Butt, a son of Naseem Butt and Hanif Butt of London. Rabbi Vivian Schirn officiated at the Westin Philadelphia hotel. The couple also had a Muslim ceremony performed in London in August by Dr. Syed Mohiud-Din, a medical doctor in Surrey, England, who is sanctioned to perform Muslim ceremonies by the Muslim Cultural and Welfare Association there.<br><br>The bride, 32, is an independent strategic marketing consultant for advertising campaigns. Until September she was an account planner in New York at JWT, the advertising agency. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania.<br><br>Her father is an independent life insurance broker in Weston, Fla. Her mother is a real estate broker with Re/Max Services in Blue Bell. She is the stepdaughter of Robert Mormile and of Angelina Radosh.<br><br>The bridegroom, 40, who is known as Tosh, is the product director in the United States for adult hepatitis vaccines and travel vaccines at GlaxoSmithKline, the London-based pharmaceuticals firm. He works in the American headquarters in Philadelphia. He graduated from Brighton Polytechnic in England and received a master's degree in management from Imperial College of the University of London.<br><br>His father retired as an executive officer with the Department of Health and Social Security in London, where he conducted statistical analyses of specific segments of the population.<br><br>Ms. Radosh and Mr. Butt met last year at a pharmaceuticals marketing meeting in Philadelphia. To break the ice, the first speaker asked the 50 or so people in attendance to raise a hand indicating whether they were married or single.<br><br>''When her hand went up for single, I said, 'Yes, perfect,' '' Mr. Butt said. Later, he said, she gave a presentation and he couldn't help admiring her. ''I thought not only is she attractive, but is also a good presenter with clarity of thought.''<br><br>At lunch he made a point of planting himself at her table. A colleague volunteered to find out whether she would be receptive to dating him and he got the green light.<br><br>A week later they met for dinner on the Lower East Side in New York and began seeing each other. ''On most of our early dates, I thought, 'I'll just go out with him, but he's not the one.' But then it dawned on me, 'Why couldn't he be?' ''<br><br>As a little girl, she said, she dreamed of a husband who was a ''nice Jewish boy,'' not a ''nice English, Muslim, Pakistani boy.''<br><br>Then she realized, ''I used to date guys who were all right on paper but wrong in person, and here is a guy who is all wrong on paper but absolutely right in person.'' </span><br><br>that was a New York Times society wedding announcement ...<br><br><a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E3D91F3FF931A25752C1A9609C8B63" rel="nofollow">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E3D91F3FF931A25752C1A9609C8B63</a><br><br>(note: to access the New York Times you'd have to sign up !)</div>

My girl was a non-Christian. I love her despite of her faith. And after she came to church with me after a period of time she decided to give her life to Jesus. Praise the Lord! Now we're very happy together. I think your previous crush or girl you love do not see this point... and I guess you should just forget about this person as she has no gift of foresight. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
