Funny, how a couple can be so in love, but upon marriage and having kids, that love which brought them together turns to sheer hate for the other, sheer hate upon the life he or she leads, sheer hatred of the self. I guess the best bet one has to ensure that he or she does not end up in such a situation is to be absolutely sure that marriage is the right path for them, and that their partner is indeed the person they want to spend the rest of your life with. As it states very clearly 'for richer or for poor, for sickness and in health, to love and only love (the other individua)l for the rest of your life'. It is a vow one takes, and not just words for one to utter in fufilment of a social compliance.<br><br>BUT like it or not, shit happens. The morning after, u awake, and realize your wife or husband you loved is a hedious beasts and worst he or she thinks the same of you. You have kids, a house in disarray, the house instalment to fufil, the car instalment (OMG!), it just gones on and on. You just want to end it all and those vows you evoked all seemed so long ago. Love has found its resting place in this perfect demise.<br><br>Here in lies the dilemna, to continue and stay together for the kids? Or to end it all and grant yourself that whole new freedom that you so desperately crave? Either way, it is a 'catch-22' situation one has been cornered into. I evoke the suggestion of divorce to the threadstarter because of the fact that his wife is a inherent gambler (not exactly a very sound influence), and that her mounting debts are taking a toll on the quality of life at home and I believe the kids are invaribly affected by all the constant squabbles the spouses trade.<br><br>BUT I must admit the situation can be altered, if the threadstarter does indeed take it upon himself to spark some life into the marriage and persuade his mrs to forego the extravagant life she is leading. Afterall, a vow is a vow, and the kids and loans and the credit cards came with it.<br><br>I guess no matter what we say, at the end of the day, he is the best judge of it all as it is his life and he knows whats best for himself.<br><br>Wilde once wrote quite cleverly I thought that 'divorces are made in heaven'. However I'll rather subscribe to the self created maxim that 'Marriages are not made in heaven, Marriages are not made for everyone'. That is why no marriage or marriages for me, cause I know I'm not one for commitments.<br><br>Oh btw, Jap_Wawa, love the pictures u post especially of the rjc gals. It was quite a while ago, but I do appreciate it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
