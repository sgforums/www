If by any chance she gets declared bankrupt, her creditors can seize all you that have in your house. But if you really go separate ways with her, the Official Assignee can't lay a finger on anything bought with your own money, because she will no longer be staying with you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Poolman:</div><div class="quote_body">True also , our joint flat once divorce , must also split .... then where me and son stay ?<br><br>Me currently self employ , not enough criteria to buy again . If can buy , instalment also headache .<br><br>Staying with my dad and my mum means restarting another war-fare , due to my wife's problems , me and my parent's relationship turn stale .<br><br>Still thinking of a way out of this bloody mess . It turns my life completely hay-wire . </div></blockquote>My recommendations:<br><br>1) Start looking for a place to rent and move in. Make sure the rent is comfy with you.<br><br>2) Then sell yr flat and liquidate your money. Also make sure anything shared with both yr names is diverted to you only.<br><br>3) Then divorce yr wife. Let her be declared bankrupt. This will solve all the debt problems.<br><br>Note: you have to do the above steps in sequence. Do not do 3 first before 2 as it will lengthen the process of your torture and stress.<br><br>Good luck<br><br></div>
