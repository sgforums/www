            <div class='col-md body'>A message that got from a friend to share with you gals and guys here.<br><br>**<br>When we become aware of our humility, we've lost it.<br>**<br><br>HimmeL &amp; erDe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>.............................................<br><br>Untold truth of the SIA air crash...<br><br>(This is an extract taken from a message board)<br><br>We have heard somethings which we guess will never ever be reported in the media. We wish to post it here so that ppl know what<br>are the things that really happened after the crash. Sort of like a look at the other side of the coin.<br><br>The Horror and saddness:<br>Some of the bodies found still had the facial expression frozen in death i.e. they have the expression of shock or were reaming. That means that they died almost instantaneously, probably killed by the heat of the superheated air upon the explosion. The only hope is that they did not feel<br>much pain but it was a quick death.<br><br>A lady was found carry a child in her arms. The bodies were fused together and they rescuers had a hard time separating them.<br>The mother was without her head and her husband, an American (not sure) was parately seeking the authorities to look for the head.<br><br>Almost a week after the crash, when the media was brought to the crash site,<br>they could still smell the burning human flesh.<br><br>The audacity of some survivors:<br>There is this Malaysian guy on a business trip to LA. He survived the crash with minor scratches to his arms. His family flew to<br>Taiwan and that is understandable. However, he stayed on and did not return with his family.<br><br>Nether did he fly to LA. A SIA paid holiday perhaps, huh?<br><br>You know the newly married couple. They came back to Singapore and very  quickly demanded the US$5k. They also claimed that their luggage were all branded goods and demand SIA pay every itme for them.<br><br>There is this horse-trainer who recently won the SIA cup. His mother 76 or 78 years old. She was flying J class. This is a filthy rich family staying in district nine/10. They demanded that SIA flies all their relatives from all over the world to attend the funeral and house them in the hotels. SIA has to booked 20 rooms for them.<br><br>Some of the Taiwanese in the 'kampong areas' flew in to Taipei and they were like all cousins, uncles, aunties...distant relatives. 8-nine rooms, all paid for and btw, they weren't interested in the<br>deceased or bereavement. Paid holiday, free birds nest, shark fin and abalone.<br><br>You can imagine hw the volunteers felt when they are assigned to these ppl.  They felt cheated of their emotions. They felt more<br>pain and sorrow for the  victims than some of the NOKs! Isn't this so very very sad. Far worse than the accident itself, don't you think?<br><br>The Taiwanese Authorities Even before the investigation team touched down, they were blaming the pilots solely for the accident. What can you expect for a country which has<br>no shame look at their policy makers behaviour in parliament.<br><br>The control tower crew went on leave immediately. The balls of these ppl who<br>want to retain the pilots indefinitely and to press criminal charges.<br><br>There was this muslim family who has lost a loved  one. Muslim burial rites requires the family to wash the body before wrapping<br>him in clothe for burial. No one helped to carry the bodies for the rites, the SIA buddy has to do it.<br><br>The Heroes and heroines:<br>You have read about the stewards and stewardess who sacrified their lives to<br>save the passengers, so no need to elaborate. Just a note to honor their<br>bravery, courage and honor. They do us, every Singaporean proud. We should fly the flag at half mast.<br><br>Gregory. His wife is in critical condition with 86% burns, amputated legs and many other conditions the doctors are not even<br>looking into because she has so many life threatening issues. yet, he tried to comfort and help others while there. he did not take advantage and 'screw' SIA for money or<br>anything like that.<br><br>Those unofficial buddies who flew down at their own expenses to help their friends at this trying times. True friends are those<br>who are always there when you need them most.<br><br>The official buddies. These are volunteers who sacrificed their own time, families and emotions to be with the injured and Next Of Kins. To feel sorrow, to see the horror and to comfort. Valid to say, some felt so cheated because the NOK weren't the least sadden by the tragedy. Only seeking monetary gains.<br><br>Last but not least, SIA authorities. They are very supportive and is doing everything the NOK and victims need and, sad to say,<br>demand, regardless reasonable or not. The sorrow felt by Dr. Cheong in his voice is so sincere.<br><br>Unofficially, he did shed a tear or two...shhh.<br><br>Money wise, they are very generous. You all knwo about the US$425K but the unofficial payouts in terms of whatever the NOK demands, the hotel rooms, the blind checks while they are there, the extra US$2k upon arrival in Taipei by  each NOK, the coming<br>memorial ceremony...lierally everything that the NOK needs...shoes, clothes, even PC (???)<br><br>Till the truth be told, this is what I have for now.<br><br></div>
