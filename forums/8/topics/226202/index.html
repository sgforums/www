Oh ya , you need to keep publishing and publishing articles if you want to go far. Average 2 per year. One doctor I know publishes 6 articles in peer reviewed journals per year.<br><br>No. 5<br>Best University for Medicine in the World - John Hopkins University - you need a basic degree to study medicine in USA because they come under graduate scheme. It will also cost you more than quarter of a million dollars for tuition fees and textbooks. If you graduate from JHU - that is prestige . Easy to recoup the investment in JHU education<br><br>I think for JHU - 4 years graduate scheme. Take the USMA or something which is their board examination and then do an internship for a year to gain full qualifications as an MD.<br><br>Second Best is Harvard and Oxford.

            <div class='col-md body'>My questions to you littlefish - What do you really think you will enjoy?Where do you see yourself in 5 years time? What do you treasure most?<br><br>I can tell you what to expect out of Medicine :<br>I was a nurse and I can tell you that you have to face blood,fecal matter, vomitus etc . Can you tolerate that? And sometimes you get to see the true depravity of humanity. I remember this guy got disemboweled by an attacker , his intestines were literally coming out and the poor fella was screaming and screaming. And you have to deal with hysterical relatives yet be very patient with them. You have to pronounce people dead and break the news to the relatives. Ever seen a dead body? Oh yeah you don't have much of a life in your early career. You will be on-call and be on rotating shifts plus expected to write articles.<br><br></div>

Starting Pay in Australia on average is around 52-56k basic without shift penalties. In Singapore , I don't know.<br><br>Medicine is not all about the money. You have poor doctors , you have rich doctors. Just depends . I won't recommend that you do medicine just because you think it is a faster route to being a millionaire. You will burn out very fast or become very cold in the profession.<br><br>Your insurance will eat up 1-2  months of your pay for professional indemnity (to protect against negligence claims) . When you hit specialist level , depending on how high risk your job is , some surgeons actually pay out an equivalent of 3 months worth of their salary for professional indemnity PER YEAR , plastic surgeons even more. Should you be sued , your indemnity premium increases.<br><br>IF you are looking to earn lots of money - you might as well do finance and accountancy or actuarial science . Actuarial goes for 50k starting and will go up to 100-200k per year . Plus you just need to maintain your actuarial fellowship and you just make sure you don't f**k up the insurance premium calculations. Your maths have to be damn solid. Finance and Accountancy - I know a few who started with banks and moved up to 70k in their third year but very high risk job.</div>
