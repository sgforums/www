Once I set my sights on something, I will not give up easily. If I love a woman, I will love her as my one and only. I will never let her go unless she doesn't love me anymore.<br><br>...I assure you women will be lining up by the dozens to meet him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>[/b]</blockquote>hahhaahaha!<br>man i bet u write superb resumes.<br><br>this is called the subtle honestly seasoned with honey trick.<br>technically no one can call u a liar, cos u stated ur bad points,<br>but<br><br>u turn it so as such you only potray the good point OF the bad points!<br>it takes people who are conscious to really know what your hiding between the lines  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
