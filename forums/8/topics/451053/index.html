              Today I was in holland village for a short drink with a gf of mine. This little boy came along and wanted my number.
              Him: Hi can I sit here? My name is XXX and I noticed you for awhile
              Me: Then?
              Him: I think it's fate. God lead me to you don't you think so?
              Me: LOL! Do you have a better pickup lines? Why don't you say God lead you to HELL! 
              Him: Seriously I have a feel for you.
              Me: but i don't and I don't feel good with someone younger than me aside i'm not a sugar mummy.
              Him: Ok! Don't say that I never give you a chance and many women wanted me but I rejected.
              Me: Good for you and get lost...
              
              Can't imagine boys are getting bad to worst. Singapore men please don't let me look down on you further.

              I agreed that women is weaker than men physically but their endurance are better.
              Don't you agreed that some men simply pathetic. I had seen many of them just can't make it. example
              1) age 35 doesn't have 200 saving and monthly borrowing from everyone yet complaining here and there but instead of working hard.
              2) married and have another gf but asking money from both side
              
              My point is if you want a gf even you're married than make sure you can provide to both side. Even you are poor is alright then work harder instead of complaining. Nothing in the world is fair. who don't want a high pay yet easier job. I realised that men nowadays are just dreaming..

              <p>Why are men the sole breadwinner? Women are given chance to be educated. Nowdays, so many female lawyer/accoutant, they are earning BIG MONEY too.</p>
              <p>I do agree with your argument stated in your examples. Those men really cannot make it. BUT if there is something inappropriate with men taking money from women, the vice versa is inappropriate too. Let say, this particular girl keep taking money from her 3 bfs, dun wan work, do u think this is fine? From my point of view, whoever(regardless guy or girl) earns more should try to pay more, its a give and take situation.</p>
              <p>Do u really think there are no lazy and poor men oversea? Maybe those ang mos/Japanese in Singapore all appear glamorous, but bear in mind, they are here on professional pass, expect them to earn a relatively decent income. Trust me, there are poor and lazy ppl back in their homeland.</p>

              You know why women like that doesn't seem to be wrong it's bcos they are women. From our forefathers, women have every rights to spend money from men.. whaha
              
              But coming to reality women indeed getting more independ then men. Perhaps the world had been changed. Men nowadays unlike men in the early 70s and late 60s therefore women doesn't like younger men.
              
              Perhaps I had already declared I like men in the early 70s and 60s :p

              <p>You know why women like that doesn’t seem to be wrong it’s bcos
                              they are women. From our forefathers, women have every rights to
                              spend money from men.. whaha</p>
              <p>But coming to reality women indeed getting more independ then
                              men. Perhaps the world had been changed. Men nowadays unlike men in
                              the early 70s and late 60s therefore women doesn’t like younger
                              men.</p>
              <p>Perhaps I had already declared I like men in the early 70s and
                              60s :p</p>

              <p>The world have changed, but only for the better. The world has never 
                              been this peaceful - I know about middle east coup de'tat and North 
                              Korea missle launch, but these are nothing compared with two World Wars 
                              follow by The Cold War. I LOVE peace times.</p>
              <p>I think u prefer <span class="st">å¤§ç”·äºº ba, indeed they are getting lesser. Women are more educated, there are lesser </span><span class="st">å°�å¥³</span><span class="st">äºº too. </span></p>
              <p>Guy nowadays(including me) also don't like <span class="st">å°�å¥³</span><span class="st">äºº. They should be strong and independent, as the same time, retaining some of the feminine aspect<br> </span></p>
              <p>If a gal wants a bf that is earn good income, chances are 
                              she herself must be good too. Both social status should be aglined.  For
                               example, Hillary Clinton, she is an ex-lawyer current politician, and her husband Bill Clinton, USA ex-president. You cannot expect fairy tale like F4 story(if u watch before) to happen, of cuz unless you are really lucky? F4 guys existed, but reserve for girls with equal social status.</p>
              <p>Do u expect a guy, who is director in some top tier MNC, to marry a gal who is uneducated and unempolyed? Flings = yes, long term = no</p>

              that's the point.. What you want you earn it yourself.
              In the past what men want they earn it themselves.
              Now it seem more women earn it themselves while men not. I didn't say it apply to all men but the percentage of men are getting larger behaving this way.

              <p>Women were discriminated, they were not allowed(or limited opportunities) to obtain high education and high income.</p>
              <p>IF I was born 40 years ago, I would be more than willing to feed my gf. Why? Because she the society disregard her, she had no earning capability. But today's world, I am not too willing. I don't think I am stingy; i rather donate thousands to charity than to buy things for materialistic gals, that approach me simply bcuz I am rich. I don't care how pretty u are, I am not interested in ur body if your mind is filled with nonsense.</p>
              <p>Women need to assess the advantage and disadvantage that come from advocating equalitiy between genders. Just a while a ago(I forgotten how long ago), a Singapore case, the ex-wife is ordered to pay alimony to her ex-husband, cause she has higher education and earns more income. The laws(more or less) recognise the fact that greater powers equals greater responsiblities. Such cases are even more common overseas.</p>
              <p>If you want guy to earn and feed you, you have to give up alot of rights too.</p>
              <p>They are still alot of poorer, barbaric countries that still believe male species are lords while female are slaves. Over there, women probably no need to work, just help out in the house. E.g. Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Egypt, etc. I don't think u wan our society to regress into such a state.</p>
              <p>But men that leech off from women should seriously reflect on themselves.</p>
