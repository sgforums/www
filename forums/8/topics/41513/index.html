I don't think I'll ever forget...I'm sure a lot of people will never forget that statue of Saddam Hussein falling."<br><br>But the fall of the Iraqi leader has brought in its wake looting and lawlessness.<br><br>Mr Rumsfeld said, "The task we've got ahead of us now is an awkward one, because you have to go from a transition; from a repressed regime to an unrepressed regime that is free to do good things, and also do bad things and we're going to see both."<br><br>And it is a transition that must get underway before hostilities are over.<br><br>Dr Tan said, "We should not assume that the war has been concluded. The major part has been accomplished and it is quite clear that the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq is over."<br><br>The pent up frustration of Iraqi people is already complicating the efforts to fill the void left by the defeated regime.<br><br>Dr Tan said, "What is needed now is to restore law and order throughout the country. I mean, until people feel safe, until looting stops, there is no way in which you are going to rebuild the country again."<br><br>The United States is now asking members of its so-called coalition for help in that rebuilding.<br><br>Deputy Prime Minister Tan has offered Singapore's assistance.<br><br>He said, "We have offered to the US, if it is required, a medical team from the Singapore Armed Forces, which will be ready to deploy to Iraq or to Kuwait at any time that they are required."<br><br>Dr Tan's trip began with the inauguration of Singapore's new US-based Apache attack helicopter detachment.<br><br>It ended with plans for even more cooperation between the armed forces of Singapore and the United States.<br><br>In addition to the medical team, the Deputy Prime Minister has also pledged tents and other supplies to help in the reconstruction of Iraq.<br><br>He returns home with an extra American request, this time for Singapore to get involved in the policing effort that will be required to restore order in that country.<br><br></div>
