The same applies to the other way round. What I think is that as long as you know that you had really tried your best to love her. If it doesn't work out, there is nothing much you can do about it.<br><br>Love itself is an unexplainable feeling. So don't ever try to understand it with logic.<br><br>You may feel hurt, you may feel pain. But the sun tomorrow still rises. You got to know that you have to move on with life. Love is a big part of life but it is never everything. Be brave my friend and be strong. I hope your wounds will heal soon.<br><br>------------------<br>If you could have told me everything<br>You would have found what love is<br>If you could have told me what was on your mind<br>I would have shown you the way<br>Tomorrow i am going live without your love<br>I've never thought beyond that time<br>I've never imagined the pictures of that life<br>For now I will try to live for you and for me<br>I will try, try to live with love,<br>With dreams and forever with tears</div>

He was very upset about it. He suspected there was a third party though she said there wasn't.<br>Normally, when a gal/guy dumps her/his bf/gf yet saying that they love you, it is an excuse. If they love you, why in the first place request for a break up. Most probably she/he can't think of a better excuse? Hehe.</div>

Then from there,it led us to a break up.Coz she claims that i was too unreasonable and worse still she claims that i was too possesive when most of time i initiated her to go out with her friends hoping that she will not be sicked of me for being too sticky  to her<br><br>The funniest part,she told me the same thing too,she told me that she still loves me and she finds it hard for her to leave me.<br>but then at the same time she still want a break up.I was totally lost and baffled by her words.Then,she came out with another reason,she told me she wants to be single coz shes alrdy very sicked and tired of having the couple lifestyle and blah blah blah blah<br>.So, i al al bobian ,have to accept her decision since she has  already made up her mind.<br>Then 1 day, i accidentally  found out  that she was alrdy seeing that guy while she was still with me.During that moment ,I felt very cheated and disappointed,but then what to do,life still goes on......<br>So friend,the best thing to do now,is to move on,coz i believe theres a better girl out there waiting for u even tho u still dunno who she is but shes def there,<br>Well unless, u become a monk or a gay then i dunno what to say lah.hehe ( just kidding )<br><br>Trust me, shes def somewhere ard and u will def mit her 1 of these days.<br><br>------------------<br>Life is like a sweet potato coz after u eat alrdy u dunno when u gonna fart<br><br>[This message has been edited by True_Love_Waits (edited 04 March 2002).]</div>
