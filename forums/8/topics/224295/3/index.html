Not to mention trying to get the casher to let them take the One for One items.....without buying the items!  And, the worse part...trying to ask if the cashier speaks english in their broken english?<br><br>The other batch was going...."Cheap! Cheap! Cheap!. And this or that one cannot buy in SIngapore, buy lah!"<br><br>Nuff said. I was cringing in embraressment.
