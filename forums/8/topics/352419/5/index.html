              <p>Lots of "debunk studies" on Oujia is basically like this.....they conduct experiments where a practitioner is blindfolded, the Board is unknowingly turned 180 degrees, then the practitioner is asked some questions again.....then these people still point to the spot where they thought the previous "Yes" , "No" are still located, and words are gibberish....which proves that the movement is not guided by spirits, but from their own minds. Subconsciously of course. It is just self-suggestion.</p>

              <p>That's an awful lots of beliefs. Your beliefs must be substantiated however personal in order for you to know it's a responsible belief.</p>
              <p>I started with faith and . . . my faith was justified.</p>
              <p>Just some ....really just some</p>
              <p>I believe there is only one powerful God because I my eyes have behold Him when I was a little.</p>
              <p>I believe there are supernatural beings usually unseen by our naked eyes because I've seen one, felt a holy one from God and wasn't allowed to speak then(not in terror), attacked by another and felt one other flying across the classroom  in broad daylight in a room full of other people emitting energy wave which could clearly be felt which it intended to be felt.</p>
              <p>I believe God is all powerful He granted my prayer in an instant a couple times.</p>

              <p>Have you seen people walking in Orchard Rd in broad daylight, suddenly 10 people of them getting "possessed"?</p>
              <p>It is always a group of close-knit people who were previously mentally preconditioned. Either they walk in a dark park, walk in a jungle etc, so their mind is already scared and tense, so when one person says "somebody is choking me" then the rest suddenly got infected and lost composure, "ah yes someone is choking me too"</p>
              <p>It is just a case of mass hysteria.</p>
              <p>Have you seen a group of 40-year old men getting mass possessed...?</p>
              <p>It is always teenagers, girls, etc.....if you put a 40 year old men in their midst who is cool and "dont care" , he wont ever get possessed. That tells you it is not a real possession but psychological issue.</p>

              <p>Hi Meat Pao,</p>
              <p>i need to share with you my experiences with this pen-fairy (ç¬”ä»™). I'm not trying to make you believe in spirts and in fact, i'm more into human psychology too. But my friend proved to me that if you don't see them, it does not mean they never exist. Eg. Electricity Current / Wind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, so, i was with this ex-gf of mine when i was in sec 3. I joined her class chalet. After dinner, we separated into 2 groups, 1 group go for bowling, the other back to chalet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We both, together with another 5 went back to chalet after dinner and since got nothing to do, my gf and 1 played pen-fairy. We managed to invite an entity by the name of Felicia, 19yrs old then. When asked, she was dead in Changi Beach. But just so suddenly, the light in the kitchen went off! We were afraid and went to the upper room to hide while waiting for the bowling group to return.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When the bowling group returns, we never tell them anything. So all of us hide in the room for games and no one is in the living room. Just then, a girl (from the bowling group) went to the living room toilet by herself and when she came back, she asked if anyone followed her when she goes to toilet or not. We said no and asked her why she ask this question? And she said that while she was inside the toilet, she heard a female voice singing, the voice came from the living room! But in fact, all of us, except for the girl that visits the ladies, is in the upper room!</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>But somehow, supernatural is a taboo topic, hard to explain. Even scientist cannot explain this too.</p>

              <p>That's an awful lots of beliefs. Your beliefs must be substantiated however personal in order for you to know it's a responsible belief.</p>
              <p>I started with faith and . . . my faith was justified.</p>
              <p>Just some ....really just some</p>
              <p>I believe there is only one powerful God because I my eyes have behold Him when I was a little.</p>
              <p>I believe there are supernatural beings usually unseen by our naked eyes because I've seen one, felt a holy one from God and wasn't allowed to speak then(not in terror), attacked by another and felt one other flying across the classroom  in broad daylight in a room full of other people emitting energy wave which could clearly be felt which it intended to be felt.</p>
              <p>I believe God is all powerful He granted my prayer in an instant a couple times.</p>

              <p>my belief in God doesn't cease even if i have many other supernatural beliefs. why? cos' my system of belief is simple; all of them fall under the category, "God's above them all"</p>
              <p>so if you ask me who create UFOs, i'll say God. if you ask me who create spirits, i'll say God. if you ask me why mother nature can be a destroyer, i'll say only God knows.</p>

              <p>I'm just saying that we need to justify what we believe in and not to be taken easily by rumors and such, even by the flock. My belief in God and the existence of spirits both can be justified by my past experience. But I can't say the same for stuffs like vampires and UFOS no matter how much I want for us not to be alone in this ever expanding universe. Not that I mind what you believe in but I'm just merely suggesting you to be careful on what you believe and not believe in. Be open and rational but don't be naive and easily taken.</p>

              <p>Playing quija board often leads to demon possession. Avoid playing it at all cost! Especially Christian. Don't get yourself involved in occult ritual. Have no part of it. It's dangerous and stupid. even if you're not Christian avoid quija board! Not worth a cent considering the risk. You may think the risk involved is small but dealing with the unknown you can't even have a smallest bearing on how much risk you're taking. You may get lucky once twice or even 12 times but will you still be lucky next time?</p>
              <p>Besides dead people spirit should be in Hades resting. Any spirit roaming around should be taken as demon.</p>

              <p>so if you ask me who create UFOs, i'll say God. if you ask me
              who create spirits, i'll say God. if you ask me why mother nature
              can be a destroyer, i'll say only God knows.</p>
              <p>Amen.</p>

              <p>you asking me? er... how am i supposed to know? do i look i'm as old as time itself? you want me to quote the Bible, i can quote but knowing your style of asking, you'll probably refute the bible anyway... cos' every other religion has their own story of the "beginning".</p>
              <p>so you are asking me a question not even Albert Einstein or any smartest man on earth, death, alive or even not born yet could answer. how am i supposed to answer?</p>
