              <p>Btw I am not sure whether ghosts exist or not.</p>
              <p>But really, there are research being done to debunk "Oujia Board". Basically the finger movements are being done subconsciously by humans themselves by self-suggestion.</p>
              <p>So unless if the pointer move by itself, a human finger moving it and telling u things, is just basically you telling yourself things.</p>

              <p>for your info, cemetries are known not to be haunted... i was staying in Potong Pasir when i was younger and i studied in Maris Stella High, within 3 cemetries. i used to walk from home to school and back home through the Christian cemetry. earliest was 6 am and latest was 10 pm and you don't get the creepy feeling compared to places known to be haunted.</p>

              <p>I am actually a believer of "something"</p>

              <p>Last night after 8.30 pm, a group of around 8 - 9 ITE
              students were possessed by unknown spirits and began to create a
              scene at Labrador Park. Police and ambulances were called to the
              scene after public and staff from the school reported that some
              students began acting strangely after they went out for a walk at
              the Park.</p>
              <p>Apparently, ITE sent 100+ students for a course by Adam Khoo at
              Labrador Park chalet-style hotel and after the course, some
              students decided to go for a walk in the park. An hour plus later,
              they were seen creating a din and acting strangely, like jumping on
              tables and shouting. a boy who tried to help a fellow possessed
              student was seen by teachers and staffs being strangled by
              unknown forces as he approached his friend. teachers and staffs
              immediately called the police and the place was sealed off for
              investigation.</p>
              <p>Presently, there are no indications of any missing students or
              fatalities. update only when source return from campsite.</p>
