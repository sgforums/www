              knowing your style of asking, you'll probably refute the bible

              <p>i'm a Roman Catholic too, so to quote from our teaching; there was nothing before God arrived, just black space and nothingness... who created God? He was not created, He just exist...</p>
              <p>my theory? i have no theory... i'm nothing but a simple man. i do not seek the truth but to embrace it's secrecy. i enjoy facing the unknown and gets enveloped in it. for the intelligence of man is nothing compared to the foolishness of God... if someone tells me that God is a facade and the bible is a lie... i'll let him speak his mind but i will not rebuke him; for why should i bother to debate what is uncontestable?</p>
              <p>the Christians in my earlier post claimed that holding joss sticks and participating in your own grandmother's funeral is a taboo, who am i to question their actions? even my own Priest asked me to mind my own business and not provoke our brothers in Christ for only God knows what is right and what is wrong. likewise, this is uncontestable.</p>
              <p>here you are; asking me about my theory about God's own origin... now, only God knows your real reason and intention to seek His origin from my perspective; based on my words and my theory... is your heart so sincerely keen to know the truth (my truth) or were you conspired with evil to find out my theory maliciously? this only God knows; your true intention... and again, this is uncontestable.</p>
              <p>my own theory about your query to me about God's origin? you are just looking for a "window" to spite me, a simple man who enjoys living in God's mysterious ways... reflect my brother, reflect and repent, for the coming of God is near.</p>

              <p>Frankly, I feel that we are not worthy of salvation... Whether or not we repent. People who repent only seek not to burn in the fires of hell, not for the sake of doing good. Also, like the bible said... The Son of Man will come at the time you do not expect him. So, how can you be sure that he will be coming? He could come at the time when there is no longer any believers, to strike down all who still lives.</p>
              <p>"Do not judge lest you be judged. "For in the way that you judge you will 
                  	 be judged; and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you. 
                  	 "And why do you look at the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do 
                  	 not notice the log that is in your own eye? "Or how can you say to your 
                  	 brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' and behold, the log is 
                  	 in your own eye? "You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, 
                  	 and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye."
                  	 <em>(Matthew 7:1-5)</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p>See, even you who seeks salvation have sinned. From my sentence, you can tell that I am judging people too. There is no salvation, my brother. It is human to sin and do evil, therefore salvation can never be attained by human hands.</p>
              <p>So, you wish to quote Lee Kuan Yew but not the word of God?</p>
              <p>"But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also." <em>(Matthew 5:39)</em></p>

              <p>i have to agree we do not deserve salvation. will God forgive us for what we have done to each other? like what you said, i'm not God so i am not qualified to answer...</p>
              <p>with all these sins that we inflicted on each other, likewise we are inflicting it on our Lord. should i say i'm sorry for judging you? maybe i should apologise. i have not shown tolerance towards you, for that i've sinned... i should have turned my other cheek when your struck me yet i've chosed to strike you back. for that too, i have sinned. so now, here it is; my sincere apology for sinning towards you my brother... may this make the world a slightly better place.</p>
