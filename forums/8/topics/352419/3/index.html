              <p>Not sure if what I heard from my senior army officer true or not but I was told not to wonder around station XX if I'm alone there at the carpark. Either I stay inside the vehicle or go up the mess room and wait for further instructions from the technicians. Hear any voice from outside also die die cannot open the door.</p>
              <p>Probably these group of teenages wonder into the same spot.......hope they are alrite. And pls someone tell them, dun ever ever go back there again.</p>

              <p><br>i'm not declaring that this is a 100% true story... not declaring that you shouldn't go to Labrador Park anymore, i'm not betting my reputation behind this; all i'm saying is:</p>
              <p>my friend who is a lecturer from ITE called me last night and told me what happened to his students at this chalet in Labrador Park. they were there for a 3 day 2 night course with Adam Khoo and after the course, some students went out and came back possessed. they acted strangely and as i've mentioned, one student was apparently "witnessed" to be strangled by unknown forces when he tried to help a fellow student who's possessed.</p>
              <p>i trust my friend, cos' first; this is nothing to lie about. if you want to lie about being in a threesome or foursome or if you can get any girl you want in a pub, i'm all for this kind of bullshitting but if you want to lie about spirits and supernatural... i guess you must be feeling very confident that spirits won't look for you at all. we all know of the term, "don't play ghost for ghost will come for you" since we are young. i feel there is nothing "macho" or "fun" to speak of fictional spiritual possession. i'm not trying to sue the Church for money either. so, you can be a judge of what you want to believe or not, loopholes or not. i will not vouch for authencity for this is what i heard from a friend of mine.</p>

              <p>Most possession cases involve female. Perhaps because they tend not to fight back when attacked. Mass possessions are a pretty common occurrences in Indonesia these days. They often happen strangely enough at schools with the victim mostly being the female students. These occurrences often make it to the newspaper sometimes even to television.These occurences are on the rise here for the last 5 years I think and they always happen at schools both private and state. I know something must have been wrong. Perhaps even very wrong.</p>
              <p>Have faith stay close to God and avoid larger sins. When attacked, cry out to God and you should be just fine. I know because I had an evil spirit sent to my dorm room one night. It fled after I cried out to God for help. It fled faster than when it came as if in utter terror, it fled without delay or resistance. Praise God.</p>
              <p>Strangely enough in my case I was still able to think and feel just that I couldn't feel my body nor could I see nor hear anything aside the name of the demon being called over and over. It was Olahzhong. I still remember that name. Sadly I think in most cases of possession most of the victims lost their mind and their capacity to feel anything to be able to ask for help to God. Just draw near to God and have faith in Him and you'll be safe.</p>

              <p>Dont believe in superstition....</p>
              <p>It is not anything connected to the spiritual realm....just psychological realm.</p>
              <p>Have you seen people walking in Orchard Rd in broad daylight, suddenly 10 people of them getting "possessed"?</p>
              <p>It is always a group of close-knit people who were previously mentally preconditioned. Either they walk in a dark park, walk in a jungle etc, so their mind is already scared and tense, so when one person says "somebody is choking me" then the rest suddenly got infected and lost composure, "ah yes someone is choking me too"</p>
              <p>It is just a case of mass hysteria.</p>
              <p>Have you seen a group of 40-year old men getting mass possessed...?</p>
              <p>It is always teenagers, girls, etc.....if you put a 40 year old men in their midst who is cool and "dont care" , he wont ever get possessed. That tells you it is not a real possession but psychological issue.</p>

              <p>the whole event has been cancelled. all student sent home at 10++ last night. the 9 students possessed were brought home by parents but did not turn up for school today. the boy who was "strangled" turned up but looked in daze... other than that, all is the usual in the school today.</p>
              <p>the reason why ambulance didn't take the students to hospital was that all appeared normal in medical sense. no weird high blood pressure etc etc. all just passed out. anyway... that's all i have to update.</p>

              <p>well as usual, i'm not implying that this incident is 100% authentic spirits' possessions. i have no proof and i have no witnesses' statements to tap into. you may be right to say that this is a mass hysteria incident. i have no concrete evidence, so do you.</p>
              <p>so i can safely say, it's up to you guys out there to believe or not believe that there was a mass possession at Labrador Park last night.</p>

              <p>But really, there are research being done to debunk "Oujia Board". Basically the finger movements are being done subconsciously by humans themselves by self-suggestion.</p>
              <p>So unless if the pointer move by itself, a human finger moving it and telling u things, is just basically you telling yourself things.</p>
