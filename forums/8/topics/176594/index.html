            <div class='col-md body'>1. Smelling bananas and/or green apples (smelling, not eating) can help you lose weight!<br>2. Apples are more efficient than caffeine in keeping people awake in the mornings!<br>3. Over 2500 left handed people a year are killed from using products made for right handed people!<br>4. Thomas Edison, lightbulb inventor, was afraid of the dark!<br>5. According to Genesis 1:20-22 the chicken came before the egg.<br>6. Albert Brooks's real name is Albert Einstein.<br>7. Astronauts are not allowed to eat beans before they go into space because passing wind in a spacesuit damages them.<br>8. Babies are born without kneecaps. They don't appear until the child reaches 2-6 years of age.<br>9. Barbie's full name is Barbra Millicent Roberts.<br>10. Barbie's measurements if she were life size: 39-23-33.<br>11. Both Hitler and Napoleon were missing one testicle.<br>12. Bruce Lee was so fast that they actually had to SLOW a film down so you could see his moves. That's the opposite of the norm.<br>13. During the chariot scene in 'Ben Hur' a small red car can be seen in the distance.<br>14. Earth is the only planet not named after a God.<br>15. Elvis had a twin brother named Jesse Garon, who died at birth, which is why Elvis' middle name was spelled Aron; in honor of his brother.<br>16. Evian (the bottled water) spelled backwards is "naive."<br>17. If you are locked in a completely sealed room, you will die of carbon dioxide poisoning before you will die of oxygen deprivation.<br>18. Iguanas, koalas and Komodo dragons all have two penises.<br>19. In most watch advertisements the time displayed on the watch is 10:10 because then the arms frame the brand of the watch (and make it look like it's smiling.)<br>20. It is believed that Shakespeare was 46 around the time that the King James Version of the Bible was written. In Psalms 46, the 46th word from the first word is shake and the 46th word from the last word is spear.<br>21. Leonardo De Vinci invented the scissors.<br>22. Michael Jordan makes more money from Nike annually than all of the Nike factory workers in Malaysia combined.<br>23. Months that begin on a Sunday will always have a "Friday the 13th."<br>24. Montpelier, Vermont is the only U.S. state capital without a McDonalds.<br>25. No animal, once frozen solid (i.e., water solidifies and turns to ice) survives when thawed, because the ice crystals formed inside cells would break open the cell membranes. However there are certain frogs that can survive the experience of being frozen. These frogs make special proteins, which prevent the formation of ice (or at least keep the crystals from becoming very large), so that they actually never freeze even though their body temperature is below zero Celsius. The water in them remains liquid: a phenomenon known as 'supercooling.' If you disturb one of these frogs (just touching them even), the water in them quickly freezes solid and they die.<br>26. Peanuts are used in the production of dynamite.<br>27. Pearls melt in vinegar.<br>28. Russians generally answer the phone by saying, 'I'm listening.'<br>29. Speak of the Devil is short for "Speak of the Devil and he shall come". It was believed that if you spoke about the Devil it would attract his attention and he would appear.<br>30. The average person falls asleep in seven minutes.<br>31. The bubbles in Guiness Beer sink to the bottom rather than float to the top like all other beers. No one knows why.<br>32. The correct response to the Irish greeting, "Top of the morning to you," is "and the rest of the day to yourself."<br>33. The largest eggs in the world are laid by a shark.<br>34. The names of the three wise monkeys are: Mizaru: See no evil, Mikazaru: Hear no evil, and Mazaru: Speak no evil.<br>35. The two-foot long bird called a Kea that lives in New Zealand likes to eat the strips of rubber around car windows!<br>36. There is a city called Rome on every continent.<br>37. There is a town in Texas called 'Ding Dong.'<br>38. There is no mention of Adam and Eve eating an apple in the Bible.<br>39. Turkey's often look up at the sky during a rainstorm. Unfortunately some have been known to drown as a result.<br>40. When young and impoverished, Pablo Picasso kept warm by burning his own paintings.<br></div>
