            <div class='col-md body'>it was just after school &amp; we were on our way home, as usual i was yakking away with girlfriends, i canÂ’t remember if i put my hand over the shoulder like in a hug or i held the hand, i think i held the hand in swinging rhythm no less! (you know how lower secondary schoolgirls are), we walked for a good 2 to 3 minutes &amp; i yakked for just as long to another gal on my left before turning to the gal on my right. HAD the fright of my life! boy, was i embarrassed when she turned into a <strong>he</strong>! dropped my hand in a split second &amp; apologized like nobodyÂ’s business and all my friends laughed at me! meanies! they were all wondering why i was so friendly &amp; openly affectionate with a strange boy &amp; in fact kept me talking to the girls on the left. &amp; whatÂ’s wrong with the boy that he allowed a girl to hold his hand for so long? he seemed stunned when i turned around &amp; dropped his hand in a jiffy and he got laughed at too from his friends, serves him right.<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 03 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This happened when I was in Sec 4. I finished a plate of spaghetti and was walking to return it to the stall. Then a girl whom I knew as a friend of another gal friend stopped me and asked me if I saw her friend. While I was answering her question, my hand tilted a bit and spaghetti sauce came pouring down on my trousers. Problem is, I didn't notice it, and after talking to the girl, I juz continued walking toward the stall. It was only while walking did I felt some dampness on my trouser leg, and I thought, "Wah liew...poured some on my trousers...never mind lah...later then wipe off..." It was only after I returned the plate did I look down, and realised that the WHOLE of my right trouser leg is drenched in spaghetti sauce! Even my shoe was stained! My friends at the table witnessed the whole incident and were already laughing their heads off when I walked back in their direction. I was so paiseh...then I asked them the girl got see or not. They say dunno leh..they juz see the girl smile then run away...wah liewz...<br><br>------------------<br>U ask y shld I trust her? She might break my heart! But isn't the person u love the onli one who has the right to break ur heart...?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This happened exactly one year back... I was playing for my school as a goalkeeper against SRJC... they had possession 90% of the time and kept coming at me... that day I was super on form (a pity that match few people come and see)and I saved 12 one-on-ones, 1 penalty and a few point blank shots according to my coach's statistic... although the match ended 1-1 but I was man of the match... (That's juz the introduction)<br><br>2 days later, another group match takes place between my school and NYJC... as NYJC is alot weaker than SRJC and NYJC has no formal coach compared to SRJC whom has a Balestier Central FC Prime League coach, almost the whole school expects us to trash NYJC and due to people spreading news that I performed very well in the previous match and I am a Gombak United Prime League goalkeeper, a lot of curious people stayed back after school to watch the match and the grandstand was packed with people... during the warm-up, I make a couple of good saves and just b4 the match kicks off, people whom I noe and whom I dunno, comes up to me and say "jiu kao ni le" which means they are depending on me as we onli need to draw the match to procced to the quarter-finals... I was breeming with confidence (come to think of it, maybe it was over-confidence liao) but heaven played a cruel joke on me...<br>In the 14th minute, a NYJC midfielder played a long ball towards my goal from the half-way line for his strikers to chase, as I am quite confident of my speed and judging that the ball will reach the box, I shouted VERY LOUDLY "MINE!!!" and went to claim the ball... I GOT it and I was smiling broadly while I am in the air with the ball in my hands... just as I am landing and bring the ball to clutch in my chest, the ball slipped through my arms and hit my left knee and bounced out to the striker who had stopped and intended to retreat... he latched on to the ball and came towards me... as a footballer will tell u, in that situation, the right thing to do is go all the way out, narrow the angle and go for the ball, and thats practically what I did... I ran out and as I am out of the penalty box oreidi, I challenged by spreading my whole body ala Schmeichel and got the ball off him with my right foot... both of us collapsed together. I immediately stood up and I saw his teammate, another striker prepared to make a shot towards the goal which by now has 2 defenders back on the line to defend. So I dived and flew through the air but his lob was too high for mi... it went over mi and my sweeper hand-balled although there's another defender behind him preparing to head the ball off the line... a penalty was awarded and my sweeper, a veri likable and popular figure in the school was sent off. My teammates were screaming at me, fucking mi off and the whole school jeered at mi... my confidence was crumpled and I just kneeled on the ground... at the point, some people was still hoping I can save the penalty as during training and matches, statistics showed that I saved almost 50% of penalties and got the right direction around 70% of the time. After my sweeper slowly trotted off the field and HE DIDN'T EVEN SCOLD MI although others did, I felt realli sorry to get him in this shit... Then I faced the penalty and judging from the run-up to the posture to the pivotal foot(secret ok? this is veri accurate although not many people noe), I guessed left but bcause of my crushed confidence, I dived right and we were 1-0 down... we played the remainder of the game with 10 men... although after the incident, I made a few good saves and been extra careful, the crowd just keept jeering and some even shouted cynistal remarks like "Schmeichel" and "Gombak keeper"... I was realli embarressed and I expected the coach to change mi but he kept faith in me which should have been a good thing but at that moment I just want to get away from everyone's views and the jeering, its no good for mi... to my surprise, I continued to play in the second half and we equalised in the 66th min... however in the next minute, NYJC midfielder took a long range shot which swerved in front of mi and flew into the top right hand corner... that to mi is UNSAVABLE although I did tried and I dived but immediately after the goal, I was subbed off and the coach doesn't even looked into my eyes... he has lost all confidence in mi and till now, my confidence and form has not recovered... how embarassing at that moment and how sad it is for mi...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well guys, if u'd say the most embarrasing situation, I've 2 to share wif u guys.<br><br>The other time we went for this D&amp;D held at Raffles Country Club. It was being held in one of those huge outdoor tents where it can hold hundreds of people. They have those ventilation shafts on the floor, u know? After several hours of dancing, I noticed my friend standing on top of that ventilation shaft with cool wind blowing upwards onto him. I hopped on and shared the wind wif him.<br><br>There was this Malay colleague of mine who wore a cheongsam (it was rather high cut) that day. She kept on complaining to me during the dance that it was pretty warm and noticed me and my friend standing on top of the shaft. As it was really dark, she didn't notice that our hair was actually flying UPWARDS.<br><br>She didn't hesitate for a moment, shouting very loudly for us to get lost, she jumped RIGHT ON TOP OF THE SHAFT...<br><br>And the flimsy cloth simply flew upwards! Everybody had a bird's eye view of everything! Hahaha....<br><br>********************************************<br><br>Well, I attended a school camp several years back. It was in ITE I remember, and the guys toilet was locked! The only toilet available for use was the girls toilet which the teachers warned us guys NOT TO USE unless there were no gals in it.<br><br>My stomach ached terribly one day and I just heck care about the warning. Without even knocking, I simply dashed in and eased myself. The feeling's simply too heavenly...<br><br>Juz then, I heard giggles and gals voice! Shit! I told myself, how am I suppose to rush out without them detecting me? I quickly finished up my business, wiped myself up and stand-by door to prepare to rush out.<br><br>At the count of 3, I ran out and juz then the gals came out. Imagine my horror! They are juz pulling up their skirts and arranging themselves when I came out!<br><br>I blushed and dashed out while they were too horrified to even scream...<br><br>Thank god the girls never told it to anyone...</div>
