Once outside all the other adults looked at me, all stunned. By then think my dad has come in and told him abt it. My dad got quite amused and i heard some1 comment ' hey this kid is smart man, still remain so calm and still managed to get out'.<br><br>Heh, paiseh sia, so malu liao still got pple praise me, not bad lar, haha......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha...u all wun believe this man. The most embarrassing thing happened when I was in my kintergarden. I remembered once when I serious stomach and needed to go to the toilet. But that time nono why I went to the gers' toilet to shit instead. Shit halfway suddenly got 2 girls come in (one of them my cousin siah) and started asking who is in the cubicle. I was so scared shitless (pun not intended) that I threw away the toilet paper I was grabbing in my hand. Hahaha, so I waited for them 2 gers to leave b4 I came out and went back to class, without cleaning my backside. Halfway through, the teacher started saying something stinks and suspect I forgot to clean my backside. So she grabbed me, pulled off my shorts and used her hand (yes, her hand!!!) to wipe at my backside. Hahahaha......imagine I was so malu when she confirmed that I really didn't clean my backside.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most embrassing? Well, I dun really grade how embrassing a situation is, but just embrassing.<br><br>Well, just 3 days ago, I was on my way home on a bus. And you know the jounrney was long and I felt sleep. And slowly slowly I fell asleep, then I suddenly fell forward, and hit my head on the seat in front so hard that the person sitting in front can feel the seat move. Well, I was still blury from my sleep, and then sit up and look around. Then the lady sitting next to me start to ask me if I am alright or not and such. Then I realise that the person sitting in front was looking at me. As usual my face turn red from the embrassment. The lady even ask if I need to go to see a doctor as she thinks that the hit was pretty hard. but I insisted that I was alright and went back to sleep. but that is just to hide my embrassment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Remembered one:<br>I was going to a barber shop, walking there from Ang Mo Kio MRT station. I was walking happily along the walkway when i thought i heard shouts across the road. At first i neber hear, but it became clearer and clearer so i look across the road (2 roads actually, in different directions) I saw some guy on a bicycle shouting in my direction. He looked vaguely familiar, so i juz shouted back at him, telling him the barber shop and pointing in its general direction. Suddenly I hear someone shout a reply behind me! I looked back and saw someone on a bicycle ontop of a hill behind me! wah kao i was so embarrassed i juz tiam tiam and quicken my pace. I tink the guy i was shouting to gave me a strange look too... then finally when i reached the barber shop, i found the same guy inside, oso waiting for his turn. I hoped he didnt recognise me...well, if he did, he didnt show it...i juz sat down and bury my face in a magazine...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He he, still remembered the first time I play captain's ball when I was in primary school. I got the ball and passed it to the keeper. Yeah man, scored a point! To the other team. At that time it didn't occur to me that scoring in captain's ball was the reverse of scoring in basketball or soccer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once in sec skool after exams, we were playing wacko. the forfeit has got somethings to do with someone u like lah, and since she is in the circle, i thought can smart alec a bit let pple beat me then i reveal i like her in front of everybody (i a bit despo liao...at first like got chance now like losing chance liao...) hence i told my fren to call my name if he kena called...then when my fren call my name, i juz slouch on the chair and act say, letting the wacker beat me. Suddenly, the roll of newspaper came beating down on my privates! I was so embarrassed i picked up the newspaper and smacked back at the wacker in rage, resulting in some shouts frm the gers...in the end i cooled down myself enough to ask wat is the forfeit...and the answer was they oleidi did away with the forfeit some rounds ago cos it invade too much of pple's privacy...DAMN! but oso good thing lah...if i said anything stoopid then, i wld be even more mah lu...ahhhhhhh... *covers face*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>
