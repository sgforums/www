            <div class='col-md body'>Some of the story line in DVC is not from Dan Brown but ripped off from an earlier book in 1983 entitled Holy Blood Holy Grail of which the authors claim to be truthful after their painstaking research. Dan Brown just twist it a bit to focus on Mary Magdalene with the Last Supper painting.<br><br>In summary, the first Crusades led by a French king was rumored to be from some Merinogivian line which is the blood line of Jesus of Mary after they settled in France to have babies and fun. The conquest of Jerusalem was a front to cover up for their real intention. On the surface they claim retake of that holy city but in actual fact they looking for the Essenes scroll (similar to Dead Sea Scrolls) or Gnostic Gospels to dispel the commonly hold view of Christainity. An effort to restore the blood line to the world with some ancient proofs.<br><br>Priory of Sion was setup there and so was the Templar knights whose on surface mission is to protect Christain pilgrims but in reality, they hide themselves inside the castle to dig under the Solomon temple for the scrolls. Contents that will shake the foundation of the Church. Therefore, Knights Templar are not really favoured by the Church due to their dubious intention. They were later murdered en-mass with the grand master de Moley which is the image in the Turin shroud and not Jesus as claimed.<br><br>There are more about it in books and Internet.

If Gnostic gospels is wat the Templar knights had found, then indeed watever christainity view that has been taught to us will be a big lie. No more shall we pay homage to our pastors or the instituition. Go internet to take a look at what Gnostic gospels say and we will know why such contents are to be heavily suppressed by the Church as it threaten their livelihood and existence.<br><br>The Gnostic gospels are real ancient text and of cuz typical stauch christain supporters will deem such works as fake and heresay. Reason is simple cuz they dun wan their so called belief to be shaken. Ever wonder if gospel of thomas, gospel of mary etc and the remainer gospels are unearthed? Will ppl accept the truth of the text?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Follow up to my earlier post again. Rosslyn Chapel was built by a Templar knight. In fact if you take a look at the church it is like half pagan half christain inside. What are those green man imageries doing inside the chapel? The only logical deduction is the templar knight has known the secret and intent to keep it alive by embedding some images there for future generations.<br><br>Note crucifixation is not a tortue punishment that is only reserved for Jesus. In fact it can happen to any other person. In a picture in the Rosslyn, there was picture of a man crucified and it is strongly believe to be the Grand Master called de Moley who was coerced into confession of his misdeed by the Church before he died. The Turin shroud image is his. The chapel is like built to acknowledge the past templar knights tragic history.<br><br>So are templar knights the warriors that fight for the Truth to be heard? The real bloodline protectors? They were silenced cuz they were wealthy and powerful during their times and imagine they strongly advocate the Gnostic gospel teachings over the Church teachings? The outcome is disastrous. To avoid that point, the Church start the bloodbath first?  Another storyline for Dan Brown?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> [/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Follow up to my earlier post again again. Remember when Priory of Sion was setup it is widely believed it consists of templar knights also.  In fact 9 French knights asked for the approval to setup a Templar Knights order. However as times goes by, priory of sion sought to distance themselves from the templars after one of them lead a disastrous campaign against the Saracens. Kingdom of Heaven that movie will show just that.<br><br>Now with the military arm gone, priory of sion sought to preserve that secret and it slowly goes underground to secretly protect the real bloodline. So if it is true, Dan Brown assertion of present priory of sion alive and kicking maybe true. Their true knowledge is that the Truth of which some day it shall be revealed to expose the biggest lie of the century. Unfortunately, it isn't forthcoming and a possible deduction could be the bloodline are all accidentally 'terminated' by forces unseen along the history since then?<br><br>With real living person proof gone, we can only pray that all the Gnostic Gospels and Dead Sea Scrolls and other supporting evidence to help in their cause. So let's all pray for the discovery of the complete series of this ancient text to tell us the Truth that ought to be revealed a long long time ago.</div>
