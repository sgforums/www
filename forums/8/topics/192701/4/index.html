It then logically follows that the conclusion is quite wrong.<br><br>For example Dan Brown makes this bizzare claim that Judasim was decended from Pagan fertility religions, making this conclusion from the 'fact' that early temple worship in Judasim involving having ritualistic sex in the holies of holies.<br><br>This is a most bizzare claim that certainly even any secular expert on Judaism would refute. Judaism was a concept of God quite devoid of any gender whatsoever, and in fact the hebrew language even lacks a word for goddess. Wherever that fact, (and the following conclusion) came from... Dan Brown must have plucked it out of thin air.<br><br>One might buy an alternative theory about Christianity, but I would think Dan Brown's version is one of the weaker ones. There are better ones out there that would stand up better to debate.<br><br>If Christianity is a lie, very well then, but what good is trading one lie for another lie? In any case, be Christianity true of false, Dan Brown's version of it is certainly a lie, and a rather big one at that.<br><br>I could make a series of conclusions that Singapore was founded in 1999, but of course if the facts I made my conclusions on are false... then my conclusion is but a work of fiction... and is fiction worth staking one's life on? Would I like to live my life by a lie?<br><br>Imagine somebody tells me that my house is on fire and I have to get out, but I choose to disbelieve this person based on false facts (I never bothered to check out) that made me conclude that this person is lying. Will holding onto this false conclusion save me from the fire?</div>

You can't say that. Do you mean that reading Da Vinci Code can change one's faith about Christianity, which you believe is bad?

However, this touch of self-centreness came when Christian groups are trying to ban the movie. Banning it means no one, no matter what religion or belief, cannot view the movie even if it is only for entertainment. Is this fair to all other religions and believes?<br><br>Singapore censorship board had made a right choice by not banning the show but putting age restrictions to it. In this way, hopefully that both the Christians and non-christians out there will be satisfied.</div>
