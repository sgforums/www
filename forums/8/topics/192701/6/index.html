Remember when Priory of Sion was setup it is widely believed it consists of templar knights also.  In fact 9 French knights asked for the approval to setup a Templar Knights order. However as times goes by, priory of sion sought to distance themselves from the templars after one of them lead a disastrous campaign against the Saracens. Kingdom of Heaven that movie will show just that.<br><br>Now with the military arm gone, priory of sion sought to preserve that secret and it slowly goes underground to secretly protect the real bloodline. So if it is true, Dan Brown assertion of present priory of sion alive and kicking maybe true. Their true knowledge is that the Truth of which some day it shall be revealed to expose the biggest lie of the century. Unfortunately, it isn't forthcoming and a possible deduction could be the bloodline are all accidentally 'terminated' by forces unseen along the history since then?<br><br>With real living person proof gone, we can only pray that all the Gnostic Gospels and Dead Sea Scrolls and other supporting evidence to help in their cause. So let's all pray for the discovery of the complete series of this ancient text to tell us the Truth that ought to be revealed a long long time ago.</div></blockquote>hmm... ok.... then you go uncover all the truth while we wait here.<br><br>At the same time, help find the royal bloodline also.

Aside from the great food, it has a community atmosphere I have not found in other cities around the world.<br>By David Turner<br><br>I LOVE our local hawker centre. Aside from the great food, it has a community atmosphere I have not found in other cities around the world.<br><br>On weekend mornings, when whole families come down in their slippers for kopi and carrot cake, it's like we're all having breakfast together.<br><br>I think this is a big reason for Singapore's social harmony. I always like to say, 'the country that eats together, stays together.'<br><br>I want to be part of the family but, for an expat, it can be difficult not to stand out as the clumsy ang moh who doesn't know his char kuay teow from his chye tow kuay.<br><br>I think I have the correct uniform: Slightly-worn '90s community event souvenir T-shirt, loose shorts for waist expansion and a red plastic bag in at least one hand.<br><br>But it's the hawker centre code of conduct I just can't work out.<br><br>There are so many secret codes to learn before you can truly say you have earned your place at the table.<br><br>Before you even think about black or white, chilli or no chilli, O or C, you have to make a lot of serious decisions.<br><br>Even finding a seat can be traumatic. Is it general seating, or do I need to order from the stall I sit next to?<br><br>Does the tissue-paper reserves-table rule apply? (And is the tissue on that table a reserve-table tissue or a used one?)<br><br>Even after I have found a seat, waves of uncertainty prevent me from sitting down.<br><br>Is it self-service? Should I sit down after I order or wait at the stall? Will the drinks man come to my table or should I flag him over?<br><br>Believe me, when you're hungry, these questions can be overwhelming.<br><br>Despite my best efforts to blend in, I often make the wrong move and end up looking like just another FOCA - Fresh Out of Changi Airport.<br><br>I try to blend in like a local by using the local language, but this only leads to more fun at my expense.<br><br>For example, when buying chicken rice I would proudly ask to 'da pau', as in take-away, like a real local.<br><br>The chicken rice lady would always laugh. I assumed she was surprised at my mastery of the local dialect.<br><br>That was until my wife told me I was actually saying 'da pau', as in big pork bun, and that she was laughing at me, not with me.<br><br>Now I just say 'packet'.<br><br>Similarly, I now say 'black glutinous rice' when ordering my favourite breakfast because I can never get ''burbur hitam' out the right way. It becomes 'burbur hatum'.<br><br>Even if I do successfully order, the ordeal is not over, because I can never tell when my order is ready.<br><br>When I order from our local zi char stall, it is always the same routine.<br><br>I order by pointing at the menu and then I sit down and start to wonder if I should go to the drinks stall or wait until they come to me.<br><br>Eventually, I notice that the zi char lady is calling out an order in Mandarin, but that no-one is collecting it.<br><br>She will repeat the order a few times before she notices a puzzled ang moh looking at her expectantly.<br><br>She then turns away and announces to the coffeeshop in general, 'seafood crispy fried noodle!' Everyone looks as I go to collect my order.<br><br>But just to prove I'm not a FOCA, I ask for extra chilli.<br><br></div>

Â“The pristine, beautiful picture of Singapore you see before you actually disguises clues to dirty dealings and secrets that go back for ages.Â”<br><br>According to the researcher and his lady assistant, apparently a relative, they have been trying to crack the code ever since they witnessed a crime where a charity was plundered for peanuts.<br><br>Â“We followed the trail of peanuts and it led to so many important people,Â” he continued, adding that a mysterious male, all in white, has been tailing them in an attempt to stop them from publishing further details in a book tentatively titled Â“The Enrich Me CodeÂ”, which they hope will be a bestseller.<br><br>The alleged secretive society, known as the PeopleÂ’s Action Priory or something like that, has denied any wrongdoing.<br><br>Said their spokesman Mr. Opus Teh, Â“Â’The Enrich Me CodeÂ’, like all of Dr. CheeÂ’s works, is mostly a work of badly-written fiction that tantalizes more than it teaches.Â”<br><br>Â© http://www.TalkingCock.com 2001-2003.

            <div class='col-md body'>I would not bank heavily on the gnostic gospels in formulating my conspiracy thesis.<br><br>Firstly they were not suppressed or covered up by the church (at least in the way you would like to see it), but rather rejected. Their existence and knowledge of their contents are no surprise to any historian, Christian or nonwise for a very long time. In fact if you read into history you will find not a cover up, but a big exposing of the gnostics. It's dispopularity now could be truly that... that is fell out of favour for it was incongruent with the truth as the Christians believed. Paul said a lot about that... a strange thing if he decided to hush it up.<br><br>A discovery of any old texts would be a historical find, but not really a confirmation of a find of the truth. If it is reflective of true Christianity at that time... well you'll have to decide.<br><br>But we have to consider several things. Was gnosticism something Jesus truly left behind or was in an invention trying to pass off for the real thing? Gnosticism is extremely hard to believe of being Jesus' tradition... frankly because it directly contradicts plenty of the things and promises in Judaism, from which was the whole point of Jesus' life in the first place.<br><br>It is a bizzare blend of greek thinking and christian events passed of an as ideal. Now you may have discovered an acient piece of thinking, but that would hardly make it the truth... only historical.<br><br>In any case, I don't see how the critics of Christianity would react any differently if it was Gnosticsm that became accepted and the mainstream idealogy that we have today suppressed and rejected. They would also quite likely say that the rejected idea was the real thing and the mainstream one rejected.<br><br>No, I do not believe that simply being rejected means that it has to be true, this works on an assumption that the Church has to be hiding something. And when one starts with this assumption he is liable to see conspiracies everywhere.<br><br>I'd rather start with looking at the basis of the two beliefs myself. In my opinion I don't find it hard to see why the gnostics fell out of favour with the Christians, after they had flirted with it for a while.<br><br>If you found an old document from some guy saying that it is proof that he owns your family inheritence (and that your family was supressing it), would you believe it simply on basis of this 'truth' being suppressed or would you check it out first?</div>
