During most of a star's lifetime, nuclear fusion in the core generates electromagnetic radiation, including photons, the particles of light. This radiation exerts an outward pressure that exactly balances the inward pull of gravity caused by the star's mass. As the nuclear fuel is exhausted, the outward forces of radiation diminish, allowing the gravitation to compress the star inward. The contraction of the core causes its temperature to rise and allows remaining nuclear material to be used as fuel. The star is saved from further collapse -- but only for a while.Eventually, all possible nuclear fuel is used up and the core collapses. How far it collapses, into what kind of object, and at what rate, is determined by the star's final mass and the remaining outward pressure that the burnt-up nuclear residue (largely iron) can muster. If the star is sufficiently massive or compressible, it may collapse to a black hole. If it is less massive or made of stiffer material, its fate is different: it may become a white dwarf or a neutron star<br></div>

Only a minority don't think so. What explanation they have I don't know.<br><br>The big bang is just like the supernova (when a big star explodes). The universe is said to have started out this way. There are many explanations for the big bang, some astronomers believe it is compression, some say because it was very very very hot, which caused the big bang. These are the two common reasons.

Stars that have a lot of mass may end their lives as black holes or neutron stars. Low and medium mass stars will become something called a white dwarf. A typical white dwarf is half as massive as the Sun, yet only slightly bigger than the Earth. This makes white dwarfs one of the densest forms of matter, surpassed only by neutron stars.Medium mass stars, like our Sun, live by burning the hydrogen that dwells within their cores, turning it into helium. This is what our Sun is doing now. The heat the Sun generates by its nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium creates an outward pressure. In another 5 billion years, the Sun will have used up all the hydrogen in its core.<br><br>This situation in a star is similar to a pressure cooker. Heating something in a sealed container causes a build up in pressure. The same thing happens in the Sun. Although the Sun may not strictly be a sealed container, gravity causes it to act like one, pulling the star inward, while the pressure created by the hot gas in the core pushes to get out. The balance between pressure and gravity is very delicate.<br><br>When the Sun runs out of hydrogen to burn, gravity temporarily tips the balance, and the star starts to collapse. But compacting a star causes it to heat up again and it is able burn what little hydrogen remains in a shell wrapped around its core.<br>This burning shell of hydrogen will give our Sun the energy to expand again. When this happens, our Sun will become a red giant; it will be so big that Mercury will be completely swallowed!<br>When a star gets bigger, its heat spreads out making its overall temperature cooler. But over time, the core temperature of our red giant Sun will increase again until it's finally hot enough to burn all the stored up helium it created in its former incarnation. Eventually, it will transform the helium into carbon and other heavier elements. The Sun will only spend one billion years as a red giant, as opposed to the nearly 10 billion it spent busily burning hydrogen.<br><br>We already know that medium mass stars, like our Sun, become red giants. But what happens after that? Well, our red giant Sun is still eating up helium and cranking out carbon. But when it's finished its helium, it isn't quite hot enough to be able to burn the carbon it created. What now?<br>Our Sun isn't hot enough to ignite the carbon it its core, so the only thing it can do is succumb to gravity again. When the core of the star contracts, it causes a release of energy that makes the envelope of the star expand. Now the star has become an even bigger giant than before! Our Sun's radius has become larger than Earth's orbit! The Sun is not very stable at this point and loses mass similar to how a boiling kettle loses water by releasing steam. This continues until the star finally blows its outer layers off in a gust of superwind. The core of the star, however, remains intact, and becomse exposed to the outside universe -- this is the white dwarf. This leaves behind a white dwarf surrounded by an expanding shell of gas in an object known as planetary nebula. They are called this because early observers thought they looked like the planets Uranus and Neptune. There are some planetary nebulae that can be viewed through a backyard telescope. In about half of them, the central white dwarf can be seen using a moderate sized telescope.<br>Planetary nebulae seem to mark the transition of a medium mass star from red giant to white dwarf. Stars that are comparable in mass to our Sun will become white dwarfs within 75,000 years of blowing their envelopes. Eventually they, like our Sun, will cool down, radiating heat into space, fading into black lumps of carbon. It has taken 10 billion years, but our Sun has reached the end of the line and quietly become a black dwarf.<br>White dwarfs can tell us important things about the age of the universe. If we can estimate the time it takes for a white dwarf to cool into a black dwarf, that would give us a lower limit on the age of the universe and our galaxy. Because it takes billions of years for white dwarfs to cool, we don't think the universe is old enough yet for many, if any, white dwarfs to have become black dwarfs. This is why we want to learn more about white dwarfs. They could be an important key to understanding our universe.<br><br></div>
