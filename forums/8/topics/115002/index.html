            <div class='col-md body'>Dear forumers<br><br>I would like to share with you what happened to me at The Coffee Connection at Paradiz Centre today.<br><br>My day started off with a quarrel at home, which affected my mood and performance at meetings during the day.  After the meeting, I went to Paradiz Centre and decided to find a place to sit and have a drink.  I needed a place to reconcile my thoughts.  My mood had been awful and I had no shoulder to cry on when I needed one.<br><br>I entered The Coffee Connection outlet at Paradiz Centre, sat down and ordered something.  Just then, my friend sent me an sms to comfort me about the morning's quarrel that I had.  Tears started rolling down my cheek, non-stop.  When the waiter served me my food and drink, I turned my face away so as to hide my teary face.<br><br>After a couple of minutes, I stopped crying and made the payment with my credit card.  As I was slowly enjoying my drink, a waitress came by and gave me a slice of fruit cake and said that it's on the house.  For a moment, I thought TCC was having some promotion to give away free dessert.  But I found a note, wrapped in the serviette, with the message written as follows:<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Dear Miss <br><br>Just a little something to cheer you up.<br><br>From:<br>Staff of TCC</span><br><br>This is the first time in my life I have ever encountered this.  I wonder what I can do to return such a nice gesture.</div>

In fact if you were to cry in my previous working place(a restaurant) I doubt my manager would entertain you. She thinks that excellent service means being intuitive to the customer's needs(e.g responding to the customers's call in less 3 seconds, refilling water in glass without being told by the customer) But giving something to the customer? Nah..It will hurt profits. When I was a service staff Im not even allowed to ask the customer how the food was(For fear that unneccesary problems might arised)</div>
