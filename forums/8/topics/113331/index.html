The philosopher read it and concluded it was correct. "Then, go to Hell!" With another snap of his finger, the philosopher disappeared.<br><br>The mathematician then asked, "Give me the most complicated formula you can ever think of!" With a snap of his finger, another stack of paper appeared next to the Devil. The mathematician read it and reluctantly agreed it was correct. "Then, go to Hell!" With another snap of his finger, the mathematician disappeared, too.<br><br>The idiot then stepped forward and said, "Bring me a chair!" The Devil brought forward a chair. "Drill 7 holes on the seat." The Devil did just that. The idiot then sat on the chair and let out a very loud fart. Standing up, he asked, "Which hole did my fart come out from?"<br>The Devil inspected the seat and said, "The third hole from the right."<br>"Wrong," said the idiot, "it's from my asshole."

He enters a sauna, sits down, and farts. Within a few moments a huge, horribly corpulent, hairy man with a firm erection lumbers out of the steam towards him.

He is greeted by the smiling naked receptionist: ''May I help you?''. Bob says: ''Here is your card and key back. You can keep the $500 joining fee.''<br><br>''But Sir, you've only been here a couple of hours; you only saw a small fraction of our facilities...''<br><br>Bob replies: ''Listen lady, I am 58 years old, I get a hard-on about once a month, but I fart 15 times a day.

            <div class='col-md body'>A man was on his first business trip to Japan, and he decided to check out the local wh0re house.<br><br>He walked in and was assigned a young girl with a body that got him going immediately.<br><br>As soon as they reached the room, he started ripping her clothes off and going to town.<br><br>Moaning and grunting, the girl was screaming in Japanese, "Wasukima! Wasukima!" He was sure that she was praising him for his good job, so he kept going harder than ever.<br><br>Later, he went golfing with his boss and a few clients.<br><br>As the clients were Japanese, he decided to impress them with his new knowledge of their language. When one of them got a hole in one, he raised his arms and shouted, "Wasukima!"<br><br>All of the men looked at him quizzically, and one of them asked, "Why are you shouting 'wrong hole'?"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Got it from a website  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>A man escapes from prison where he has been for 15 years. He breaks into a house to look for money and guns and finds a young couple in bed. He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair. While tying the girl to the bed he gets on top of her, kisses her neck, then gets up and goes into the bathroom.<br><br>While he's in there, the husband tells his wife: "listen, this guy's an escaped convict, look at his clothes! He probably spent lots of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck."<br><br>"If he wants sex, don't resist, don't complain, do whatever he tells you. Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is probably very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us. Be strong, honey. I love you!"<br><br>To which the wife responds: "he wasn't kissing my neck. He was whispering in my ear. He told me he was gay, thought you were cute, and asked if we had any vaseline. I told him it was in the bathroom. Be strong honey. I love you too!"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems an elderly gentleman had serious hearing problems for a number of years. He went to the doctor and the doctor was able to have him fitted for a set of hearing aids that allowed the gentleman to hear 100%.<br><br>The elderly gentleman went back in a month to the doctor and the doctor said, "Your hearing is perfect. Your family must be really pleased you can hear again."<br><br>To which the gentleman said, "Oh, I haven't told my family yet. I just sit around and listen to the conversations. I've changed my will five times!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A NUS graduate finding difficulty in getting a job here<br>finally accepted the offer to work with Mandai Zoo.<br><br>"What to do? It's better to work like this than earn nothing...,"<br>he mumbled to himself.<br><br>So the IT grad started work acting as a monkey. He had to wear<br>monkey suit and mask, chew nuts and eat bananas. He also had to<br>climb trees and jump from one to another to attract visitors.<br><br>The zoo has since enjoyed tremendous business and an increase in<br>visitor arrrivals. Even world leaders wanted to see the super 'smart'<br>monkey of the world.<br><br>Unfortunately, one day when he was jumping from the trees he slipped<br>and fell into a crocodile pool!<br><br>"Oh my God....I'm dying... now," he thought, as a hungry-looking<br>crocodile swam steadily towards his direction.<br><br>In the middle of his struggle, suddenly he heard a soft voice,<br>"Don't be afraid my friend...
