The physician tells the man to bring his wife in so he can talk to her.<br><br>When the wife comes to office, the doctor asks her why she doesn't want<br>to have sex with her husband any more.<br><br>"For the last 7 months," the wife replies, "every morning I take a cab to work. I don't make much money and my husband doesn't give me more than bus fare, so the cab driver always asks me, 'So are you going to pay today or what?' I always give him an 'or what'.<br><br>That makes me late to work. I'm late, so the boss asks me, 'So are we going to dock your salary, or what?'<br><br>That's another 'or what.' On the way home, I take the cab and again I<br>don't have any money so the cab driver asks me, 'So are you going to<br>pay this time or what?' And, again, I do an 'or what'.<br><br>So you see, Doctor, when I get home I'm all tired out and I don't want<br>sex any more."<br><br>The doctor thinks for a second.

"Well, OK... but only for a minute."<br><br>She loosened her bikini top and while both are standing there on the beach, he slid his hands underneath and began to feel... then he started saying, "OH MY GOD... OH MY GOD... OH MY GOD..." while he was caressing them.<br><br>Out of curiosity, she asked him, "Why do you keep saying, 'Oh my god, oh my god'?"<br><br>While continuing to feel her bre@sts he answered, "OH MY GOD...
