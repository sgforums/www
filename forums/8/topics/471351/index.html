            <div class='col-md body'><p>I was chatting to this lady over facebook. Just a friendly chat, asked her out for a date but she said she already has a boyfriend. I joked with her that all my friends are sexy, maybe she is not sexy enough for me. Then she asked me a few questions, I didn't really reply.. After a few hours, I got a message from her.. Didn't sound like her, she scolded me with vulgarities, ask me to watch what I am saying.. If not happy, she ask me to call her.. She say she know my face, she knows where to find me.. I guess it was her boyfriend who messaged like that, then she removed me from her friend's list.. I blocked her totally from my account.. I am just surprised a friendly funny chat can lead to a heated fight.. We dont know each other before, we dont have any phone numbers.. I dont even use my actual name on facebook.. Can she complain to police for any action against me? But I didnt say anything wrong, in fact she is the one who intimidated me by scolding vulgarities and saying she knows where to find me..Am I in any kind of trouble? I totally blocked her off already from facebook.. </p></div>

              <p>Nothing la. Police also not interested. At the very most if you get an IO who takes pity on you, will just call her and tell her not to do anything dumb.</p>
              <p>But no offence disclosed.  Anybody can make a report, you, she, her boyfirend etc, but just for your own record purposes, nobody in law enforcement will be interested. Do you in a single day how many 'just for record purposes' reports are made? I'd say nearly 1/3 on a poor day and nearly 50% on a busy day.</p>

                              <p>I was chatting to this lady over facebook. Just a friendly chat,
              asked her out for a date but she said she already has a boyfriend.
              I joked with her that all my friends are sexy, maybe she is not
              sexy enough for me. Then she asked me a few questions, I didn't
              really reply.. After a few hours, I got a message from her.. Didn't
              sound like her, she scolded me with vulgarities, ask me to watch
              what I am saying.. If not happy, she ask me to call her.. She say
              she know my face, she knows where to find me.. I guess it was her
              boyfriend who messaged like that, then she removed me from her
              friend's list.. I blocked her totally from my account.. I am just
              surprised a friendly funny chat can lead to a heated fight.. We
              dont know each other before, we dont have any phone numbers.. I
              dont even use my actual name on facebook.. Can she complain to
              police for any action against me? But I didnt say anything wrong,
              in fact she is the one who intimidated me by scolding vulgarities
              and saying she knows where to find me..Am I in any kind of trouble?
              I totally blocked her off already from facebook.. </p>

              Lols...you are the one who started this argument by being egoist and probably felt rejected by her just because she was telling you the truth or not that she already has a boyfriend. And then you insulted her for being not good looking enough for you. I think if she reported to the police also no use because this internet insult are very common worldwide. However, if the police report really come true and steps are taken for legal action against you, legally you will be seen as the source of having started all this in the first place.
