I went into my room and then cursed the toilet for being too small.

            <div class='col-md body'>When I was young, I lived in a deserted kampong deep in the jungle. Every night, my mother would ask me not to go home too late as there won't be any transportation after a certain time. One night, before going home, I tapao a kueh teow soup for supper. I was late and I waited for the taxi/bus but there was none. I was getting worried as the night was getting darker and darker. So I tried to  flag down private vehicles to take me home. There was no one stopping for me, till one motorcyclist took compensation on me and stopped to give me a lift. He was a man with a kind face. I accepted his offer and got onto his motorbike.<br><br>On the way home, we would pass by a temple. At night, the temple would look eerily spooky with the dim lights from the candles. At first, the motorcyclist was warm and friendly. When the temple was approaching, the motorcyclist eyes grown bigger and bigger. His kind face turned to a face of anger. He was muttering something loud but was not audible to me. I was so scared that I closed my eyes in order not to  see his angry face.<br><br>Then, the motorcylist stopped in front of the temple and then yelled at me.<br><br>"Your kueh teow soup is so hot!! It is burning my thigh! Can you please move it away???"<br></div>

I was late and I waited for the taxi/bus but there was none. I was getting worried as the night was getting darker and darker. So I tried to  flag down private vehicles to take me home. There was no one stopping for me, till one motorcyclist took compensation on me and stopped to give me a lift. He was a man with a kind face.

At first, the motorcyclist was warm and friendly. When the temple was approaching, the motorcyclist eyes grown bigger and bigger. His kind face turned to a face of anger. He was muttering something loud but was not audible to me. I was so scared that I closed my eyes in order not to  see his angry face.<br><br>Then, the motorcylist stopped in front of the temple and then yelled at me.<br><br>"Your kueh teow soup is so hot!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, I've this experience while i was in Secondary One.<br><br>Back den my class would ask out form teacher to tell us a ghost story whenever time permits. (My form teacher when i was in sec one, teaches me Maths and P.E)<br><br>On this particular day, i had my Home Education (Cooking and Sewing Class) lesson on cooking.<br><br>Ok, the layout of the kitchen is quite simple. When u enter the kitchen, a whiteboard is directly in front of the door, facing towards the right. There are 2 columns, 5 rows of tables in front of the white board. The sinks are located beside each of the 2 colums of tables. There are 5 sinks in each sides and just beside each sink is a rack to hold the dishes and utensils after they're washed. The racks are placed leaning against the wall.<br><br>We gathered in front of the whiteboard, as instructed by the teacher to see her demonstration. Ok, here comes the scary part. My LEFT EYEBROW began to twitch out of the sudden. I, whom stood at the sinks on the left, turn my head and looked at the sinks on the right. (Dont ask me why. It just happened.)<br><br>Suddenly, the racks at the extreme end fell. The whole class was startled. But as usual, we'll go "Woa!" and laugh it off. Den, the rack beside it dropped as well. The class gets noisier. Den after dat, i think u all should have guessed, the 3rd rack fell. My teacher began to mumble some nonsense. I can still remember clearly she said "If something is bound to happen and you cannot stop it den dont.". Tne 4th rack fell.<br><br>At that point of time everyone wasn't interested in her demonstration anymore. We were just amazed and discussing the events that had just happened. But class still resumes la.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The very next day, we told our Form Teacher about it and den, 2 of my classmates said something which he kept to himself for the day. They were standing just in front of the sinks on the right. After the 4th rack fell, 2 of them saw someone in white floating pass and disappear. The people standing near the sinks on the right also felt chill air blowing against them out of the sudden.<br><br>From that day on, no more ghost stories were heard from my form teacher.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>
