            <div class='col-md body'>When i was a kid i stayed in my grandma's old flat for some time..One nite i was zzzzz. My bed was facing the window (corridor room). Suddenly i woke up... I saw this young girl in white juz floating across the corridor.. Thebackground was very smoky and greenish. I was too tired to think much but i am sure that was not a dream. Later i dreamt of her a few times. From what i heard a girl had fell down that corridor before.<br><br>last month in Phuket, we stayed in a room which was at the extreme end. Next to exit. Every night i would hear bangings on the door but i dun know which door but sound very de. very loud .also lots of furniture dragging but my frns did not hear anything, anyway they were zzzz like pigs liao</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This took place in one of the shophouses in the neighbouring country<br><br>I was taking a bath in the kitchen at around midnight. That night is quiet. I'm the type who spent long time showering in the bathroom. Suddenly, very loud sharp knockings (louder than people using hammer to knock nail into the wall) appear on the right wall of the bathroom. The right wall is actually attached to the kitchen!!! Nobody will be knocking nails using hammer in the midnight, and nearly everyone else has gone to sleep, and there's no one else in the kitchen. I knew the clue and quickly finish my shower and dashed out of the bathroom. When I'm out of the bathroom, the loud knockings ceased. In the middle of the night, I heard sounds of water showering (same sound as water heater showering head splashing water) in the same bathroom in the kitchen.<br></div>
