            <div class='col-md body'>As has been pointed out, what exactly constitutes Australian culture?  Peter Costello's got his heart in the right place, but by bringing in the issue of Australian culture and then not addressing it, he's messed up badly.  On the other hand, opponents of Costello's stand have proposed that Australian values do not differ from common human values, and equally failed to substantiate what these values are.<br><br>There was an interesting public debate about the Cronulla riots a while back.  A number of Cronulla residents argued that the riots were a long time coming because the cops didn't do anything about the trouble that was obviously brewing.  Some White Australians said that the Lebanese tended to hang around in large groups and sexually harrass and abuse women on the beach, while some Lebanese people said that they started hanging around in groups in the first place because they didn't feel safe.  It's six of one and half a dozen of the other as to who's wrong and who's right and where it all started, but one thing's for sure - this is a vicious cycle that needs to be broken.<br><br>Fact is that in broad strokes, Costello's right.  Except for refugees, people who take up residency in Australia do so by choice, and if they don't like it, they can jolly well leave.  If we're talking universal rules of conduct here, everybody knows that you don't enter another guy's house and proceed to sh!t on his living room carpet, so what's the beef?  Costello's just stating the obvious, and that's a good point at which to start breaking the vicious cycle.  I for one am glad that someone's finally got the balls to stand up and say something useful instead of hiding behind politically correct and practically useless piffle.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe someone mentioned this before in another thread. In some countries, its population would identify themselves by their nationality first. Whereas countries like Singapore and Malaysia, we identify ourselves by our race first.<br>The next time you filled up an offical form of any sort, take note if our race is asked or not. There was talk sometime ago to do away with the question on race in forms.<br>It is not surprising that the aussies threw a hoo hah because they felt women from the middle east continued to maintain their traditional dressing, and therefore not being australianised. But certainly we must be able to be free to choose on how we dress. This is a delicate matter. The women dress as they are because of religious reasons. There will always be two sides to the coin, and one can put up the arguments that we have seen in the case in France.<br>So if we are migrants to another country, what are we to do.... burn our bridges, abandon our values and welcome our new found home with open arms? It'll be hilarious to see newly migrant old uncles and aunties going around in the streets of australian cities muttering 'bloody this' and 'bloody that'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, we were all migrant people who derieved from one centre in search for a better life. Trans-migration has been something that have gone on for centuries, so no race or people are the 'original' people of their land, just that they settled there before others did. However through time, people came, people left, race exterminated, new races created. We are just part of the ongoing process of civilization, of life.</div>
