            <div class='col-md body'>This is an issue, I have been wondering for quite some time now, and my view is this.<br><br>Singaporean men dont really have a problem, it's the whole culture and size of this country that is driving the local women away.<br><br>Imagine someone, who has sufficient money, is intelligent enough, has sufficient good looks and NONE of the asian upbringing due to environment that practically worships western values. He/She would definitely not want to live their life in a deadbeat country that encourages working till you die and paying till you die if they have a choice. Sense of partriotism, loyalty to the family are thrown out the window, along with the belief in asian family models.<br><br>Man in Asia are expected to start families AND contribute to the family that took care of them before adult hood. Women, however in most Asian countries, do not have this social responsibility on them.<br><br>For women in Singapore, to marry a singapore man, would be no different from accepting the dead beat lifestyle that singapore encourages. Which is what most people would agree , is a bullsh1t idea. Believe it or not, if you have a gf who loves Singapore, she would love most Singapore men too.<br><br>-------------------------------------<br><br>10 March 2006, The New Paper,<br><br>SORRY, guys. Joey Swee does not quite fancy you.<br><br>In her own words, she finds Singaporean men too shallow, too domineering and too boastful.<br><br>'When the timing is right, they'll say, 'Let's go apply for a flat together!',' claimed the 29-year-old actress-compere.<br><br>She speaks from experience, of course.<br><br>Joey has had two Singaporean boyfriends - a three-year relationship in her teens and a four-year relationship that ended when she was 23 years old.<br><br>She also has many guy buddies.<br><br>And while she has had no lack of Singapore suitors, she has become more sceptical of male attention after joining Star Search in 1997.<br><br>'It's harder to make new friends because you wonder if people are trying to make use of you,' she said.<br><br>It didn't help that Joey wanted a 'hong hong lie lie ' (Mandarin for grand and spectacular) romance.<br><br>So she settled for a foreigner - Indonesian-Chinese Gani Bustan, 41.<br><br>'Some people are nice to you or give you treats because you are who you are,' she reasoned. 'But with a foreigner, all the 'privileges' I had are gone, because he doesn't have a clue who I am.'<br><br>The couple were introduced in 2003 by Joey's girlfriend, who had married Mr Gani's best pal.<br><br>Initially, they kept in touch via e-mail and instant messages.<br><br>Things got serious when Mr Gani, who runs his own finance company, started flying to Singapore for business regularly.<br><br>He proposed last December aboard a plane. They were returning from a nine-day China tour.<br><br>They had their wedding ceremony in Jakarta last month and will register their marriage here next Monday. Then they will fly to Paris in April for their honeymoon.<br><br>She said: 'He's a very genuine person and he's very caring and dotes on me.<br><br>'We're from two different countries, so we treasure what little time we have together. It's more hong hong lie lie because we're always flying to see each other.'<br><br>The jet-setting will continue during their married life, as Joey intends to continue - with her hosting and acting.<br><br>When asked how she managed to keep her 'trophy hubby' under wraps, she replied: 'Of course you cannot talk about your final catch, or else someone will come snatch him away!'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One cannot dictate his/her sexual preference. It manifests itself naturally. You cannot measure the degree of lousiness of male Singaporeans by the size of the lesbian population. There is no correlation at all.<br><br>However, Singaporean men are lousy in the sense that the Singapore dream no longer appeals to locals. Marrying a Singaporean male is akin being part of the viscious cycle - Woo a girl in university -&gt; Start Working -&gt; Marry her -&gt; Have Kids -&gt; Send Your Kids to school -&gt; Retire and Work at McDonalds' -&gt; Your kid goes to university and woo a girl .. -&gt; the cycle repeats itself..<br><br>How are we Singaporeans going to live our lives outside the social paradigm that is so well-defined in our clinical environment?<br><br><strong>We should all migrate!</strong></div>

I think just to ask this of them is enough, never mind asking them to be gentlemanly and caring. If they even remotely show they can stop being total pervs, then we consider asking them to take it one level up, and start showing they can be caring n gentlemanly</div>

Hence her opinions are despised or even worthless when it was skewed to her materialistic nature.<br><br>What prompted me to write now however, was about Caramon saying the fault doesn't lie on singaporean men. Wow, what a refreshing comment. All these while, I've been tired of hearing about singaporean ladies blaming the local men on alot of issues, and then came out of the blue, Caramon like a superwoman in cape putting things right on prespective. Now that's worth listening to. That just puts Caramon one rung up.</div>
