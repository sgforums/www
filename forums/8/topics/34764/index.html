            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Age Spots</strong><br>Cut a lemon wedge and hold directly on spot for ten minutes. Rinse with warm water. Repeat this step every day until the spots lighten or vanish altogether!<br><br><strong>Bath Secret</strong><br>Pour a cup or more of powdered milk under running bath water. The lactic acid in the milk will remove dry dead skin and leave you baby soft. Powered milk is quite reasonably priced compared to those expensive bath oils and soaks. Just add a drop or two of some scented oil if you want a really dreamy bath!<br><br><strong>Blackheads</strong><br>A friend of mine gave me this great tip. To erase blackheads, try this quick cleansing mask: Mix two Tbs. of oatmeal, four Tbs. of plain yogurt, one tablespoon lemon juice and one Tbs. of olive oil into a paste and gently apply to skin. Leave it on for five minutes and rinse with cold water. Let your face air-dry. Check out my Facial Page for more great masks!<br><br><strong>Banish Bemishes On Back or Chest</strong><br>Mix one half cup of honey with one half cup of orange juice and apply to the affected areas. Let sit for 5 minutes then rinse. Honey heals and banishes blemishes and the orange juice will dry up the excess oils. Also, look below under "Zit Zappers" for more blemish remedies!<br><br><strong>Clogged Pores</strong><br>This is a great deep cleansing scrub! Mix four Tbs. of plain yogurt with two Tbs. of grated orange peel. Massage into skin for three minutes. Rinse with warm water. The yogurt is an exfoliant and the orange peel will extract dirt and oils.<br><br><strong>Cold Sores</strong><br>When you feel that first little warning "tingle" dab some Bepto Bismol on the spot before the sore has a chance to appear. For more really great cold sore tips, go to my home remedy page.<br>Barefoot Lass's Home Remedies<br><br><strong>Double Chin</strong><br>To camouflage a double chin, sweep brownish-rose blush along jaw line from just below the ears to chin and blend. Highlight tip of chin with white powder for a slimming effect. Now.... if you want to really firm that double chin up, do the exercise that Mona is doing below!<br><br><strong><br>Elbow Fix</strong><br>To remove the discoloration from your elbows, just cut a lemon in half and rest an elbow in each half for 10 minutes. The acid in the lemon juice breaks down the dark patches, so they wash away.<br><br><strong>Dry Patches</strong><br>To relieve dry patches, massage in vegetable shortening like Crisco. Sounds yucky! But it is emollient rich and full of vitamins and replenishing oils. And, it's preservative and fragrance free. Best of all, it works!!<br><br><strong>Freckles</strong><br>Sorry, ya can't remove these darling dots but you can lighten them. Try one of these tips:<br>Rub your freckles with fresh cut eggplant every day. You should see a difference in a week or so. Or try rubbing on fresh crushed cranberries daily and leave on for fifteen minutes, rinse with cool water and pat dry. Tip; The more sugar that you eat, the darker your freckles will be! This is a scientific fact. So, eliminate refined sugar and watch your freckles fade. Now this is the killer! If you are really determined to make your freckles lighter than ever, try this old time remedy: Put six ounces of urine in a jar with one tablespoon of white vinegar and a pinch of salt. Cover the jar let it sit for twenty four hours. Take a cotton ball and pat on the solution. Do this until the freckles have faded enough for you. Yuck!<br><br><strong>Terrific Eye Cream</strong><br>Before bed apply unscented castor oil around your eyes. Plastic surgeons use this on their patients after surgery!<br><br><strong><br>Puffy Eyes</strong><br>Put cool slices of cucumbers on your eyes. Or soak two tea bags &amp; place in freezer for a few minutes, place on eyes &amp; lay back &amp; relax! Or, grate a raw potato, mold it into a mushy pack, and put it on your eyes and lids for 10-20 minutes. The potato starch will help smooth eye-area skin and ease away puffyness.<br><br><strong>Baggy Eyes</strong><br>Got baggy eyes? Try this trick! Dab some Preparation H hemorrhoid cream on those bags!! It will shrink them up in no time!<br><br><strong>Under Eye Dark Circles</strong><br>Here is a beauty tip from way back.... For under eye circles and wrinkles, mix a drop or two of honey with 2-3 drops of fresh lemon juice. Apply to the area under the eye. I honestly can not remember how long to leave this solution on, but I leave it on for about 15 min. to 1/2 hour and it seems to work.<br><br><strong>Highlight Your Hair!</strong><br>"When trying to highlight your hair, you can put one half teaspoon of iodine in a spray bottle of water, spray all over your hair, and then do your outside yard work on a sunny day. By the end of the day, your highlights will be very noticeable."<br><br><strong>Curly Lashes</strong><br>"To get long curly lashes, buy an eyelash curler at the drug store. They're only a couple of bucks. Before curling, use your blow dryer to "heat up" the curler. The results are great!"<br><br><strong>Shine Stopper!</strong><br>Using a clean makeup brush, brush your face with pure lemon juice. Let it stand for 5 minutes then rinse. Do this in the evening before bed since the citric acid may cause temporary redness. Lemon juice contains astringent and antiseptic properties that will get rid of the excess perspiration and unwanted shine from high humidity (that also causes oil glands to work over time!). Another shine stopper tip: In a cup, combine 10 drops of lemon juice with one half cup of water. Saturate a cotton ball with mixture and dab over clean skin. Do not rinse.<br><br><strong>Slenderize A Round Face</strong><br>To make your face appear thinner: Sweep bronzer over temples, cheekbones and under chin using a fluffy brush. Highlight forehead, bridge of nose, cheekbones and tip of chin with light powder.<br><br><strong><br>Slimmer Legs!</strong><br>This seaweed wrap releases water retention and leaves legs looking their sleekest! Soak legs in bath of warm water and Epsom salts for 5 minutes. Pat dry. Apply a seaweed mask (there are many to choose from on the market today!). Then wrap legs with plastic wrap and a warm towel. Relax for 15 minutes. Remove towel and plastic wrap and rinse.<br><br><strong><br>Kissable Lips!</strong><br>I have a tip that I use to keep my lips soft and free of dead skin. This tip was given to me years ago and I still use it because it really works! Buy a clean unused toothbrush and apply a dab or two of petroleum jelly to it. Brush lips until dead skin is scrubbed off and rinse with warm water. Works every time!"<br><br>"Take cinnamon oil and dab on lips before you put on your lipstick. You have to test this first! It can irritate some peoples skin. You can also mix cinnamon with your lipstick if it is too strong alone."<br><br><strong>Hair Conditioner</strong><br>Heat up one half cup of mayonnaise and apply to dry unwashed hair. Cover with plastic bag and wait for 15 minutes. Rinse and shampoo thoroughly. Gotta try this one!<br><br><strong>Bye Bye Shampoo Buildup!</strong><br>Here is my tip to get rid of shampoo and conditioner build-up on your hair. Take a tablespoon of baking soda and massage into wet hair, rinse and shampoo as usual. Do this weekly. For a super-duper cleansing, rinse off the baking soda with a few tablespoons of cider vinegar mixed with warm water. It fizzes like crazy and really strips out all of the junk (except the grey!).<br><br><strong>Keep Makeup Fresh</strong><br>After applying makeup, spray mineral water on your face and let dry. Do not wipe. Makeup will stay looking fresh longer.<br><br><strong>Makeup Remover</strong><br>Almond or sesame oil on a cotton ball will do a great job of taking off makeup, including water-proof mascara! Megan from PA wanted to share this tip with us that her mom Tami shared with her: "If you use contact lens solution to remove your eye makeup it works just as good if not better than eye make up remover! Just put it on a cotton swab and well...... you get the point." Thank you both for sharing!<br><br><strong>The Best Moisturizer!</strong><br>Expensive health spas use this treatment! Wash face thoroughly. While your face is still wet, rub in a small amount of petroleum jelly. Continue wetting face until the jelly is spread evenly and doesn't appear greasy. Your gonna love how smooth and soft your face feels! Just remember, it will not stay greasy if you keep adding water alittle at a time!<br><br><strong>Salt Glow Rub</strong><br>This exfoliating scrub will leave your skin soft and glowing. Only the best spas use this special recipe! Mix the juice from 1 lemon with 2 parts coarse salt and 1 part olive oil to make a paste. Step into the shower and massage into body. Turn on the shower and rinse. Pat dry and apply a rich moisturizer.<br><br><strong><br>Silky Soft Hands</strong><br>This is my favorite tip for silky soft hands; Pour a spoonful of honey into the palm of your hand, add 3/4 spoon of sugar. (do this over the sink!) Now massage well into your hands for a few minutes. Sounds yucky, but feels great! Rinse and apply hand lotion. Soft! Also try; Before bed, wash and dry hands in lukewarm water. Slather with petroleum jelly, cover with cotton gloves and go to sleep. In the morning you will have smooth, supple, silky soft hands!<br><br><strong>Silky Soft Legs</strong><br>Mix two Tbs. of petroleum jelly with the contents of one 400 IU vitamin E capsule and massage all over your legs. Slip on cotton sweats and go to bed. In the morning, wash legs with a moisturizing body wash and apply a body lotion. Soft as silk!<br><br><strong>Smudge-proof Eyes</strong><br>To seal eyeliner in place, trace over the line with a powder shadow in a matching shade. Another good tip is to use a fine brush, dip in water then your powdered shadow and then trace over your liner.<br><br><strong>Tooth Whitener</strong><br>Dip a toothbrush in a mashed strawberry and brush vigorously to remove yellowing and stains.<br><br>After brushing with your regular toothpaste, make a paste of 1 tbsp of baking soda and a few drops of lemon juice and brush again. It tastes horrible but just think white teeth! You should start to see a change in a week.<br><br><strong>Wrinkle Remover</strong><br>Green Thompson seedless grapes! No kidding! It's one of the ingredients in those big time expensive wrinkle creams. All ya do is cut a grape in half and gently crush it on your face and neck. Make sure that you get the "crows-feet" and the lines around your mouth. Leave it on for twenty minutes or so and rinse with tepid water and pat dry. Repeat every day and before you know it... those nasty old lines will be hard to find!! While you are at it, drink at least 8 glasses of water daily. And... eat veggies rich in Vitamin A, such as carrots, celery and spinach. Also, get 8 hours of sleep every night.<br><br>Soak cotton pads in orange juice and put them over the eyes for one half hour to get rid of wrinkles."<br><br><strong>Zit Zappers!</strong><br>Dab with lemon juice a few times a day. Or dab some white non-gel toothpaste on it. My friends and I swear by the toothpaste. It works wonders. Or, try this; Saturate a tea bag in warm water and press on affected area for 5 minutes then rinse.<br><br>Here's a cheap and safe alternative to popping pimples (inevitably leading to scarring)! Soak a cotton ball in warm salt water and hold it on the blemish for 3-4 minutes, the nasty white part will dissolve!<br><br>I've been using the following, very inexpensive, solution for pimples for at least ten years and it always works! Insert a Q-tip into a bottle of "Camphor Spirit", which you can obtain from any pharmacy, and press the Q-tip on the pimple. It may burn a bit. Repeat as often as necessary. It will prevent the pimple from "blossoming". Try it, you'll love it!"<br><br>"Calamine Lotion the same stuff for Chicken Pox works great on blemishes."<br><br>[/b]</div>
