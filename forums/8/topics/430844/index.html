              <p>Let me just make an example based on the show "secret garden" from Channel U</p>
              <p>There are one bully who was abuse by his mother and another one with austism. The bully attcked an lady and as he escape, he make the one with austism to carry the lady handbag and instructed him : "If you get caught, just mention the handbag is snatched by me and I deserved it" and which the austism boy obediently told the police. If not for the help of Dr "Beng", this innocent mental ill boy would be sentenced to prison for nothing while the real culprit get away.</p>
              <p>Similarly had this strike you that if death sentence is passed, an life cannot be brought back again, Also if the suspect is wrongly asscused and time had given him an chance to prove his innocent, which one would be better ?</p>

              <p>You just contradicted yourself.</p>
              <p>Motive is and should be considered.</p>
              <p><em>Unless the person accidentally kill someone or kill the person
                                      out of self defence than we can give the person a short jail
                                      sentence.</em></p>
              <p>Whats the bias with people being mentally ill ? Short jail sentence lol ? And killing a person out of self defence has no motive ? So what is motive</p>
