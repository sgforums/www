              <p>Lol ? Theres always a example where in a case of self defence need not kill him. But instead he did. And the case is refered as self-defence. So is he evil ? Is he more evil than the mentally ill evil ?</p>

              <p>Yes. You have to understand what is                         kleptomania first. Kleptomaniacs steal things without logic. Things that is being stolen has no necessary value or motive.</p>
              <p>These people can steal the price tag, the box that is supposed to contain the diamond ring, instead of the ring itself. The vase of flower that is for decoration instead of the laptops in Courts. This includes simple things such as paper, paperclips, tape, glue, but not from stationary shop. These stolen items are very funny. And normal people dont consider it as stealing also. "Take" is a more proper word.</p>
              <p>Stealing toliet rolls from public toliet, forks and spoons from resturants are not considered the behavior under                         kleptomania either. </p>
