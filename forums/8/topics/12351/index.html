This is a public forum which means open to public... No matter what happened in the past.. it is all in the past... Face the present and the future and stop living in the past...<br><br>bLaCk sHiT: got a few question to ask you<br>1) Since you got only one post.. Why do you care abt what happened in the past??<br><br>2) IF you are one who have been posting in this forum for long time.. WHY create a NEW nick just to post this thread?<br><br>3) How come pointing finger at SGCLUB?? Out to create trouble between the 2 forums??<br><br>4) Who are you?

Even when sgclub was thriving, many of the forumities shifted to other forums like SIngalore to escape the politics. THere is no such thing as crawling back or not. We simply go to places that are free from such politics, where it is a REAL forum. You come in, chat, and generally pass your time happily.
