Furthermore, this morning they shut down the email server completely.<br><br>As I was leaving, I deliberately walked past the reporters who were waiting there for long long time.  I told them not to show my face on tv (I hope they keep their promise!!!).  I told them the truth, ie despite the retrenchment, the company is still hiring.  When asked whether we all saw this coming, I said yes, cuz the management has been talking about it since last Dec.  Yes, many staff (not including myself though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ) have had sleepless nights.  This has been dragging for too long.<br><br>When asked what my plans are, I said look for a new job and definitely get higher pay than the zoo.  Yes!  Zoo's pay is really really low.  That is way I begged my boss to let me have the retrenchment money --&gt; as a compensation for me for getting a clerk's pay and doing a senior exec job.  I'm not exaggerating, cuz when I was interviewed for this job, the interviewer said that the zoo is a non-profit orgn, cannot pay the staff blah blah blah.<br><br>I told the reporters that I was supposed to do a lot of things for some clients and I was not given the time to handover.  Good good good.  Hope later the client complain.  Worst still.  One of the client is SPH...hahaha.<br><br>I hope the reporters find out that those newly hired staff were all previously from Mcdonalds.  The newly appointed chairman is the ex boss of McD.  So what does this tell us?<br></div></blockquote>so u are the 1 saying that the management has been talking abt it frm nov ah ?</div>
