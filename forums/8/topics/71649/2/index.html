We have asked all the older animals to consider voluntary early retirements since they are less productive. For example, Ah Meng consumes more food than a young orang utan and is less energetic. She sometimes even eats up visitorsÂ’ breakfasts. Also, we have so many orang utans, we can afford to cut down on the duplication.Â”<br><br>The Zoo is also tightening up its management of animals who are not performing.<br><br>Talkingcock understands that the two Â“greenÂ” polar bears that developed fur fungi have been given warning letters for exceeding their annual sick leave quota.<br><br>The Zoo has also exiled one of the tigers back to Malaysia, accused of trying to incite the animals to establish a union. Â“Foreign-born animals are always a problem in the Zoo because their loyalties are questionable. They simply do not have our countryÂ’s interests in mind. They also tend to be less obedient than locally bred animals.Â”<br><br>The restructuring seems to be affecting the morale of the animals. Visitors complained that recently, the animals appear Â“sian-sianÂ” in their enclosures. The elephants seem to be moving slower than usual. The lions seemed resigned to their fate and are spending all their time lying in the sun. Even a 3-hour pep talk by SM last week failed to raise spirits. Rumour has it that the Zoo has threatened that if they donÂ’t pull up their socks, the Zoo will bring in animal robots to take their places.<br><br>Hong Bao, the daughter of Ah Meng, told TalkingCock using sign language that she is Â“very concernedÂ”. Â“I joined the zoo because I thought, hey, this is civil service Â– I can just laze around whole day and lead a secure life. Beats going out and fending for myself in the Johor forests, right? Now things are different. For example, my bananas ration is now tied to the number of visitors at my enclosure Â– part of what management calls Â‘performance-based compensationÂ’. Now I have to do monkey business in order to attract attention. Damn siong.Â”<br><br>Mr Boh Kang Cho was confident that with retraining, the animals will adapt to new uses.<br><br>He said that for example, the Ministry of Community Development and Sports has already shown interest in hiring and retraining Ah Meng, mother of numerous orang utans, to be the ambassador of their campaign to encourage Singaporeans to have more children. The Ministry of Manpower is retraining monkeys to clean the windows of HDB flats, a chore now deemed too dangerous for maids.<br><br>Mr Boh warned that the animals have to take responsibility for their fate. The zoo has already received numerous requests from Chinese restaurants and medicine shops to purchase Â‘redundantÂ’ animals - bears, tigers, antelopes and rhinos are the most popular.<br><br>Â© http://www.TalkingCock.com 2001-2003.

From one zoo to another so it is a low learning curve. She is expected to sail through the course as good breakfasts is after all as integral a factor in getting the job done in both old and new positions.<br><br>Lions - what better redeployment of the national symbol than to have them chained next to the goal posts of the Singaporean football team? Any player who slacks on the field gets eaten up immediately. There is now extra incentive to not embarrass the country at<br>the international matches. Sending the ball skywards one metre from the goal posts? Makan. Drop the ball when it is already in the goalie's hand only to have it sent into the net by the other team. Extra fast makan. Goal 2010? Hell, yeah!<br><br>Tigers - reassigned to Asia Pacific Brewery as Auditor General and Auditor General at large. Any punk who tries to embezzle money again will be, yep you guessed it, eaten alive. This service can be outsourced to any company who suspects their accountants are slyly cooking the books. Give the man a tiger takes on a whole new meaning.<br><br>Hippopotamus - Minister for Manpower. Why? Easy. Sits there and opens his big mouth all day long. Why look for one in a hospital when there was a natural talent in the zoo escapes us.<br><br>Giraffes - Presidents of Singapore so that they can oversee the national reserves. We hope we got this one right. That's all there is to the job, right? Overseeing only and nothing else, right?<br><br>Snakes and Pythons - outsourced to Temasek Holdings. These guys can really swallow. And the pythons will have our money in a death grip.<br><br>Pandas - the solution to the world's most expensive parliament lies within this group. Surprised you , didn't we? No, we don't think monkeys cut it. They may be paid peanuts but they are too noisy. Docile and non-confrontational, pandas are the perfect Singaporean parliamentarians. Sure winners during elections, too. Who can say no to a panda? Problem is there isn't any in Singapore and not enough in the world to form a GRC. We have standards, you know.<br><br>Polar bears - sign on with SAF as Rangers. They have proven abilities to blend in with the vegetation. Missions to Malaysia are bound to succeed. Besides, they can survive any water torture SAF instructors throw at them.<br><br>Monkeys - GLCs directors. Can't see no difference. And on top of that, you can pay them peanuts.<br><br>Elephants - NTUC Union Chiefs and sagely Senior Ministers. Because they have really long noses.<br><br>Â© http://www.TalkingCock.com 2001-2003.

            <div class='col-md body'>ok.  now can talk about it..hehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>This afternoon the selected zoo staff were summoned to a classroom, where the staff were given a cheque and a bag.<br><br>No chance to do handover at all as the staff have to leave almost immediately.  Furthermore, this morning they shut down the email server completely.<br><br>As I was leaving, I deliberately walked past the reporters who were waiting there for long long time.  I told them not to show my face on tv (I hope they keep their promise!!!).  I told them the truth, ie despite the retrenchment, the company is still hiring.  When asked whether we all saw this coming, I said yes, cuz the management has been talking about it since last Dec.  Yes, many staff (not including myself though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ) have had sleepless nights.  This has been dragging for too long.<br><br>When asked what my plans are, I said look for a new job and definitely get higher pay than the zoo.  Yes!  Zoo's pay is really really low.  That is way I begged my boss to let me have the retrenchment money --&gt; as a compensation for me for getting a clerk's pay and doing a senior exec job.  I'm not exaggerating, cuz when I was interviewed for this job, the interviewer said that the zoo is a non-profit orgn, cannot pay the staff blah blah blah.<br><br>I told the reporters that I was supposed to do a lot of things for some clients and I was not given the time to handover.  Good good good.  Hope later the client complain.  Worst still.  One of the client is SPH...hahaha.<br><br>I hope the reporters find out that those newly hired staff were all previously from Mcdonalds.  The newly appointed chairman is the ex boss of McD.  So what does this tell us?<br></div>
