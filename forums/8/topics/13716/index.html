            <div class='col-md body'>I think this might be very interesting to post it openly for discussion:<br><br>there were reports saying that Neil Armstrong didnt really landed on moon. These reports claimed that the moon landing project were faked by US to convince the world their outperformance against USSR in space research during the 1950s and 1960s.<br><br>And do you know that the Roswell incident of UFO crashing onto Earth in 1957 was a Hoax done by the US government?<br>They already admitted it was hoax some years ago through media and TV.<br><br>Below are some of the websites suspecting that the whole moon landing project was another hoax done to win the Space Race against USSR.<br><br><a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast23feb_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast23feb_2.htm</a>   <a href="http://www.empusa.clara.net/lunar/lunar1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.empusa.clara.net/lunar/lunar1.htm</a>   <a href="http://www.stats.org/newsletters/0104/moon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.stats.org/newsletters/0104/moon.htm</a>   <a href="http://science.krishna.org/Articles/2000/12/00227.html" rel="nofollow">http://science.krishna.org/Articles/2000/12/00227.html</a>   <a href="http://www.thekeyboard.org.uk/Moon%20landings" rel="nofollow">http://www.thekeyboard.org.uk/Moon%20landings</a>   <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a951117.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a951117.html</a>   <a href="http://www.ramjet.co.uk/apollo/conspiracy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ramjet.co.uk/apollo/conspiracy.html</a>  <a href="http://www.jimloy.com/pseudo/apollo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimloy.com/pseudo/apollo.htm</a>  <a href="http://www.apfn.org/apfn/moon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.apfn.org/apfn/moon.htm</a>  <a href="http://www2.gasou.edu/student/gsi27193/WebProject.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www2.gasou.edu/student/gsi27193/WebProject.htm</a>  <a href="http://www21.brinkster.com/cagape/features/moonlanding/" rel="nofollow">http://www21.brinkster.com/cagape/features/moonlanding/</a><br><br>If you search the web, there are many more of these websites.<br>And there are proofs and many evidences there proved the "moon landing" was set up in a studio-room!<br><br>Have you ever wonder why they visited moon only once and it was nearly half a century since the first visit and now no more?<br>I wonder why. I thought researches have to be done many times on the same place even though it's just a moon.<br>Worse still, now so few man are flying out of space, and they never even touch down on any planets or any stars.<br><br>if they are searching for extra-terrestrial life, they should have researched more on the moon as the first step to begin with. How could they just claim that there's no water on moon and just deny that there are lifeforms on the Moon and never go back there again since they have only landed in one small corner of the moon?? That is not the professional way of space research!<br><br>If they claimed that Alien might have visited Earth thousands of years ago(evidences like pyramids, Huge Statues in Easter island ), then surely they should search for traces which Aliens might have left behind when they bypass the moon?<br><br>What's more if Aliens were to visit Earth and they landed in the desert by accident and they claimed that Earth has no life because there is no water so they fly back home and never come back to Earth again - Do you think they are stupid or unprofessional?<br><br>I wonder if the moon landing project was an ultimate hoax to the world.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 20 February 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok, here's my argument about this. i believe they never landed on the moon. i shan't argue about pictures or things i can't prove, just like talking about the presence or absence of a God. we can go on and on and argue and counter-argue and it won't get us anywhere. i haven't seen a god, but it doesn't mean he's not there.<br><br>my argument: i downloaded the audio transcript of the broadcast of "earth to moon" where Houston was communicating with the astronauts as they were landing. the distance of the moon to earth is approximately over 330,000km. electromagnetic transmission occurs at the speed of light which is 290,000km per second. therefore, it would take over 2 seconds for the astronauts on the moon to reply to Houston, and the recording on earth to be broadcast to the world. after listening to the transcript, there are some in which there was a reply in around 1 second or less. i don't think that could have been possible, unless the astronauts started replying before Houston's message had been completed. thus, my conclusion is that, the audio was not for real.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just compare with those 'overseas live' interviews and u will realise it still takes them some time to react to the questions posed.<br><br>If it was really just like wat chokky said (replied within 2 sec), then it's <strong>really</strong> fishy.<br><br>Actually, I've read about this moon-landing hoax quite some time back. To be fair, there were many websites that tried to explain or answer the doubts.<br><br>Personally, I have doubts about the moon-landing. Imagine we could send a man to the moon nearly 40 years ago, and since then there isnt any more such 'exploration'. Some may think that it is actually not necessary to send ppl, use 'robots' instead, but I still feel it's fishy, considering how much technology have evolved since then. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Conspiracy theories....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Not all "no talk" periods were edited, those which were not too long were left as is. Down in Mission Control, there is a man who monitors in real time the transmissions. Everything goes through him before reaching the ears of the World.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find that the theories put forth by the skeptics are extremely frail. ALL of their theories can be debunked by scientific methods. How do you explain Moonrocks then? The rocks had composites which cannot be found on the Earth, and thousands of scientists worldwide had examined them.<br><br><a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast23feb_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast23feb_2.htm</a><br><a href="http://www.redzero.demon.co.uk/moonhoax/" rel="nofollow">http://www.redzero.demon.co.uk/moonhoax/</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Radio<br>There's no pause in the conversations between the Astronauts and those on earth. If they were on the moon, wouldn't there would be a lag just like those on earth using satellite connections?<br><br>This is very true. That's why you can hear a lag. Radio waves travel at the speed of light, but the moon is far enough away for this to take a noticeable amount of time. Roughly 1.2 seconds. This means that an Astronaut would have to wait 2.4 seconds before getting a response from mission control.<br><br>So why can't we always hear this gap of 2.4 seconds?<br><br>All recordings of radio conversations of the Apollo missions were made on Earth. This means that we hear things as if we were standing beside the mission controller. The Astronaut's message comes in and the mission controller immediately responds. There is no lag because we are not aware of the 1.2 seconds it has taken the message to reach Earth, nor do we have to wait the 1.2 seconds it will take the response to reach the moon before we hear it. Obviously the reverse is true if the mission controller is asking the Astronaut something. In this case we have to wait for the request to reach the Astronaut and then for the answer to get back. So it's the Astronaut's turn to experience no lag.<br><br>The recordings and transcripts of conversations with the Moon show a mixture of this; sometimes a full 2.4 second gap, sometimes none at all.<br><br>-http://www.redzero.demon.co.uk/moonhoax/</div>
