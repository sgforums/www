And as you are probably aware, I've attempted to explain those views numerous times in other posts.<br><br>The problem is, I find that a lot of people don't know what they believe. And even if they know why they believe, they don't know why they believe it. And that's how the kowpeh kowbu-ing about whether god exists comes about.<br><br>If someone tells me "belief is a gift. God chooses those who will be saved." The person believes I am not chosen and I will go to hell. I can accept that view. I disagree with it but I can accept it. I also expect that person to understand why there's no reason for me to share that view.<br><br>If someone tells me "I opened my heart and God blessed me by coming into my life." I can accept that. But I also expect that person accept that god didn't come into mine, and I have no reason to feel the same way."<br><br>But when someone tells me, "You must believe in God." I have to ask why? And if the answer is "because the bible is evidence of God," I'll address the issue of why the person feels that the bible is evidence of god.<br><br>I am amused when people ask me, "Why are you angry with God?"<br><br>I am amused when people tell me, "you know there's a god. But you just choose not to believe in him because you don't want to face up to your sins."<br><br>I'm amused when people tell me that they believe in creationism when they don't even know which version of creationism they believe in.<br><br>I'm amused when people tell me "I don't know what I know, I just know."<br><br>So I simply point out the inconsistencies and logical fallacies in a person's argument. Often, because of the arguments presented, the topic spills into a discussion of the nature and existence of god. But really, the main objective is just to help people know what they believe so they can understand why others may not believe the same.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's no such thing as satanic forces, every people has a fundamental darkness inside them, who they themselves know it. It's ultimately up to them to overcome it. Seeking help from external sources like Exorcists (who "OOH!!! AAH!!! in the name of blah blah blah blah blah), actually in fact are running away from their own problems &amp; not dare to face reality.</div>

Why ? cuz theres just too many stories from people bout thhere is this thing around us. even my company has this thing. Ppl who have seen this thing surely believe in this thing, Ppl who never see this at all , perhaps due to high luck wont see this till their death.<br><br>But God? Till now mayb only few or mayb none see the God at all.<br><br>but man, i just duno to believe or not in God. I rather depend on myself how to handle any problem or how to improve myself than asking for God's bless.<br><br>For me, it is we who bless ourself.
