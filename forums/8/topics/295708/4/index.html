            <div class='col-md body'>I try to restrain myself from commenting but i just can't as I've seen a considerable number of these posts popping up in the forums.<br><br>First, today, not only the kids have good life but their parents have too. I just don't understand what the thread starter wants. Our society has progressed to a much higher level of economic prosperity, what can you expect? With money, you certainly cannot expect people to live like the older days where everyone is poor and just trying to scrape through. We should be happy that more and more people are using branded expensive goods and eating fulfilling meals.<br><br>However, I have to agree that this has caused some social problems. With this, there is sort of a visible widening income gap that we see. Even in the midst of the many well off people in Singapore, there are those who are still poor and trying to cope. This is disturbing.<br><br>Also, it has to be agreed that some parents are indeed over-pampering their children. However, I am sure that children being able to spend and enjoy life more is not the root of the problem to them using swear phrases and being rude. This problem from my perspective is caused by influence from friends and of course the mass media. When I say the mass media, I mean the western influence. Their movies and shows are glittering with unfavorable words and phrases which is taken as "cool" and "in" for Singaporean students.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We shouldn't impose our own story and experiences on the new age of children. They experience differently from us. Their own stories and ours are different simply because we leave in different times and have seen, hear, feel, tasted and smell differently.<br><br>Whether we feel lucky is much more dependent on how we have experienced before and now. People who feel as what the poster said speaks out from their own experiences and will not be able to bridge the gap with the newer generation of people.</div>
