            <div class='col-md body'><br>I meet this girl for a date last night and she simply blew my mind. As we all know, last night was a rainy day and when we meet up outside IVOX in the evening, the both of us was slightly wet. Slightly would be an understatement. However, that did not deter us from enjoying our dinner and a nice quiet game of scrabble later. It sure was a unique experience, where I had to spent a dinner thinking about words instead of thinking sweet nothings to flirt with. The crux of this thread is to come later...<br><br>We finished our dinner cum intellectual sparring late into the night and she finally conceded that I am the winner, abet unwillingly over some technical mishap that propel me in front of her by 1 point. When we came out of the restaurant, she was shivering slightly. We made our way to Cityhall where we browse through the collection of boutiques. As it was close to the witching hours, most shops have long switched off their lights...except for one. We entered into it and she takes her picks among the selections, again, another deja vu experience.<br><br>The shop shut it's door while we are still shopping but the girl assured us that we can shop to our hearts content before leaving as they have to settle some stock checking. We were like some VIPs in which we have the whole place to ourselves. My date was naturally very excited and she waltzes around, trying to her heart's content.<br><br>"james?"<br>"Yeah, whatÂ’s up?" I approached the dressing room when she called out to me<br>"How do I looked?" she giggled at me as she stepped out of the dressing room.<br>She was wearing a low velvet pants and a nice sexy black mid-driff.<br>"If you can be eaten, I would have 3 helping of that!!!" I remarked!<br>She laughed and just as she was about to go back in and change, my eyes happened upon a brown pullover.<br>"Say, why don't you try that as well?" I handed the pullover to her<br>"Why my dearest james, since when have I became your personal model?" she laughed even more coquettishly. Snatching the pullover from me, she went right back in.<br><br>"Come and feast your eyes upon your model my dearest friend!" she tata as she stepped out.<br>"So how do I look now?" she pouted at me as she turn left and right, looking at the full-length mirror beside her.<br>There she was, in a brown pullover with a black velvet pants. To top it off, she was wearing a pair of boots, with her shiny long dark hair falling along side carelessly among the woollen pullover. She sashayed towards me and put her finger on my wide-open mouth.<br>"Thanks for the compliment james." she whispered<br>"But I didn't even said anything?!?!" I stammered<br>"Oh you don't have to. I can see all that from your eyes and bodily expression." she lowered her eyes to my pelvis area and winked at me.<br><br>In the end, I offered to pay for both her clothes and although she refuses, I insisted upon it.<br>"But that's too expensive. You should be spending on yourself instead!" she ticked me off.<br>"Yeah, but to me..." I stopped and looked at her critically<br>"It was well spent money. The most in fact. Nothing pleases me more than to have such a pretty girl beside me. Actually, it would be even more marvellous if you can link your arms around me as we walk." I said wishfully.<br>"Oh james, you know I can't...I am..." she mentioned with an ever flushing face<br>"Oh I know, you don't have to say it out loud." I answered for her<br>"After all, we are allowed to dreams. And let this dream continued as long as the night last." I said with a sigh.<br><br>Throughout the whole night, none of us open our mouth. We made our way to the cinema, walking alongside one another, ever so close and yet so far. And itÂ’s just me thinking about her and her thinking about my words.<br><br>"Love belongs to Desire, and Desire is always cruel..." - Neil Gaiman<br><br>------------------<br>The heartless and souless fool.</div>
