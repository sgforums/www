            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Listed are some WELL known facts about the "detainees" in Camp X-Ray.<br><br>Please read and tell me what U think. World Mop up and several Camp X-Rays?<br><br>After all they are in your back yard too.<br><br>1. 'Brutalised, often tortured, we ask them in a friendly and Islamic way<br>to confess their crimes,' he explained to us. 'If they do not confess, then we use force.'<br><br>2. Handing-over of prisoners of war to a third party that is not a party<br>to the war, which America insists implausibly to the International Committee<br>for the Red Cross that it is not; in other words, the US claims that it is<br>merely assisting the anti-Taliban forces rather than prosecuting a war<br><br>3. These men are drugged and bound and then flown out of the country to<br>an island camp, where lawyers are appointed for them but where the normal<br>guarantees of defendants' rights do not apply.<br><br>4. These are men who fought without uniforms. They bore their weapons in<br>secret for a criminal organisation without a formal legal command<br><br>5. If the prisoners are not covered by the 'laws of war', then they are<br>ordinary criminals. And the rights of ordinary - and even extraordinary<br>- criminals are guaranteed by the US Constitution.<br><br>6. They are criminals, 'unlawful combatants', and therefore not covered<br>by the protections of the Geneva Conventions.<br><br>How should they be handled ???<br><br>Is USA correct?<br><br>Too BAD, USA want them, USA got em, don't stand in USA way.<br><br>It's time to clean up the World, screw the regulor LAWS.</div>

Similarly He made the world with moral/spiritual laws as well, such as that the disobedience of which will prove eternally costly. Therefore, let the God who so loved the world that He gave us His only begotten son, Jesus Christ, heal your hurts in the way that He knows best. While it may not be in your ways, trust that He who made you and I, knows the best way, His way.
