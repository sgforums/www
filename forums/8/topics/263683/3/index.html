            <div class='col-md body'>Chris Benoit WikiPedia Mystery [/b]<br><br>The Fox News Channel is reporting that an investigation has been launched regarding an entry made on Wikipedia that apparently noted the death of Nancy Benoit fourteen hours before the Benoit family was discovered deceased in their Fayetteville, GA home. Investigators want to know who made that entry, and there is speculation that it could have been Chris Benoit himself. Benoit sent strange text messages to friends and John Laurinaitis prior to the wrestler taking his own life.<br><br>Fox News is reporting that Chris Benoit's profile entry on the Wikipedia website was changed to note that he missed the WWE Vengeance pay-per-view, "due to personal issues, stemming from the death of his wife Nancy" 14 hours before the Benoit family was found dead.<br><br>The edit was made a minute past midnight Eastern Time. It was an anonymous edit from the IP address 69.120.111.23 using the Internet service provider Optimum Online. The IP was traced to a (so far) anonymous user originating in Stamford, CT, which of course is the headquarters of World Wrestling Entertainment. Then just one hour later after the first edit reversion, another anonymous edit by 125.63.148.173 using unwiredAustralia.com.au, a wireless Internet service provider, was made adding about the aforementioned personal issues: "which according to several pro wrestling websites is attributed to the passing of Benoit's wife, Nancy." That edit was reverted just under 20 minutes later, with the comment: "Saying 'several pro wrestling websites' is still not reliable information." Further investigation shows that the IP address used to make the first edit is located in Connecticut, but the IP address is not linked to any computers or servers used by the WWE. The second edit was made by a computer in Australia from a wireless network.<br><br>Confession From Mystery Poster Claim Concidence [/b]<br><br>The following is from Wikipedia.com:<br><br>The anonymous individual responsible for suggesting, 14 hours before police discovered the body, that WWE wrestler Chris Benoit's wife was dead is confessing, saying his/her comment was a "terrible coincidence."<br><br>The anonymous editor left a lengthy apology to the Wikimedia community, explaining, "I hope this puts an end to this speculation that someone knew about the tragedy before it was discovered."<br><br>Below is the full, unedited apology:<br><br>"... Hey everyone. I am here to talk about the wikipedia comment that was left by myself. I just want to say that it was an incredible coincidence. Last weekend, I had heard about Chris Benoit no showing Vengeance because of a family emergency, and I had heard rumors about why that was. I was reading rumors and speculation about this matter online, and one of them included that his wife may have passed away, and I did the wrong thing by posting it on wikipedia to spite there being no evidence. I posted my speculation on the situation at the time and I am deeply sorry about this, and I was just as shocked as everyone when I heard that this actually would happen in real life. It is one of those things that just turned into a huge coincidence. That night I found out that what I posted, ended up actually happening, a 1 in 10,000 chance of happening, or so I thought. I was beyond wrong for posting wrongful information, and I am sorry to everyone for this. I just want everyone to know it was stupid of me, and I will never do anything like this again. I just posted something that was at that time a piece of wrong unsourced information that is typical on wikipedia, as it is done all the time.<br><br>Nonetheless, I feel incredibly bad for all the attention this got because of the fact that what I said turned out to be the truth. Like I said it was just a major coincidence, and I will never vandalize anything on wikipedia or post wrongful information. I've learned from this experience. I just can't believe what I wrote was actually the case, I've remained stunned and saddened over it.<br><br>I wish not to reveal my identity so I can keep me and my family out of this since they have nothing to do with anything. I am not connected to WWE or Benoit at all in anyway. I am from Stamford as the IP address shows, and I am just an everyday individual who posted a wrongful remark at the time that received so much attention because it turned out to actually happen. I will say again I didn't know anything about the Benoit tragedy, it was a terrible coincidence that I never saw coming.<br><br>I hope this puts an end to this speculation that someone knew about the tragedy before it was discovered. It was just a rumor that I had heard about from other people online who were speculating what the family emergency Chris was attending to. I made a big mistake by posting this comment on his page, since all we had were what we thought was going on and nothing about what actually was going on yet, and sadly what happened turned out to be my speculation at the time. I assumed wiki would edit out my information, which they did, so thats why I didn't go back to edit it out myself.<br><br>I know I keep repeating it but I feel terrible about the mainstream coverage this has received, since it was only a huge coincidence and a terrible event that should of never happened. I am not sure how to react, as hearing about my message becoming a huge part of the Benoit slayings made me feel terrible as everyone believes that it is connected to the tragedy, but it was just an awful coincidence. That is all I have to say, I will never post anything here again unless it is pure fact, no spam nothing like that. Thank you, and let this end this chapter of the Benoit story, and hopefully one day we will find out why this tragedy ever actually happened."<br><br>Investigators Not Convinced [/b]<br><br>Investigators seized computers believed to belong to the individual who posted a Wikipedia entry late Sunday night stating that Nancy Benoit had died some 13 hours before she was discovered deceased in her home. "It is unbelievable what a hindrance this has put on our investigation. We've got to put a lot of effort and time into working to prove or disprove that someone put up a hoax situation or that somebody was conceiving the death from out of state," Lt. Tommy Pope told ABC News.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Debra (formerly of WCW and WWE), the ex-wife of Steve Austin and Â“SuperstarÂ” Billy Graham were interviewed on Fox New ChannelÂ’s Â“Hannity and Colmes.Â”<br><br>Debra Marshall<br><br>Stone ColdÂ” Steve AustinÂ’s ex-wife Debra  spoke on the FOX 31 web site about the Benoit family tragedy. Â“Domestic and drug abuse is out of hand in the WWE and something needs to be done about it,Â” commented Williams, who also claimed that she witnessed Austin use steroids. Â“If only I had spoken up sooner, maybe Nancy and her little boy would be alive today ... That's why I'm going public now. Something has to change!Â” A victim of domestic violence in 2002 by Austin, Debra told the web site that she filed for a restraining order from Austin after a third incident between the couple. Debra alleged in the web site that Austin forced her to write a letter to the courts, ending the restraining order. Debra later consented to a gag order regarding the matter<br><br>- Debra said Austin took steroids, and she saw him use them.<br><br>- She said the wrestling industry is a hush hush business, and people donÂ’t talk about this topic openly.<br><br>- She attributes AustinÂ’s domestic abuse on her to steroid abuse.<br><br>- Marshall said she thought the last time she was attacked by Austin, she was going to die. It was Â‘roidÂ’ rage in her opinion, and he had been drinking.<br><br>- She said she showed up to work with bruises, but nobody said anything because Austin made millions for the company.<br><br>- She said if she had spoken up years ago, maybe Nancy and Daniel would be alive today.<br><br>- She said WWE told her not say anything about the domestic abuse.<br><br>- She said WWE is deflecting the heat about Â‘roidÂ’ rage.<br><br>- Marshall said that Graham has never been on the end of someone being abused by somebody on steroids.<br><br>Â“SuperstarÂ” Billy Graham<br><br>- Graham said WWE is not responsible for the Benoit tragedy, as the San Francisco Giants would not be responsible if Barry Bonds had a Â‘roidÂ’ rage.<br><br>- He said WWE isnÂ’t a baby sister, and wrestlers must be responsible for their own actions.<br><br>- Graham wondered if there were pain killers, sleeping pills, anti-depressants, etc. in the home, as the media only asked if steroids were found.<br><br>- Graham said his wife Valerie has seen some of his past rages.<br><br>- Graham said Benoit passed a WWE drug test in April for steroids, but has no doubt that Benoit has used steroids in the past.<br><br>Chris Jericho<br><br>- Y2J characterized the Benoit case as a tale of two cities. Jericho said Benoit was his mentor, and one of his best friends. Y2J said he had told Benoit he loved him.<br><br>- Â“I think it goes a lot deeper than that,Â” said Jericho when asked about steroid being a factor.<br><br>- Y2J never discussed his sonÂ’s condition. Jericho said Benoit was a quiet person. Jericho said he wouldnÂ’t be surprised if BenoitÂ’s parents never knew of DanielÂ’s condition.<br><br>- Jericho said when he learned of DanielÂ’s fragile X syndrome condition, it made sense since the young Benoit had the symptoms such as lack of social skills, flapping of the hands, being hyper, having trouble focusing, ADHD, having a bigger head with smaller ears, etc. Previously, Jericho thought Daniel was naturally withdrawn like Benoit.<br><br>- Â“fabrication,Â” said Y2J of reports that Benoit was distraught about being demoted to the ECW brand. Jericho said Benoit was on the verge of winning of the ECW title, and would have been a coach/mentor in WWEÂ’s third brand.<br><br>- Jericho said Benoit never had a job of outside of the wrestling business.<br><br>- Jericho said BenoitÂ’s son is 14 years old and daughter is 10 or 11, and hanging in there.<br><br>- Jericho suggested that Benoit had a deep dark mental problem that had been building inside him for years.<br><br>- Jericho said Benoit loved his children, and even would fly home just to be with his kids for a few hours.<br><br>- Jericho said the WWE drug testing is random and independently done. He said wrestlers have failed the drug test, and suggested they ask Vince McMahon for the names.<br><br>* On a side note, Nancy Grace brought up the Wikipedia entry, and a suggestion was made that perhaps Benoit had told someone of his wifeÂ’s death.<br><br>* A caller asked about a scenario that Benoit himself was murdered, and the panel insisted that the evidence doesnÂ’t support that theory. A guest suggested that until the toxicology reports come in, that perhaps Nancy Benoit killed Daniel since she was a womanÂ’s wrestler.<br><br>Bret Hart<br><br>- Hart said the Wikipedia tidbit is just another bizarre piece to the puzzle.<br><br>- Hart said he doesnÂ’t know anyone who received a text message from Benoit.<br><br>- Hart doesnÂ’t refute that Benoit was taking testosterone. Hart said he wants to get to the bottom of this like everyone.<br><br>- Hart said there has been a problem with steroid use in wrestling, but noted that WWE is drug testing.<br><br>- Hart said wrestlers took steroids during the Hulk Hogan years to help in recuperating their bodies.<br><br>- Hart said WWE has previously drug tested, but had abandoned testing until the Eddy Guerrero death.<br><br>- He said his best matches were when he was steroid free.<br><br>Bret Hart joined FOX News live tonight speaking about the Benoit tragedy. He says he has known Chris Benoit since he was 11 or 12 years old and that he was a remarkable little kid who was obsessed with wrestling. Just a few years later Benoit learned how to wrestle at around 16 or 17, and his whole life was about wrestling. He says that Benoit was one of the best in the business, and that everyone backstage loved him.<br><br>Hart says that he Benoit had a lot of respect for everyone, and he was a leader in the locker room who carried the ball for the roster and implemented respect in the young wrestlers. Hart says that Benoit has 2 other children, and he has spoken to the oldest of the two who is very confused by the whole thing but is staying strong.<br><br>Bret says that Benoit has likely used steroids throughout his career, but that he thinks when Eddie Guerrero died, WWEÂ’s new drug policy was strong enough to prevent drug abuse in the company. He doesnÂ’t think that steroids played a role in the murders.<br><br>He closes off the interview saying that he never knew anything was wrong with DanielÂ’s health at all, and was shocked to hear the reports about whatever disease it was that he apparently had. He says he never heard Chris ever say anything was wrong with his son.<br><br>Joanie Â“Chyna DollÂ” Laurer<br><br>- Â“IÂ’m disgusted and horrified,Â” said Laurer of the Benoit tragedy.<br><br>- She said WWE has had major read flags over the years.<br><br>- Laurer said she was never drug tested when she was in the WWE.<br><br>- She said she never used steroids, but feared using them as a womenÂ’s wrestler.<br><br>- Â“Very quiet and talent,Â” said of Benoit. She said he was trained in Japan. She said she didnÂ’t know Nancy Benoit.<br><br></div>
