            <div class='col-md body'>John Bradshaw Layfield<br><br>The following is JBL's blog<br><br>I want to say my thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by the horrific events that happened this past weekend with the Benoit family. I have never been this close to a tragedy of this scale, and still have no understanding how this incomprehensible thing could have happened. I knew the family well, and I donÂ’t want to add my speculation to what happened. I just want to say, I wish it never had, I think it is deplorable and my heart is broken that it did.<br><br>Matt Hardy, in his latest blog entry, wrote:<br>I haven't always agreed with every decision Vince McMahon has made, but I do agree with everything he's done dealing with this situation thus far. Out of respect for the sudden death of Benoit's family and his contributions to the business, I think Vince did the right thing by canceling the scheduled Raw. When the decision was made to make Raw a Chris Benoit tribute show, the WWE was only doing what seemed respectful and right at that time. When more information was discovered, the WWE took a different and appropriate stance towards their programming. The ECW and Smackdown shows this week were dedicated to our great fans. Wrestling fans who were grieving and confused over this tragedy needed us, including me, to entertain them. I feel it is my responsibility, as well as my pleasure, to put smiles on people's faces and give them an escape from reality. I know Vince feels that way as well. Chris Benoit was always kind, considerate, and professional when I interacted with him. Like everyone else, I was shocked when everything came out. I can't believe Chris Benoit and his wife and child are dead as I type this. As of now, all of the strange pieces of this puzzle haven't been put together yet. My thoughts and prayers go out to Benoit's other two children as well as the immediate family and friends of the deceased. More than anything, I feel terrible for little Daniel--he was as innocent as any human being could possibly be. This is a terrible and sad tragedy. I am very disappointed with how many media outlets are lapping the entire population of professional wrestlers into this situation. There are many outstanding, wonderful people that do so many great things for the world that I work and wrestle with. It's not fair or accurate. Tell the people you love that you love them, and never lose sight of what's really important in life. We may not ever understand why this tragedy happened, but we have to learn from it. Stay strong--life is too precious and too short. I have much more I want to say about the activities of the last few days. If it's appropriate, I definitely will. Be well my friends, I'll talk to you soon..<br><br>WWE Diva Victoria made the following statement through a MySpace bulletin: Hey All. I had planned ..ing off talking about a recent trip to an arena football game, but I would be remiss not to address the Chris Benoit situation. Everyone who knew anything about wrestling knew of his in-ring contributions. I truly don't know what I can say and not get in trouble with the WWE. Anyone who reads my blogs regularly knows how much I love wrestling, and being part of the WWE. But I think what I have to say is more important. His son, Daniel, came to many shows. We bonded. He a was a cute little boy. What Chris did was selfish and hurtful. I fear that him being a superstar in some way glamorizes the situation. That's not what suicide is. It is selfish and hurtful. As long as you have a breath to breathe, you can make change to improve your life. You can talk to family, or friends, or clergy. And if you're not comfortable with any of them, here are two phone numbers for a Suicide and Crisis Hotline. 1-800-784-2433 (1-800-SUICIDE) or 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). They take calls 24/7. You always have options. Maybe someday I'll be able to forgive Chris, but not today. God Bless Us All, Lisa Marie<br><br>The Following is from Rob Van Dam(RVD) Official Website<br><br>Well, thereÂ’s no need to wait until we have our heads wrapped around this, because I doubt thatÂ’ll happen, so here it is. I know that a monster committed those terrible, unforgivable acts of horror. Just like everyone who knew Chris Benoit, I canÂ’t think of him as a monster. Not Chris.<br><br>Chris was truly a role modelÂ’s role model. You simply had to respect him and admire his focus and unmatched discipline. If I ever got asked a question about who I looked up to the most in the business, you guessed it. ThatÂ’s me sharing a real feeling with you. Not talking about bull shit that I have little interest in, like who would I like most to wrestle with, or whatÂ’s my favorite color, but who I actually looked up to in the dressing room. ItÂ’s Chris Benoit- in the ring and in the dressing room and with his family.<br><br>The last time I talked to Chris, a few weeks ago, he told me how much he respected me for stepping away from the business. His message now comes to me from beyond. He said Â“Some of us donÂ’t know when to get out.Â” I told him that I always held a little contempt for him telling me back in 1992 that I was a dumb-ass for wanting to quit WCW, and mentioned the irony.<br><br>Over the last several years, on overseas tours IÂ’d always see Chris in the gym when the other guys were recovering from the night before. HeÂ’d train hard and sometimes IÂ’d see him allowing young wrestlers to follow his lead and get a guaranteed killer workout. He took pride in what he did and set a great example for others, myself included, to follow.<br><br>How many murderersÂ…baby murderers at thatÂ… are praised so highly by EVERYONE who knew them? This is all so bizarre and new information seems to come out every few hours but I canÂ’t imagine weÂ’ll ever understand what happened here. It appears that Chris took the answers with him. To tell you the honest truth, the easiest thing for me to believe at this moment is that if no frame work was involved, he was taken over by demonic energies with no compassion. I have to believe this is often the case with such inhumane acts.<br><br>Nancy, Daniel and ChrisÂ’ tragic deaths obviously have affected a lot of people. Just remember, thereÂ’s enough hate in this world. Hateful thoughts do not move us in the right direction, so make a conscious effort to remember that. ItÂ’s important now and always.<br><br>Michael Benoit (Chris' father)<br><br>"We have no understanding why it happened. It's going to take us a long time to come to terms with this, and we may never come to terms with it."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Former professional wrestler Lex Luger who lives in the Metro Atlanta area told 11Alive News Wednesday that he is shocked and saddened by the death of Chris Benoit. Police said Benoit killed himself after strangling his wife and smothering his 7-year-old son inside their Fayetteville home this past weekend. Benoit and Luger were aquainted through wrestling but Luger told 11Alive's Valerie Hoff that the two had not seen each other in some time. Luger said alcohol and drugs, including steroids, wreaked havoc on his own life for years before a jail chaplain converted him to Christianity. He said he believes it is possible steroid use played a part in the Benoit family tragedy. "Obviously, they were in his home. Let's face it. There's a pretty good chance he was on them and to discount that they didn't play a role, as far as with his temperament, I'd be lying if I said there wasn't that possibility," Luger told 11Alive's Valerie Hoff. Luger is now a fitness and nutrition coach in Cobb County.<br><br>Jillian Hall is the first WWE star to really speak out against Chris Benoit. She posted a likely controversial blog entry on her MySpace page earlier today regarding the Benoit situation. She said what he did "is completely disgusting and unforgiveable!" However, she pulled it a few hours later. Here is the blog entry that was deleted: Time to Speak. Well, by now the whole world knows of the horrible news that took place this week. With all of the comments and messages from people saying how sorry they are for our loss, I figured I would speak in general. I am 100% in agreeance with WWE and Mr. McMahon on completely erasing all tributes to Chris Benoit. While he had always been nice and polite to me and most of the WWE talent, what he did is completely disgusting and unforgiveable! This man who could have been a legend has demolished his reputation. My heart goes out to Nancy and the adorable Daniel and the family and friends they left behind!<br><br>The following is from Kurt Angle's official website, KurtAngleTNA.com: "Kurt hopes that you will join him in extending condolences and prayers for the survivors of the Chris Benoit Family. This news is very sad for all of us that knew and loved Chris. It is a sad tragedy and we wish the best for the family members that have to deal with this situation and go forward from this."<br><br>RAW color commentator Jim Ross released the following comments concerning the Chris Benoit Tragedy, the media, and this past Monday's RAW on his web site:<br><br>The senseless and tragic death of the 3 people in the double murder-suicide that occurred over the weekend in the BenoitÂ’s home in an Atlanta suburb is a nightmare that one still wants to awake from. For those of us that knew Chris, Nancy, and Daniel on a personal level it is still hard to believe that this horrific event could even occur much less why.<br><br>The last time I saw the three of them together was at Wrestlemania 23 and my wife and I had a long visit with the Benoits and at no time could one detect that there were any issues whatsoever. I even had the occasion to speak at length privately to Nancy and she said things were fine at home. As well as Nancy and I knew each other, if that had not been the case, she would have inferred otherwise I assure you. Like so many others who attended the event on that night, the Benoit family was happy and enjoying the moment.<br><br>So what happened? I do not know. No one knows. We will hopefully know more when the toxicology reports are completed. Until then all anyone has, including the media, is supposition based on speculation. To garner ratings, the media will continue to make this as huge a story as possible, even without all the facts. ThatÂ’s the business in which they are involved. Remember when the media, without all the facts, essentially convicted the Duke Lacrosse team several months ago only to find out that there was no case but in the spirit of ratings and to scoop the competition, the three young men from the Duke Lacrosse team were in essence ruled guilty by the media?<br><br>I know this damn sure isnÂ’t a Duke Lacrosse matter or even remotely close, because two innocent people are dead. But again we hear the media rush to judgment about why and how this horrific chain of events came to pass, but still without the evidence or a valid motive. So then why are three people dead? What caused this irrational and totally uncharacteristic behavior from an individual who hereto for had never demonstrated such tendencies in his workplace, not even once? I donÂ’t know and neither does anyone else until the medical examiner can provide more information and then there will be most likely questions in this matter than may never be answered. I know this, God knows and he will deal with this matter accordingly.<br><br>Plus, some of those who have or are loosely associated with wrestling and who are making statements with little or no background of the facts of this matter or who simply want another 15 minutes are in a large sense pathetic.<br><br>The bottom line is that a woman and a small child are dead of murder and that is an utter shame. That act is inexcusable. The victimÂ’s families need to be held close to our hearts and in our prayers. LetÂ’s consider putting forth as much passion and effort in prayer and reflection as some are in playing amateur detective and wannabe investigative reporters. LetÂ’s spend a little more time with our own families while we are at it, because there are no guarantees about tomorrow and we should covet every day we are blessed to have with our loved ones. I know this, I am going to do all I can to spend more time with family and friends than ever before as this sad situation has slapped me in the face in more ways than one.<br><br>I have had friends who questioned the Benoit-themed Monday Night Raw, especially in light of the events that occurred in the Benoit home. For all those who seem to know all the answers and seemingly like to give the appearance of having 20/20 vision after the fact let me add this; when we went on the air at 7 p.m. central time, all we knew was that the police, at the WWEÂ’s urging, had gone to the home and had found three dead bodies in the Benoit home Monday afternoon. This information was confirmed to us late in the day Monday in Corpus Christi and that was all we knew. There was no talk from the authorities themselves of a double murder suicide that was relayed to us in Texas. The facts came out as the night progressed and more facts are still being released several days after this unspeakable nightmare.<br><br>Obviously, and in my opinion, if the WWE had known the information of what had actually happened in suburban Atlanta over the weekend, a different decision regarding MondayÂ’s three hour retrospective to BenoitÂ’s career would have obviously been different.<br><br>I know that BenoitÂ’s behavior was totally uncharacteristic of him, as I knew him over so many years as he was one of the most professional and polite men with which I have ever been associated. I donÂ’t know why this sickening chain of events happened, but murder, especially taking oneÂ’s own childÂ’s life, is unpardonable. I am anxious to read the results of the toxicology reports as the next curious individual but the bottom line is that 3 people are dead including a mother and her son.<br><br>It is not too late for all of us to change how we deal with our own families and our friends and to honor every day we have the privilege of being on this earth. Remember, we are all only passing through, so take every day as a gift and continue to count all oneÂ’s blessings.<br><br>Today can truly be the first day in the rest of our lives. God Bless all of you that are suffering. Lean on GodÂ…He can handle it.<br>J.R.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The following is from The Toronto Sun:<br><br>Chris Benoit was a "delusional juice freak" who chased the dark side and had trouble distinguishing between his fictional character and reality, says the man who started him out in professional wrestling.<br><br>"The last time I saw him he was in pretty rough shape mentally," said Bruce Hart, son of the legendary Stu Hart. "I didn't know all the details but I knew it wasn't good. I was not at all shocked (by what happened).<br><br>"If I could see and determine that in a few visits, how the hell could they (World Wrestling Entertainment) not have known something was wrong? (In my opinion) I think the WWE needs to re-evaluate what it is doing here."<br><br>Hart will not simplify the shocking murder of Benoit's wife and 7-year-old son or the eventual suicide of the wrestler by attributing it only to steroid usage. But he truly believes that steroid abuse, in combination with delusional behaviour, painkillers and failing health -- "almost all the people we started out with (who did steroids) began breaking down around 40," Hart said -- is a deadly cocktail that needs to be further examined.<br><br>"I've known too many wrestlers who couldn't separate the character they play on television from their real life," said Hart, who has wrestled professionally, promoted wrestling and trained wrestlers all his life.<br><br>"Wrestlers start believing their press clippings and what is said on television. It's like an actor leaving the set but still playing the part. There's a delusional element to this. I've seen it over and over again. Some people can't separate the character from real life, and Chris was one of those people.<br><br>"From my experience, that has been quite prevalent with wrestlers and that becomes exacerbated by steroids, drugs, painkillers and failing health."<br><br>They hadn't seen each other much over the past few years, with Hart still in Calgary and Benoit working the circuit. "We saw each other mostly at funerals," Hart said. "At my brother's (Owen), my dad's, my brother-in-law's (Davey Boy Smith). Not that long ago I was talking to Hillbilly Jim and we were reminiscing a little. I told him I was worried about Chris."<br><br>While the WWE has a drug-testing policy, Hart believes they should bring in psychologists and physicians to evaluate not only their drug-testing procedures but how they treat their athletes, deal with them, and the toll their gimmicks take on the lives of their performers.<br><br>"Imagine if Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux and Mark Messier were all dead in their 40s. Imagine what the reaction would be?" Hart asked. "There would be investigations and more investigations. Wouldn't people want to know what happened and why?"<br><br>Hart was also deeply angered that the WWE aired a three-hour tribute to Benoit on Monday night.<br><br>"I kept hearing 'He was a nice guy, a great guy' and I knew him when he was a kid. But all I know now is he's a murderer," Hart said. In my opinion, "for them to do a tribute show was disgraceful."<br><br>Officials at WWE Canada refused to comment yesterday.<br><br>WWE owner Vince McMahon told NBC Today Show viewers yesterday that "steroids may or may not have had anything to do with this. It's all speculation until the toxicology reports come back."<br><br>Hart did wonder if Benoit had been given an unfavourable medical report, which may been another factor in his violent behaviour. "A lot of the steroid users start getting liver and kidney problems around the age of 40," Hart said. "There are a lot of wrestlers out there who are dead that you never heard about whose bodies broke down. I've known others who had looming health issues and went a little crazy. Maybe this caused him to go off."<br><br>WWE superstar King Booker sat down with KHOU out of Houston, Texas today to talk about the Benoit tragedy. Below are some of the highlights.<br><br>Booker said that he knew Benoit personally and as most people in the business that knew Benoit have said, commented that he had never seen a bad side of Benoit. He noted that he knew BenoitÂ’s wife Nancy and all of his children. He characterized what has happened as completely "out of the norm and unexplainable."<br><br>Booker noted that he wrestled Benoit in 75-100 matches and just recently talked to him for about thirty minutes about the wrestling business. "We're all tired at certain points, we work a lot of hours, but I never saw this side of Chris. I've never seen Chris mad. I've never seen Chris angry. He was always the guy with a lot of positive energy, always pushing the guys."<br><br>He went on to tell a story of a student that came to his wrestling school in Houston, Texas to be trained. Booker said that the student arrived from Illinois, with Â“no way to go backÂ” and had $800 in his pocket. He revealed that the student carried around a photo of Benoit and Eddie Guerrero with him, as he was inspired by them to pursue a career in professional wrestling. "That was just the type of person he was, always encouraging people. He didn't even know this guy, but that's the type of person he was." Booker commented.<br><br>When Â“roid rageÂ” was brought up in the interview, Booker commented, "The media is going to put a spin on it, you know. We know that. WWE knows that. Did the guy last week who murders his wife and kid last week have any form of roid rage? He was a cop. This happens in any form of life. I feel like the human life is a delicate piece of equipment and everyone has their breaking point. We don't know what his breaking point was. You don't know what my point is, I don't know what your point is. We're all human. I just think it was a huge malfunction and whatever it was, we may never know. It's not for us to know. It's out of our hands and with God now."<br><br>Booker said that the wrestling industry is a huge family and heÂ’s cried and wanted to pull his hair out over the tragedy. He revealed that he loved Chris and said that he is mad to see him "go out like this. I'm pissed at him in certain ways. I wish I could just hold him for a second, but it's out of our hands. I'll be there at the funeral and tell him goodbye and hopefully see him on the other side. Hopefully, I'll find out what happened one day."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All these messages were made before the sordid details regarding the Benoit family tragedy came out.<br><br>-- Former WWE Diva Trish Stratus had the following message posted on her official website:<br><br>Trish Remembers Chris Benoit<br><br>We are deeply saddened over the loss of Chris Benoit. Trish had this to say:<br><br>"Chris was an incredible person, wrestler and friend. To the wrestling business he is the epitome of excellence, an example of dedication and passion, someone who lived their dreams. I shared many moments with Chris, I had the privilage of being his tag partner, we shared a Canadian heritage, we even shared a gap tooth, something that we laughed about years ago. Nancy was a beautiful person inside and out, it was always a pleasure to share a conversation with her, her smile lighting up a room. Their son Daniel rounded out a beautiful family. My thoughts are with the family, friends, as well as others whose lives Chris and his family touched. What an amazing life. I am deeply saddened by Chris' passing, and humbled by all that he was able to accomplish."<br><br>-- Shortly after the news broke out, WWE Diva Queen Sharmell sent out the following message on MySpace<br><br>Feel free to leave your thoughts on our forum. Thanks for the well wishes, and voices of support, as we have lost a dear family....<br><br>There are no easy words at a time like this. We have already endured a difficult week, with the death of our beloved "Sensational Sherri", and now with the unfortunate news of the untimely passing of Chris Benoit and his family. My husband and I would first like to extend our thoughts and prayers to entire Benoit family, during this difficult period.<br><br>Chris Benoit was a tenacious rival, a gracious gentleman, and most of all, a wonderful friend. Booker and I had the honor of knowing Chris and his family for more than a decade, and our lives have been enriched ever since. While our hearts are saddened, we choose to celebrate Chris' life, his achievements, and his undying dedication to both this business, and to you the fans.<br><br>The "Rabid Wolverine" may be gone, but his legacy will not be forgetten. Chris' tenacity will live on, as he will be emulated for years to come (just as he sought to emulate his idol, The Dynamite Kid). In conclusion, we hope that this tragedy serves to help people focus on what is truly important, as we certainly will. Please be grateful for everything that you have, and always keep your family ties as strong as possible.<br><br>Queen Sharmell<br><br>-- Gregory Helms posted the following blog entry just after the news of the Benoit family death broke out. However, when the sad details regarding the deaths came out, he pulled the blog:<br><br>To my friend Chris Benoit R.I.P.<br><br>I was sitting here at my computer when I got a call informing me of the death of Chris Benoit and his family. Other than saying that my thoughts go out to to his remaining family, I don't know what to say. Chris had just called me on Thursday to check on me as he has every week since my surgery and now days later I find out that he's gone. He was my friend. This hurts! This f**ing sucks!!!! Rest in peace my friend! Love you!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to a new FOX News report, the investigation of Chris BenoitÂ’s physician, Dr. Phil Astin, has revealed that he is accused of supplying "Benoit with a ten month supply of steroids, every three or four weeks, from May 2006 to May 2007."<br><br>If the news breaking today that Chris Benoit was being supplied with ten months worth of anabolic steroids every three to four weeks by Dr. Phil Astin turns out to be accurate, this will make World Wrestling Entertainment look extremely bad stemming from their press release comments last week.<br><br>U.S. Attorney David Nahmias reported that on average, Benoit was reportedly getting a ten-month supply of anabolic steroids every three to four weeks during a period from May 4, 2006 to May 9, 2007 from Dr. Astin. So, the April 10, 2007 WWE drug test that Benoit passed was right in the middle of that time period, making earlier claims by WWE look like a joke now to the media and a huge blow to the company overall.<br><br>Records are showing that Dr. Astin prescribed over 1 million doses of numerous drugs over the last two years, many of which were prescription painkillers and anabolic steroids. Many of the prescriptions were un-dated, which is illegal. - Said one federal agent about Dr. Phil Astin: "Dr. Astin allegedly prescribed these drugs like candy. Dirty doctors should be on notice that they face federal prosecution and federal prison time."<br><br>The early reaction to this news has to be complete credibility loss for WWE when it comes to the company's Wellness Policy. And with Benoit more than likely being tested throughout the year, it is pretty much impossible to have any form of confidence in the drug policy with the release of this information contradicting everything. It should be noted that Benoit was off for many months in 2006 and likely was not tested by WWE during that period, but it's believed he was tested at least four times minimum during a period where he was taking very heavy doses of anabolic steroids based on the timeline provided by investigators today.<br><br>It's now been made public that Benoit was arguing with his wife Nancy over his increased use of steroids at the same time he was subject to a drug testing policy. WWE announcing that Benoit passed a drug test on April 10 is something that can no longer hold up among public opinion now that these facts have been released, especially with it taking place well into the beginning of the Wellness policy being implemented. There are numerous possibilities on how Benoit may have been passing tests. Either WWE's testing is very flawed, Benoit found a way to beat the tests or the drug tests were a cover (although that could be disputed with wrestlers such as Chris Masters and Joey Mercury being subject to them not long ago).<br><br>Ted DiBiase was backstage at Raw last week. He said he is now a full time minister, and joined the show from Louisville.<br><br># DiBiase said he knew Benoit for 10 years. Â“A great guy,Â” said DiBiase of Benoit. DiBiase said he was totally dedicated to the trade, and helped young wrestlers. He said he admired Benoit.<br># He said he had just arrived in Corpus Christi, Texas for Raw when word of ChrisÂ’s death flittered in. He said people were crying, including himself. He said there was no speculation at the time, and heard rumors hours later of the ruling in the case. DiBiase said he didnÂ’t talk to Vince McMahon that night.<br># He was scheduled to do a cameo that night and instead they did a three hour Benoit tribute. DiBiase said wrestlers were allowed to go home or do tribute interviews.<br># DiBiase said he was at a crossroads in 1992 while doing drugs, messing around with women, etc. and realized he risked his marriage and the well being of his family, and took responsibility for his actions.<br># DiBiase said he was randomly drug tested when he wrestled. He said WWE tests for all kinds of drugs today.<br><br>Gail Kim made a statement regarding the Benoit tragedy on the forum of her official website. Here is her statement:<br><br>"I can see that everyone has been shocked by the Chris Benoit family tragedy and I didnt want to speak on this topic since the news came out. I received the news the day after I got home from the last road trip and was resting when i was notified that Chris and his wife were dead. I woke up immediately and was in total shock. My first thoughts were ....was it an accident? I couldn't believe it! I reached out to my friends in the business and slowly i started to hear more details. I can honestly say until yesterday I was in a state of shock and confusion. Its almost like you dont want to believe the details that you were hearing because thats not the Chris we all knew. Like you have probably heard before, Chris was one of the good guys in the business...passionate, intense, quiet, and always so nice. I loved his family and they were always a pleasure to be around...truly. Daniel was such a cute kid who you could tell looked up to his father and loved wrestling as well. Its so strange how we all think we know what someone's like and then something like this happens. I think I am still in the stage of not wanting to believe it.... but it did happen. The news coverage blaming the steroids? I dont believe it was roid rage...it sounds like from the investigation that this was not a "in the moment" incident. it happened over the course of the weekend. Who knows if steroids affected him in terms of long term use.... we dont know any details about his personal life, his health, etc... so i dont want to draw any conclusions myself. its just been a sad few days that I cant seem to stop thinking about and I know we are all asking the question WHY? I dont think we'll ever find out the answer to that question." -Gail Kim<br><br>Friday night Chris Jericho appeared on Fox News television show "On the<br>Record" to speak about the Benoit case. He started out by saying that the<br>man he knew and loved was not the same man who murdered his family. He<br>stated that in the last few hours of Chris's life, he commited some of the<br>most henious and violent crimes Jericho had ever heard of. When asked about<br>the steroid's he said that WWE does many wellness tests all done at random.<br>They are preformed by outside organizations and cover many different areas<br>of wellness. Jericho said that he had seen a psychiatrist the day before,<br>thursday, and she had told him that people who commit double murder-suicide<br>do it for a multitude of reasons. He believes that if steroids were involved<br>that was not the only reason that Benoit committed these crimes. He said<br>that he belives Benoit was mentally ill and that contributed to the<br>murder's. Multiple times Jericho said he believes that Benoit took all the<br>answers with him to the grave.<br><br>Jericho did not only speak of the bad things though. He went on to explain<br>how Benoit would fly home between shows just to see his kids for a few hours<br>before he flew off again for another show. He explained how Benoit was<br>possibly the best there was in the business. He said that Benoit was the guy<br>everybody in the locker room wanted to be like, including himself. When<br>asked if Jericho was glad to be away from the business he said "absolutely<br>not, its a great thing to be able to entertain so many people every single<br>day."</div>
