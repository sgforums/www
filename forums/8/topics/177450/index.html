            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;Dear Friends,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;PLEASE DO NOT DISCARD THIS MESSAGE ---- VERY IMPORTANT<br>&gt;MUST READ...<br>&gt;Especially those who love to go Orchard Road !!!!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Beware, don't talk to strangers specially<br>&gt;China men. Beware and alert your friends, wife and family members.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Be Alert At All Times !<br>&gt;<br>&gt;This is scary.....<br>&gt;<br>&gt;My female friend encountered this incident in Orchard.<br>&gt;That time she was waiting for me at Orchard Tower.<br>&gt;She was approached by an Chinese 30 to 40yrs old man.<br>&gt;I saw the man talking to her while I am walking toward her.<br>&gt;I was puzzled when she suddenly walked off with the man<br>&gt;.......and even stunned when she walked pass me without looking at<br>&gt;me...but<br>&gt;I am standing in front of her!!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Thinking something amiss, I called her handphone instead.<br>&gt;She answered the phone and was shocked to realise she is no<br>&gt;longer outside Orchard Tower. The man must have saw his charm<br>&gt;being broken, immediately talked to her again..... This time I<br>&gt;told my friend don't listen to what he said and not to look at his<br>&gt;eyes.....juz RUN!<br>&gt;She quickly ran off ......She called me again after 15mins.....<br>&gt;and meet me at Takashimaya.<br>&gt;She was shivering all over when I met her.<br>&gt;She told me she really don't know what was going on..... I told her I<br>&gt;heard of this kind<br>&gt;of things before, ..... but nvr expected to see it<br>&gt;myself too...... Well....... that day, she took almost half a day to calm<br>&gt;herself down.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;My friend sent me the following email yesterday, am<br>&gt;forwarding to all of u for info so that u would not be caught in that<br>&gt;situation.<br>&gt;Take care.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"While waiting for my husband at Tangs side entrance facing<br>&gt;Lucky Plaza, a Chinese man suddenly approached me, disregarding my<br>&gt;personal<br>&gt;space, stood so close to me that I need to back off. Then he asked me<br>&gt;where was a place, which I didn't comprehend. After repeating 2 times or<br>&gt;so, he<br>&gt;said the place was where they sell chicken rice, duck rice, making some<br>&gt;innocent<br>&gt;hand gestures like counting, so I thought he meant foodcourt, told him<br>&gt;that he<br>&gt;could go down the flight of stairs next to Mac to basement.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;He appeared lost and asked me again if it was on left hand side<br>&gt;or right handside. I was little irritated as we were facing the<br>&gt;stairs,such a big stairway and u are asking me right or left!<br>&gt;Luckily my husband arrived at that time. The taxi behind him sounded the<br>&gt;horn, so<br>&gt;I hurriedly pointed again to the stairway and asked him to go down.<br>&gt;Later I was suddenly awaken with an uneasy feeling. Realized that he might<br>&gt;be a hypnotiser.<br>&gt;As I remembered that he was loitering near me for some time, but I just<br>&gt;took it that he was another<br>&gt;passerby at that moment. He spoke in a deliberate and slower manner, his<br>&gt;hand gestures<br>&gt;when mentioning chicken rice; duck rice, etc and his deliberate attempt in<br>&gt;asking me if left or right.<br>&gt;These people try to get us to conjure up images in our mind, that's how<br>&gt;they hypnotise us.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The reason why I thought of a hypnotiser was because my KLfriend shared<br>&gt;with me 3 mths<br>&gt;back that her friend had fallen victim when she woke up naked, not<br>&gt;remembering what happened."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;This also happened to an ex-colleague of mine. Her story was that she was<br>&gt;at busy shopping center exit,<br>&gt;saw flustered Chinese man speaking very loudly on HP, then the man<br>&gt;approached herfor help, told<br>&gt;her that his girlfriend from overseas came to look for him but was lost,so<br>&gt;wanted to borrow money from my friend,<br>&gt;amount was quite a lot which my friend didn't have. After talking for a<br>&gt;while, he even managed to ask her to follow him.<br>&gt;Fortunately her HP rang, she said she suddenly became more aware of what<br>&gt;was happening,<br>&gt;before that, she just wanted to follow him to help him. Immediately she<br>&gt;told the man she didn't have<br>&gt;money and left.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;So beware of all foreign Chinese man! I can't descript his accent but he<br>&gt;is definitely not S'porean. He is very decently<br>&gt;dressed, normal guy on the street, maybe late 30s, carrying a rather big<br>&gt;shoulder sling bag.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Please alert your galfriends, sisters, mothers etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, these China people are always either getting murdered, or up to some crooked act.<br><br>Hypnotism doesn't work on everyone, therefore the hypnotiser needs to assess his target victim first. Weak minded individuals or distracted personalities are most vulnerable.<br><br>In the first place, don't look too approachable. Be alert and wary, look at any person who approach you up and down the body, study his/her body language, never look at other party eye-to-eye. Listen to what he/she is saying but analyse the surrounding, distract yourself so that your mind isn't focussed on his/her words.<br><br></div>

Draw a diagram showing the relationship between all the victims mentioned in the passage below. [10]<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by a_guy:</div><div class="quote_body">&gt;Dear Friends,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;PLEASE DO NOT DISCARD THIS MESSAGE ---- VERY IMPORTANT<br>&gt;MUST READ...<br>&gt;Especially those who love to go Orchard Road !!!!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Beware, don't talk to strangers specially<br>&gt;China men. Beware and alert your friends, wife and family members.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Be Alert At All Times !<br>&gt;<br>&gt;This is scary.....<br>&gt;<br>&gt;My female friend encountered this incident in Orchard.<br>&gt;That time she was waiting for me at Orchard Tower.<br>&gt;She was approached by an Chinese 30 to 40yrs old man.<br>&gt;I saw the man talking to her while I am walking toward her.<br>&gt;I was puzzled when she suddenly walked off with the man<br>&gt;.......and even stunned when she walked pass me without looking at<br>&gt;me...but<br>&gt;I am standing in front of her!!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Thinking something amiss, I called her handphone instead.<br>&gt;She answered the phone and was shocked to realise she is no<br>&gt;longer outside Orchard Tower. The man must have saw his charm<br>&gt;being broken, immediately talked to her again..... This time I<br>&gt;told my friend don't listen to what he said and not to look at his<br>&gt;eyes.....juz RUN!<br>&gt;She quickly ran off ......She called me again after 15mins.....<br>&gt;and meet me at Takashimaya.<br>&gt;She was shivering all over when I met her.<br>&gt;She told me she really don't know what was going on..... I told her I<br>&gt;heard of this kind<br>&gt;of things before, ..... but nvr expected to see it<br>&gt;myself too...... Well....... that day, she took almost half a day to calm<br>&gt;herself down.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;My friend sent me the following email yesterday, am<br>&gt;forwarding to all of u for info so that u would not be caught in that<br>&gt;situation.<br>&gt;Take care.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"While waiting for my husband at Tangs side entrance facing<br>&gt;Lucky Plaza, a Chinese man suddenly approached me, disregarding my<br>&gt;personal<br>&gt;space, stood so close to me that I need to back off. Then he asked me<br>&gt;where was a place, which I didn't comprehend. After repeating 2 times or<br>&gt;so, he<br>&gt;said the place was where they sell chicken rice, duck rice, making some<br>&gt;innocent<br>&gt;hand gestures like counting, so I thought he meant foodcourt, told him<br>&gt;that he<br>&gt;could go down the flight of stairs next to Mac to basement.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;He appeared lost and asked me again if it was on left hand side<br>&gt;or right handside. I was little irritated as we were facing the<br>&gt;stairs,such a big stairway and u are asking me right or left!<br>&gt;Luckily my husband arrived at that time. The taxi behind him sounded the<br>&gt;horn, so<br>&gt;I hurriedly pointed again to the stairway and asked him to go down.<br>&gt;Later I was suddenly awaken with an uneasy feeling. Realized that he might<br>&gt;be a hypnotiser.<br>&gt;As I remembered that he was loitering near me for some time, but I just<br>&gt;took it that he was another<br>&gt;passerby at that moment. He spoke in a deliberate and slower manner, his<br>&gt;hand gestures<br>&gt;when mentioning chicken rice; duck rice, etc and his deliberate attempt in<br>&gt;asking me if left or right.<br>&gt;These people try to get us to conjure up images in our mind, that's how<br>&gt;they hypnotise us.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The reason why I thought of a hypnotiser was because my KLfriend shared<br>&gt;with me 3 mths<br>&gt;back that her friend had fallen victim when she woke up naked, not<br>&gt;remembering what happened."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;This also happened to an ex-colleague of mine. Her story was that she was<br>&gt;at busy shopping center exit,<br>&gt;saw flustered Chinese man speaking very loudly on HP, then the man<br>&gt;approached herfor help, told<br>&gt;her that his girlfriend from overseas came to look for him but was lost,so<br>&gt;wanted to borrow money from my friend,<br>&gt;amount was quite a lot which my friend didn't have. After talking for a<br>&gt;while, he even managed to ask her to follow him.<br>&gt;Fortunately her HP rang, she said she suddenly became more aware of what<br>&gt;was happening,<br>&gt;before that, she just wanted to follow him to help him. Immediately she<br>&gt;told the man she didn't have<br>&gt;money and left.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;So beware of all foreign Chinese man! I can't descript his accent but he<br>&gt;is definitely not S'porean. He is very decently<br>&gt;dressed, normal guy on the street, maybe late 30s, carrying a rather big<br>&gt;shoulder sling bag.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Please alert your galfriends, sisters, mothers etc. </div></blockquote></div>
