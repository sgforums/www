            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br>I got this article from a friend of mine which I think you guys here maybe interested. What about you guys? Please feel free to post your comment on this article.<br>*********************************************************<br><br>The following is an article which I received from a Buddhist friend which<br>I think is interesting . But of course it is presented from the Buddhist<br>point of view i.e. not without biases . The presentation of the following<br>conservation can be more objective and fair , from my personal point of<br>view if the followings are included :<br><br>(1) The pre-Buddhist debate regarding the rationality of the Hindu concept<br>of Braham in India ;<br>(2) The argumentation from Middle Age up to present regarding the<br>possiblity of the Judo-Christian concept of God in both Western and Eastern<br>Christendom (modern day Europe and northern Middle East) ;<br>(3) Debate between the sufis and mainstream Muslim scholars regarding the<br>concept of God ; and<br>(4) Debate between Mohist (support existence of God) and other school of<br>thoughts like Taoism and Confucism (non-existence of God) in China during<br>early Han era .<br><br>Why did God (if there is one) Create?<br><br>One night, Zeph was passing by Tampines MRT (subway) station on his way<br>to catch a movie at Century Square when a stranger approached him, asking if<br>he could spare some time. Zeph (Z) knew it would be about sharing the<br>teachings of God. The gentleman introduced himself as Jay (J). He was<br>dressed neatly in a long-sleeved shirt and pants, looking as if he had just<br>knocked off from office work... or is he doing his "work" now? He<br>definitely looked like a sincere and nice guy. There was a twinkle of<br>genuine interest in his eye. Initially, Zeph wanted to simply turn him<br>down with a simple "No" before walking off- but that twinkle made him decide<br>to give conversation a chance:<br><br>Z: Hi... emmm... I'm sorry, but I'm a staunch Buddhist.<br>J: That's okay! Say, how long have you been a Buddhist?<br>Z: About 5 years or so.<br>J: Do you mind if I share with you about God?<br>Z: Sure... I'm willing to hear what you have to say, but provided you<br>hear what I have to say too.<br>J: Of course!<br>Z: Errr... because I'm rushing for time, can I ask you a question first?<br>It's very important- it's like my first and prime question about God.<br>J: Go ahead!<br>Z: Okay- If there is a God, "WHY did God create?"<br>J: Create you?<br>Z: No no... create "anything"... and "everything". Why did God create<br>anything at all?<br>J: Out of Love for us.<br>Z: But how can God love something that is not yet created?<br>J: Well, it's like a #### who can love her unborn child in her womb!<br>Z: In that case, why did God "conceive" the idea of creating? It's still<br>the same thing, whether we ask "Why did God create?" or "Why did God<br>think of creating?"<br>J: Hmmm... What do YOU think is the answer?<br>Z: I worked something out to figure this out recently... Please hold on,<br>it's here somewhere... [Zeph rummages through the file in his backpack]<br>Here it is! [He holds out a piece of paper for Jay to see, about to read it<br>with a finger running through the words] Please stop me if there is any<br>part you don't understand.<br>J: Sure! Let's see...<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>WHY DID GOD (if there is one) CREATE?<br><br>Assuming there is a creator God, let us ask: "Why did God create?"<br>There are only a possible number of reasons-<br><br>1. Out of need<br>2. Out of want (greed)<br>3. For no reason<br>4. For a transcendental reason that we can never understand<br>5. For a transcendental reason we can't yet understand, OR<br>6. A certain combination of 1-5.<br><br>Given the classic attributes of an almighty creator God as<br><br>a) Complete<br>b) Pure<br>c) Reasonable (Rational)<br>d) Understanding of us ,AND<br>e) Perfect<br><br>Then,<br><br>I) If God created b'cos of 1, He is not a)-[ IS Incomplete ]<br>II) If God created b'cos of 2, He is not b)-[ IS Impure ]<br>III) If God created b'cos of 3, He not c)-[ IS Unreasonable/Irrational ]<br>IV) If God created b'cos of 4, He is not understanding of us (me, for one)<br>needing to know the answer to the above question, before being able to<br>believe Him. He is thus not d)<br>V) If God created out of 5, belief in Him is out of the question for now,<br>and for as long as we do not understand. He is thus not d)<br>VI) If God created out of 6, He is not a), b), c), d) and/or e).<br><br>Therefore, in any case, there is NO God... as attributed in a)-e).<br><br>Conclusions:<br><br>* There NEVER was a "Complete, Pure, Reasonable, Understanding and<br>Perfect" creator God.<br>* There is NO "Complete, Pure, Reasonable, Understanding and Perfect"<br>creator God.<br>* There can NEVER be a "Complete, Pure, Reasonable, Understanding and<br>Perfect" creator God.<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Z: So what do you think?<br>J: Hmmm...<br>Z: God is the foundation of everything you believe in, that you hope I<br>can believe. But I'm afraid I can't, as you just saw. My line of reasoning is<br>down-to-earth and not far-fetched, is it?<br>J: Yes, it's very reasonable. Did you come up with that by yourself?<br>Z: Ya. I ask myself many questions on life and such. God was a big<br>question mark resolved when I came up with this little proof thing.<br>J: Not bad! I can't find anything wrong with your reasoning... as yet.<br>Z: You know? I became a Buddhist because the Buddha could answer all the<br>questions I ask. I have to admit I don't believe in God because of vice<br>versa... I mean- God answers none of my important questions. I'm sorry if<br>this sounds bad, but it's really so. I'm a person of reason, who doesn't<br>over-demand reason. I'm only being reasonably reasonable.<br>J: Yup.<br>Z: You know, we Buddhists are proud of the spirit of Free Enquiry that<br>the Buddha advocated. We are encouraged to ask all kinds of questions<br>intelligently before accepting anything. No one is obliged to believe in<br>anything blindly. No other religious teacher taught with this gracious<br>openness. We say Buddhism starts from reason down on the visible ground,<br>not from invisible faith up in the sky. The Buddha openly invited the<br>followers of other systems of thought to question His teachings from<br>various perspectives. It might be interesting to note that the Buddha was<br>born in a unique time in history, at a time where India was with all<br>kinds of religious thought. It is said that there were more than 65 religions<br>then. The Buddha never said He was a God in any sense. But He openly<br>proclaimed that He was Fully Enlightened, perfect in action, speech and<br>thought, Compassion and Wisdom. And this, He never failed to exemplify in<br>His 45 years of teaching. No religious founder taught as extensively and<br>coherently as Him. He was a very practical teacher- who was only<br>concerned with us achieving True Happiness. Another interesting point is that the<br>Buddha taught about how the world's various religions evolved with Man's<br>thinking. He even taught about how the belief in God arose! In this<br>sense, Buddhism is the only religion that teaches about other religions! The<br>Buddha never condemned any religion that benefitted Man on the whole, but<br>He shows us where each religion's teachings stand in the light of the<br>Ultimate Truth. It really blew my mind!<br><br>J: You really know your Buddhism. And it seems very interesting!<br>Z: Basics I guess I know quite well. Buddhism's really amazing! By the<br>way, please don't get me wrong. I'm not against God-believers, it's just that<br>I'd discovered the Buddha and His teachings to be nothing less than<br>"Complete, Pure, Reasonable, Understanding and Perfect!"<br>J: Hmmm... would you mind if I ask you questions about Buddhism just as<br>you asked me your question about God?<br>Z: Sure!<br>J: But you're rushing for time...<br>Z: Oh ya... I almost forgot. Tell you what- I'll give you my contact<br>number.<br>J: Thanks. I'll give you mine too. [Zeph scribbled onto his "God paper"<br>and gave it to him, and Jay gave him his namecard]<br>Z: Well, really got to go now...<br>J: Nice meeting you.<br>Z: Nice meeting you too! Hope I didn't take up your time.<br>J: No, of course not- it was very interesting! I'm glad YOU took the time<br>to talk to me! I'll call you.<br>Z: Okay! Bye!<br><br>In time to come, Jay and Zeph became good friends. Jay's questions on<br>Buddhism were all answered by Zeph. He understood why Zeph became a<br>Buddhist. And with more time, Jay told Zeph he was on his way to become a<br>Buddhist. On knowing this, Zeph felt truly thankful that he caught that<br>twinke in Jay's eyes. It must have been the twinkle of Jay's Buddha-Nature.<br>But then again, it must have been Zeph's Buddha-Nature too, that caught<br>that light in his eyes, with his eyes.<br><br></div>
