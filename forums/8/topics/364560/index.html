              <p>according to your dat "one way", is by deducting money equally from all rich pple's salary, we may have caused difficulty to those essential rich pple who is in real needs of supporting their family (perhaps a disabled father, a paralysed mother, 2 mentally challenged children, a low-educated wife)</p>
              <p>so how? no way to check man, unless a new system is put in place to countercheck those excess rich Vs essential rich</p>

              <p>no such thing..as far as what i see. every morning see poor old man selling tissues. and poor old woman climbing overhead bridge (maybe to go work). nobody buys from old man.</p>
              <p>got rich people donate money, but poor ppl are usually uneducated esp the old ones, they prob duno where to go for financial help, so money wouldnt reach these ppl.</p>
              <p>in the ideal world everything is shared more fairly, but to be realistic we cannot expect that.</p>
              <p>even my buying tissues from old man doesnt help him cos i see him everyday.</p>

              Rich people damn poor thing lor.
              
              Poor people like to punish the rich for being rich.
              
              Is it really rich people's fault for the poor people's plight ?
              
              If we punish the rich.. then why bother becoming rich ?
              
              We might as well.. just all sit at home .. be poor and wait for the rich to give us their money.
              ----------------------------------------
              
              It boils down to poor people's "self-righteous" mentality. 
              
              Something like they only help the weak/poor, and loathe the rich/strong.
              
              This kind of shallow old-generation mentality is actually a kind of mental sickness that needs to be cured.

              <p>This is a lame theory, the end result is there is going to be more poor people. Why work when the rich will distribute their wealth to you. I for one will quit my job and stay at home to be poor, got a stupid rich guy is going to feed me why waste my effort and time to work.</p>
