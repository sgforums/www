              <p>Making money is about opportunities. People need money to make money. Even if you want to sell things, you need contacts for suppliers, you need cash for supplies etc.</p>
              <p>So how can you say that?</p>
              <p>This is why it is easy for a rich man to make money but not a poor man.</p>

              <p>I met this lady the other day on the bus back towards Clementi. She is a Messanic Judaist and a very fervant one. Apparently she is in such a financial state that she needs to sell bible and other religious stuff for a living. I went to her house the other day, it was like a regular store room. All the things she is trying to sell is in there, singapore flags, candle holder, bibles, scriptures, blow horns. Anything you could scavenge off the streets.</p>
              <p>While I was sitting there talking to her, her husband tried to loan ten dollars from me. I think her husband is unemployed as well. Both of them are in their sixties. It is not in a very good position to be in at this age I think.</p>
              <p>Also while I was in the lift going up to see this first lady yesterday, I met this other lady that collects newspaper for a living in her sixties as well. The other guy in the life just stood there looking at her while standing in her way when she was trying to get out the lift at level six of the HDB flat. I ended up helping her bring all her newspaper to her place before proceeding to the flat of the first lady.</p>
              <p>It feels very sad indeed. I think helping poor aged people with some time and effort if not money is one of the <a href="http://thingstodosingapore.com/see-things/Support-poor-messianic-Judaist-doing-garage-sale-for-religious-items">things to do in Singapore</a></p>

              <p>History has never shown us why this world should be equal and just. It never happens.</p>
              <p>Not only with humans, who are born with inequality, some are born rich, strong, have talents, some are born poor, weak, dumb, and even with abnormalities since birth.Not just humans, even animals are unequal. You see in the jungle, big animals eat small animals. There is no equality, this is the nature of our world.</p>
              <p>I think we should accept it, and once we can accept it, we can find more peace in our hearts (not to discourage good deeds, but to accept and recognize imperfection)</p>

              <p>every1 wishes the world to be fair, just that everyone's definition of whats equality is different.</p>
              <p>to the people with nothing they think that its a great idea if everyone had something ( so money please! )</p>
              <p>to the people who work hard AND succeeded they think that their efforts should be rewarded. If hard work, intelligence etc all didn't matter, then everyone might as well stay home and wait for the government to issue money. Work so hard for what?</p>
              <p>all i can say is that the world is controlled by the people who have power.</p>
              <p>Those who always come and talk about equality and stuff are the ones who have no money no power and hence cannot do anything.</p>
              <p>This kind of nato ( no action talk only ) behavior would only serve to prolong the wealth upon wealth cycle of the people in power.</p>

              <p><br>Actually, the country is split into two classes, those who earn local salaries and those who earn international market level salaries.  Their qualifications may not necessarily be different but just opportunities.  You just hope like hell that you're in the latter.  It's a vicious cycle bcos if you happen to be in the former the only way out is education, a lot of hard work and more importantly a lot of luck.  Once you've  moved up, it is easier to stay there.  Guess which group the majority of the people are in?</p>

              <p>It's a lot more effective than expecting the government to do anything about it. Do you seriously think that even if the government decides to divert the money to help out these poor it would really be the needy that would apply for it ?</p>

              <p><br>Don't worry.  By comparison, poor people in Singapore is much better off than poor people in many other countries.  Even in worst case scenario, there is still food to eat.  No one is dying from starvation.  The weather is mild so the homeless can sleep in void decks.  I'm not saying we should not help them, I'm just saying that life is just not so bad in Singapore be it rich or poor.</p>
