People who enjoy the companionship of good, close friends are those who don't take daily courtesies for granted. They are quick to thank their friends for their many expressions of kindness. On the other hand, people whose circle of friends is severely constricted often do not have the attitude of gratitude.<br><br><strong>COUNT ON ME</strong><br>"A friend is one who walks in when others walk out," observes Walter Winchell. Loyalty is an essential ingredient for true friendship; it is the emotional glue that bonds people. Those who are rich in their relationships tend to be steady and true friends. When troubles come, a good friend is there, indicating "you can count on me."<br><br><strong>LET ME HELP</strong><br>Some of the most significant messages people deliver to one another often come in just three words. When spoken or conveyed, those statements have the power to forge new friendships, deepen old ones and restore relationships that have cooled.<br><br><strong>I UNDERSTAND YOU</strong><br>People become closer and enjoy each other more if they feel the other person accepts and understands them. Letting other people know in so many little ways that you understand him or her is one of the most powerful tools for healing your relationship.<br><br><strong>GO FOR IT</strong><br>Some of your friends may be nonconformists, have unique projects and unusual hobbies. Support them in pursuing their interests. "Rather than urging your loved ones to conform, encourage their uniqueness. Everyone has dreams that no one else has, and you can make yourself loved by encouraging those aspirations," says Dr. Alan Loy McGinnis, author of the book "The Friendship Factor ".<br><br>Three little words that everyone was expecting to see have to be<br>reserved for those, who are special people, friends and family in your life; that is <strong>I LOVE YOU</strong>..[/b]</blockquote></div>
