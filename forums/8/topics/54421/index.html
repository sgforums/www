            <div class='col-md body'>I think,personally that sometimes,patching back isnt really an option.<br><br>NO matter how much you try to fix the pieces back into a broken pot, there'll always be at least a hairline crack in the thing.<br><br>However, i guess must bear in mind the circumstances that led to the breakup in the first place. Was it something terrible like infidelity? OR was it more a case of misunderstandings that led to heated words and raised emotions that caused the couple to break up in the spur of the moment. heh i guess its up to the individual to see that.<br><br>But for me, no i wont patch back with my ex.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
