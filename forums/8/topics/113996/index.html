Or just walk into any sports shop and they have these labels all over the place advertising for it (they call it "Climate Cool" or something).<br><br>The top brands which are designed exclusively for running (Asics, New Balance, even Reebok nowadays) have shoes which come in different measurements - not only length, but also width, etc.<br><br>I think slight pronations are natural and don't really have to be corrected....unless your feet or knees get hurt due to it.<br><br>For more serious cases, top brands (Asics, New Balance, etc) also have different models for over- or under- pronation.  Their websites have extensive information on this.  I've also seen stand-alone insoles which can help correct pronation by supporting your feet at the right places, but I'm not sure if you can find them here.<br><br>Since you're such a serious runner, why not spend a bit more and go for Asics?  I've never heard a single bad review about it.  It sounds almost magical to me.<br><br>Hey, how do you train for a marathon anyway?
