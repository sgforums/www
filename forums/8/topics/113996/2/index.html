Adidas is one of them - check their website (if they have one).  Or just walk into any sports shop and they have these labels all over the place advertising for it (they call it "Climate Cool" or something).<br><br>The top brands which are designed exclusively for running (Asics, New Balance, even Reebok nowadays) have shoes which come in different measurements - not only length, but also width, etc.<br><br>I think slight pronations are natural and don't really have to be corrected....unless your feet or knees get hurt due to it.<br><br>For more serious cases, top brands (Asics, New Balance, etc) also have different models for over- or under- pronation.  Their websites have extensive information on this.  I've also seen stand-alone insoles which can help correct pronation by supporting your feet at the right places, but I'm not sure if you can find them here.<br><br>Since you're such a serious runner, why not spend a bit more and go for Asics?  I've never heard a single bad review about it.  It sounds almost magical to me.<br><br>Hey, how do you train for a marathon anyway?  Do you actually run like 24 km a few times every week?<br><br>Lastly, I think anyone's socks would be drenched if they ran for 1+ hour lah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div></blockquote>I am a leisure runner.
