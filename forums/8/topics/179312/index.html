            <div class='col-md body'>u r all nuts...It is all our brain and eyes which conjure up images..  believe dreamland is possible ONLY IN THE MIND. Although such a world may not exist. In the distant future we can see machines invented which can plant thoughts in our brains.<br>Signals entering your mind and eye can be manipulated so that u are transported into this "dreamworld". Point is the similar to the radio frquency as mentioned. ONE form of such a manipulation already exists though naturally - Hallucinations or mistaken identity. From a distant u see some white cloth swaying in the air and mistake it to be a ghost.

We need a computer (our bodies), an modem (our minds), to be able to connect to cyberspace. We never see cyberspace because it is invisible, because it exists digitally, but it is real because there is proof that if you and me are talking on the internet through cyberspace, then cyberspace is existant, on an entirely different level from the physical plane. Cyberspace then exists on the digital plane.<br><br>Radio waves are always here, but they are invisible and so cannot be seen. If you have a radio that is able to receive radio frequencies and translate them into sound, then you know that the world of radio waves is real.<br><br>Our minds are fantastic organs that are able to form mental images and create thoughts, but I believe that dreamland is always there and all we need to reach that place is to fall asleep and let our subconsciousness receive the frequencies radiated from dreamland and translate them to visual/audio reality in our sleep.</div></blockquote>Dreams are Messages we are unsure of in waking life. They appear to u in the form of complicated patterns called Dreams. Dreams are the future of the thought process. Current models of thought processes such as flow charts are not perfect will become obsolete.<br>In the future, decisions can be made just by dreaming.<br>Have u heard that if someone were to give u  a mathemtical problem which u cant solve, the answers will appear in your dream if u think about it before going to sleep. Problem is when we wake up we forget all about the dream most often. We only remember the dreams which have something to do with emotions such as fear , love or sexual. For example nightmares.<br><br>The reason we cant solve the mathematical problem in waking life is that we are not in tune with our deeper inner selves which is to be isolated from the real world. Everyday we get distracted and prevented from reaching to these "higher level of intelligences" by our environment - the real world. A real world where our thought processes are dictated creating a layer on top thus preventing us from reaching a deeper level of intelligence.<br><br>Steven Spielberg's idea of psychics in Minority Report hinted in the distant future , we may be able to have beings with super intelligences whose thought processes are not conventional. In Speilberg's movie, the beings were isolated and cut off from the outside world making them in tune with themselves more.<br><br>In or everyday life, introverts seem to posseess more intelligence on random processes than extroverts who are rather expereinced in  fixed processes.<br>Introverts have been known to be more in tune with their inner selves though when come to expereinced thinking modes, they seem to blunder.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe dream land is a diff relm cos i dreamed of being in egypt at a mosque and my mom didnt know it was one and when the imam started talking, my mom left me there and left the country, (my mother dislikes islam very much so), then after the lecture was over, i went to the back door of the mosque, slid down a ramp, and this guy was waiting for me with open arms at the bottom. im wondering what this dream means, cos<br>1. my mother is a non practicing christian and i am a muslim,<br>2. i have not actually been to egypt although i have friends there. i think it is reality, as shown in number 1, mixing with my desire to be accepted for who i am reguardless of what creed i am, does anyone have a suggestion on this?</div>

But do we ever tell the differences between reality and dreams?  Without being seemingly  to be ridiculing anyone one's faith in Buddha, I think the founder of such a system of belief is unable to relate with what is truth  with what is <strong> illusion </strong>!</div>
