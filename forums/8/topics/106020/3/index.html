            <div class='col-md body'>been a while since I've encountered bizarre stories... here's more...<br><br>Guy A meets Gal at pub and made a lot of effort to leave an impression on her. Gal kinda likes Guy A and started going out with him. After a couple of weeks, Guy A plays David Copperfield and starts disappearing act - refusing to answer phone calls and smses... everytime Gal calls, he's sleeping. Once Gal tried calling a few times at different points of the day and he's 'sleeping' for more than 12 hours. Meanwhile Guy A's friend, Guy B starts smsing and calling Gal, which she ignored.<br><br>In the end, Guy A finally answers phone calls and say want to break up cos he 'knows' Gal has been seeing Guy B behind his back, when Gal actually detests the sight of Guy B. Gal hasn't even been out with her own friends as she spent so much time waiting for Guy A to wake up or call back most of the time.<br><br>Wah lao... some kind of lame excuse. Want ONS say so lah.... and no backbone to say somemore and tries to blame the gal. What a jerk...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's another one and this time round, the gal shld be blamed....<br><br>Gal and Guy had been going out for more than a year. Gal had always been fussy and quick-tempered and Guy was probably the most stable and giving bf she had ever had. Everything Gal wanted her own way, Guy would give in. Even then, Gal always manages to find some fault with Guy e.g. not cutting up the corn from the cob for her, not pulling her chair out for her etc. The most bizarre incident was when Guy helped her to order food at the foodcourt and happened to order noodle with soup instead of without. Gal gave Guy such a terrible shelling that friends around them were shocked Guy could just take it and swallow it all. Her biggest complaint with Guy was that he's not saving enough money to get ready to settle down with her... yet at the same time, she complain Guy has not been willing to spend money to buy the expensive, branded presents she wants!!!<br><br>eh allo... make up your mind what you want lah... and puh-lease open your eyes to see. Not many gals are as fortunate to get such tolerating bfs....</div>
