            <div class='col-md body'>have a friend now, who's having problems with her ex-gf. apparently the ex-gf tells her "truth A" about a certain matter, then tells Gal B "truth B" about the same matter. the problem is that that Gal B n my fren dun like each other, and that Gal B liked my fren's ex-gf when they were together, so now Gal B would then screw with my fren's head by telling her "truth B" which is what my fren's supposed not to hear. And the problem is my fren's ex-gf is not truthful either... my fren doesn't mind hearing "truth B", if it's from her ex-gf herself, but to hear it from someone she dislikes, is so much more hurtful, since it would show that her ex-gf is lying to her... haiz</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>new bizarre story over the weekend..... remember that story abt the Guy who gave the gal up for someone who looks exactly like her??<br><br>here's more....<br><br>Guy meets Gal again at a gathering and after more than a year, Gal has already moved on.... During the gathering, Gal goes about talking normally to other friends around her and finds she got nothing to say to Guy... so just treat him as acquaintance...<br><br>Guy looks at Gal with an indescribable expression on his face.... as if wishing that Gal will still talk to him like the close friends they once were and update him about her relationship life...  Gal ignores seeing the expression and goes about doing her own thing....<br><br>What does the guy expect?? Broke up already then move on lah!!! duh... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
