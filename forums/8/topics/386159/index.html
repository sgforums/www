              <p><br>even if they do approach u.. theres a limit to the persecution that u will receive. When u criticise, abstain from vulgaries and pejorative words. If they cane u or suspend u from school just because of a open criticism.. You might wanna ask your parents to pursue legal means</p>

              <p>If you are going to post criticism via an online platform - make yourself anonymous. Start with the username, and maybe tweak the privacy settings a little, though it would be pointless if nobody could access it..if anything is to be done, you could try approaching staff members of the school, or drop an anonymous letter citing the problem and reasons why it should be resolved.</p>
              <p>In the event that you are confronted, and forced to delete the blog, you can copy the contents and dump it on a new blog with a different name. When questioned, you can just bua bodoh and pretend as though someone else out there shares the same grievances as you do. If the school persecutes you in an unreasonable manner, do not be afraid to pull your parents to your side, as there is nothing shameful in gaining leverage in an ugly situation.</p>
              <p>But problems that revolve around the teacher are usually difficult to resolve without concrete proof of incompetency. There was a time where my classmates and myself had our test timings compromised - we had a full 15 minutes out of 50 cut off an important test paper, simply for being "noisy" when the old hag just kept bitching on about silence during the test period, failing to realize that her noise was the only one resonating around the 4 walls. We ended up with a petition and went straight up to the principal's office. We were not disappointed.</p>
              <p>If there is a real problem with the teacher, your peers would have it too. However, if the teacher only picks on you, it would be a good time to reflect on what you might have done to warrant the crosshair. Should the issue persist, seek help from your parents and resolve the matter with the teacher directly.</p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>

              <p>Well my answer is no though it is better as compared from the past, writing as a sec sch student perspective.</p>
              <p>First, I don't get it, why do they need to go around the web searching around for our social networking sites' profile or blogs...finding things for themselves to do???</p>
              <p>Second, I believe dunno how many times, you heard your school saying asking for suggestions when you submit, your suggestions somehow went don't know where or if it does get read, most of the time it will be ignored or give you rubbish excuse for not accepting it. Take for example, handphone rules, for schools that don't allow phones, try submitting suggestions to allow phones and your reply will be all those lame excuses, how do they even know whether will handphone work or not work when they never even try in their own school with their own students. Other school is other school, they have different students. Seriously at least consider or take some actions like a bring handphone to school trial than wait for results to flow in, sometimes the results might be quite surprising... At least respect our suggestions...</p>
              <p>Third, some teachers just seriously think that they elder hence we must respect them so they say what you do what/they say you talk when you never you also bo bian must admit you talk than when you try to explain you never talk, they start to scold you...Seriously this is the point where teachers fail, they keep thinking that they are right in everything than never ever give us a chance to explain. How many times before you can explain yourself they will say, "I don't want to hear your nonsense/explainations"...hello next time can I accuse you that you steal $100 from me and just say what you say to us...</p>

              <p>A few years back I made a thread on this very website...complaining how my school is diverting most of the financial assistance to 'niche' CCAs and withdrawing all fundings to my CCA and even terminating our instructor and barring us from making performances outside school.</p>
              <p>I was stupid enough to use the school library to check on my thread, and ended up having my identity found out. I reckoned it was a good opportunity to discuss nicely face-to-face with the head of the school, but ended up getting literally screamed at by him in the office. On hindsight not even my sergeants in BMT could even match his feriocity at that moment.</p>
              <p>Luckily, I had put up passwords to my blog and he couldn't enter it, cause there's worse contents inside :p</p>

              <p>This is the story behind the 'nick' I use for most forums. When online, keep your identity 'anonymous'...why create trouble for yourself by giving everyone in the world a record of the contents you make online? It can jolly well stay in the google search results for the next 10 years.</p>

              <p>Boy, u can edit all ur post that are improper but do note that even if you change a nick, if you post anything that any govt organisation will not allow, they can just get your ISP provider to identify who you are and you can't run away from that.</p>
