              <p>No matter where a secondary or primary school student studies
                  in, the school will track down their blogs, remember what is
                  inside, and punish the students for any vulgarities found inside
                  the blog. Do students really have rights these days? Is this
                  freedom of speech at a price? But if it is really freedom, why does
                  it have a price?</p>
              <p>Schools are also anxious on what students write about their
                  school, and if anything bad written is found on a public post, the
                  record goes straight into the O-level records. Why are schools all
                  so anxious about such things? If a majority of students actually
                  complain on the internet with constructive methods, doesn't that
                  directly prove that there is a problem with the education system in
                  a certain school? And everytime a student complains about their
                  teacher, it is seemed as inappropriate and rude.</p>
              <p>I have also written public some of the bad things that happened
                  in my school, and one being here about a teacher I dislike. Given
                  how tight such things are, what if the school found out what i
                  wrote and sends their <strong>person</strong> to approach me?Given
                  the way my username is my real name, it will be easy to identify
                  me. If they do, how should I respond especially when the teacher
                  seems to be always right while the student is always wrong?</p>

              <p>I have graduated from secondary school last year, and have seen first hand how my teachers scold students, and also heard how they punish the students</p>
              <p>Based on what i heard from my friends(maybe 1 sided), my secondary school is known to be one of the more 'unreasonable' ones. I think the reason behind it is because a teacher who have been teaching for over 10 years would be more 'egoistic' than the rest(how ever not all teachers are like that), and thus even if the student's reasoning skills win the teacher, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the teacher does not want to lose face in front of all his/her colleagues</span></p>
              <p>So do students have rights? They still have, but the amount of rights they have is based on their behaviours, relationship with teachers, and are benchmarked against their classmates. Of course, even the worst student have some kind of rights.</p>
              <p>What i am trying to say is that be a good student in ur school, you will have your rights, and if you are unhappy about things, post them annonmously online/on STOMP or on newspaper, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">pretend you did nothing in front of the teachers</span></p>

              <p>More normal ones i remember once we did not sing the national anthem loud enough or something, the discipline master lecture the whole schhool in the parade square and it starts to drizzle, and the discipline master continued to lecture in the rain, some people are unhappy about this</p>
              <p>Normally my school make them lose face infront of their friends, that is also another 'form' of punishment, also standing under the sun, conducting firedrills twice becos the 1st one was not done well</p>
              <p>still have somemore, but i cant remember them now</p>

              <p>personally i feel tat students nowadays have more rights than during my time which was in the late 80s and 90s...in those days, u could get punish for almost anything(depending on the personality of the teacher)...of cuz there were nice teachers but there were also those who belonged to the older generation who belived tat punishments were needed to discipline and guide students...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>at least, i noe tat nowadays teachers have to be very careful in laying their hands on students lest the students' parents complain...they cun even use most of the punishments meted out during my time...tat to me is plenty of rights...</p>

              <p><br>Teacher are also human mah, govt can also get corrupted, not said teachers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why nobody mention about the Principal, he/she is the sole responsible for the school teachers behavior. If teacher are those play acting and pointing finger type, i guess it show alots about the Principal leadership quality</p>
