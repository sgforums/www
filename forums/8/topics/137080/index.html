            <div class='col-md body'>George Bush meets with the Queen of England.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;He asks her, "Your  Majesty, how do you run such an efficient<br>&gt;&gt;government? Are there any tips  you can give to me?"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"Well," says the Queen, "the most important thing is to  surround<br>&gt;&gt;yourself with intelligent people."<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Bush frowns. "But how do I know the people around me  are really<br>&gt;&gt;intelligent?"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;The Queen takes a sip of  tea.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"Oh,  that's easy. You just ask them to answer an intelligence<br>riddle".<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;The Queen pushes a  button on her intercom.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"Please send Tony Blair in here, would you?"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Tony Blair walks into the room.  "Yes, my Queen?"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;The Queen smiles. "Answer me this, please, Tony. Your mother  and<br>&gt;&gt;father have  a child. It is not your brother and it is not your<br>&gt;&gt;sister. Who<br>is<br><br>&gt;&gt;it?"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Without pausing for a moment, Tony Blair answers, "That would be<br>me."<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"Yes! Very  good," says the Queen.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Back at the White House, Bush asks to speak with vice president  Dick<br>&gt;&gt;Cheney.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"Dick, answer this for me. Your  mother and your father have a child.<br>&gt;&gt;It's not your brother and it's not your sister. Who is  it?"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"I'm not  sure," says the vice president. "Let me get back to you on<br>&gt;&gt;that one."<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Dick Cheney goes to his advisors  and asks every one, but none can<br>give<br><br>&gt;&gt;him<br>&gt;&gt;an answer.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Finally, he ends up in  the men's room and recognizes Colin Powell's<br>&gt;&gt;shoes in the next stall.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Dick shouts, "Colin!  Can you answer this for me? Your mother and<br>&gt;&gt;father have a child and it's not  your brother or your sister. Who is<br>&gt;&gt;it?"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Colin Powell yells back, "That's easy. It's me!"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Dick Cheney smiles.  "Thanks!"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Cheney goes back to the Oval Office to speak with Bush.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"Sir, I did some  research and I have the answer to that riddle. It's<br>&gt;&gt;Colin Powell."<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Bush gets up, stomps over to  Dick Cheney, and angrily yells into his<br>&gt;&gt;face, "No, you idiot! It's Tony  Blair!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. After 20 Years<br>&gt;<br>&gt;   There was this couple that had been married for 20 years. Every time<br>&gt;   they made love the husband always insisted on shutting off the lights.<br>&gt;   Well, after 20 years the wife felt this was ridiculous. She figured she<br>&gt;   would break him of this crazy habit. So one night, while they were in<br>&gt;   the middle of a wild, screaming, romantic session, she turned on the<br>&gt;   lights. She looked down ... and saw her husband was holding a battery<br>&gt;   operated pleasure device... a vibrator... soft, wonderful and larger<br>&gt;   than a real one. She goes completely ballistic. " You impotent bastard,<br>&gt;   " she screamed at him, " how could you be lying to me all of these<br>&gt;   years? You better explain yourself! The husband looks her straight in<br>&gt;   the eyes and says calmly: " I'll explain the toy ... if you explain the<br>&gt;   kids. "<br>&gt;<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How to Mess With the IRS<br><br>(Internal Revenue Service, an agency of the government to whom Americans pay taxes on their salary.)<br><br>--Always put staples in the right hand corner. Go ahead and put a down the whole right side. The extractors who remove the mail from the envelopes have to take out any staples in the right side.<br><br>--Never arrange paperwork in the right order, or even facing the right way.  Put a few upside down and backwards. That way they have to remove all your staples rearrange your paperwork and re-staple it (on the left side).<br><br>--Line the bottom of your envelope with Elmer's glue and let it dry before you put in your forms, so that the automated opener doesn't open it and the extractor has to open it by hand.<br><br>--If your very unfortunate and have to pay taxes use a two or three party check.<br><br>--On top of paying with a three party check pay one of the dollars you owe in cash. When an extractor receives cash, no matter how small an amount, he has to take it to a special desk and fill out of few nasty forms.<br><br>--Write a little letter of appreciation. Any letter received has to read and stamped regardless of what it is or what it's on.<br><br>--Write your letter on something misshapen and unconventional. Like on the back of a Kroger sack.<br><br>--When you mail it, mail it in a big envelope (even if its just a single EZi form). Big envelopes have to be torn and sorted differently than regular business size ones. An added bonus to the big envelope is that they take priority over other mail, so the workers can hurry up and deal with your mess.<br><br>--If you send 2 checks they'll have to staple your unsightly envelope to your half destroyed form.<br><br>--Always put extra paper clips on your forms. Any foreign fasteners or the like have to be removed and put away.<br><br>--Sign your name in ink on every page. Any signature has to verified and then date stamped.<br><br>NOTE: These are just a few of the fun and exciting things you can do with The Man. These methods are only recommended when you owe money<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There once was this deacon and this preacher, and they had been friends for a long time. One day the deacon got sick and was put in the hospital, so the preacher decided to go and see his old friend.<br>When he walked into the hospital room, the preacher noticed all the hoses and medical equipment attached to the deacon. The preacher walked over and kneeled by the bed and asked, ''How ya doing?''<br><br>The deacon motioned at a pad and pen on the nightstand. ''You want that?'' the preacher asked him, and the deacon nodded his head yes. So the preacher handed his friend the pad and pen and the deacon began to write. All of a sudden the deacon died.<br><br>At his funeral, the preacher was asked to deliver the service. ''He was a good man and I'll never forget him,'' the preacher said, ''I was with him when he died and as a matter of fact I have his last thought in my coat pocket here.''<br><br>The preacher reaches into his pocket and pulls out the paper. ''Please, get up! You're kneeling on my oxygen hose!''<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The Pope dies and, naturally, goes to heaven. He's met by the reception committee, and after a whirlwind tour is told that he can enjoy any of the myriad recreations available. He decides that he wants to read all of the ancient original text ofthe Holy Scriptures, and spends the next eon or so learning the languages. After becoming a linguistic master,he sits down in the library and begins to pore over every versionof the Bible, working back from the most recent "Easy Reading" to the original script. All of a sudden there is a screamin the library. The angels come running to him, only to find the Pope huddled in a chair, crying to himself, and muttering, "An 'R'! They left out the 'R'." God takes him aside, offering comfort and asks him what the problem is. After collecting his wits,the Pope sobs again,"It's the letter 'R' ... the word was supposed to be CELEBRATE!"<br><br></div>
