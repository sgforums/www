            <div class='col-md body'>another luv story making the email round.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>happy reading!<br><br>-------------------------------------------------<br>My grandparents were married for over half a century, and played their own special game from the time they had met each other. The goal of their game was to write the word "shmily" in a surprise place for the<br>other to find, as soon as one of them discovered it, it was their turn to hide it once more.<br><br>They dragged "shmily" with their fingers through the sugar and flour containers to await whoever was preparing the next meal. They smeared it in the dew on the windows overlooking the patio where my grandma always fed us warm, homemade pudding with blue food coloring.<br><br>"Shmily" was written in the steam left on the mirror after a hot shower, where it would reappear bath after bath. At one point, my grandmother even unrolled an entire roll of toilet paper to leave shmily on the very last sheet.<br><br>There was no end to the places "shmily" would pop up. Little notes with "shmily" scribbled hurriedly were found on dashboards and car seats, or taped to steering wheels. The notes were stuffed inside shoes and left under pillows. "Shmily" was written in the dust upon the mantel and traced in the ashes of the fireplace. This mysterious word was as much a part of my grandparents' house as the furniture.<br><br>It took me a long time before I was able to fully appreciate my grandparents' game. Skepticism has kept me from believing in true love - one that is pure and enduring. However, I never doubted my grandparents' relationship. They had love down pat. It was more than their flirtation little games; it was a way of life.<br><br>Their relationship was based on a devotion and passionate affection which not everyone is lucky enough to experience.<br><br>Grandma and Grandpa held hands every chance they could. They stole kisses as they bumped into each other in their tiny kitchen. They<br>finished each other's sentences and share the daily crossword puzzle and word jumble. My grandma whispered to me about how cute my grandpa was, how handsome an old man he had grown to be. She claimed that she really knew "how to pick'em." Before every meal they bowed heads and gave thanks, marveling at their blessings: a wonderful family, good<br>fortune, and each other.<br><br>But there was a dark cloud in my grandparents' life: my grandmother had breast cancer. The disease had first appeared ten years earlier. As always, Grandpa was with her every step of the way. He comforted her in their yellow room, painted that color so she could always be<br>surrounded by sunshine, even when she was too sick to go outside. Now the cancer was once again attacking her body. With the help of a cane and my grandfather's steady hand, they still went to church every morning.<br><br>But my grandmother grew steadily weaker until, finally, she could not leave the house anymore. For a while, Grandpa would go to church alone, praying to God to watch over his wife. Then one day, what we all dreaded finally happened. Grandma was gone.<br><br>"Shmily." It was scrawled in yellow on the pink ribbons of my grandmother's funeral bouquet. As the crowd thinned and the last<br>mourners turned to leave, my aunts, uncles, cousins and other family members came forward and gathered around Grandma one last time.<br><br>Grandpa stepped up to my grandmother's casket and, taking a shaky breath, he began to sing to her. Through his tears and grief, the song came, a deep and throaty lullaby.<br><br>Shaking with my own sorrow, I will never forget that moment. For I knew then that, although I couldn't begin to fathom the depth of their love, I had been privileged to witness its unmatched beauty.<br><br>S-h-m-i-l-y: See How Much I Love You.<br><br>Thank you, Grandma and Grandpa, for letting me see.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jane looked over her past with Derrick, her most beloved husband who passed away two years ago due to a flight accident. Derrick was a pilot and all his life, he had been flying. Jane liked the way Derrick handled her and the way Derrick handled his plane, his work everything. She love him till now and the pain hurts till now. She will just recall the time where she first known Derrick and smile to herself.<br><br>It had been exactly five years since Jane first met Derrick at the airport. Jane was planning to visit her mom in London. That night, she was waiting at the airport. With several long hours before her flight, she hunted for a book in the airport shop. Finally bought a bag of cookies and found a place to rest her tired body.<br><br>She was engrossed in her book but happened to see That the man beside her, as bold as he could be, grabbed a cookie or two from the bag between then. She tried to ignore, to avoid a scene. She read, munched cookies, and watched the clock. As the gutsy "cookie thief" diminished her stock. She was getting more irritated as the minutes ticked by. Thinking, "If I wasn't so nice, I'd blacken his eye!" With each cookie she took, he took one too. When only one was left, she wondered what he'd do. With a smile on his face and a nervous laugh, he took the last cookie and broke it in half.<br><br>He offered her half, as he ate the other. She snatched it from him and thought, "Oh brother, this guy has some nerve, and he's also rude, Why, he didn't even show any gratitude!" She had never known when she has been so galled, and sighed with relief when her flight was called. She gathered her belongings and headed for the gate, refusing to look back at the "thieving ingrate." She boarded the plane and sank in her seat. Then sought her book, which was almost complete.<br><br>As she reached in her baggage, she gasped with surprise: There was her bag of cookies in front of her eyes! "If mine are here," she moaned with despair, "Then the others were his and he tried to share!" Too late to apologize, she realized with grief, That she was the rude one, the ingrate, the thief! Feeling guilty about the whole thing but was unable to do much. As the plane landed in London, she peeked through the window for her mom who promise to pick her up. Just as her eye slide through the blurly screen, she saw the same guy that she met at the airport. Jane was delighted and rushed down to the exit. "Hey you!!" Derrick looked back and was surpise by this lady calling up to him "Yes, Madam can i help you ??" Jane took out her remaining bag of cookies .... "Want some??"<br><br>------------------<br>One line has no meaning, another line is needed to give it expression.<br><a href="http://zhaoyun.cjb.net" rel="nofollow">zhaoyun.cjb.net</a><br><a href="mailto:zhaoyun@onebox.com" rel="nofollow">zhaoyun@onebox.com</a><br></div>
