            <div class='col-md body'>Love at first sight ....<br><br>There was once a guy who suffered from cancer... a cancer that can't be treated. He was 18 years old and he could die anytime. All his life, he was stuck in his house being taken care by his mother. He never went outside but he was sick of staying home and wanted to go out for once. So he asked his mother and she gave him permission. He walked down his block and found a lot of stores. He passed a CD store and looked through the front door for a second as he walked. He stopped and went back to look into the store. He saw a young girl about his age and he knew it was love at first sight. He opened the door and walked in, not looking at anything else but her. He walked closer and closer until he was finally at the front desk where she sat. She looked up and asked<br><br>Can I help you?<br><br>She smiled and he thought it was the most beautiful smile he has ever seen before and wanted to kiss her right there. He said Uh... Yeah... Umm... I would like to buy a CD. He picked one out and gave her money for it. Would you like me to wrap it for you? she asked, smiling her cute smile again. He nodded and she went to the back. She came back with the wrapped CD and gave it to him. He took it and walked out of the store. He went home and from then on, he went to that store everyday and bought a CD, and she wrapped it for him. He took the CD home and put it in his closet. He was still too shy to ask her out and he really wanted to but he couldn't. His mother found out about this and told him to just ask her.<br><br>The next day, he took all his courage and went to the store. He bought a CD like he did everyday and once again she went to the back of the store and came back with it wrapped. He took it and when she wasn't looking, he left his phone number on the desk and ran out... Ah-RRRRRING-Ah The mother picked up the phone and said, Hello? It was the girl She asked for the boy and the mother started to cry and said, You don't know? He passed away yesterday... The line was quiet except for the cries of the boy's mother. Later in the day, the mother went into the boy's room because she wanted to remember him. She thought she would start by looking at this clothes. So she opened the closet. She was face to face with piles and piles and piles of unopened CDs. She was surprised to find all those CDs and she picked one up and sat down on the bed and she started to open one. Inside, there was a CD and as she took it out of the wrapper, out fell a piece of paper. The mother picked it up and started to read it.<br>It said:<br><br>Hi... I think U R really cute. Do u wanna go out with me?<br>Love,<br>Jacelyn<br><br>The mother opened another CD... Again there was a piece of paper.<br>It said:<br><br>Hi... I think U R really cute. Do u wanna go out with me?<br>Love,<br>Jacelyn<br><br>Remember to always say what you mean. If you love someone, tell them. Don't be afraid to express yourself. Reach out and tell someone what they mean to you. Because when you decide that it is the right time, it might be too late. Seize the day. Never have regrets. Love makes life live !!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Waiting for True Love<br>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br><br>As I walked home one freezing day, I stumbled on a wallet someone had lost in the street. I picked it up and looked inside to find some identification so I could call the owner. But the wallet contained only three dollars and a crumpled letter that looked as if it had been in there for years.<br><br>The envelope was worn and the only thing that was legible on it was the return address. I started to open the letter, hoping to find some clue. Then I saw the dateline--1924. The letter had been<br>written almost sixty years ago. It was written in a beautiful feminine handwriting on powder blue stationery with a little flower in the left-hand corner. It was a "Dear John" letter that told the recipient, whose name appeared to be Michael, that the writer could not see him any more because her mother forbade it. Even so, she wrote that she would always love him. It was signed, Hannah.<br><br>It was a beautiful letter, but there was no way except for the name Michael, that the owner could be identified. Maybe if I called<br>information, the operator could find a phone listing for the address on the envelope.<br><br>"Operator," I began, "this is an unusual request. I'm trying to find the owner of a wallet that I found. Is there anyway you can tell me if there is a phone number for an address that was on an envelope in<br>the wallet?"<br><br>She suggested I speak with her supervisor, who hesitated for a moment then said, "Well, there is a phone listing at that address, but I can't give you the number." She said, as a courtesy, she would call that number, explain my story and would ask them if they wanted her to connect me. I waited a few minutes and then she was back on the line.<br><br>"I have a party who will speak with you." I asked the woman on the other end of the line if she knew anyone by the name of Hannah. She<br>gasped, "Oh! We bought this house from a family who had a daughter named Hannah. But that was 30 years ago!"<br><br>"Would you know where that family could be located now?" I asked. "I remember that Hannah had to place her mother in a nursing home some years ago," the woman said. "Maybe if you got in touch with them they might be able to track down the daughter." She gave me the name of the nursing home and I called the number.<br><br>They told me the old lady had passed away some years ago but they did have a phone number for where they thought the daughter might be living. I thanked them and phoned. The woman who answered explained that Hannah herself was now living in a nursing home.<br><br>This whole thing was stupid, I thought to myself. Why was I making such a big deal over finding the owner of a wallet that had only three dollars and a letter that was almost 60 years old?<br><br>Nevertheless, I called the nursing home in which Hannah was supposed to be living and the man who answered the phone told me, "Yes, Hannah is staying with us. " Even though it was already 10 PM, I asked if I<br>could come by to see her. "Well," he said hesitatingly, "if you want to take a chance, she might be in the day room watching television."<br><br>I thanked him and drove over to the nursing home. The night nurse and a guard greeted me at the door.<br><br>We went up to the third floor of the large building. In the day room, the nurse introduced me to Hannah. She was a sweet, silver-hair old timer with a warm smile and a twinkle in her eye. I told her about<br>finding the wallet and showed her the  letter. The second she saw the powder blue envelope with that little flower on the left, she took a deep breath and  said, "Young man, this letter was the last contact I ever had with Michael." She looked away for a moment deep in thought and then said Softly, "I loved him very much. But I was only 16 at the time and my mother felt I was too young. Oh, he was so handsome. He looked like Sean Connery, the actor."<br><br>"Yes," she continued. "Michael Goldstein was a wonderful person. If you should find him, tell him I think of him often. And," she<br>hesitated for a moment, almost biting her lip, "tell him I still love him. You know," she said smiling as tears began to well up in her eyes, "I never did marry. I guess no one ever matched up to Michael . . . ."<br><br>I thanked Hannah and said goodbye. I took the elevator to the first floor and as I stood by the door, the guard there asked, "Was the old lady able to help you?" I told him she had given me a lead. "At least<br>I have a last name. But I think I'll let it go for a while.<br><br>I spent almost the whole day trying to find the owner of this wallet." I had taken out the wallet, which was a simple brown leather<br>case with red lacing on the side. When the guard saw it, he said, "Hey, wait a minute! That's Mr. Goldstein's wallet. I'd know it<br>anywhere with that right red lacing. He's always losing that wallet. I must have found it in the halls at least three times."<br><br>"Who's Mr. Goldstein?" I asked as my hand began to shake. "He's one of the old timers on the 8th floor. That's Mike Goldstein's wallet for sure. He must have lost it on one of his walks." I thanked the guard and quickly ran back to the nurse's office. I told her what the guard had said. We went back to the elevator and got on. I prayed<br>that Mr. Goldstein would be up.<br><br>On the eighth floor, the floor nurse said, "I think he's still in the day room. He likes to read at night. He's a darling old man." We went to the only room that had any lights on and there was a man reading a<br>book. The nurse went over to him and asked if he had lost his wallet.<br><br>Mr. Goldstein looked up with surprise, put his hand in his back pocket and said, "Oh, it is missing!" "This kind gentleman found a<br>wallet and we wondered if it could be yours?" I handed Mr. Goldstein the wallet and the second he saw it, he smiled with relief and said, "Yes, that's it! It must have dropped out of my pocket this<br>afternoon. I want to give you a reward."<br><br>"No, thank you," I said. "But I have to tell you something. I read the letter in the hope of finding out who owned the wallet." The<br>smile on his face suddenly disappeared. "You read that letter?" "Not only did I read it, I think I know where Hannah is." He suddenly grew pale. "Hannah? You know where she is? How is she? Is she still as pretty as she was? Please, please tell me," he  begged. "She's fine...just as pretty as when you knew her." I said softly.<br><br>The old man smiled with anticipation and asked, "Could you tell me where she is? I want to call her tomorrow." He grabbed my hand and said, "You know something, mister, I was so in love with that girl that when that letter came, my life literally ended. I never married. I guess I've always loved her. "<br><br>"Mr. Goldstein," I said, "Come with me." We took the elevator down to the third floor. The hallways were darkened and only one or two little night-lights lit our way to the day room where Hannah was sitting alone watching the television.<br><br>The nurse walked over to her. "Hannah," she said softly, pointing to Michael, who was waiting with me in the doorway. "Do you know this man?" She adjusted her glasses, looked for a moment, but didn't say a word. Michael said softly, almost in a whisper, "Hannah, it's Michael. Do you remember me?"<br><br>She gasped, "Michael! I don't believe it! Michael! It's you! My Michael!" He walked slowly towards her and they embraced. The nurse and I left with tears streaming down our faces. "See," I said. "See how the Good Lord works! If it's meant to be, it will be."<br><br>About three weeks later I got a call at my office from the nursing home. "Can you break away on Sunday to attend a wedding? Michael and Hannah are going to tie the knot!" It was a beautiful wedding with all the people at the nursing home dressed up to join in the<br>celebration. Hannah wore a light beige dress and looked beautiful. Michael wore a dark blue suit and stood tall. They made me their best man. The hospital gave them their own room and if you ever wanted to see a 76-year-old bride and a 79-year-old groom acting like two teenagers, you had to see this couple. A perfect ending for a love<br>affair that had lasted nearly 60 years.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Not quite the regular but as touching ...<br><br>Rudy's Angel<br>------------<br>I walked into the grocery store not particularly interested in buying groceries. I wasn't hungry. The pain of losing my husband of 37 years was still too raw.  And this grocery<br>story held so many sweet memories.<br><br>Rudy often came with me and most every time he'd pretend to go off and look for something special. I knew what he was up to. I'd always spot him walking down the aisle with the three yellow roses in his hands. Rudy knew I loved yellow roses.<br><br>With a heart filled with grief, I only wanted to buy my few items and leave, but even grocery shopping was different since Rudy had passed on. Shopping for one took time, a little more thought than it had for two.<br><br>Standing by the meat, I searched for the perfect small steak and remembered how Rudy had loved his steak. Suddenly a woman came beside me. She was blond, slim and lovely in a soft green pantsuit. I watched as she picked up a large pack of T-bones, dropped them<br>in her basket, hesitated, and then put them back. She turned to go and once again reached for the pack of steaks. She saw me watching her and she smiled.<br><br>"My husband loves T-bones, but honestly, at these prices, I don't know."<br><br>I swallowed the emotion down my throat and met her pale blue eyes. "My husband passed away eight days ago," I told her. Glancing at the package in her hands, I fought to control the tremble in my voice. "Buy him the steaks. And cherish every moment you have together."<br><br>She shook her head and I saw the emotion in her eyes as she placed the package in her basket and wheeled away.<br><br>I turned and pushed my cart across the length of the store to the dairy products.   There I stood, trying to decide which size milk I should buy. A quart, I finally decided and moved on to the ice cream section near the front of the store. If nothing else, I could always fix myself an ice cream cone.<br><br>I placed the ice cream in my cart and looked down the aisle toward the front. I saw first the green suit, then recognized the pretty lady coming towards me.  In her arms she carried a package. On her face was the brightest smile I had ever seen. I would swear a soft halo encircled her blond hair as she kept walking toward me, her eyes holding mine.<br><br>As she came closer, I saw what she held and tears began misting in my eyes.<br><br>"These are for you," she said and placed three beautiful long stemmed yellow roses in my arms. "When you go through the line, they will know these are paid for." She leaned over and placed a gentle kiss on my cheek, then smiled again.<br><br>I wanted to tell her what she'd done, what the roses meant, but still unable to speak, I watched as she walked away as tears clouded my vision. I looked down at the beautiful roses nestled in the green tissue wrapping and found it almost unreal. How did she know?<br><br>Suddenly the answer seemed so clear. I wasn't alone. "Oh, Rudy, you haven't forgotten me, have you?" I whispered, with tears in my eyes. He was still with me, and she was his angel.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, guys/gals.... here is the continue of the story for Love Vacation....<br><br>At the time where Minami moved in with Seina, Minami still can't forget her past with her boyfriend (Asakura). One night they sat together, drinking wine and talking to each other about their love ones. She then ask Seina if he has got anyone that he loves. Seina then relate to her how he has secretly love he's junior (Ryoko). Seina and Ryoko are both aspiring pianist waiting just for the right moment to win the important contest to be a truly renown pianist. Minami than say something nasty to Seina and Seina also said something nasty back to her. At that moment they both fell silent. Minami then told when she is born. At that moment, Minami told Seina how Asakura has court her. At 27, Minami just break up with her another boyfriend before Asakura came into view. At the time of her birthday, Asakura phoned Minami and wish her Happy Birthday and 12 mignight sharp always for 3 years. Minami told Seina that she thought that it would last forever but now that has all been smashed. Now she is a bride whose groom has runaway on the wedding day. Quite sad at this moment for Minami. Inorder to break that awful moment, Seina show Minami some neat trick with a rubber ball. Minami also wanted to try that trick out. The first it was successful but the second time, the ball got lost. As the ball is one of the item that Minami and Asakura have won during use of one of the toys vending machine, it is of great treasure to Minami. As the ball got lost, Seina wanted to go and fetch back the ball but was stopped by Minami. It is at this point I feel that Minami wanted to let go of the old romance. The next day, Minami went and find back the ball and spent one whole day at home waiting for phone calls. Meanwhile, Seina who is working at a Piano Teaching School for kids, while marking the attendance, know that the day is 15 April. After a hard day at work, Seina went home and Minami told him that she has answered his phonecalls. Seina become angry at her for answering his phonecalls. Being a nice man, Seina requested Minami to replay the message. Minami told him that Ryoko has called, upon hearing this Seina become very depressed. In Japan, man and woman don't usually live together in the same flat unless they have some relationship. Minami then told Seina that the piano contest that he last took is not successful and also one of his student has fallen sick and would like to take leave for tomorrow lesson. Seina being very upset and depressed went into his room. Minami then talk something nasty and they both have a  verbal fight and ended up Minami deciding to leave the apartment. As Minami was leaving, Seina went and tidy up the room and found out the reason for Minami answering his phone calls. Today is her birthday. She was waiting for Asakura to phone her. Knowing this, Seina knows that he has made a big mistake. He ask Minami to come back but Minami being mad at the moment, refuses to go back. Seina being very sorry, started to play on his piano "Happy Birthday" song. After that, using his true feeling, he compose a very nice song for Minami. Minami upon hearing the birthday song got all soft and upon hearing the second song, her heart melted. (Sugoii!!!) She went back to the apartment. Just then, the phone ring but....it's not Asakura.<br><br>I think the story is very long and it would take a long time to write it out here so please please, if u have the chance go and get the drama. Any request is welcome.<br><br>Jaa ne.<br>NERV.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>As romantic and sad, from Singapore.<br><br>**  A Diary  **<br>---------------<br>*January 2*<br>Do you still remember the first time we met?  It was the first day of in school.  I was hurriedly entering the school gate when I bumped into you as you stepped out of a luxurious Volvo. The books you were holding fell all over the ground.I quickly picked up the books and returned them to you along with words of apology, but all you showed me was your intimidating look. My first impression of you was that you were a wilful girl born with a golden spoon in the mouth.  I had rejected you completely and had hoped not to meet you again, but surprisingly you turned out to be my classmate.<br><br>*March 22*<br>I started to know more about you as days passed and my opinion of you changed for the better on each passing day.  I realised that you were from a wealthy family but definitely not a wilful girl. You were nice and friendly.You got angry that day we first met because I had left a footprint marking on the poetry collection you loved dearly. We met often during lunch break and I found something in you that was different from the rest of the girls -- your passion for Chinese poetry. Often you would mumble something to yourself. Initially, I thought that you were humming a pop song but later I realised that you had been reciting Chinese poems from great poets.You were so knowledgeable that you knew every poet and which poems they composed. I was very impressed indeed.<br><br>*April 5*<br>I met you again in the study area.That day you were reading the Chinese classics "Romance of the 3 kingdom". Your ability to appreciate Chinese classics left me with admiration. You were indeed unique in many ways.<br><br>*May 5*<br>From then on, we would often meet in the study area to discuss about the good and bad things of the character in these Chinese classics. Do you still remember the time when we almost broke off because we could not agree on whether Jia Bao Yu hurt Lin Dai Yu? Our argument was so fierce that we never talked for that week. But when Friday came,we still met in the study area and laughed over the incident. After which, another argument<br>started.<br><br>*Aug 7*<br>I could not deny it.  It was a feeling I could not identify accurately. Whenever you laughed over a joke with other guys, that emotion filled my senses. It took me a while before I identified it. I was in love; the feeling was jealousy. I felt the need to express it. But, I was afraid... that you would dismiss my feeling, that you and I would be stuck in an embarrassing situation,that our long nurtured friendship would crumbled...therefore, I kept quiet.<br><br>*Oct 1*<br>The news came as a shock to me.I was so worried when I learnt that you had fainted in the canteen. I was struggling to keep my worried face in ctrl as I looked at the ambulance that carried you away.<br><br>*Oct 2*<br>It was drizzling that day.  Our form teacher sadly announced that you had got cancer. As she finished her last sentence, outside the classroom, it seemed to me that the drizzle had turned into a downpour. I could only hear the sound of the rain, nothing more.I rushed to NUH ICU to see you immediately after lesson. Your face was whitish in colour, showing no trace of red.I learnt that you had just undergone an operation. The<br>life-support system was just beside you with tubes piercing mercilessly into your left wrist. "I am all right, it is just a serious case of anemia. Believe me, my parents told me that". you said convincingly. I knew fully well what you were thinking, you did not want me to be worried. " Are you comforting yourself or comforting the fears and hopelessness that was written all over my face?", I thought to myself. I was not strong enough to disagree with you and I nodded my head with a forced smile.You responded with a smile too -- with great effort.<br><br>*Oct 5*<br>It was a ordinary day but to me, it was an important day.  I felt an impulse to express my love. I walked over to the side of your bed, holding your hand. I told you the story of how an ordinary guy fell in love with a girl who likes poetry and Chinese classics. As I told my story, my eyes started to flood with water, and uncontrollably my voice started to choke,and finally I broke into tears. But you held my head against your body and with watery eyes, said: "I understand such a love, so did the girl." I returned my eyes to her and at that moment, her tears dropped, and for the first time, I saw some redness on her lips.<br><br>*Oct 26*<br>It was the last day of examination and I rushed to NUH to continue my story. When I reached there, I only saw the nurse arranging the bed you once slept on. When I asked about you, the nurse told me expressionlessly that you had passed away. It was a bolt from the blue for me. I stood motionless for a long time. I hated myself for spending the last few days preparing for the last examination paper. I hated myself for not staying<br>longer the last time I visited you. I hated myself so much... but you were gone...... I can't remember how I got home that day. When I woke up, I was already in my room.The pillow I slept on was wet. The next day, I went for the funeral. I heard from your father that on the day you passed away, you were still reading the poetry collection I gave you as a gift for your birthday. Standing in front of your portrait,I had no tears, they were<br>used up on the day of your death. All I knew was sadness, my hearts was like shattered into pieces and died.<br><br>*Jan 2*<br>A new girl has taken over your seat. She does not like poetry, but she likes to hum pop songs.When I asked her if she knows Jia Bao Yu, she replied: "What talking you." Yes, you were gone. But to me, the seat is still unoccupied, and maybe no one will ever occupy it......<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All, this is not realli a love story but something 4 u all to read<br><br>John Blanchard stood up from the bench, straightened his Army uniform, and studied the crowd of people making their way through Grand Central Station.  He looked for the girl whose heart he knew, but whose face he didn't, the girl with the rose. His interest in her had begun thirteen months before in a Florida library.  Taking a book off the shelf he found himself intrigued, not with the words of the book, but with the notes penciled in the margin. The soft handwriting reflected a thoughtful soul and insightful mind. In the front of the book, he discovered the previous owner's name, Miss Hollis Maynell. With time and effort he located her address. She lived in New York City.<br><br>He wrote her a letter introducing himself and inviting her to correspond.  The next day he was shipped overseas for service in World War II. During the next year and one-month the two grew to know each other through the mail.  Each letter was a seed falling on a fertile heart. A Romance was budding. Blanchard requested a photograph, but she refused. She felt that if he really cared, it wouldn't matter what she looked like.<br><br>When the day finally came for him to return from Europe, they scheduled their first meeting - 7:00 PM at the Grand Central Station in New York.<br>"You'll recognize me," she wrote, "by the red rose I'll be wearing on my lapel."  So at 7:00 he was in the station looking for a girl whose heart he loved, but whose face he'd never seen.<br><br>I'll let Mr. Blanchard tell you what happened: A young woman was coming toward me, her figure  long and slim.  Her blonde hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears; her eyes were blue as flowers.  Her lips and chin had a gentle firmness, and in her pale green suit she was like springtime come alive.  I started toward her, entirely forgetting to notice that she was not wearing a rose.  As I moved, a small, provocative smile curved her lips.  "Going my way, sailor?" she murmured. Almost uncontrollably I made one step closer to her, and then I saw Hollis Maynell.  She was standing almost directly behind the girl. A woman well past 40, she had graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump, her thick ankled feet thrust into low-heeled shoes. The girl in the green suit was walking quickly away.  I felt as though I was split in two, so keen was my desire to follow her, and yet so deep was my longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned me and upheld my own. And there she stood.  Her pale, plump face was gentle and sensible, her gray eyes had a warm and kindly twinkle.  I did not hesitate.  My fingers gripped the small worn blue leather copy of the book that was to identify me to her.  This would not be love, but it would be something precious, something perhaps even better than love, a friendship for which I had been and must ever be grateful. I squared my shoulders and saluted and held out the book to the woman, even though while I spoke I felt choked by the bitterness of my disappointment.  "I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard, and you must be Miss Maynell.  I am so glad you could meet me; may I take you to dinner?" The woman's face broadened into a tolerant smile.  "I don't know what this is about, son," she answered, "but the young lady in the green suit who just went by, she begged me to wear this rose on my coat. And she said if you were to ask me out to dinner, I should go and tell you that she is waiting for you in the big restaurant across the street. She said it was some kind of test!"  It's not difficult to understand and admire Miss Maynell's wisdom. The true nature of a heart is seen in its response to the unattractive.   "Tell me whom you love," Houssaye wrote, "And I will tell you who you are."<br><br>------------------<br>One line has no meaning, another line is needed to give it expression.<br><a href="http://zhaoyun.cjb.net" rel="nofollow">zhaoyun.cjb.net</a><br><a href="mailto:zhaoyun@onebox.com" rel="nofollow">zhaoyun@onebox.com</a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Touching......... sad........... Heres one.<br><br>Eric fought to hold back the angry tears, glistening in his bloodshot<br>eyes.He lifted his head and glazed at the stars twinkling upon the midnight<br>sky. The world seemed so peaceful tonight.<br><br>Everything looked fine.Faint sounds of crickets in the overgrown grass, the<br>occassional roar of a car speeding by... Everything looked fine but to<br>Eric, it wasn't. His lips quivered and his hands shook with emotion.<br>Without meaning to, Eric started bawling. What had he done? He thought<br>about the times he had with Regine. Times that he never treasured.<br><br>Eric and Regine had known each other since forever. They were in the same<br>school for 7 years and they had even been in the same class for a  couple<br>of years. Regine had been a really great friend.<br><br>Although not exactly drop dead gorgeous, Regine was beautiful in her<br>own way. She had a certain style which you cannot describe. Maybe<br>it was the way she carried herself or the sensitivity reflected in her<br>almond-shaped eyes... There was definately a certain grace about<br>her.<br><br>Eric knew that he could always count on Regine. She was always there<br>for him, helping him all that she could. She was a really great friend,<br>always so giving and thoughtful.<br><br>At that time, Eric was in love with Angel, the most beautiful girl in the<br>class. Angel was absolutely gorgeous, with her striking, trim figure, long<br>silky hair and flawless complexion. Eric wasn't the only one who was<br>totally crazy about her. He confided this to no one but Regine. Regine<br>didn't like Angel. She thought Angel was somehow<br>pretenious but being the good friend she always was, Regine gave Eric<br>her full support and even devoted herself to endless hours on the<br>phone, listening to mooning over his dream girl. Eric remembered<br>the day Regine went with him to the florist to pick out some flowers<br>for Angel. It was supposed to be a St. Valentine's Day bouquet and he<br>had wanted it to be a special one.<br><br>Regine had put together a beautiful bouquet of roses, complete with baby's<br>breath. Eric took the magnificent bunch to school the next<br>day and waited by the gate for Angel to come. He was nervous and<br>his knees had turned to jelly. What if Angel doesn't like it? Just then,<br>Regine came by. She nodded to him and gave him an encouraging smile. His<br>confidence immediately went up several notches.Eric glanced down at the<br>bouquet and discovered that on the tip of the petal of one rose was turning<br>slightly brown.He frowned. Though it was hardly noticeable, he took it out<br>of the bouquet. He could not give that to Angel. Angel deserved the best.<br><br>Eric caught up with Regine and gave her the brown-tipped rose. He<br>meant to ask her to throw it away before Angel could see it.<br><br>Regine's eyes widen,as she took the rose. "Is that for me? Thanks, Eric."<br><br>Her eyes shone with happiness as she gave him a wide smile. "Oh erm...<br>yeah." Eric didn't know what to say. Regine gave him a slight push.<br>"Go and wait for Angel now. She would be here any minute."<br><br>Eric ran off thankfully, a little ashamed of himself. But his guilt<br>vanished as soon as he saw Angel coming into the school gate. He<br>pushed the flowers eagerly into Angel's hands and glazed at her<br>like a hopeful little dog. Angel took the flowers and gave him a hundred<br>megawatt smile. Eric was over the moon. The next few weeks were<br>followed by long phone calls, moonlight walks and lovey dovey words.<br>Eric felt like he was the happiest guy on earth. He began to see less<br>and less of Regine and felt a little guilty about that. But he always<br>brushed it off by thinking that Regine would understand that he had<br>got to care for his girlfriend now.<br><br>As days passed, Angel started giving him the cold shoulder.<br>Finally one day, Angel told Eric that she did not want to see him<br>anymore. "The thrill is gone." she said in a cold sort of voice.<br>Seconds later, she sped away with some guy on a Harley Davidson,<br>leaving Eric in the dust. His world came crushing down on him.<br><br>Within an hour, everyone learnt about it and they were snickering<br>and making some "toad thinks he could have swan meat" remarks. Eric<br>felt that his world was bleak. He felt trapped, as though he was in<br>a long, endless tunnel in total darkness. That was when a warm glow<br>of light appeared at the other end of the tunnel... Regine. She had<br>picked up all the broken pieces and tried to fix it all back in one<br>piece. She was a real friend.<br><br>One night, Eric and Regine were sitting in the cafe for their usual coffee.<br>Eric began telling Regine all about the scenerio with Angel and how he<br>still loved her. He did not notice that Regine was strangely quiet until<br>she suddenly spoke. "Eric, there's something I want to say." Eric looked at<br>her solemn, sad face in alarm. "What is it, Regine?" She gripped her hands<br>tightly until her knuckles turned<br>white.<br><br>"Eric... I like you." she whispered. "Regine, I like you too. In<br>fact, I think of you as my very best friend." "No, Eric, you don't<br>understand.I like you. I mean... really like you." Eric gasped in<br>disbelief. He looked as though he had been slapped across the face.<br>"Regine, you don't mean that!" he protested. Regine nodded miserably,<br>a tear trickling down the side of her face. "But you can't, Regine.<br>I like Angel." Eric continued, weakly.<br><br>"I know, Eric. I'm not asking anything. I just want you to know<br>because... because... I can't bear to help you with Angel anymore.<br>I cannot lie to myself any longer. I'll go mad, I really will, Eric."<br><br>Regine broke down sobbing. The night ended in a very awkard way.<br>Neither of them spoke to each other. They had said a hurried goodbye<br>and went their own separate ways. They never spoke to each other<br>again.<br><br>Eric slumped himself on the ground, his chest heaving and his<br>breath quicken with every sob. He had been so blind! He had finally<br>realized what a fool he had been. How could he NOT notice the<br>false, insincere smile of Angel's? The sacarstism in her sickly sweet<br>voice and her laughter which sounded like fingernails on a chalkboard...<br><br>How could he have ever thought she was beautiful? And how could she<br>ever compared with Regine...<br>Regine, who was so touched by an imperfect rose with a brown tip... who was<br>so giving, so appreciative... who was always there to pick him up after his<br>falls... And he had never even given her a decent rose... Why did he only<br>realize it now??? WHY???<br><br>Well, what he could do now was to go and find Regine and patch things up<br>with her. Then, they will live happily after, right?<br><br>Wrong.<br><br>Because Regine is dead. She had been sitting in her balcony, looking at the<br>rose that Eric had given her, only that it was all brown and crumpled now.<br>Nevertheless, she still kept it and looked at it all the time. The wind had<br>swept the flower out of her hand and in her haste to retrieve it, Regine<br>had fallen off the balcony. Eric never had the chance to tell her anything<br>and he never will again.<br>He had shut his heart to Regine after what happened with Angel. He had<br>not even really liked Angel but he THOUGHT he had. It was too late<br>to realize that now.<br><br>Dawn broke, sending streaks of sunlight over the morning sky.Eric recalled<br>what Regine had said to him once before. "Let the break<br>of dawn mark a new beginning. Leave all your troubles behind." He<br>would do just that. He had depended too much on Regine to pick up<br>all his broken pieces. He had to do that himself now. He owed Regine<br>that much. Eric took a last glance at Regine's freshly dug grave,<br>whirled round and walked off slowly, leaving the shadows of the past behind<br>him...<br><br>Are YOU keeping your heart shut?<br>Are YOU yearining for someone whom you know is unobtainable?<br>Are YOU still living in the past or dwelling over failed relationships?<br>The ONE for YOU may be just by your side but are YOU seeing the Regine in<br>them or are YOU still lost in the past with Angel?<br><br>Woman is not made of a man's head to climb over him,<br>She is not made from his feet to be trampled on,<br>But from his rib to be by his side as an equal,<br>Under his arms to be protected and close to his heart to be loved.<br><br>Mind.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One Moment Please ....<br><br>"So, how do you develop a relationship?" This question was asked of me when I was doing a Relationship Service seminar for the YMCA. I have to admit that the question caught me off guard for a brief second. We had been talking "theory" all day and this woman wanted some concrete methods for developing client or, for that matter, any relationship. After pausing for a minute to collect my thoughts, I stated that the only thing I could do was tell her the truth from my experience. Somewhat shyly, I began to tell her the story of how my wife and I saved our relationship. My mind flashed back to a time when Karen and I were at a State Fair and I won two red velvet hearts as a consolation prize in one of the midway games. I broke apart the two hearts and gave one to Karen and kept one for myself.<br><br>We had been married for 10 years and were going through a bit of a "flat spot" in our relationship. We still loved each other, but something was missing. Karen did not want the "flatness" to continue so one day she came up with a plan. She took one of the hearts and hid it in my towel while I was taking a shower. When I went to grab my towel, the red heart spilled out. As I bent down to pick it up, I was overcome with a rush of emotion that made me flash back to the time when I won the red hearts and the love we felt for each other at that moment. I then hid the heart in her sock drawer. She hid it in my underwear drawer. I hid it in the refrigerator. She wrapped it in plastic wrap and hid it in the peanut butter. Hiding the heart became as much fun as finding it. Each time we hid or found it was a moment to be treasured, like the first moment we fell in love or the first moment we kissed or the first moment we looked into our child's eyes. Each is a cherished and precious moment.<br><br>How do you develop a relationship?

            <div class='col-md body'>Alike ....<br><br>They have known each other since school days and have since become the closest of friends. They shared everything and anything and spent lots of time together in and after school. But the friendship never develops more than friends. Diane kept a secret... her admiration and love for Jack. She has her reasons for keeping it a secret.<br><br>FEAR!!<br>Fear of rejection...<br>Fear that he might not feel the same...<br>Fear that he might not want to be her best friend anymore...<br>Fear of losing someone that she can find comfort in...<br><br>At least if she keeps her feelings to herself, she might still be able to spend time with him and hopefully, he might be the one to tell her how he feels towards her. Time passes by and soon, school days were over. Jack and Diane went separate ways. Jack's Dad decided to move his business oversea and Jack had to continue his studies there while Diane got herself a job.<br><br>They kept in touch through penned letters, sent each other photographs and mailed each other gifts. Diane longed for Jack to be back. She have decided that she would have the courage to tell him her feelings once he's back. And then out of the blue the mails from Jack stopped coming. Diane wrote to him, but there's no reply. Where is he? What happened? Lots of questions run through her mind.<br><br>Ten years passes by and Diane was still hopeful that Jack would come back or at least send her a note. And then its as if her prayers were heard. She received a letter from Jack's family. It said<br><br>Diane,<br>I am so sorry to send you this mail about my husband Jack who died of cancer a year ago. Just recently, I peeped through his daily and discovered a lot of his past which he had never mention to me before. Back to the days when we met, he told me that he fallen in love with me at first sight. We got married not long after that. Through the years, he had been a great husband and father. Till now then i realise that you are the one in his heart. I had attached our wedding photo and also our address. I hope you can drop by to send your offering.<br>Lynn<br><br>Diane was down with tears falling upon her cheeks. She lift her little fingers to pull out the photo that is neatly attach to the letter. She could not believe her eyes on the photo.<br><br>From the photo, she knew that Jack actually love her. If only she had say it to him ten years ago. Jack's love meant so much to a Diane who have not tasted love before. Diane knew that she will never fall in love with another guy other than Jack.<br><br>------------------<br>One line has no meaning, another line is needed to give it expression.<br><a href="http://zhaoyun.cjb.net" rel="nofollow">zhaoyun.cjb.net</a><br><a href="mailto:zhaoyun@onebox.com" rel="nofollow">zhaoyun@onebox.com</a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is very long. but quite sad. saddest of the stories i have read b4<br><br>------<br><br>met her on the net, how?.. I can't remember. but it seems to me that it is this 'little theory' which I declared in the cyberspace that caught her attention. 'if I have a million dollars, I would buy a house. do I have a million? No. that's y I dun have a house. if I have wings, I can fly. do I have wings? No. so I can never fly. if all the waters are drawn out of Pacific Ocean, but it still can't put off the flame of love between us. can all the waters of Pacific Ocean be drawn off? No. that's y I dun love u. that's me, a typical science student. 1st u come up with an assumption, then u fit a suitable conclusion. If the proposed assumption doesn't stand at all, then everything is just bullshit. I guess this is what they call 'unromantic'. but she is an exception. she actually mailed me and said that I m an 'interesting' person. 'interesting'?.. what a word to use on me, its like using 'faithful' on Mr. Clinton. I thought this gal must be a low-IQ organism, or suffering from serious brain damage. anyway, her nick doesn't seems so bad- FLYNDANCE- that's quite a unique one. but I was warning myself: hello, this is the virtual world of Internet. who knows what might be lurking behind a beautiful nick. Talking from experience, most of the time it will be a 'dinosaur' in disguise, the only differences will be whether it is a carnivore or a herbivore. but, I know she is way different from a 'dinosaur', she is special.<br><br>So I guess its time for the appearance of FlyNDance. ever since she mailed to tell me that I m 'interesting', I was always wishing to meet her in #ajcrr. Too bad, lady luck was just not on my side. So I can only reply her letter to tell her that I will start to train myself to become an 'interesting' person, just to show that she is far-sighted. She replied my reply, I replied her reply to my reply, she again replied my reply to her reply blah blah blah...<br>Oh no, I just started a chain-reaction. Actually what interested me the most is this 'para' she wrote in one of the mails....<br>I dance swithtly, amidst the crowd.<br>your glance on me<br>be it surprise, be it admiration, it ain't gonna stop my rhythm<br>'COs it's not your glance that made me dance,<br>it's my heart of youth.<br>I simply cannot relate this gal to any of the 'dinosaurs'. But if she really is a dinosaur, I m willing to let her have her fill. Tye, my best pal unfortunately, noticed my little affair with FlyNDance, and has been perpetually warning me about this....<br>"HELLO!!!... u don't even know what she looks like, y take the risk??.. maybe 'she' is a guy!!... haha!!.."<br>I can't blame Tye for his ignorance. Ever since he was dumped by Sally in Sec4, he has become a renowned 'playboy'. As the saying goes: "Once bitten, Twice shy", in this case, after Tye was bitten, he has mastered the art of skinning snakes alive, and make into soup. But he got all the factors to be a playboy, I always think he is the 19 year-old version of Brad Pitt. Tall, handsome and got this tongue that causes diabetes in every women he targets. I dun think he can even remember how many girlfriends he had had. I went online that night, log onto channel ajcrr and yesh!!... she is there.<br>Before I can get over the surprise and the daze, she sent me a message.....<br>"hey slorr.. so late liao haven't slept ahh??"<br>Now what? Now what??!!.. okok, I had to calm down 1st. I swallowed hard on my saliva, took a few deep breath. Now where is that Tye when I needed him most at such crucial moment, somebody to tell me what to say to her. How m I going to attract her with my pathetic humour which has gone stale. "slorr... me in a foul mood today.. can't sleep.. u leh??"<br>MOTHER'S(direct translation to chinese), what slorr slorr... now when I read it twice in a row, I m beginning to feel disgusted in that nick Tye gave me. Tye said that: "who knows.. it might attract some innocent gals in talking to u... haha.."<br>"I m not feeling very good too.... so lets sad together."<br>Finally squeezed a sentence out, but I can already feel droplets of sweat forming on my forehead. Actually I m not in a bad mood, I just wanna follow up her topic that's all. And if she ask for the reason for my feeling down, I can say: "since u r feeling down, how can I ever be happy?..." I know it sounds mushy, but Tye said:<br>"MUSHYNESS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL COURTSHIP".<br>And gals are a very weird species, they trust their ears far more than their eyes. So instead of doing 10 things to impress her, why not just say a sentence to move her.<br>"ok... but u haven't greet me leh..."<br>DAMNIT!.. how can I forget simple manners to gals. To think they call me 'MR COURTEOUS' in school. If this thing ever leaks out in school, I would lost all my female fans.<br>"nice to meet u... miss long-hair.."<br>I've been wishing that she's keeping long hair. Tye said that:<br>"FlyNDance... hmm.. she would either be long-haired or a desperado, 'COs when gals dance, only 2 parts of them may fly: hair and skirt. So if she doesn't has long hair, that means her skirt flys when she dances, AH-HA!!.. this has a certain sexual hint in it...haha.."<br>"eh?... how u know I got long hair?.."<br>BINGO!!.. heaven is on my side this time. It goes to prove that she is not a DESPERADO. yesh!!.. "not only that.. I also know u seldom wear skirt.."<br>I increased the stake, if I m correct this time, peace on earth forever.<br>"err... I guess u r rite lor.. but how u know one?.."<br>HAHAHAHAHA.... I m good ahh...<br>"just guess..."<br>"ok lor... hey slorr... tell u wat.. me tired liaoz... u coming online tomorrow morning??..."<br>"ya... y??.."<br>Please please please say the u coming too, if not I m going to kill myself for letting u go tonight.<br>"I'll see ya tomorrow at 10 am then...good night..."<br>"er.. should be today at 10 am.. ok.. good night too"<br>I just blurted out a last sentence....<br>Offline. Suddenly I was so impressed by my performance just now.<br>But is the season of spring really arriving for me??... I wish.<br>"slorr... what a coincidence ahh..."<br>yeh... I m not late.<br>"ya lor... so qiao.."<br>gals are weird, I thought we already had an arrangement, y do I have to pretend that its not. they must have watched too many movies, and like to think that guys they met due to the thing called 'fate' is the best thing that can happen to their love life. "slorr.... u talking nonsense lah..." NONSENSE???.. ok, let me tell u what nonsense. Summer's beach, the guy must be good at running, with broad shoulders, dark complexion with a tint of redness, sparkling eyes and loud laughter. Then he will call out loud the name of the gal, running towards her, carry her and spin 3 rounds anticlockwisely. "slorr.... u siao liaoz ahh??"<br>I siao?.. ok.. lets change a location then. Deep in the mountains, the guy must have long hair, gotta have the look of an artist, carries a sketching stand, a few pieces of drawings, and u can see birds stop over at his side, admiring his work. and there will be a gal whose the model.... most problemably naked. "slorr.. but these all very romantic mah..."<br>ROMANTIC??.. hello miss... romance only survive in novels and movies. In real life, the guy on the beach may step onto broken glass or the gal may be too heavy which tore his arm muscles. Birds may just clear their waste on top of the guy in the mountains, or he might get a thrashing from the gal because he comments on the excess fats around the waist and hips.<br>"slorr... u hate romance??.."<br>I hate romance?... nope, I m just using my knowledge of statistic to get a deduction, that guys must be TALL to be romantic, not HANDSOME!!!.. some love novels even portrayed the guy as normal looking, but no-one dares to challenge the height of him!.. I object.... because I m not tall.<br>"slorr.... objection overruled..." I think I m really outstandingly bo liao, talking to her about these until noon. "slorr... are u hungry?..."<br>"ya... u leh??...."<br>"yesh... guess its time for lunch...slorr.." "then do u think we should....??"<br>"slorr... I m just asking... I dun intend to have lunch with u..."<br>ok, good.. I m not romantic... neither are u.<br>I had lunch with Tye, we talk about the conversation with FlyNDance this morning.<br>"U moron... told her u r not romantic... u siao ah?.." "u have disgrace me man... how can u make such a big mistake?....I...I..." Tye grabbed a chicken wing with chopstick, and I can see the trembling of the hand and the wing. "there are 3 'don'ts' in chasing a gal... one...dun forget to be romantic,.. two ... dun be too honest... 3... dun be too stingy on the sugar in our speech... noticed number 1, u stupid??"<br>what rubbish is that??....<br>"In mandarin we say 'nan ren bu huai, nu ren bu ai', u should know this..."<br>this I know, but it has been a controversial topic over centuries. "women aren't really that... cheap.. so y would they only falls for 'bad guys' like me??... that's because 'bad guys' are usually romantic... those 'nice guys' are usually... dumdums...so she would rather choose a romantic 'bad guy' rather than any of those dumdums... in maths we call this 2C1...understand?...dumdum.."<br>oh, Tye is talking about maths!!.. now I understand. No wonder I have always been left on the shelf. "in another words... gals wouldn't mind if u r not tall... if u r not handsome... they can bear with ur inconsiderate acts...can forget ur stupidity...but they can never forgive if u r not romantic..." come on, this is so exaggerating. "hey... most women have a 'knot' for romance.. just like most men have a 'knot' for virginity... to women they just can't understand how precious the thin layer of membrane is to men, same thing, men can't imagine how important women treats romance. this is bullshit! how come I've never heard of that. "the key word is 'knot'...if u can untie it... fine.. but how many had actually succeeded in that... practically none..." ok, fine. now I've done it... so what should I do to remedy the situation?<br>"face it... u r hopeless already... I promise u I'll have a drink with u when u and her are over..."<br>U SONOFABITCH.<br>Mid-night. I m trying to concentrate on my physics notes....F=ma,v=u+at...it's really a wonder that nature can be explained by just a few formulas and equations, and this we call science. then y is astrology and palmistry being labeled as superstitious? science should only be one of the ways to explain truth, wat can't be explained by science, it doesn't necessary mean that's its unreal.... Close to 1am. since I can't get anything into my head, I shall try my luck on net then, maybe she is there... "slorr...u here finally... good night to u... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.." 'FINALLY'? strange word to use it here.<br>Wat is she doing here at this hour? must be feeling down again.<br>"yes... it is fate that brought me to u at this moment..."<br>I m trying very hard to convince her that I m a bit romantic.<br>"slorr... nothing to do with fate...I waited 4 u 4 one hour liaoz..."<br>"sure or not?.. for wat?.."<br>"talk to u mah...or else I can't sleep..."<br>"u sick izzit?... go see doctor lah..."<br>" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">...."<br>"slorr....let's continue our topic.. wat do u think of relationships began from internet?..." oh my god... how should I answer her now?<br>"its.. its very... romantic..."<br>indeed I m not a good liar, even my words are shaking now.<br>"slorr... u bluffing... u not romantic one mah..."<br>GAME OVER. I m finished!.. no choice but to drink with Tye.<br>"slorr.... u lagging?... or just daoing me?..."<br>"no... I m wondering y is the sky so chio tonight?.."<br>"nonono... dun try to shift the topic... slorr..."<br>sigh... I give up... I asked for it myself. Actually I think relationships started from cyberspace is considered as ROMANTIC, 'COs romance gives pple an impression of unreal, and cyberspace is virtual. "slorr....that's interesting.." 2 surfers keep a safe distance from each other and usually 3 types of pple are produced in this way.<br>The 1st type....<br>The 1st type being those who present themselves on net with their 'secondary personality'. Usually all of us consists of multiple personalities, and in everyday life, wat we present to the world is the 'primary personality', with the secondary one being suppressed, or maybe we dun even realised this other trait of us deep inside. so internet is the place where this side of us is revealed, both intentionally or without conscious knowledge.<br>"izzit true?... wat about 2nd type?.."<br>the 2nd type are those who will transform themselves into the kind of man/woman he/she would want to be. theres bound to be 1 or 2 characteristics that u particularly admire, too bad, sometimes these characteristics are just couldnt be found in u. cyberspace is the perfect location for this transformation to occur.<br>"slorr.... u blowing cow izzit?.. type 3 leh?..."<br>I m not blowing cow, I read it from an article of TIMES mag!! type 3 will be those who transform themselves into characters which are impossible for them to become in real life. for example, if u r a gal, you may act as a man on net. you may even become BATMAN or SUPERMAN if u want. "hm.. thats pretty amazing..." the 1st type is the 'faithful' type, 'cos its his own personality that is being presented on net. the 2nd type is the 'foolish' type, 'cos he knows only how to admire others, always forgets his own strong pts. the 3rd type is the 'pathetic' type, 'cos he is wishing 4 some impossible.<br>"slorr.... den u belong to wat type?... me leh?.." i dun wish to believe u r type 3, 'cos i m not. I crossed the possibility of type 1 'cos its too common, because i think u r special. being able to attract u, i think i m at least a bit specila. so we belong to type 2. "type2.... den who u wish to become?..slorr.." i certainly would like to become a person like Tye, humorous, romantic and eloquent, 'cos these are wat i m lacking of.<br>"slorr.... wat about me?.." U?.. i dun know. U want to FLY and DANCE, problemably that means u wish to fully enjoy ur youth while u can. but if this is somethng u wish yet u can't achieve, den theres 2 possibilities: 1, u r aging, 2, u r leaving the world. i think i said something wrong, 'cos she didn't sent me anymore msg after this.<br>i began to blame myself for being so perverted, y talk about these things?.. I should have discussed with her whether ZOE or FANN, who should be the queen of caldecott hill. damn that TIMES mag, poison my mind.maybe she's lagging. so i waited... and waited. although its just a few minutes, but it felt like several hours. i want to apologize, but do not know how to start. until she sent me this msg: "slorr... lets meet..." without hesitation, i used the hand that I had used it over 18 years to wipe my ass, typed 'O-K'.<br>I m supposed to meet FlyNDance tonight , 8pm, at the entrance of Mcdonalds, the one beside YMCA. that's the best time and place to meet a gal u have never met b4, according to Tye, 'COs they would have taken their dinner by that time which means we can simply go inside the Mc and have some fries and coke. she will be wearing a whole set of coffee theme attire and I will be wearing my usual blues, this is our way of identification.she told me she is not those 'cute gals' I may think she is, I said nevermind, I m not Brad-pitt either. then she told me she has long ago given up on this hope already.<br>"slorr... u r early..."<br>while I was idling, a gal tapped my shoulders from my back. althoh I was oridi mentally prepared for anything that's gonna appear in front of me, I was still astonished by this gal who stood in front of me now. if not for the coffeee theme and that 'slorr', I would think she is only asking for directions. 'COs she is one of those chio buz that can only be found on orchard road, usually while I m crossing the road. maybe I suffered from a serious concussion due to the heavy blow, my mind was extraordinarily calm. "had ur dinner rite?.. I think we shall go inside the Mc 1st..."<br>"u r pretty smart huh?... a good way to save money indeed..."<br>AIYA!~!... she knows me soooo well, I can only give her an innocent smile back. since she's so pretty, I ordered 2 LARGE cokes, and even ordered TWO packets of fries. "this time u treat, next time i'll let u treat..." I m not falling for that, miss... but I m glad she mentioned 'next time'.<br>"slorr... r u disappointed when u saw me just now?.." DISSAPPOINTED?... r u drunk?.. "y do u think I will be disappointed then?.." "'cos i told u i m not cute mah, so u must be quite dissappointed when u saw me.." she is making 0 sense, but i know she is just trying to hint that she's actually cute. "then y did u have to lie that u r not cute?" "slorr... i said i m not cute... i didn't say i m not pretty.."<br>#$%$##%^*&amp;%$@!!!<br>"but u r also quite....decent looking what.. its not like what u described to me too.."<br>'DECENT'? a very vague word. to many gals, decent=boring. one good thing is that she didn't lie to me about the fact that she is keeping long hair. she also has a fair complexion which reminds me of HL milk I take almost everyday.<br>it is now only that i found out she is from ACJC, but had spent her 1st 3 mths in AJ. sitting in front of each other, we talk about many things. from her obsession with coffee to my hobby of watching movies. in btw, she had completely shoke off my misconception of 'if she is pretty, she is brainless'. she appears to be an attractive gal, both physically and character wise, talking, smiling to me, occasionally being a little sarcastic and nasty. its like a dream. we left the Mc at around 10 pm. since its still early, i decided to send her home and fortunately, its just Ang Mo Kio, two MRT stops from mine. i would have a second thought if she's staying at Pasir Ris.<br>"slorr... congratulations.... u r officially permitted to date me from now on..." she said this b4 the lift door closed. back at home, i realized that i hadn't asked for her real name, maybe its the influence of that stoopid Tye. Tye told me:" never ask a pretty gal her name the 1st time u meet her, 'cos there are oredi too many wolves out there dying to know, so she will be more interested in you if u act bochap..." then y didn't she ask for mine? dun tell me theres a female version of Tye telling her not to?<br>it's again 1am. time to meet her in ajcrr. "hi!... slorr.. u tired?..."<br>of 'cos i m tired after all the surprises she presented me, i would go straight for my bed if not for her. but y is she here also?... isn't she tired too?..<br>"long time no see.. how r u?.."<br>"slorr u siao ah?... 2 hours only leh.. miss me?..." "A)yes.. B)of'cos.. C)abuden...D)dying to see u...E)all of above.... answer is E..." " <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">..." seems like she is really tired, even the smiling face are yawning to me rite now.<br>"u wanna go for a movie tomorrow?.." maybe i should ask her now, while she is half asleep, hoping that she will blur-blurly click 'OK'.<br>"should be no problem... what show?... HOOOOORAY!!... i m cheering for her fatique.<br>"we decide what show tomorrow... anyway whats important is watch with who... not the show.." Tye's fav line, i m just borrowing it. " <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">..."<br>"u should go sleep now lah..."<br>"wait one little while... u haven't tell me u tired or not?.."<br>"ok lah... a bit.... u leh?.."<br>"i m exhausted.... but have to say good night to u 1st... slorr..if not i can't sleep..<br>"me too...."<br>i can't believe i m doing this SILLY business rite now....<br>"ok i tell u what.... i count 1,2,3... then we log off together..."<br>"ok.... good night slorr..."<br>"same to u.."<br>"1...."<br>"2..."<br>"3.."<br>i never talk whenever i m inside a cinema, and now is the best time for my mouth to rest, so I spent the following 3 hours to admire this much-talked-about movie of the century, Titanic. i m not a romantic person, so its perfectly understandable if i can't really appreciate this motion picture fully, except for all those stunning special effects. but something stroke me when Jack said to Rose b4 he sank into the deep.....<br>"Rose, listen to me... listen.... winning that ticket was the best thing that had happened to me... it brought me to u.... and i m thankful, Rose.... i m thankful...."<br>suddenly i felt much fortunate than Jack, 'cos I dun have to risk my life to board Titanic, all I have to do is to switch on my PC every night. But he's one lucky guy too, 'cos he knows how to draw, and just look at how slowly he was drawing Rose, that made me blame myself for the lack of this talent.<br>But to her, this movie wasnt just about drawings or special effects. i noticed that packet of tissue paper she was holding in her hand. and just when Rose said:" i promise... i will never let go, Jack... i'll never let go.."she opened up her sling bag and here comes the reserve handkerchief. Damn that celine Dion, y on earth did she had to sing that "MYHEART WILL GO ON" at the end of the show, for all the female species inside the theater, its like "MY TEARS WILL ALSO GO ON".<br>"Ok... movie ended...lets go...." i stood up, speak to her gently, worried that every single word i breath out might just crush onto her, and kill her. she continued to sit on the position, looked at me with her beautiful eyes that just came back from a swim. after a while, she said... "slorr.... movie ended..... but life goes on.. m I rite?..."<br>i nodded my head... but i just wished somebody might give me some clue of what she was saying. finally we managed to leave Orchard cineplex, since its still early, we decided to take a walk down the street. along the way, she seems unusually quiet. so I guess Tye was rite about the 'TITANIC FLU', he said that gals often got so mentally distressed after watching this show, and its the best time to launch an emotional attack on her, thats y Tye had watch Titanic for over 5 times roughly. her eyes were focussed on the path or the crowds but i know her mind was still left on Titanic, sinking with her, waiting for somebody to pull her up. i just kept my mouth shut 'cos I know i m not a good swimmer. we walked to Plaza Singapura. suddenly she stopped in front of a Christian Dior counter. "slorr.. have u read a novel called 'fragrance'?..."<br>"err..nope.... y do u ask?..." "look at this 'DOLCE VITA' from Christian Dior... its what the guy bought for her girlfriend in the story on her birthday.... and he told her 'DOLCE VITA' is french, meaning 'SWEET TIMES'..." she pointed to a bottle of perfume at the counter, but i was more interested at the price tag around the neck of the bottle. "oh... izzit?..." "slorr... then do u consider today as 'sweet times'...?"<br>"at first i do... but some pts are deducted since u started crying..."<br>"that means it can only be considered a little bit sweet, i'll buy the small bottle then..." i insisted to pay for the perfume as her bdae present from me since i know her birthday is coming soon, this kinda saves me a lot of trouble of finding a present for her.<br>luckily its just perfume, i would have to pawn my underwear if that guy in the story gives her girlfriend diamond or gold bar. "r u hungry?.... wanna sit down and have something?..." "i dun have appetite... what about u?.." "you eat, i eat...." her eyes are red again...... i m such a fool.<br>finnally got away from the noisy crowd at the mrt station, walking on one of the steets of AMK ave6. contrastingly, its so quiet now that i even can hear the rythm of her heartbeat."slorr... do u know what's the correct way of applying perfume?...."<br>i shoke my head. in fact, i had never used a perfume or cologne b4, medicated oil maybe."1st u apply some behind ur ears... then ur neck and wrists... after that spray some onto the air, then walk throughit..."<br>"sure or not?... in that case this little bottle wont even be able to last u for 3 days...."<br>"slorr.. shall we try?..."<br>"'we'?... u go ahead... i m a MAN..." she opened up that DOLCE VITA... behind her ears, neck then the wrist she applied some... and she really did spray some onto the air!!... WABIANGZ!!.. expensive leh!... finnaly she stretched out her hands... facing up... like enjoying the raindrops fallling on her face... "hahaha.... slorr... this is so fun!.... now its ur turn...." she went through the same procedures with me and i can feel the coldness of he fingers. maybe its the perfume... i guess.<br>"slorr... get ready... i m going to spray!!..." i imitated her.. face up... and walked through my 1st perfume rain.<br>"slorr lets have another round!!..." WHAT!!... serious?.. my money isn't easy to come by leh!!.... b4 i can collect the broken pieces of my heart, she had walked through her second round. she was even more excited this time, hoping around, like her nick.... a flying and dancing butterfly. late night of AMK, the streets smells unusually nicer rite now. until we finished the whole of that DOLCE VITA.<br>"DOLCE VITA is exhausted... i guess this sweet time shall end now too.... slorr.. i'll go up now.... tonight 1am. i wont be online, and u r not to do so too..."<br>"huh?....but why?...."<br>"go online at 12pm tomorrow.. u will know....remember... only12pm..."<br>she turned and walked into the lift... at the same time... i saw an obvious pink patch behind her neck... which is visible only now be'cos she tied her hair.<br>i looked up towards her window on the 4th floorfrom below, but it never light up. i switched off the light in my room... engulfed in the absolute darkness... 'cos i wished to have the same kind of feeling as her right now... i realised in complete darkness... the easiest mood one gets... is loneliness.. she must be lonely rite now... half asleep.. i almost can see a beautiful butterfly.. turning to ashes amidst the sea of flame... and that patch behind her neck.. from pink it became red... then burgundy.. slowly.. it wallowed me.... was it the cause of that can of beer just now?... suddenly i felt cold... and shaky.. and that coolness seemed to have come straight from my heart... the rate of my heartbeat was an exponential function of time as it got closer to 1am... USE A DIFFERENT NICK!!... checked .. she isn't there.... my heart was beating fast... but the temp remained below healthy level........<br>finally its 12 pm, excited as i was, logged on the net, yet there was still no sign of FlyNDance. But theres a mail from her......<br><br>Dear slorr,<br>At first i thought it will be easier for me to settle down in the darkness... recollecting memories we have shared... but all i felt was loneliness...... can u feel it too?... I still can't change the habit of logging on at 1am... so i used a different nick to sneak into AJCRR... u dun blame me right?...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">... u werent there... should i feel glad for ur obidience?.... U said both of us belonged to TYPE 2... the foolish type... maybe u r right!... 'cos I really do admire those who dares to fight for their desires... I stroke my hair gently when u said that i m leaving the world... and a few strands of hair fell..... No!... doctor told me its not a terminal disease... and doctor aren't supposed to lie!!?... I still can live like a normal person... BUT CAN I?..  FlyNDance... is it really something i wont be able to do?... After the 1st meeting with u at Mc... I started to realise that u r not only a virtual being living in the cyberspace... in reality u r strong, gentle and sensitive.... i can feel the defense wall of my heart is slowly breaking apart.... i m defeated... I tied my hair today.. 'cos my fren told me that i look more attractive this way... I want u to remember my face as it is today... 'cos after today... everything may change.... But why didn't u ask for my real name?..thats why i never asked for urs... i m a gal mah..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">... do u realised how i wish to have something more than a nick to take along with me?...<br>Slorr... thank u for the DOLCE VITA... finally got a taste of what sweet times are like... but i m really sorry..... i just couldnt bear to say goodbyz..... since it started from a mail.... it should end with a mail too.... Its been 3 months and 2 days since the very 1st mail... not a very long time but it isn't short either.... our story began from me... and I will end it..<br>Maybe its what u said... 'internet is fast and convenient, but it isn't perfect'.... I can send u my thoughts right away... but not my tears... Its about 5.30am now.... time to go.... by the time u receive this mail... i would be trying to settle down somewhere else.... i dun know....<br>Good Bye.<br><br>With lotsa love,<br>FlyNDance<br><br>After reading her mail, i felt as if i had just experienced a roller-coaster ride which Almost derailed. she had shown me the other side of her, soft and sensitive. For a couple of mths, i was trying to hypnotise myself, to suppress my feelings whenever I started to think about her again. Perpetually i was telling myself, she is just one virtual character that flys and dance in the net, but never in the real world. I became a fugitive, escaping from my PC, escaping from the internet and anythng that has to do wih coffee<br>. Hide myself behind the piles of lecture notes, behind the crowd of pple, trying to get rid of this thought of missing something in life. But i failed. I found out that its not that i dun miss her, its just that i had forgotten the passion that always comes along when u r having something hanging on ur mind all the time. its like i cannot not breath, its just that I had forgotten the fact that i have been breathing in and out for the past 19 years. i can hold my breath for a while, but not forever. i have to find her.<br>"err... i m looking for ... er.. FlyNDance...."<br>"HUH??..." 'huh'.... this is the exact word i was expecting from her. she seems to be FlyNDance's elder sister, 20++, looked quite a beauty too even without any makeup. But of 'cos, still can't be compared with her... I explained to her my purpose for knocking on the door and told her that i m no stalker whom she might think i m. surprisingly when i told her my disgusting nick, slorr, she appeared to be rather excited and quickly she scribbled something on a small piece of paper and handed it to me.....<br>"u should go and see her.." SGH, Room 3-425<br>This is the 1st time i've ever stepped into the Singapore General Hospital. its a dust-free space, everything looked soo clean, tidy and arranged. But i dun like the feeling it gave me... I entered room 3-425, she was there, in a deep sleep... i stood by her, watching... her hair was still as long as before, laying across the soft, White pillow... her face looked roundish now, I know it's the side-effect of the medicine... and the pinkish-red patch that was on her neck had spread to her face... appearing in a shape of a butterfly..<br>nevertheless.. she was still the most beautiful butterfly i've ever seen... Her eyelashes twitched slightly.. she must be dreaming... what's that in her dream??... Mcdonald's fries and coke?.. sinking Titanic?.. or the rain at AMK ave 6?.. The room was getting darker as the clock approaches 6pm.. i wanted to switch on the light... 'cos I hate to see her lying lonely under the shadow of a patient's room.... But i m worried that her dreams might be disturbed by the sudden light rays... while i was in a dilemma.. her eyes opened slowly... Her eyes were wide on me.. then she turned away suddenly.. i can only see her back<br>at this moment... she lost weight... after a long time.. she turned to face me again.. rubbed her eyes... and smiled.... "slorr.. u r here!..."<br>"yes... nice weather today.. isn't it?.."<br>"ya lor.. sky also very chio today?.. right?...heehee.." 'SKY VERY CHIO'... i can still remember this was the conversation we had in one of our AJCRR meetings... But she didn't realized that it's raining today... "slorr.... why r u standing there.. sit down.."<br>thanks for reminding me.. i just found out that my legs were numbed due to the several hours of standing... "slorr... u lost weight..." ME?.. i thought i should be the one whos telling this to her!!??....<br>"slorr.. u hungry?... had ur lunch?.."<br>"food here isn't so good.. thats why patients like me always slim down a bit.."<br>"apart from that.. its quite ok.. but sometimes i feel really bored without a PC here to talk to u.."<br>"slorr.. hows ur mid-year?.. sure did very well right?.."<br>WAIT A MINUTE!.. u r the one who's lying on bed right now!!.. not me!....<br>Yet.. i had nothing to ask her actually.. 'cos I was there to see her.. not to find out the answers to those questions.. maybe now its the time for me to utter some touching lines like whats in the case of a movie..<br>But i m not a Romantic person... moreover... movies are fiction.. life isn't..<br>I just wished that she could leave this place which almost made me sick as soon as possible... back to AMK ave6, back to ACJC, back to where she belonged.... and i promised she wont be alone anymore.. 'cos I will always be there... After a while... her mum was here to see her.. around the age of 50, slightly overweight.. other than the cheerful smile... she didn't really remind me of FlyNDance...<br>"err... i think i've gotta go now... bye bye auntie.."<br>"You....You..." she sat up straight in a sudden.. like experienced a tremendous shock... "i'll be here again tomorrow.. and the day after tomorrow... until u leave this lace..."<br>before i went back home, i went to Plaza Singapura again to buy that Christian Dior Dolce Vita...and i've got the biggest bottle this time, that she can even swim in it.<br>i try not to close my eyes that night, 'cos I want to go to her as soon as the 1st sun ray shoots into my room. i hired a cab, didn't want to waste too much time on bus.<br>"slorr.. u r here.. i've been waiting for u for a long time..."<br>"had a good night's rest?..." "oh... i didn't allow myself to fall into a deep sleep... 'cos i know u wont wake me up when ur here..." "then u should take a rest now..." "err... since u r here lready... i dun think I can..." I gave her the Dolce Vita, and we'd agreed that we would dance in the rain in front of SGH main entrance the day she's discharged. i dare not look straight at her... 'cos theres a butterfly on her face.. it was only last night b4 I leave SGH that i found out she's suffering from an illness called ERYSIPELAS.. what the unproffesionals call the BUTTERFLY DISEASE...<br>but i what i like is the coffee butterfly that is able to dance around freely.... not that pinkish-red butterfly that settled on her pale complexion... moreover.. whats a butterfly if it can't fly.... "slorr.. why r u looking at me.. and not talking?..." i dun know...'cos i noticed that shes getting weaker physically... I had a bad feeling about this... "slorr... i m thirsty... can u get me a drink?.." I m not leaving her at this moment. i can still remember a movie about this guy who went all the way to get red bean soup for his girlfriend who's on sickbed... and to find her lying silently on the white bedsheet when he came back... never to wake up again... "r u trying to get rid of me... like whats in that movie?.." "slorr... movie is movie... life is life..." MOVIE?.. LIFE?....<br>"but i thot u just had a drink?... anyway.. so what can i get for u?..."<br>"Ultimate Ice Blended!!...." This is a hospital leh!!... did she think I can find Coffeee Bean everywhere on this island?...like Mcdonalds... whatsmore... coffeee wasnt suitable for her at that time...<br>"err.... coffee isn't good for health.. order something else... ok?.." "so u know coffee isn't good for the body too... then u should cut down on ur intake oso... ok?.." i saw her smile appearing... and theres a shine in her eyes...<br>i realised that shes just trying to tell me not to drink too much coffee in the future... My heart seemed to have suffered from a heavy blow... This is not good... a taste of pH&lt;7 has started to fill my nose..... If this is not going to stop.. tears might be the next thing that appears in front of her... i recalled the chapter on reservoir and dam in physics textbook.. quickly apply the knowledge on me... even if its just a few droplets... "ok... i promise... i'll try my best.." "and try to sleep earlier in the future..." "and dun skip breakfast... its important to u..." "and dun be too obsessed with Blue.. it makes u look.. troubled...." "and....." this didn't sound good... its like giving the final instructions b4 she... I can't bear to let her continue... "okok... i'll go get u a drink right away.." "slorr... is the machine far away?... if it is.. then its ok.. i dun want it anymore..." from my mental calculation....men would take 67 steps while women would take 85 steps to reach the vending machine right at that corner.. plus the time taken to purchase... average would take a total of 1.8-2.1 minutes... not very far... "quite near.."<br>"slorr.... come back quick... i dun want to be alone for too long.... i hate that feeling.." i didn't answer her.... i just increased my pace....<br><br>X X X X X X X<br>"eh... its late already... go to sleep.."<br>my mum was nagging at me again.<br>"okok.... 10 more minutes..."<br>Until today, FlyNDance had left for more than 2 mths. i still logged on at 1am everynight, but onto channel DOLCE-VITA which was created by myself, with slorr and FlyNDance being the only 2 nicks inside, for 10 minutes. Althoh she wont be able to fly and dance in real life anymore, but i still wish that she could continue to do so in the virtual world. Even Tye has given up on me... "she's gone.... y r u still doing this?.. for what?!!..." Yet, even if thats the case, i can't allow her soul to be left at the corner of loneliness. 'cos she said.... she hate the feeling of being alone... I still remember there was a heavy downpour on that day.... When i reached SGH... they told me... A coffeee butterfly flew away from her room at around 1am last night.... after that... i can't remember... i just knew that i stood at the bus-stop for a whole day... and i was all wet because of the rain.. even my face..<br>I've been crying hard not to think of her over theses 2 mths.. I've been hoping that her face wont appear in my mind every moment that i breath, but it's like hoping that.... the sky isn't blue; the grass isn't green; the stars do not twinkle at night... Basically, i was hoping for something impossible to happen... I can't believe that i m of Type 2, even in real life.. Did i cry?.. NO WAY!.. i said it b4, i m not a romantic person, and this may be due to the deficiency in the hormones that constitutes emotions... whenever i had the feeling of pH&lt;7, i'll browse through those FWDS:jokes... attention will then be shifted by those dim-wit, low-class jokes... so now everything is back to the way it was b4 I met her 9 mths ago... Tye is still flirting around, and i m still the old decent=dull me. But i've stopped taking coffeee and beer.<br>"xing ah... is this for u?...."My mum handed me a letter she picked up in the mail box this morning. i was surprised when i saw 'To:slorr...' written on the envelope. That's for me i guess. i opened it up, there was a piece of writing inside, and another coffee envelope.<br><br>Slorr,<br>I m FlyNDance's sister, i think this is how u r addressing her. I m sorry that i do not know ur real name, althoh we'd met b4. When i was packing her stuffs a few Days ago, I found this letter with your name and address already written on it. So i posted it to you, because I believe this is what my sister intended to do.<br>Best wishes,<br>Xiao wen<br><br>The letter was sent 3 days ago, and there was another<br>'To:slorr...' followed by my home address written on the coffee envelope. But this handwriting was a lot nicer and the words seemed to be moving swithtly... like in a joyful dance.I have no time to figure out how she has gotten my home address... did i give her in one of my mails?.. I tried to control my trembling hands, slowly, I opened up the envelope. I found a photo, and a half of a movie ticket inside... Apart from these, there was a blue letter... with the familiar DOLCE VITA smell on it. The photo Showed her, standing on a piece of grassland... wearing the same coffee theme attire on our 1st meeting at Mcdonalds. Something was written at the back of it....<br><br>Dear slorr,<br>Coffee represents Pisces.. thats me.<br>Blue represents sagitarius.. thats you.<br>A blue letter inside a coffeee envelope....<br>know what i mean?...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>seeing me... do u feel like drinking coffee<br>now?..<br>stop drooling!... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>FlyNDance<br>I smiled.... bitterly.. and the contents of the blue letter is simple:<br>If i have one more day to live,<br>i want to be your girlfriend.<br>Do i have one more day? No.<br>Too bad. I can't be your girlfriend...<br>not in this life.<br>If i have wings, i want to fly down from the<br>paradise just to see you.<br>Do i have wings? No.<br>Sadly. I can never see you again.<br>If all the water are drawn out of the bath-tub,<br>but it still can't put off the flame of love btw us.<br>Can all the water in a bath-tub be drawn off?<br>Can.<br>So, yes. I LOVE YOU.<br>FlyNDance<br>My chest was torn apart... tears broke through the dam I constructed a long time go in a jiffy... As proud, as emotionless as i was, i can't pull back the salty wet thats on the whole of my face anymore....She has changed my 'little theory'... and gotten back what i'd owed her... tears for 2 months....<br>X X X X X X X<br><br>Titanic has won 11 awards in the Oscar.. including best picture.Yet, Rose wasnt the best actress under that category. So if its sad in a movie, it may not be so fortunate too in real life. and.. in reality... should Jack hold on to Rose.. and 'Never let go?'.....<br>Maybe he shouldnt be worried about this... 'cos that beautiful coffee<br>butterfly will continue to fly and dance in his heart.. forever...<br>~THE END~<br></div>
