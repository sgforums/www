Smoking is not like any other recreational activity. If you want to kill youself, go ahead. But i'm not going allow myself to get killed by your smoke for your recreation. You want to smoke, make sure i dont smell it.<br><br>2. If i had my way all factories would shut down. But is that possible? I depend on those factories, so do you, and so does society. It keeps the economy going.<br><br>3. A motor engine gives off carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide some nitrogen products. While unhealthy, its way healthier than the chemicals given off by cigrette smoke.<br><br>4. Are non-smokers not entitled to fresh air? The smokers should be isolated in a room, where they can breathe all the 2nd hand smoke they want. Whats the use of putting smokers in fresh air if all they're gonna do is pollute it? Its not like they want the fresh air or they wouldnt be smoking.<br><br>5. The government's first priority is income and tourists etc.. I think its a dumb policy. If they think its bad for health, just ban it. Theres a million and one ways to gain revenue, i dont see why it has to be from smoking. They might as well start trading drugs and having a slice of that lucrative market. Afterall, isnt it the same as cigrettes? It still harms the body.<br><br></div>
