If you want to kill youself, go ahead. But i'm not going allow myself to get killed by your smoke for your recreation. You want to smoke, make sure i dont smell it.<br><br>2. If i had my way all factories would shut down. But is that possible? I depend on those factories, so do you, and so does society. It keeps the economy going.<br><br>3. A motor engine gives off carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide some nitrogen products. While unhealthy, its way healthier than the chemicals given off by cigrette smoke.<br><br>4. Are non-smokers not entitled to fresh air? The smokers should be isolated in a room, where they can breathe all the 2nd hand smoke they want. Whats the use of putting smokers in fresh air if all they're gonna do is pollute it? Its not like they want the fresh air or they wouldnt be smoking.<br><br>5. The government's first priority is income and tourists etc.. I think its a dumb policy. If they think its bad for health, just ban it. Theres a million and one ways to gain revenue, i dont see why it has to be from smoking. They might as well start trading drugs and having a slice of that lucrative market. Afterall, isnt it the same as cigrettes? It still harms the body.<br><br></div></blockquote>Some ppl just can't accept the brutal truth.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It's not about whether you smoke or don't smoke, whether you're a religous person or not, whether you're from NUS or not. It's your freaking lousy attitude.<br><br>That aside, most people around me aren't too bothered by whether the people they're with are smokers or not. I guess age plays a part. When you're of a certain age, seeing one of your own friends light up a cigeratte is nothing. It's not like the first time you see somebody smoking and it's not like he or she is underage. Also, to be that old and smoking, you should know what you're doing.<br><br>People should also get the idea right that smoking does not directly link to death by lung cancer and what not. I believe it may increase the chances of a person to get lung cancer but honestly, there are many other things that could kill you out there. Besides, second hand smoke is more damaging because as compared at the smoker who breathes in via a filter, the smoke for a second hand smoker is unfiltered. I'm not saying we should all smoke, but maybe just to put a more neutral view on the matter.<br><br>And where smoking is concerned, it's nothing about looking cool. I'm not referring to those young wannabes by the way. It's more about a habit, an urge, a dependency. Trust me, smokers can produce excellant work after a smoke break, but the craving for a puff can drive be really unbearable as well. Smoking can be like any habit or addiction, and unhealthy doesn't necessarrily have to be physical, it can be mental as well. So smoking isn't the only addiction that can harm you. Addiction to computer games can be kist as damaging to a person's life.<br><br>In general non-smokers my age do not really have anything against smokers, but they may not feel comfortable with the smoke. Some people just physically react stronger to smoke (cough/sneeze as their more sensitive) or they're just  don't like the smell. It's like how I generally don't link the smell of cheese or how caucasians in general don't like the smell of durians. It's a preference thing. So obviously, since such non-smokers are not comfortable inhaling smoke, they would prefer to stay away when a smoker is taking a puff. But when the ciggerate is put out, all can be well again. Provided the non-smoker is comfortable with what the smoker smells like after that.<br><br>One thing to add, whether you're a smoker or a non-smoker, I'm quite sure no one likes having smoke deliberately blown into your face. Somebody doing that to you is obviously somebody trying to play punk with you.<br><br>And to think some people claim to be from NUS. Punk.<br><br></div>
