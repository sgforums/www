            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Bombay (1995)<br>The film that marked the rise of Bollywood to international standards,with A.R.Rehman and Maniratnam proving their inborn excellence and hardbuilt consistency.Bombay focuses on religious and ethnic conflict. A Muslim man falls in love with a Hindu woman. Barriers must be broken in the name of love, but can Bombay City follow suit? Sadly, no: in December 1992, Hindus destroyed an ancient mosque in Northern India. Thus the film turns from romance to a powerful document of the religious riots that tore the city apart. Based on true events, this notorious movie was banned in many muslim countries due to its graphic violence and one of the most controversial indian movie ever to come under fire from the censorship board and religious groups.Fueled by the hype and controversy, the soundtrack by Rahman was a great success and sold a mindboggling 1 million copies in just a week...</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More harm was done by this movie than good..At the time of its release a hloelot of bullcrap was going on<br><br>1) Religious fanatics held riots and burnt down theatres<br><br>2)Censorship board in a dilemma cause they have to turn down the work of the most reputed director in India<br><br>3)political parties joined in the mayhem due to concern over certain objectionable scenes in the movie which showed them in the bad light<br><br>4) the issue of inter religion marriage was trashed and debated in the media<br><br>5) People asked   " Do they have a crisis center set up to help us deal with the movie now?".<br><br>6)The director was targetted for an assination attempt by extremists who hurled a bomb at his residence but escaped with his life<br><br>All these caught the attention of the west made this movie seen all over the world....it marketed itself...Everyone should watch this movie as it reinforcs the message :"make peace, not war" in the end ultimately its our loved ones who going to suffer .The direction is slick, the script excellent and the songs brilliant. You will not often find an Indian Commercial film which is entertaining and has a thoughtful message.<br><br>While the ending might be idealistic and slightly unrealistic, it gives us hope that one day we will set aside our differences. The message is also not rammed down our throat..A strong argument for peace and love  and an emotional tale of recent Indian history. See it.<br><br></div>

This was probably Ratnam's worst effort to date, watchable only because of its superbly crafted technical aspects like Santosh Sivan's excellent camerawork which gives an impression of watching a high budget hollywood show and the exception of the song scene.......Ratnam, has now become as predictable as the sun rising in the east......Recommend watching his latest movie YUVA (2004) is not too bad</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes Bahi I have actually seen Yuva on TV a few months back and thoroughly enjoyed it. Its rather a unique experiment in Bollywood<br><br>I gotta say this Ratnam guy is a genious, he has told 3 tales in one story The most coolest character got to be that of the Assasin , his arch enemy 2nd the the social activist and 3rd the Romeo caught in the battle<br><br>Gosh  the Romeo has spoilt the whole show and feel that he's absolutely unnecessary in an otherwise excellent show much like  Quantin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction with those flashbacks and stuff.
