You get up to offer the seat to this old lady, but a young pretty girl rushes to sit down instead.<br><br>You  say "excuse me" but she ignores you.<br>You say it again but this time add "i got up to give this auntie the seat...and this time you're met with an irritated stare from the girl.<br><br>After repeating it to her 3 more times she finally gets up with a big "AIYA" and pushes her way past you, uttering "Stupid Son of a b***h".<br><br>By this time you're aggravated enough and you raise your voice to tell her to watch her language.<br><br>She then turns around asks, why? you got problem isit?<br>You start to tell her "Yar..got" and she gives you a slap across the face infront of everyone in the bus.<br><br>Everyone is stunned and looks, but does nothing(as expected) and you see the girl smirking to herself, giving you the "you can't do anything" to me look...<br><br>In this instance.....Would you slap the girl back?<br></div></blockquote>No, but I'd taunt her to slap me again. And this time, I would block it off with such a force that would guarantee her arm to break.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Maybe, I'd alight with her and follow her to some quiet place. When she's all alone, I'd run up to her and shout "WEI KNN" and throw her my heaviest punch on her face. Then cao liao <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Seriously,<br><br>I'd just control my temper and let it go, and help the old lady to the seat. I'd rather win the crowd than win the argument. Even if she were to slap me again, so be it - turn the other cheek once lor. 3rd time then different story liao  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
