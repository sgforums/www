            <div class='col-md body'>Much as I figured they should have inspected the hell out of Iraq with more.. about a division worth of inspectors and with a huge armed squad with them, to make sure Saddam does not, the UN has failed to do so.<br><br>Frankly, the cause of this war becoming a reality has be placed squarely on the shoulders of 2 entities:<br><br><strong>Hans Blix: </strong><br>For his ambigious reports, he has refused to confirm or deny that he has found banned WMD.  His actions and his words are always contradictary.  He says that he has found no evidence, yet there are missiles to be destroyed.  He gives reports that both sides can use because there is nothing in the reports that says Saddam has or hasn't got the weapons.<br><br>Then the latest piece of double-talk spewed out of his mouth destroyed whatever little credibility Blix had left.  He was quoted as saying Iraq will not use chemical and biological weapons because Saddam does not want to swing world opinion.<br><br>Blix is a man politicking.  Saddam has not hesitated to use chemical weapons on civilians, when cornered, would he hesitate to use them?  Would Saddam use the weapons Blix said he did not have?  What kind of verbal diarrhoea is Blix vomitting?<br><br>His failure to do his job and refusing to admit to being incompetent has allowed the detractors of forcing Saddam to disarm enough time and excuses to delay everything.. all the time, Saddam is laughing at the impotence of the UN.  Mostly led by France, waving its veto, saying it'll veto everything that will include military action.<br><br>which brings us to<br><br><strong>France:</strong><br>The UN has always been really impotent when there are vetos wielded by a few countries.  Right now, France has led the way, followed by Germany to stall the threats of military action on Iraq.  There are 2 things that can make Saddam disarm and follow the UN Resolutions imposed after its invasion of Kuwait.  These 2 things must go together... They are:<br><br>1) An armed and credible threat of military action<br>2) A united stand in the UN to force him to disarm<br><br>Well, the first is there, courtesy of the US.<br><br>The second is truly and utterly scuttled by France.  It would seem that they were looking to gain political leverage by being the opposition to the US, even when the US and the UN Resolutions were in concord.  Their putting up stiff resistance to the enforcing of these disarmament resolutions fractured the will of the UN to make Saddam disarm.  This ultimately allowed Saddam to do whatever he wanted and stall for the past 6 months.<br><br>After the intended power-grab by France, they have shown themselves treacherous, and untrustworthy as allies.  Worse, they have rendered themselves, and the UN totally impotent and destroyed any credibility the UN ever had.<br><br>Now, the French see that they have lost it all... and in a move so shameful, have turned right around and offered aid to the Coalition movement to fight Iraq.<br><br>The whole thing is a tragedy.  Which could have been prevented if not for Blix and France.<br><br>Alas...<br><br></div>
