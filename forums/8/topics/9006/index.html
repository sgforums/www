Can't afford to, in my job."<br><br>H : "Now let's just analyse that. So all these places you've been boasting about for the past 2 hours - Africa, Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland - the past isn't important there, is that what you are saying? You think they're all living in the present? They are just woke up one morning, saw you were there with your four little suitcases, and decided to have a war? It wasn't happening till you arrived? ..."<br><br>R : " You think you are better than me, don't you?<br><br>H : "No"<br><br>R : "Smarter then?"<br><br>H : "Not even that. Look. You say Moscow is a very scary town. It is. Why? I'll tell you. Because there's no tradition of private property. First of all there were workers and peasants who had nothing and the nobility owned the country. Then there were workers and peasants with nothing and the Party owned the country. Now there are still workers and peasants with nothing and the country's owned, as it's always been owned, by whoever has the biggest fists. Unless you understand that, you can't begin to understand Russia. You can't make sense of the present unless a part of you lives in the past. End of lecture."<br><br>R : "..."<br><br>-Robert Harris in his book Archangel.<br><br>Dear friends,<br><br>History as a subject have always been maligned and greeted with a yawn. From kids to parents, this reaction is almost universal. As a student of history, I feel that his subject needs doses of spin doctoring and to show the world what it really is and it's importance. Students of Maths and Science knew about mechanics and it's intricate working but do they know Galileo Galilei (1564-1642)? Who is he? You will never be able to feel the beauty of his work without appreciating his sparks of genius in a era which condemn innovation and dying for his work. Feminists wax lyrical about their movements but ask them about Emmeline Pankhurst (1858-192<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and they will stumble. Those who argued that USA is an Imperialist power obviously have no inkling about American Exceptionalism and for those who sprout liberty and freedom in Singapore like it's running out of fashion, is missing lessons on The Reign of Terror and the Maria Hertogh Riot of 1950. The Enlightenment Period of 18th century will be a good period to start with regards to capitalism ran amok here. As H said above, i am not smarter then you with my knowledge but "You can't make sense of the present unless a part of you lives in the past."<br><br>Cheerio,<br>James<br><br>"Death solves all problems-no man, no problem."
