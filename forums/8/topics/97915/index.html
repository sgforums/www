            <div class='col-md body'>OK, I'm sure most of us have watched the movie, Titanic, starring Leonardo di Carprio and Kate Winslet.  What is the most memorable scene in the movie for you?<br><br>My most memorable scene was this scene when the women and children were being placed into the boats to sail to safety before the Titanic capsized.  There was an old lady who was asked to board a boat but she refused when she realised that it meant her husband would be left behind.  She firmly held her husband's hand and shushed him up and she could not imagine life without him, cannot imagine fleeing to safety whilst he was left behind a sinking ship.  The husband was so touched, they hugged for a while then they held hands and slowly walked back to their cabin where they lay in bed holding each other tightly as the waters slowly rose around them, reaching out for them with its tentative arms, enveloping them in a watery grave as they slowly breathe their last, still entwined in each other's arms...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I know a lot of people miss this very touching moment in the movie but it was the one scene that jumped straight out at me.  I thought the Jack and Rose romance was more of a crush but this old couple sure knew what love, dedication and commitment were all about!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So, what was your favourite scene and is there anyone else who remembers the scene I'm talking about here?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
