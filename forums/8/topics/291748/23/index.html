If you keep insisting on ignoring them, there's nothing i can do.<br><br>As for the rubber speculation that you did, i'm lost for words. You either went in with favorable odds(which kinda proves my point), or beat the odds(and got lucky, which is pretty much gambling). I'm not sure what you were trying to say there, but it sounds pretty lose-lose for you to me.<br><br>But i'll come down to your level for a bit. According to you, if people did exactly what you did back then, they have ZERO chance of going broke? Because according to your logic, if they had even the tiniest chance of going bust, then what you're saying is "if we listen to andrew, you can go broke".<br><br>Yeah, sounds pretty accurate to you doesn't it?<br><br>Unfortuately, the moral compass in me cannot allow me to use this against you. Because unlike you, I take pride in not misleading people just to win a petty argument.</div>
