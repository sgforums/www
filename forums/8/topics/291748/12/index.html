However there is one thing I would like to add.  Past performance is never an accurate indicator of future success.  You can have the machine backtest historical figures and spit out all the charts you want, there is still a good possibility that the end result differs from what actually happens.  The only reason why machines are used is because institutional investors handle extremely large sums of money everyday.  They are never a substitute for the skill of the investor in setting the terms and conditions for the machine to determine the result.<br><br>To the home investor, I would suggest taking a course on reading financial ratios which are crucial to fundamental analysis.<br><br>I rank:<br>Fundamental Analysis:60%<br>Technical Analysis*:10%<br>Luck:30%<br><br>*what the machine does<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok i'm going to ignore Andrew until he comes up with new/better points from here on out. Replying to the same unoriginal insults for the 12th time is getting old.<br><br>But i'll elaborate a little here. If you want to make money from investments, odds are everything. If you want to avoid going broke, bankroll management is important. Risk vs Reward. The age old question of finding the balance.<br><br>What andrew is trying to do is confuse the innocent readers that bankroll management has anything to do with deciding what to invest in. It doesn't. Bankroll management is the check in place to keep you from danger against the huge variance in the market.<br><br>Kind of like a car. You want the car to bring you from point A to point B in the quickest time. But you still want to have that handbrake there to save you from yourself.<br><br>Bankroll management isn't even essential for making investments. Big firms leverage(going against core principles in bankroll management) their investments all the time. They accept the huge risk in favor of bigger rewards because they can absorb the damage when push comes to shove. It is however recommended that private investors exercise it though.<br><br>There's a concept in professional gambling that can be used to illustrate the situation here. It's called playing with scared money.<br><br>If you're playing with money you NEED(eg school fees, daily essentials, rent), you need to seriously consider and minimise your risk. If you have 200k, and you need to spend 2k a month, investing with 20k is perfectly fine. It's not 'scared money'. A loss will hurt, but it won't cripple you. If you only have 3k in your account and you need  2k this month, it's a terrible idea to invest that 2k, even though the odds are the same as before(and let's assume extremely profitable).<br><br>The dangers of playing with scared money is obvious. As i have pointed out in a previous post, we as humans can try to play the odds all we want, but eventually we are still guided by our emotions. When you enter the market with a strategy, you have to follow it through. You know your odds, and you know you have a positive expectation only if you follow it through. That's easy to do if you're not playing with scared money. What happens when you are?<br><br>Again let's use the 2k scenario. You have 3k, invest 2k and need 2k at the end of the month. You effectively have only 1k of liquidity left, which is not enough. Assuming you enter at the beginning of the month expecting to cash out profitably at the end of the month, various things could happen to make you second guess yourself unneccessarily if you are playing with scared money<br><br>1) the value of your investment dips momentarily. Scared money usually exit here to "play safe"<br><br>2) the value of your investment increases faster than you expect, but does not hit your expected return yet. There's another week to go, and it could still hit the projected value. Scared money will often take the money here and cash out, thinking they have made a handsome profit. In reality, they have lost expected returns. If they do this often, they can expect to actually lose money in the long run<br><br>3) It's nearing the end of the month, and the price hasn't moved. You need the money soon. The odds tell you you're still a favourite to make a profit, but you lack the time. You cash out, and the price rises to your expected value the following week. This is the most dangerous of all. Because it drives people crazy. Crazy people do not follow the odds. They curse the heavens and start buying without consultation of the odds. This is how most people who don't practice bankroll management usually end up broke.<br><br>That's all I have for this topic at this point. I await Andrew to point out i'm backpedaling by preaching another concept other than odds calculations, but i urge everyone to keep in mind that bankroll management has nothing to do with how you invest. It should not affect the strategy of investment. All it affects is how much you invest. Too many people have confused the two when they are playing with scared money.</div>
