No one writes an argumentative essay with one sided perspective, unless it is a propaganda. Propaganda usually comes with ulterior motive. What is your ulterior motive?<br>If you wish to spread that gamble and forex are bad, you should at least include that if you do not have the skills, those are bad. But if you have the skills, forex is good for you but I'm ambivalent about casino gambling.</div></blockquote>Are you capable of comprehension?

You claimed to quote a proverb, and i'm just asking you to explain which proverb it was. Not exactly rocket science, just elaborating your point to me.

I don't lay traps for you. I don't have to. You do that job all by yourself. I'm just asking you to explain yourself.

Because it's only fifty cents if he loses each time. He can endure the losing streak.<br><br>What if i made it a hundred thousand vs fifty thousand? He probably will still play because the odds i give him are so favorable.<br><br>What about 100,000 and 99,999?<br>Suddenly the expected returns drop, but it's still a positive expectancy of return. The risk of ruin is real here though, because a 20 loss streak will definately hurt.<br><br>What about 1.00 and 0.99?<br>Will andrew play? </blockquote><blockquote><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>[quote]Originally posted by AndrewPKYap:<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>[quote]Originally posted by Mitell:<br>you don't think skill matters in a casino?<br>you don't think skill matters in the stock market?<br>you don't think skill matters in forex?<br><br>There is no such think as skills or systems to win in the all above, this is a negative progressive game.

            <div class='col-md body'>while we're talking about the dangers of gambling, i'll like to know, andrew, why you feel the casino is such a danger to society with it's maximum house commission of 24% (on the big wheel)....when the established 4D system in singapore is already taking in about 60% in commission.<br><br>And brokers charge a fraction of that!<br><br>Of all the things to point out as a danger, why aren't you pointing out the obvious?<br><br>Why haven't I seen you campaigning against singapore pools all these years?<br><br>Are you only now coming out because you sense an opportunity to spread the fear now that something new and unfamiliar is coming to town(the casinos)?
