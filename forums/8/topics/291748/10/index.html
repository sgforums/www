            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by deathbait:</div><div class="quote_body">Lol andrew<br><br>I like the way you attempt to link hard mathematical science to religion. Faith in a divine entity is so far removed from hard, proven mathematical proofs it's hilarious you're trying to concile the two.<br><br>I'm going to elaborate on my statement that "odds are everything" now. Partly because i'm tired of waiting for you to tell me why it's stupid, but mostly because I think it's better to explain an idea in detail than to just write vague statements(i'm looking at you, andrew), and this IS for the public after all, not just andrew.<br><br>Why do i say odds are everything when you're looking to invest?<br><br>Let's look at the objective of investing. When you invest, you want to meet certain criteria, or come close to them<br><br>1) make correct decisions<br>2) avoid making bad decisions<br>3) generate income in the long run<br>4) hedging<br><br>How do we make correct decisions? How do we know which decisions are bad? Introduce the idea of expected returns.<br><br>Expected returns are not to be confused with real returns. Your expected returns could be 300%, while at the same time, your real returns are -300%. What expected returns means is, in the long run, your real returns will match your expected returns, provided you continue to follow the prescribed strategy.<br><br>Obviously then, you want expected returns to be as positive as possible. This is not just for the forex, but for everything we do in life. A simple example would be choosing between two chicken rice stalls to buy lunch from. Assuming they both taste and cost the same with no queues, your expected returns are obviously higher if you buy from the stall that gives more chicken. And that is certainly the way you decide between two food stalls in real life.<br><br>Assuming you understand the above example, i'll elaborate a little on why andrew is wrong now to agree that emotional detachment plays a part in the investment process. Assume now that the stall that gives less chicken is run by your best friend. You are emotional bound to buy from him now. You are generating sub standard expected returns. It is a violation of (2), and you're now making a wrong decision.<br><br>Occasionally, the wrong decision may pay off. For example, the "more chicken stall" runs out of chicken just as you reach the head of the queue, giving you a "loss". But in the long run, you never go wrong making the correct choice based on expected returns.<br><br>But since we're on the topic of emotional detachment, i'll like to elaborate a little more here on the dangers of it(because being human, none of us are truly ever able to isolate it from our decision making). Emotional detachment is a dangerous thing when you're investing in the markets. Here's why:<br><br>The human mind is designed to learn from experience. Telling a child not to touch a hot stove won't work. The child will only avoid the hot stove after being burnt once. Only then will he start to heed advice regarding hot objects. Because he has learnt from experience.<br><br>Similarly, our brains learn to repeat actions that give a favorable return. In the complex world of the trade markets though, this primitive mechanism is a dangerous one for us. As has been pointed out above, the correct move(positive expected returns) is not always the best move in the short run. In fact, most decisions only give us an edge of about 10-15% over a random outcome. That's a lot of bad decisions that give positive short term results! And your brain inteprets those positive results as related to those bad decisions! This is why emotional attachment has to be kept in check. Play according to the facts, not your emotions.<br><br>Ok, going back to the odds. Why are odds important then? Well, the holy grail of all decision making is to know the odds. To know the odds is to never lose value in a decision again. For most decisions we make in our lives, we can at best approximate the odds. It is a pretty elusive figure.<br><br>Expected returns are calculated by odds. Odds is simply the probability of wins against losses. Every decision we make has it's upsides and downsides. But by calculating your expected returns accurately, you can see if that decision will lead to more upsides or downsides. Thereafter, the correct move can be made.<br><br>In a casino gamble, most odds are readily apparent. Expecially when no one has to make any decisions apart from how much to bet. Take roulette. Assuming we only buy 1 number, you expect to win once every 37 times. You<br>paid 1:36. 1:36 is your odds of winning. you're getting 1:35 payoff. That means your expected returns is negative.<br><br>By knowing the odds, you can determine that the correct move(if all that interests you is making money) is not to play the game. The better move is to be the house, of course.<br><br>Translate this to markets, or the forex in this case. You may be thinking by now that after this whole lecture, you're gonna be rich, because you will always make the right decisions. Well, the odds in these arenas are less well defined. Imperfect information baby. To determine the odds is what you have your traders for. It's why you pay the funds/banks a fee to manage the money for you. The traders aren't there all day playing with their gut. They are there because whether they understand the concept or not, they are in charge of estimating the odds to make the right call.<br><br>What are the odds that SIA share price will plummet to 0 today? You can tell me offhand it's close to 0, and you will be right. But that doesn't help you make good decisions. If i were to ask you a more relevant question, "what is the probability that SIA price will rise 20 cents today?", you would be stumped.Perhaps you'll try to guess a number, and that is what emotional investors do, subconsciously. That is obviously the wrong way. What if I gave you predefined odds? 2:1, SIA will rise 20 cents today. Knowing the odds, would that not give you confidence to buy SIA?<br><br>Odds ARE everything. They are the holy grail to investing. They are everything because the man with the odds will always make money. Knowing the odds is equivilant to never making a losing trade. Because even if the trade loses money, he is making the correct decision.<br><br>How again, my dear andrew, are odds not everything? Are you still going to insist luck and emotion plays a part? You are more of a gambler than the people you are trying to help, my dear boy.<br><br>You will of course excuse my maniacal laughter here. After all, the one time i actually make a point that supports Andrew's campaign, he shoots it down as grossly stupid=)</div></blockquote>How to calculate expected return?</div>
