            <div class='col-md body'>This is just my observation.<br><br>Approximately more than 50% of your posts are in riddles (i.e. instead of answering our questions, you give us proverbs or riddles or calling us stupid or calling us superficial or stating that our statement is superficial), how can you be an author when you always speak in riddles, always give nebulous, vague, dubious, obscure, unclear, blurry statement? do you use all those vague statement in your book? like the<br><blockquote>That is what many people think... and I am not surprised that you think similarly...<br><br>The reality is different...<br><br>It is like, looking at the sky, you will see with your own eyes that the sun moving from the east to the west... every morning you will see the sun moving from the east to the west...<br><br>don't be like an unschooled kid, and think that the sun moves from the east to the west.... it is the earth that is rotating and not the sun moving from the east to the west, that you see the sun moving from the east to the west...<br><br>Similarly, you see the charts, you study the news, you do your analysis and you conclude that you can make money from forex trading... the reality is different... the reality is that you will end up losing all you money if you do not stop after losing a big amount of your money.</blockquote>or are you trying to write an english literature essay targetting only those who bother to read between the line to slowly comprehend the unfathomable.<br>Do you even consider how many of those who gamble do not really understand English (especially old people who like to buy 4D). With your attitude and lampooning, trenchant, mordant, invective, and worse insulting remark, you won't progress as a writer.<br>When you hold a press conference and there is one person asking you why your view on gambling and forex are so polarized and you reply like what you did in this forum (giving a riddle, going around the statement and finally end it up with a sarcastic remark saying that "you are too dumb to understand and i don't want to waste my time answering superficial question".<br></div>

I have stated earlier that i think it's possible to for forex trading to pay, however the odds are highly stacked. The biggest problem is one of psychology. People tend to draw pictures in their minds. That is the first thing to overcome and empirical evidence has it that people are bad at money management...most will somehow lose money.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, forex commisions are extracted via a spread.<br><br>While this spread varies, the commission taken from you for every trade is not exactly astronomical to overcome if you indeed have the skills to trade in the forex.<br><br>And yes, it's easy to lie to ourselves that the road ahead will indeed be smoother. But as long as you understand exactly why you're in the trade, you should be less likely to succumb to impulse trades.<br><br>Which is why i'm repeating it so often(and am extremely incredulous that andrew thinks this is rubbish). Play the odds. They are the most important thing to consider when you trade. Math does not lie. If your move is always mathematically correct, emotions will never take over.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am now seriously doubt that you are the real author of the book.<br>Which author go around insulting people in forum? Your book is supposed to educate us, not to make us inferior and believe that everything you write is true. You book should offer a different point of view and not force us to accept your point of view.<br><br><strong>If your insults in this forum circulate to public, I wonder what will happen to the sales of your book</strong><br><br><blockquote>I have seen first-hand the harm casino gambling does. Having reviewed medical research, I am totally against Casino gambling. I am however pro-freedom. The state however should not sponsor casino gambling. The state in fact should discourage casino gambling and educate it's citizens on the harm of gambling at the casino. I believe that there is a clear and present danger for many people when it comes to casino gambling. There is a need to educate as many people as possible on the dangers of the casino in a clear, complete, effective and simple manner. If they are unable to stop themselves from going to the casino, at the very least they must be taught and they must learn the survival skills. My mission in life and this book is to educate people on Casino gambling and Stock Market Speculation.</blockquote>This excerpt is taken from the background information that you wrote about your book.<br>1. You clearly mention that your objective is to educate us, but why do you go to another level and insult us. Is it ethical for a teacher to scold his student stupid. If I already know everything, why should I even bother to ask the question. Since i don't know, that is the reason I ask.<br>2. If you want to educate as many people as possible about the danger of gambling and speculating, why don't you educate your government? They spend money hiring hedge fund managers and financial analysts just to speculate? Why don't you educate those Hedge fund managers and tell them that speculating is very bad? You clearly know that they draw an at least 4 digits salary per month just to speculate.<br>3. You clearly state that you want to educate us in a clear and simple manner. But what I see here is that you are presenting rude, insulting and vague statement. Where is the clarity? Where is the simplicity?<br>4. You clearly wrote that we have to learn survival skills should we persist to go into casino or gambling. In this case you are offering solution to the problem and try to minimize the impact on our lives. But what are you writing here? Propaganda and extremely polarized statement..<br><br>I can't find your book in Kinokuniya anyway?</div>
