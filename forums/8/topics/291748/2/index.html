            <div class='col-md body'>Actually if you are very good at forex, you should capitalize on the declining US$ or rising Yen.<br>But I guess it already quite late.<br><br>For forex trading, it is better if you have TA background and know all the technique. And also, always know where is your limit since the leverage in forex is very tempting.<br><br>most commonly used leverage is US$1 to US$100, so every profit and loss are multiplied by factor of 100. So be careful when you trade. Also, you must read more about TA and current affairs. Don't trade blindly.<br><br>Some website (forex.com) allow you to practice for 1 month. they give u virtual US$50k to trade and practice their interface and charts.
