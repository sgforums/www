            <div class='col-md body'>wait<br><br>just so we're clear<br><br>you don't think odds are what seperates a gamble from an investment?<br><br>you don't think skill matters in a casino?<br>you don't think skill matters in the stock market?<br>you don't think skill matters in forex?<br><br>odds ARE the only thing that defines an action as gambling. If your odds are worse than your expected value in return, and you're still deciding to enter, you're gambling.<br><br>But what if the odds are favorable to the point where it exceeds your expected returns?<br><br>I'll even give you an example.<br><br>I'll play a game of coin flips with you, paying you a dollar for everytime you win, and taking 50 cents for everytime you lose.<br><br>Will you play?<br>Is it a gamble?<br><br>What is the one overriding factor in you deciding it is favorable to play this game with me?<br><br>It's the odds, you moron.<br><br>Let's move back to the forex.<br><br>Let's assume a broker commision of X percent. You would thus expect that if you bought and sold blind with no leverage, your long term loss would be X multiplied by the number of transactions.<br><br>That is your expected value in that series of transaction, negative. Which is why buying and selling blind is considered gambling, because the odds give you a negative expected value, but you play anyway.<br><br>But what if you inject a little intelligence into the trade? If your manual input into playing the forex can give you enough expected value to offset X per trade, you're no longer gambling. You're investing. Much like the coin flip game i proposed, you can now see value in playing the forex, because mathematically in the long run, you're going to make money.<br><br>Of course ppl can lose alot of money even with positive expected returns. It's a theory called the risk of ruin. Basically, because you have finite capital and time, a really long losing streak(variance) can push you to the point of no return. And it's this fear that andrew is trying to take advantage of to sell his book. His philosophy is simple: If you don't play, you can't lose. He doesn't like it pointed out that you can't win either.<br><br>Yet, i'm sure he'll play the coin flip game with me. Because it's only fifty cents if he loses each time. He can endure the losing streak.<br><br>What if i made it a hundred thousand vs fifty thousand? He probably will still play because the odds i give him are so favorable.<br><br>What about 100,000 and 99,999?<br>Suddenly the expected returns drop, but it's still a positive expectancy of return. The risk of ruin is real here though, because a 20 loss streak will definately hurt.<br><br>What about 1.00 and 0.99?<br>Will andrew play?<br><br>End of the day, it's a simple question of risk analysis. Everything you do in life, you want to enter when it is an advantageous situation. But risk kicks in when you're in over your head. Which is why bankroll management is important. Andrew will have you believe that dipping your pool in the markets is a dangerous move. It's simply not true. You can't lose money if you consistantly move in when you have a positive expected return on the trade, and have a suffecient bankroll to take a losing streak.<br><br>Of course, being an ex-trader, andrew knows all this. It's just inconvenient to elaborate the concepts because they break down all his points, and boy does he need them to hold up if he's gonna sell his book(which btw, professes to talk about gambling and whatnot, but can't even get an accurate illustration of a roulette wheel on the cover).<br><br>The only things you never want to do in trading is going in blind, or investing too big a proportion of your total capital in a single trade. If you're not prone to either of the above, step in....the water's fine. Don't let andrew push you off with his nonsense. Trading is not always gambling. Never let someone who doesn't even know what gambling is tell you forex is gambling.<br><br>It's disgusting enough that andrew can claim he was a trader and has such ridiculous misunderstandings on how investments work. It's even worse when he tries to spread disinformation just to sell a book.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and as a follow up, i'll like to talk about odds in the world cup bet that andrew made.<br><br>Sports bets.<br>Everyone likes to bet a little when they're watching sports, it spices up the game.<br><br>Andrew talked about 1:0.22 odds.<br><br>Pityful, you might say. But andrew never revealed the teams.<br><br>Investing 50k in 1:0.22 odds may seem insane, and andrew would definately like to make you think so. But is it really?<br><br>22 cents to your dollar is a 22 percent return on investment. How many of you make that on a consistant basis in your investments? Andrew certainly doesn't. He's more or less admitted it by refusing to answer my previous questions.<br><br>But what defines it as a good or bad investment?<br><br>1:0.22 is break even odds if your team will win roughly four out of five times. That is what really determines whether it's a good investment. How often do you think your team will win?<br><br>What if your team was playing against handicapped kids in a game of soccer? Would you put 50k on those odds? I'll ask how much more i can heap onto THAT bet, i'll tell you.<br><br>But that's in the extreme case, where you expect to win almost 100% of the time.<br><br>What if england was playing against NUS soccer team, and i gave you 1:0.22 odds? How often do you expect NUS to win? once in twenty? Buying at those odds certainly seem good.<br><br>What if england was playing against itself?(computer games come to mind.)You'll need 1:1 odds to break even. 1:0.22 would indeed be insane.<br><br>So you see, as always, andrew likes to point out a few details while leaving the most important points to a scenario out of his posts to justify his arguments. If you aren't already sick of it, you should be.<br><br>And i'm still hoping to see andrew explain why his playing rugby for the military once has any bearing on the value of sports. I can't resist the obvious barb, sorry <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">id the value go down BECAUSE you were part of it?</div>

Maybe in the casino.<br><br>But if you think the consistent winners in the markets are either cheating or super lucky, you're just plain wrong.<br><br>As for skill in a casino, blackjack or poker comes to mind(no, counting cards is not cheating).<br><br>In blackjack, if you play like the typical "uncle", the casino has about a 5% commission. Play like someone who has read a book or two on blackjack odds and plays, and the commission goes down to about 1.2%.<br><br>Count cards, and suddenly the commision is down all the way to -0.5%. That's an expected GAIN. That's why casinos don't like GOOD card counters. Oh they love the bad ones, because it doesn't take too much of a bad count to sway that -0.5% up to positive again.<br><br>So really, there are skill games in casinos too. When your skill is suffecient to offset the "commission" taken from the host, it can be a good investment too.</div>

Why do you care if the casino makes money if, by your own words, you're not playing with the casino?<br><br>really, it's sick how silly your posts are.<br><br>Let me dissect it now:<br><br>1) You lose in poker in the long run because you are a losing player(read: lousy), not because you have less money. In fact, it is advantageous to buy in with a small amount, compared to being the deep stack of the table.<br><br>2) Please, oh please play poker with me so i can show you why luck is irrelevant in the long run. While we're at it, bring your entire life savings, and i'll bring just a few bucks, just so you can prove to me how your big toad will gobble me up.<br><br>3) Casinos NEVER have an overwhelming chance of winning the random patron. The most profitable game in the casino, known as the big wheel, has only a 7.7 percent commision. Not Overwhelming. Also, look up "overwhelming" in the dictionary.<br><br>4) As before, poker is not played against the house, so it matters not if the house is making money. The "rake" is paid to the house for hosting the game and paying the dealers. You will indeed make money at the poker table against other less savvy opponents.<br><br>5) Skill required in blackjack is the greatest when playing in a multi decked, non constant shuffled casino game. When you're playing our local version of blackjack, the only skill required to win(and there is only one way to win) is of diplomacy: If you're not the banker, you lose. It's a simple game.<br><br>6) The advantage the bankers have in our home blackjack games are(finally, here's how you use the word) overwhelming. So overwhelming in fact that they almost always win, even in the short run. Stories of bankers losing alot of money are myths perpetuated to scare ppl from being the banker. If you're still in doubt, chinese new year is coming up. Be the banker for once and play it seriously(as in, out for the cash). You'll see what i mean.<br><br>7) Casinos will never cheat you of your money. That's just silly. Consider the case of the online poker site, absolutepoker. Casinos make tons of money from the public without needing to cheat. To be caught cheating is to kill the cash cow, to behead the golden goose. Absolute poker was caught cheating, and now it's being boycotted. Chances are, it lost more in a week's income than they won by cheating.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Emoticons. really?<br><br>With your appalling lack of knowledge in gambling, are you really qualified to write a book on it?</div>
