Do not bother debating this fact. You already revealed it couple of pages back in this thread.<br><br>6) Where can i get a copy of your book?<br><br>7) What other things besides odds do you look at when you develop an investment portfolio strategy?

Questions that he should have ready answers for. They aren't exactly rocket science questions.<br><br>What are you waiting for "Mr Yap"? Are you afraid the answers to these questions will ruin your position? Are you afraid of legal consequences to the answers of the first two? Or did you already realise sometime back that odds are indeed everything, and now you can't backpedal?<br><br>It's fun to see you try to wriggle out of this checkmate, really. But please dodge the questions more creatively if you intend to dodge. I will of course repeat the questions constantly until you give up some answers.
