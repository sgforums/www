However there is one thing I would like to add.  Past performance is never an accurate indicator of future success.  You can have the machine backtest historical figures and spit out all the charts you want, there is still a good possibility that the end result differs from what actually happens.  The only reason why machines are used is because institutional investors handle extremely large sums of money everyday.  They are never a substitute for the skill of the investor in setting the terms and conditions for the machine to determine the result.<br><br>To the home investor, I would suggest taking a course on reading financial ratios which are crucial to fundamental analysis.<br><br>I rank:<br>Fundamental Analysis:60%<br>Technical Analysis*:10%<br>Luck:30%<br><br>*what the machine does</div></blockquote>Just to add on, the reason the entire process of getting machines to output odds values is because of the circular process of the whole thing. An assumption is made in this process that violates statistics:<br><br>Probability of outcome will be reflected in long run values.<br>long run values can be used to estimate probability of outcome.<br><br>Combined, these assumptions create a circular logic argument. Unfortunately, this is the best we can get currently, so it will have to do. The market is such an unpredictable environment any help counts.<br><br>Touching on fundamental analysis VS technical analysis. I'm aware that these are considered competing ideas. But for the home investor, I recommend that whichever side you support, always look to the opposing front for affirmation before investing.<br><br>Just because fundamental analysis determines a price will rise does not mean you should run in blindly. Even if you scoff at TA, take the time to appreciate the theories and run them through quickly. If both methods support your view that the price will rocket, you can go in with so much more confidence. This applies similarly to people who put stock in TA and scoff at the fundamentals.<br><br>There's no such thing as luck in the industry, only variance=)<br><br></div>

You claim you have prior knowledge of commodity markets, yet is unable to come up with any proof of knowledge in the basics of investments.<br><br>You want to believe in your own filth, that's fine. DO NOT misrepresent my words to mislead the public. I point out the mathematically correct way to invest, and you laugh at my efforts. That is fine. I can chalk it down to sheer ignorance. I touch on prevention from variance and bankruptcy, and you mislead the audience to believe everything i say will make them go broke? That is just pure malice. You sir, should be ashamed of yourself. You claim to be middle aged. Act your age and respect yourself sir.<br><br>If you have nothing constructive to say, please refrain from oozing stupidity and contaminating the forums. You say you want to protect people from gambling addiction. I applaud that. It is indeed a worthwhile goal. But all I've seen you do thus far is self-promotion. You have yet to touch on anything even remotely close to gambling. Even the few words coerced out of you betray your true nature. You want to be an expert on gambling, yet you prove yourself ignorant of many aspects of gambling. You claim to be a commodities future specialist, yet refuse to acknowledge the existence of odds estimation.<br><br>So please sir, return to the hole you crawled out of this morning. Go find a job. Go do something constructive. Finish writing your book or burn it. I don't care. Just find some meaningful thing to do. But for crying out loud. Just because your life sucks doesn't mean you should pull everyone down. And that is exactly what you're doing by going around spreading disinformation.<br><br>You have ceased to be amusing to me.

            <div class='col-md body'>btw andrew, the way to circumvent the profane filter is NOT to put a fullstop in between letters like sh.it but place a bold, italic or underscore in between the letters..... like so: co<strong></strong>ck and sh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>it.... this way is nicer so that there is no jarring full stop in between the letters.....<br><br>..... just so you know.<br><br>hopefully you too can learn something this morning. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
