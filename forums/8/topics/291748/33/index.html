            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The expansion of legal gambling brings expansion of problems. In Canada, research by the University of Alberta concluded, "The suicide rate for gambling addicts is 3.4 times higher than the average Canadian." The study also found that "gambling addiction among children over 12 has continually increased since 2002."<br><br>In the United States, the National Institute of Mental Health has a $1.8 million grant to study "prevalence of problem gambling across the 14 to 21 age group and its relevance to alcohol abuse."<br><br>Much of youth gambling is playing the lottery, sports pools, poker and the Internet. Ours is the first Hoosier generation to grow up in an atmosphere of legalized gambling.<br><br>An Atlantic City, N.J., survey reported "two-thirds of high schoolers have gambled in the casinos there. In Nevada, 10 percent of adolescent gamblers under age 21 are at risk."<br><br>Daniels recently spoke out against legalizing Internet gambling (HR 2046) because it is "accessible to minors 24 hours a day." </blockquote><a href="http://www.post-trib.com/news/opinion/686509,wolfcol.article" rel="nofollow">http://www.post-trib.com/news/opinion/686509,wolfcol.article</a></div>
