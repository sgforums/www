The one you quoted may actually be a good book for all i know. But i do notice that the "winners" get top billing in the title over the "losers". Perhaps you need to finish reading the book and get to the winning part? You've proven yourself to skip lines, even entire posts when you don't like reading them.

You have been short in coming up with that "one thing" necessary to break it. I'm sorry Andrew. Here in the grown up world, if you make threats, and the recipient tells you to bring it on, you actually have to either concede or bring the goods. I notice you've done neither. As usual, ignoring posts that you do not like to see is the strategy of the day.<br><br>Seriously. Did you think I was a confused teenage boy, so hampered by my pride that I would back down, afraid to call that silly bluff? Let battle be joined. Tell the world that one thing that would break down my arguments and end this farce.<br><br>Of course you can't. You were making blind threats. And now all you can do is impotently make random posts of why you can't answer my questions because they are too stupid. Nevermind that most of them are simple yes/no answers.<br><br>Ok, i'll admit it. Most of my questions would indeed incriminate you if you actually answered them properly. Isn't that the main reason why you refuse to answer any of them?<br><br>Of course now you'll start sprouting that nonsense that my views are too stupid for you to comment....nevermind the fact that you've been trying to compose a reply that will shut me up for the last 4 pages. I present you with this question once again. It is apparent that you want me to go away, and I have said I would, if you could just present that one thing you had that supposedly proved everything i said wrong. If that were indeed true, why are you procrastinating? Either you were lying, or you just enjoy calling me "grossly stupid"(that's another thing i think you should apologise for. I've proven myself much more articulate and knowledgeable than you thus far).<br><br>Which is it?<br><br></div>
