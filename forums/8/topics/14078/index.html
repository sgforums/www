            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FireIce:</div><div class="quote_body">do u ppl know there is something called private email?<br><br></div></blockquote>Hi, FI ( private note to you)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> and also Devil1976 too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> (also private)<br><br>Can I tell you how I feel about this bunch of christian "Siao"...<br><br>They are totally out of their teachings, i really feel sad for jesus, who died for this bunch of idiot, totally useless junk... Instead of following the bible and listening to god, they try to preach to the world not out of love, but to show that their mind is far greater than we, the non-christians. Remember how they posted about great scientists are christians, great works done by christians, bad things done by Islam, but never did they post about terrible crimes that are done by christians... but we tok about their crusaders, they shift the blame...<br><br>Always saying that their faith is true, and all other faith is false. Ok, I guess this is every religion rights because everyone would uphold their own faith. But when you ask them a real question, they will skip the main topic and tell you other thing which is not related. Jesus said spread the good news, not put everyone faiths down and spread the good news.<br><br>Now their courage and moral are even higher, trying to think about god's great plan and trying to show ppl here how good their intellectual mind is, wonder if they know about the show called a beautiful mind...<br><br>This forum might be small, but to each and everyone who lives here in the forum like you do is important and each of us played a big role, the world is already crazy now, and yet they couldn't leave here a virtual community for a small peace, they are thousands of christian forums where they can openly discussed thousands of who cares what christians topics, and yet they choose to do it here... why? Isn't that a show off to us, the non-christians... If they think that this is preaching, spreading of the gospel... My god, if i am a lighting, I will struck them twice to wake up their so called intellectual minds.<br><br>I have tried to tell them this, but they ignored, people cursed them and they rebuked by saying ppl post islam, buddhism. True, ppl did that, but you must see how you do it, nobody stop them to post christian post, but the way they do it is pissing everyone off. if I were to post about christianity, I will do it a thousand ways better than them... why try forcing ppl to drink ppl, we are not cows like them.<br><br>To them, god is everything, god give them a book and said this is my wrods, follow it and be saved, so simple... it didn't said you must saved another 500 souls every year in order to be save. The great commission is never a great issue in the bible, to live a life to be like jesus is the main teaching. What good if you can saved 500 souls and can't even saved yourself.<br><br>True, this is a public forum, they posted what they want, but when ppl cursed and swear to them, they will say why moderator didnt stop them, why they cursed me and blah blah...<br><br>Really, this bunch of christians is really a disgrace to jesus to the core, now they are trying to decipher the bible verses in front of us, saying in my own deduction, my guess... what? jesus said follow me and listen to me, take my bible as a sword, the sword means wisdom to cut down all ignorance, but see, they are trying to think that what god is trying to said in a verse, what it means, does it means this.... or does it means that.... to me, this bunch of idiot is more interested in decoding the bible than doing god's will.<br><br>Did god tell them in the morning, hey wake up, login to sgforums.com and discuss this topic... surely god didn't ask them to do this, but rather the holy spirit should tell them this please don't do it, it is enuff, please do some community works, please try to help the old, please don't waste your time.<br><br>God didn't want you to think so much, he just say something which is the summary of the bible:<br><br>John 3.16 For God so loved the world that he give his one and only son to die for us, and whoever believes in him will not die, but have eternal life<br><br>Did they understand this.... i guess nope...<br><br>Conclusion, sorry FI and Devil, I guess it is not up for me to tell them this again, but I am really pissed off by this bunch of christians, not all, you know who i meant. I hope i am not disturbing u2, but guess both of u might feel how i feel.. all in all, cheers and let forget about this idiot mad cows and live life to our fullest...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess there is always the black sheeps among the white ones then...noone is perfect..neither will christians claim that they are...the most simple point to prove is just by their actions instead of words...cause there is always a point from everyone...its just like the chicken and egg questions...so i think the best way to show love through christianity is thru their actions...and not how well they speak...My 2cents worth~~   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
