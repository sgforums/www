              <p>“We Are One" is a CSR project by MediaCorp, CapitaLand and LEGO
              Singapore. It was initiated by MediaCorp to raise at least one million
              dollars for charity.</p>
              <p>The idea is simple – to build a 5m
              by 8m Singapore island using 2x2 stud LEGO® bricks. The money raised
              will be channeled to help Singaporeans and families affected by the
              economic downturn.</p>
              <p>The story we are telling is equally simple – “The First
              Singaporeans built this country with blood, sweat and tears. Who will
              fill it with love, hope and compassion?”</p>
              <p>The concept
              was inspired by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s call to the nation to
              show that we care for those who have been deeply affected by the
              recession. As we emerge out of this crisis together, it is a great
              opportunity for us to show our compassion.</p>
              <p>We hope that
              like Fabric of the Nation (2003), this nation-wide event will move all
              Singaporeans and friends to support the cause.</p>

              <p>The event was non-political in nature, but a heart felt call for those who care about the less priviledge to come forth and help.</p>
              <p>No doubt Singaporeans had donated generously for charitable causes, but this event was much more symbolic. It may be only a piece of toy brick, but with it is a pledge and a committment from the heart to build up our country to make it a better place than it was left to us from our forefathers, first by caring for others.</p>
              <p>It is the committment to egalitarianism, for the sake of society and must never go the utilitarian way of self centredness, a pledge to never leave anyone behind, an undertaking of nobility and national patriotism, a maturity that we must now strive for after 44 years since independence.</p>
              <p>I sincerly hope more would come forth and participate in such future events when it occurs again. For those who didnt make it, it doesnt matter, for others in our society would understand. It is the thought and the heart that counts.</p>
              <p>No citizen can claim he had never benefited from our society and found success outside our community if he grew up here.</p>
              <p>There is no shame in loving your country and the efforts of our forefathers- Malay, Chinese, Indians, etc, together whom gave us our progressive todays. thru their collective hardwork, blood, sweat and toil for centuries...  </p>

              <p>The piece of symbolic brick costs only $2, for charities and to supplement social funds, and the $2 may seem small change to many, but if your pockets have only 90cts, you cant even get a bus ride, let alone the MRT, and would have to walk a long way home.</p>
              <p>Better you keep what you have, and seek help from kind souls than to give it to charities. Others and charities understand, appreciate the thought for charity but would not want it any other way, to deprave you of what you have, for they too, had either been deprived before and know the pain, and wish it not upon others.</p>
              <p>I know how you feel, more so in these hard times and suffering from both being laid off and getting a job with perhaps a lower pay which you would find unreasonable.</p>
              <p>Perhaps think of the FT/FW issue this way -  if they were not here, more companies may not be able to compete and will even to have fold, causing lesser jobs in the market. Every foriegner hired means another citizen gets to be hired or keeps his job. There is a qouta system in place. Abusers of the qouta system gets penalised.</p>
              <p>Many more are like you, caught in a doing not of our own but living in a new world order of globalisation. There are still good paying jobs if you had upgraded. Many are doing everything they can to keep their jobs, applying for jobs, upgrading for jobs, competting in jobs, working hard with the right attitude, proving themselves and getting promoted.</p>
              <p>Words may be easily said, but the facts and realities are there for all to see. They had not given up and most found success. So too can you. I wish you all the best and good luck, because you are ONE OF US.</p>

              <p>Please explain how to seek a balance in our daily expenses when the pay keep going down and expenses is the other way? The FTs are not on equal footing here when they set foot into a company, they ousted the locals with their expected pay. And then realised later that things are not so cheap here, but damaged had already done...to locals</p>

              Like you, I don't like nor agree with this lego charity thingie, so I didn't deign it to take part. But I don't see any relevance with the National Day celebrations. While its expensive and such, a lot of it has become a vital part of nation building, not to mention pride, which cannot be measured in monetary terms (perhaps you are not Singaporean enough to understand it ??). I remember during my distant army days regarding incidents with the $10,000 a pop mega firecracker, but since then even Singapore has learnt to pare down overly lavish and non too cost effective celebrations.
              
              However, u conveniently neglect to mention how the Taiwanese actually admire Singapore as a society that actually works and for a government that actually does work. SG ain't perfect but at least things do get done. Unlike your Taiwan with a perpetually paralysed political leadership.
              
              I always laugh at how Asian societies like Taiwan farcically adopt an American/Western political system without the necessary historical and cultural development to implement it. Not that America even works well btw ... Taiwanese can be really dumb the way they farcically get embroiled over self-brewed crises like the partisan politics / å�°ç‹¬ independence talk and even the current American beef talk ...
              
              I always feel there's much to improve in Singapore but alas that's miles better than Taiwanese people not realising how they seem to make themselves the laughing stock, not just among Chinese but worldwide?
