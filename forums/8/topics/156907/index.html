            <div class='col-md body'><strong>I also have my share of such strange encounters: </strong><br><br>Yours seem to be on tarot cards? Hmmm... mine is different... the book actually glue me for hours last nite... for each chapter he compared the deciphered Sumerian text with the OT and do a comparison. It was a compelling read. Kudos to NLB for bringing in such titles.<br><br>So all along my dreams of being an alien-human hybrid could be true after all!!!! Somehow tracing back all human DNA we arrive at Adam n Eve but tracing further they are creation of who but the aliens here on Earth to mine minerals needed in their planet.<br><br>It can also explain why funny paintings of aliens are in the ancient caveman art and other artefacts left by Maya, Egyptian etc etc... works. Erich von Daniken maybe right afterall!<br><br>Aliens exist and they are Creators of our human race!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

What happen was there seem to be a desperate need for more workers and they decide to create one primitive being to do the job.<br><br>What we learnt is Adam n Eve is created and live in the Garden of Eden until they eat the forbidden apple and were expelled. During the making process, there already exist ape-men on Earth the Neatheral and Cro-Magnon ape-men. So Adam n Eve was created after those ape-men exist.<br><br>After expulsion, Adam n Eve settled in somewhere Africa there is also how a lot of fossil are found explaining it. In fact dinosaurs already roam the Earth way before Adam n Eve were born.<br><br>There are more but too much to describe.. the book offer an explanation to that and how 10 generation after Adam the great Deluge came at Noah time. Compared those stories to the Sumerian text that are deciphered and described they matched!<br><br>I suggest go take a read and be open about it. OT maybe real afterall but so may the alien existence proposition be true. The G*d we pray are aliens!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Moses who receive the commandment from G*d also mention about great light that descend from the heaven and vision he had all correspond to telepathy the alien employ to contact human, a race they created and did not manage properly to let it go out of hand  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
