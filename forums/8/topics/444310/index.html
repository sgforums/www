              <p>
              </p><div>With the big hype on fast network via fiber optic connection, in november this year, my family decided we upgrade our home broadband to fiber optic with Singtel exStream package. We were encourage by Singtel sale team to take up the exStream 100 ($79.9) Home package as it will cost us almost the same for the exStream 50 ($64.9 plus $5.35) Home package as we will need to pay for the modem. We were also been told we cannot expect full 100mb connection and as for wireless we be able to get connection to 70mb only. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>After waiting for our installation date we finally got the service installed in <a>December 13th.</a> After trying out the service it's not much of a different with our previous 6mb ADSL network. Speed test using either a third party and Singtel utilities reveal the connection speed of below 50mb and at night it will slow down to below 35mb to 40mb. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I have called the Singtel technical to assist. Two separate occasion I have to comeback home in the afternoon so that the technical team can assist on checking the setting and my PC hardware via online. The technical guy told me that minimum of 50mb is acceptable. Only at one occasion that the connection reach 50 odd that he recorded my connection as above 50. Finally he decide to get a technical guy to check on site at my location. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Two days later the technical guy came to my flat and told me it normal for drop of network speed and on technical term between 35 to 70mb. And he also told it no point to do any exchange of modem. To make it more upsetting is he said even if sign up for 200mb, the signal will be the same. I have the job sheet indicating this statement. All information by the technical guy who came to my flat was confirmed by the technical team when I called them to log a complaint. I question the technical team on what were promise before we sign up for the exStream package. They said they are technical team and the not sales team, so they do not know how sales team promote or say about the exStream package. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Yesterday someone from Singtel called me up to address my complaint. I told them we sign up exStream 100mb Home package only to be told later connection via wireless is between 35 to 70. No mention of this during sign up. She is apologetic and offer two months free subscription. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Wow! Should I be jumping for joy to get a two month free subscription? Why not offer half the subscription fee for the full contract term because we get only half the promise speed?</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I told the her this is not acceptable and Singtel knew about the drop of connection speed, yet promote the exStream service as the one to sign up for better connectivity and sharing the connection with multiple devices. Another thing to be upset is I'm only have one PC at home, what happen if I have more than one. What excuse will Singtel say then? </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I hope the ministry concern will look into this matter. Why should customer pay something that are misleading and misrepresented?</div>

              <p>im using broadband</p>
              <p>on a good day, it's good. </p>
              <p>on a bad day, well, im used to it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a guy came to peddle the fibre</p>
              <p>he said, now bery slow rite? so if u just pay $20 per mth more, it will be faster. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i wonder if they perpersly made home broadband slow so tt ppl would go to fibre</p>
              <p>and then give slow fibre so ppl would sign up the more asspensive one (for perceived higher speed)</p>

              <div>With the big hype on fast network via fiber optic connection,
                  in november this year, my family decided we upgrade our home
                  broadband to fiber optic with Singtel exStream package. We were
                  encourage by Singtel sale team to take up the exStream 100 ($79.9)
                  Home package as it will cost us almost the same for the exStream 50
                  ($64.9 plus $5.35) Home package as we will need to pay for the
                  modem. We were also been told we cannot expect full 100mb
                  connection and as for wireless we be able to get connection to 70mb
                  only. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>After waiting for our installation date we finally got the
                  service installed in <a rel="nofollow">December
                  13th.</a> After trying out the service it's not much of a
                  different with our previous 6mb ADSL network. Speed test using
                  either a third party and Singtel utilities reveal the connection
                  speed of below 50mb and at night it will slow down to below 35mb to
                  40mb. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I have called the Singtel technical to assist. Two separate
                  occasion I have to comeback home in the afternoon so that the
                  technical team can assist on checking the setting and my PC
                  hardware via online. The technical guy told me that minimum of 50mb
                  is acceptable. Only at one occasion that the connection reach 50
                  odd that he recorded my connection as above 50. Finally he decide
                  to get a technical guy to check on site at my location. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Two days later the technical guy came to my flat and told me
                  it normal for drop of network speed and on technical term between
                  35 to 70mb. And he also told it no point to do any exchange of
                  modem. To make it more upsetting is he said even if sign up for
                  200mb, the signal will be the same. I have the job sheet indicating
                  this statement. All information by the technical guy who came to my
                  flat was confirmed by the technical team when I called them to log
                  a complaint. I question the technical team on what were promise
                  before we sign up for the exStream package. They said they are
                  technical team and the not sales team, so they do not know how
                  sales team promote or say about the exStream package. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Yesterday someone from Singtel called me up to address my
                  complaint. I told them we sign up exStream 100mb Home package only
                  to be told later connection via wireless is between 35 to 70. No
                  mention of this during sign up. She is apologetic and offer two
                  months free subscription. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Wow! Should I be jumping for joy to get a two month free
                  subscription? Why not offer half the subscription fee for the full
                  contract term because we get only half the promise speed?</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I told the her this is not acceptable and Singtel knew about
                  the drop of connection speed, yet promote the exStream service as
                  the one to sign up for better connectivity and sharing the
                  connection with multiple devices. Another thing to be upset is I'm
                  only have one PC at home, what happen if I have more than one. What
                  excuse will Singtel say then? </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I hope the ministry concern will look into this matter. Why
                  should customer pay something that are misleading and
                  misrepresented?</div>

              <p>At least they're upfront about the truth, and there's technical explanations behind it. It's like expecting a USB 2.0 connection to be transferring data at 480 mbps all the time when you're talking about cables that are long enough to go to the moon. And unless you're placing your laptop right beside your wireless router, various sources of interference would generally decrease the data transfer speed between them.</p>

              <p>Going from 6 to 35 mbps is not much of a difference? What were you expecting, really?</p>

              <p>Whatever your plan you sign up to wouldn't in any way affect the signal strength. Why the hell would it? It's the signals that's travelling along the cables, and it's naturally weakened by scattering of the light beams as it goes down the fibre.</p>

              <p>Plug that port out to a gigabit network router. Whatever you connect to the router would be able to access the maximum speed your fibre-optics connection offers. </p>
