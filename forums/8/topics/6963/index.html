            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Willa and all,<br><br>I think sometimes it is great to just sit down, reflect and think about things that we may have taken for granted for such a long time. I used to think a lot. It's always about things that are not reflective and which really make me worry and sleepless. Anyway, i am over that phrase now and am  making better use of my brain cells  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Willa thanks for sharing your thoughts and it sorta make me think too.<br><br>For me, the beach is just an underpass away but i am not really into lazing around in ECP coz' the beach is always so milky and dirty! Never my ideal beach! Would love to go to the Caribbean if i ever have the chance.<br><br>During Feb, i went camping with my friends in Pulau Ubin. Although there wasn't a really nice beach, we lay down outside our tents and look up into the sky. Though there weren't many stars to gaze we happened to see two shooting stars! Now how about that?! It was the second time in my life that i happened to see shooting stars. The other was during the meteor shower. (which i can't really remember the date.)<br><br>I always look up in the sky, it's always different even though it's always there. How often have we take time and look up to see what it has to offer? Take a look at the sky someday and u may just find a star shooting across! And it's a really exciting feeling. Well, for me it is. I don't know about others  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Looking forward to all your reflections people!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When I want to laze around and do nothing, I like to sit at the coffee shop outside of borders, looking at people walking past. I haven't done that too long, just a few times, but I liked it.<br><br>The feeling of seeing people walk past and all going off to do stuff, while I stay put... very nice. Gives me a real sense of peace.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmm.....I was told couple times that I also fall in love very easily and quickly.  I personally disagree to some extent.<br><br>I do care for a lot of ppl, but to me loving someone and being in love w/ someone is totally diff.  I love all my friends, I will go an extra mile if they needed me to, but being in love is diff.  For me, being in love mean my world revolving arnd his.  Someone i can share everything w/, all my darkest secrets and all intimate moments.<br><br>For me, it's very easily confused between loving someone and being in love w/ someone, now that i think back in my life (i am old!) I have only truely been in love with one person, but the only regret is that I realized it too late.<br><br>I think for most girls, we are easily confused.  We might think we are in love w/ someone cuz we are caught in the moment/spark or cuz the other person cares/loves us so much.  It's really best for us to give ourselves sometime and think things over.<br><br>Every year on my birthday, I like to sit down and think abt all those ppl that meant something to me, all those ppl who have left footprints on my life, good or bad...<br><br>I love the beach!!!!! I love looking up at the sky and seeing the stars... *smile*  Won't it be best if we call all watch the stars with the person we are in love w/...<br><br>hahahhahahhaa DAMN!  feel like i'm just yapping away here!<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>
