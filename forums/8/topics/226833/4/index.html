What you wrote here is quite base on your own assumations. Might nt be a hit and ran. Might nt be a guy. He might not be gay cuz who knows he surrendered himself alr. So i must agree with some forum mates about your own assumtions. So in future, pls be careful about what you post becuz everyone is innocent until proven guilty. Peace.<br></div>
