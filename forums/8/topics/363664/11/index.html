              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Law Society of Singapore Island refuses to disclose the number of lawyers!</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>A
              couple of years ago, it was reported in the Singapore press that the
              number of lawyers there with an island population of 4.5 million was no
              more than 3,500! Even with this small number, what was alarming was the
              number of lawyers there was shrinking with time, not increasing! In
              fact, the report said, 10 years ago there were more lawyers than what
              they had in 2007.<br><br>The number of 2500 now, guessing the
              shrinkage, is obviously inadequate for a country with a population of
              4.5 million and claiming to be a financial hub! The principle reason is
              ( as any Singapore watcher will agree) the lack of human rights in the
              island; the erosion of the rule of law by Lee Kuan Yew, the dictator,
              interfering in the administration of justice and using it as a
              political tool to destroy his opponents. <br><br>Wanting to know what
              the number of lawyers in Singapore were now, I sent an Email to the Law
              society of Singapore. They have refused to answer. My guess, as
              anyone's guess would be, is this. The number of lawyers have shrunk
              even further and it would embarrass the Law Society to reveal the
              number. So they keep quite. Appended below is the exchange of Emails.<br><br><strong>Communication 1, Gopalan Nair to Law Society</strong>: <em>Article on Singapore lawyers<br>Friday, June 26, 2009 6:50 AM<br>From: "Gopalan Nair" <br>Add sender to Contacts<br>To: shawn@lawsoc.org.sg<br><br>Hello,<br><br>I

              you for your Email. However what you say is troubling. If the exercise
              for filing new practicing certificates ended on April 1, which is
              nearly 2 months since, are you still saying they are still trying to
              organize the figures? This is difficult to accept, especially since
              Singapore is always trying to show they work at lighting speed
              efficiency. <br><br>What appears from public discussion is that the
              lawyer population is not only shrinking, it has in fact got below the
              2,000 mark! The perceived reason is political interference in the legal
              process and the weakening of the rule of law. I do not know if this
              figure of 2,000 is true, an amount totally insufficient for a country
              the population size and business nature of Singapore. <br><br>What I suspect is that this is indeed the case, and you are trying to conceal this fact to avoid embarrassment.<br><br>I
              would be grateful if you answer this in the interests of not only of
              the Singapore public but also any outsider who may want to have
              anything to do with your legal system or country.<br><br>To be fair to
              you, I will be publishing this correspondence and your reply or the

              you for your response, which I honestly did not expect. Your response
              is troubling. Am I taken to understand that the practicing certificate
              exercise ended on April 30, 2009. That your organization publishes the
              statistics once a year, that is in August/ September 2009. Therefore
              between the period April 30, 2009 to August/ September 2009, a period
              of at least 3 months, you or no one in your organization knows how many
              lawyers have practicing certificates! That you must wait until August/
              September, a period of 3 months, before you or anyone else can know how
              many lawyers practice in Singapore! I understand, and I am sure you
              agree that Singapore does not have more than 3,000 lawyers or so, by
              the count last year! And all this difficulty that you have is just for
              this small number. <br><br>And I must go away and wait for August/
              September 2009 to get this figure and in the meantime, my article on
              the declining legal profession in Singapore has to wait.<br><br>Am I am right in saying this?

              <p>Fanning the fire is easy. Are you going to foot the legal bills for Jason ?</p>
              <p>Whether win or lose the case , Jason will have to spend a huge sum of money just on legal bills.</p>
              <p>How much are you going to contribute to the legal fees huh ?</p>
              <p>My belief is that Jason will not want to pursue the matter further unless if Harriet Educational decides to sue Jason lah.</p>

              <p>If the original posts contain truth, then no need to worry. The original posters have the defence of justification, i.e. speaking the truth.                                                                                     Defences<br><br>Whenever you publish anything which might be considered to be defamatory you should consider whether you can establish one of the defences below. Keep the evidence on which you have based your decision for a minimum of 18 months including all drafts of the article, statements, tape recordings and notebooks. A claimant must commence a defamation action within one year of publication of the defamatory statement(s) which runs afresh on each repetition of the publication.<br><br>   <strong>1. Justification</strong><br>      Justification means simply the truth - the defamatory statement is true or substantially true. Justification is both the best and worst defence. It is best because if it succeeds it is an absolute defence regardless of the reason for publication.<br><br>      It is irrelevant whether or not publication of the material was a breach of privacy or confidence or that it was offensive to the claimant. It is the worst defence because the defamatory statement is presumed to be untrue and the onus is on the defendant to prove the contrary.<br><strong>   2. Fair comment</strong><br>      The defence of fair comment on a matter of public interest is designed to preserve the fundamental rights of freedom of speech and expression. In a democratic society everyone is entitled to express genuinely held opinions on matters of public interest however strong or prejudiced those views may be.<br><br>      The defendant must overcome four hurdles to establish this defence:<br>          * the statement must be comment (ie opinion) and not a statement of fact;<br>          * the comment must have a sufficient factual basis (that is the comment must be based on facts which are themselves true);<br>          * the comment must be one that a "fair minded" man could honestly hold;<br>          * the subject matter of the comment must be a matter of public interest.<br>  <strong> 3. Privilege</strong><br>      Privilege is category of defence where the law recognises that it is better that individuals are free to speak their mind (and others to report what they say) without fear of being sued for defamation even if they get it wrong and the claimant's reputation is damaged. Privilege may be absolute or qualified.<br>          * Absolute privilege<br>            Absolute privilege is a complete defence and cannot be defeated even if the claimant proves that the defendant published the words maliciously (unlike qualified privilege). Statements made in judicial or quasi judicial proceedings and statements made in parliamentary proceedings are absolutely privileged.<br>          * Qualified privilege<br>            Qualified privilege will be a defence where the public interest in allowing publication outweighs the claimant's interest in protecting his reputation, unless the claimant proves malice on the part of the defendant. Statements or publications protected by qualified privilege can broadly be divided into two categories:<br>                o statements made by a person who has a duty, to make the statement or an interest in making the statement to a recipient or recipients having a duty or interest in receiving it; and<br>                o fair and accurate reports of certain proceedings, documents and statements.<br>          * Secondary responsibility<br>            The term 'publisher' includes distributors and printers. Although section 1 of the Defamation Act 1996 protects those who have only secondary responsibility they must demonstrate that they have taken sufficient care to rely on the defence, ie that:<br>                o he is not the author, editor or publisher of the statement complained of, or<br>                o he is only involved in providing a system or service by means of which the statement is retrieved, copied, distributed or made available in electronic form. This is the defence that an internet service provider (or a chat room or message board provider) will seek to rely on if he 'innocently' publishes defamatory material. However it is essential for the provider to show that he has taken reasonable care and takes prompt action, if necessary;<br>                o he took reasonable care in relation to its publication and<br>                o he did not know and had no reason to believe that what he did caused or contributed to the publication of the defamatory statement.</p>
