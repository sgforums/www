              <p>hi all,</p>
              <p>I would like to ask if you encountered some teenagers asking you for help by buying a paper clip that is twisted to a heart shape? I was approached the first time two weeks ago, the guy claimed he from NYP but join a private course need to sell finish in order to graduate. he say any amount will do. I gave 2 bucks for his effort, thinking if it would really helped him.</p>
              <p>today it happened again. another guy tried the same trick on me, I was just curious, so I asked what private school they from, how come need to sell this. The guy told me cannot say the private school name.. then I question him more and he changed his attitude and walk off.</p>
              <p>I post this is to ask whether is there really such a course that requires selling of such clips as a graduation requirement? if really is genuine, why can't tell me the school name?</p>
