              <p>Hi, i know of people who do this. Coincidentally they are from Sunshine Empire. Even more coincidentally, their friends that are selling stuffs with them are from Sunshine Empire.</p>
              <p>Once i met such a friend when i joined SE (but quit later) at bugis. She tried to sell me a packet of tissue paper at $10.</p>
              <p>If you look around, and stare hard enough, you will get to see their business manager close by. They are usually just regular teenagers or maybe in their early 20s, sometimes dressed in formal, just walking around.</p>
              <p>Do try asking if they are from SE. Btw, when i joined SE, they said they were sort of a training school for entrepreneurs which is total crap. So maybe that explains why they sell regular useless stuff at high price.</p>
