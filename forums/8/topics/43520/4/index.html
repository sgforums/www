U can have one player for Club A and the next season, ay... another Club. Could be that the club could not offer a better deal but there shld be some kinda royalty to the club isn't it?<br><br>Club would probably do better if the team gel longer and have a positive mindset that they could have a outside chance to win S-League. Just my 2 cents worth. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
