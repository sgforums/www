            <div class='col-md body'>How to download and run the tool<br><br>Important: You must have administrative rights to run this tool on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, or Windows XP.<br><br>Note for network administrators: If you are running MS Exchange 2000 Server, we recommend that you exclude the M drive from the scan by running the tool from a command line, with the Exclude switch. For more information, read the Microsoft knowledge base article, "XADM: Do Not Back Up or Scan Exchange 2000 Drive M" (Article 298924).<br><br>Follow these steps to download and run the tool:<br><br>1. Download the FxKelvir.exe file from: http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/FxKelvir.exe<br>2. Save the file to a convenient location, such as your Windows desktop.<br>3. Optional: To check the authenticity of the digital signature, refer to the "Digital signature" section later in this writeup.<br><br>Note: If you are sure that you are downloading this tool from the Security Response Web site, you can skip this step. If you are not sure, or are a network administrator and need to authenticate the files before deployment, follow the steps in the "Digital signature" section before proceeding with step 4.<br>4. Close all the running programs.<br>5. If you are on a network or if you have a full-time connection to the Internet, disconnect the computer from the network and the Internet.<br>6. If you are running Windows Me or XP, turn off System Restore. For instructions on how to turn off System Restore, read your Windows documentation, or one of the following articles:<br><br># "How to disable or enable Windows Me System Restore"<br># "How to turn off or turn on Windows XP System Restore"<br><br>7. Locate the file that you just downloaded.<br>8. Double-click the FxKelvir.exe file to start the removal tool.<br>9. Click Start to begin the process, and then allow the tool to run.<br>10. Restart the computer.<br>11. Run the removal tool again to ensure that the system is clean.<br>12. If you are running Windows Me/XP, then re-enable System Restore.<br>13. If you are on a network or if you have a full-time connection to the Internet, reconnect the computer to the network or to the Internet connection.<br>14. Run LiveUpdate to make sure that you are using the most current virus definitions.<br><br>When the tool has finished running, you will see a message indicating whether W32.Kelvir.D has infected the computer. The tool displays results similar to the following:<br><br>* Total number of the scanned files<br>* Number of deleted files<br>* Number of repaired files<br>* Number of terminated viral processes<br>* Number of fixed registry entries</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Disabling or enabling Windows XP System Restore<br><br>Situation:<br>You want to know how to turn off or turn on the Windows XP System Restore feature.<br><br>Solution:<br>Before you Begin: This document applies only to Windows XP. If you are using Windows Me, follow the instructions in the document Disabling or enabling Windows Me System Restore.<br><br>System Restore, a Windows XP feature, is similar to the "Last Known Good Configuration" in Windows NT and Windows 2000. You can use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, using the backups that it makes of selected system files and program files. Unlike the "Last Known Good Configuration" feature, System Restore maintains multiple restore points. This gives you the choice of restoring your computer to any number of previously saved states.<br><br>While this is a desirable feature, in some cases it should be temporarily turned off. For example, if the computer is infected with a virus, then it is possible that the virus could be backed up by System Restore. By default, Windows prevents System Restore from being modified by outside programs. As a result, there is the possibility that you could restore a virus-infected file, or that the on-line scanners would detect the virus in that location.<br><br>Disabling System Restore does not delete or remove any of your personal data from your computer. The only files removed are those that System Restore created, the restore points. Using System Restore to revert to a previously saved restore point does not affect any of your personal data files or any items in your My Documents folder. For more information search the Microsoft Windows Help (Click Start &gt; Help and Support) and search for "System Restore Overview" and "Understanding System Restore." These documents explain what System Restore is, how it works, and more information about the effects of turning it on or off.<br><br>Note:<br><br>o You must be logged in as an Administrator to do this. If you are not logged in as an Administrator, the System Restore tab will not be displayed. If you do not know how to log in as Administrator, contact your system administrator (if you are on a network), the computer manufacturer, or installer.<br>o Turning off System Restore will delete all previous restore points. You must create new restore points once you turn System Restore back on.<br><br>To turn off Windows XP System Restore<br><br>1. Click Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Windows Explorer<br>2. Right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.<br>3. Click the System Restore tab.<br>4. Check the "Turn off System Restore" or "Turn off System Restore on all drives" check box as shown in this illustration:<br><br><img src="http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/tsgeninfo.nsf/949e46314f0916a0852565d00073bbfd/5065b3834b10031488256b0900255ea7/Solution/0.136A?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif"><br><br>5.

As noted in the message, this will delete all existing restore points. Click Yes to do this.<br>7. Click OK.<br>8. Proceed with what you need to do. For example, removing viruses. Restart the computer and follow the instructions in the next section to turn on System Restore.<br><br>To turn on Windows XP System Restore<br><br>1. Click Start.<br>2. Right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.<br>3. Click the System Restore tab.<br>4. Uncheck the "Turn off System Restore" or "Turn off System Restore on all drives" check box.<br>5. Click Apply, and then click OK.<br><br>System Restore will create regular backups of selected system files and program files.
