It does not take a degree to become an entrepreneur. In fact, I believe that pursueing a degree will delay a potential entrepreneur 3-4 years to step into the real world to experience and explore. This 3-4 yrs in the real world will allow one to have much exposure to business, networking and entrepreneurship. In addition, it also makes a person poorer with 20k-30k of cash, which can be fully utilise to fulfil his entrepreneur drive.</div>
