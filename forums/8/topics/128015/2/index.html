Oh well, here we go...<br><br>I must agree that kids these days seem to have looser morals. It's not at all uncommon to hear of 13-year old girls losing their virginities and 14 year old boys comparing how many cherries they popped. To me what really astounds me is the fact that I'm only 21 years old, and thus only a few years older than them. I seriously don't remember any of my peers engaging in this sort of thing when I was their age. Maybe there were, but such tales are few and far in between.<br><br>And no, it's not because I was in some prestigious school and was out of touch of reality. I came from a neighbourhood school with its fair share of gangsters and hooligans. While I did hear tales of students engaging in such sexual practices, they were mostly confined to the Upper Sec hooligans.<br><br>Now the age of having sex is dropping liao..... I remember reading a special Straits Times report stating that the average age for teenage sex is now 12. And mind you, that's AVERAGE.... which means that there are some even younger ones as well. My eyes almost popped out of my sockets when one 12-year old kid complained to the reporter that he had to stop having sex as he needed to prepare for his PSLE. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>What it means is that they were having sex at the same age when I was playing Police &amp; Thief and Pepsi Cola 1-2-3 during recess.<br><br>Something to think about.</div></blockquote>Not bashing.. very concern over the matter.<br>Cause at the end, if these kids keep doing these things, your income tax (you are the younger generation) will go towards fixing the issues that they bring about cause of their actions instead of being invested in the correct places to make life better, richer and more money for everyone. Its a bigger picture than wanting to bash them. If I want to bash them, I would have said the following "the kids all are stupid, irresponsble and suck. Singapore will be doomed to have such people as our future."<br>But I do feel a bit of imprnding doom. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

I am just saying that kids who should be studying should not be making babies. 20 yr old already independent and need to be responsible for whatever they do. Can a teenager be responsible for the babies they make? You would be surprise to hear its the same with the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s crowd and what they will do when they know they can get away with it.<br><br>I don't understand why kids are in such a hurry to grow up...<br><br></div>

It was very shaming to become pregnant and usually these people are shunted by the whole school. there's a lot more social pressure not to screw up. But then, perhaps its also because I was in very methodist run schools who are known to be pretty strict. We had s*x ed by the counsellers themselves before holidays, class by class so that we can approach with questions<br><br></div>

We shut ppl with tattoos, gangsters, and etc. Now its all acceptable to act gangster like, have lots of tattoos and have sex as long as use rubber...<br></div>
