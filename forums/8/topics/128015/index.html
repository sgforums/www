            <div class='col-md body'>One evening, while the day was still young, I passed by a neigbhood park. A young couple was petting there openly. As I walked past them, the teenager girl who carried a soft toy in one hand, lifted up her head and stared at me. Just curious to see what they were doing, I cornered my sight toward them. I saw the childish look on that girl face, think she was still a secondary student. She was hugging that guy, who I cant see his face, as his back was facing me. From the expression of her face, I can sense that she is enjoying the petting done by the guy.<br><br>Think that guy sense the present of me behind him and he push the girl away. He turned around, and stared at me. Without sense of shame, he hugged the girl again. But I could see clearly that the girl blouse was unbutton all the way down. Oh my God, I tell myself. That guy look like a secondly school student too.<br><br>What have happen to this world ? I asked myself. As a girl myself, I feel shame for them, especially for that girl.</div>

All these things, I see all the time.<br>young sec kids,  late teens, young adults, middle aged, affairs, locals, foreigners and etc.<br>There's no right or wrong, its just that morally some people feel differently about the issue.<br>Some people have looser morals. Some just don't care. My 20 yr old intern tells me girls she met as young as 13 are no longer virgins, had 6 bf and experienced beyond knowledge. She's shocked but I told her, this is the trend. How to fix/correct even when its not really right but who is to make the call and whose morally right?<br>Just have more abandoned babies, irresposible young fathers, baby killer young mothers, social costs and etc. We get exposed to all that media, and open to negative influences without control or censorship or the ability to handling it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sounds like another bash-the-kids session. Oh well, here we go...<br><br>I must agree that kids these days seem to have looser morals. It's not at all uncommon to hear of 13-year old girls losing their virginities and 14 year old boys comparing how many cherries they popped. To me what really astounds me is the fact that I'm only 21 years old, and thus only a few years older than them. I seriously don't remember any of my peers engaging in this sort of thing when I was their age. Maybe there were, but such tales are few and far in between.<br><br>And no, it's not because I was in some prestigious school and was out of touch of reality. I came from a neighbourhood school with its fair share of gangsters and hooligans. While I did hear tales of students engaging in such sexual practices, they were mostly confined to the Upper Sec hooligans.<br><br>Now the age of having sex is dropping liao..... I remember reading a special Straits Times report stating that the average age for teenage sex is now 12. And mind you, that's AVERAGE.... which means that there are some even younger ones as well. My eyes almost popped out of my sockets when one 12-year old kid complained to the reporter that he had to stop having sex as he needed to prepare for his PSLE. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>What it means is that they were having sex at the same age when I was playing Police &amp; Thief and Pepsi Cola 1-2-3 during recess.<br><br>Something to think about.</div>
