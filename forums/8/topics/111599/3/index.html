America is self-sufficent, Singapore is not.<br>but always remember that humble people will prove to be the winners in the long run, nobody believed that the japanese can beat the russians in WW2, being humble to me is a virtue everybody should adopt  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

If cost of living is high, being poor is not really a choice.<br><br><blockquote><br>may not be a wealthy but u may be healthy.</blockquote>I tend to disagree this.<br>Wealthy people have access to life-prolonging drugs, rehabs and stuff. which the majority of the poor dont. They can live on organic food, vits, have the best access to medical facilities when they are sick.<br><br>In short, the poor are screwed, and trying to console themselves with statements such as above.<br><br><blockquote><br>may not be rich in wealth but u are rich with love.</blockquote>Same case. Yes, being rich will have a tendency of inviting slugs and leeches. But then, how long can one live? given a choice, i think any poor guy will trade love with riches. especially so those who've been denied of a decent daily meal. With riches, you can do more things. You CAN back a weak charity organisation. but when you are poor.... you have nothing to provide except your labour and perhaps life?<br><br><blockquote><br>have high expectation get them with ur own hands, helps are not needed.<br>keep in mind head how big where how big cap.<br>move on, life is nv fair.[/b]</blockquote>Thats right, life is never fair. You can't live a life of a king when you are poor. But you CAN CHOOSE to live the life of a poor when you are king. it is the difference.<br><br></div>
