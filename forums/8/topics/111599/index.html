            <div class='col-md body'><strong>I feel that people from poor families are unfair in certain aspect.<br><br>Being rich their parents can afford them a better environment to nuture them.Be it a capital for them to start a new business, or a downpayment for a new car. <span style="color: red;">parents pay for their oversea education even if they are stupid for a degree in local uni. </span>After that, they go back to army as white horse status and do nothing till they ORD and get a better job because of their degree.<br><br>For poor people, with only a diploma or less, they have to start at the bottom or even worse. The pay sucks and even after working for many years we might not be able to reach the level of the degree holder. <span style="color: red;">The poor that study private U, will have to pay themselves and sometimes take 2 to 3 jobs just to sustain the course fees.</span><br><br>On top of all this grief, we still have all the crap about local ladies being judgemental of us poor guys.<span style="color: red;"> Give the poor a break and just admit that if the person is poor and lowly educated, he's not worth the time. so ladies, spare them the excuses. </span><br><br>So you see, being poor in singapore doesn't help at all. just try to take care of our health, as medical care is getting more expensive by the day. medisave is enough if we don't get sick often.</strong></div>
