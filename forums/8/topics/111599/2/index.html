            <div class='col-md body'>Oh.... and here's my S$0.02 cents' worth (pardon the pun).<br><br>Sure, no one wants to be poor, what more in Singapore. When I was in Sec 3 all the way to JC 2 my family had financial problems.<br><br>It reached to the extent where I had to skip lunch many many times just to cover my school expenses (transport, assessment books, lecture notes) and so on. Not surprisingly, I was really underweight. I weighed only 46kg (height: 1.66m) in Sec 4 and 53kg (height: 1.70m) in JC 2. My peers and teachers kept expressing their fears that I had anorexia or something.<br><br>Other people were happily comparing their handphones and talking about how fun ICQ/MSN was.... and there I was, constantly thinking about how I wish I could have lunch.<br><br>However, I told myself that there's no point in being bitter and sore over these things. While being poor has been very disadvantageous to me, it also proved to be (partly, at least) a blessing in disguise. By not having to worry about what handphones to buy, I didn't have to worry about handphone bills. By not having Internet access at home, I could devote more time to studies instead of wasting hours yakking on MSN and ICQ every night (like what some of my peers did).<br><br>What's more, poverty doesn't have to last forever if you quit whining and start to do something about it. Just work as hard as you can now, and some day, you will succeed. It doesn't hurt as well to have a little faith and believe that things can get better.<br><br>I'm now much better off, thank goodness, because my sis has entered the workforce as a JC lecturer and my elder bro is following suit.<br><br>I also became financially independent in the army....... I didn't have to worry about finances then. The army pay, while meagre, was more than what I received from my parents.<br><br>I'm now also much fitter now that I can eat properly.... I'm now at a much better 61kg (height: 1.70m).<br><br>No one ever said it would be easy..... but you can make things better if you're willing to try.</div>
