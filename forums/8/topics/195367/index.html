            <div class='col-md body'>What happened to the Singaporean girls we all used to know as conservative and prude... Now they've gone from conservative to almost slutty. But the one thing that still hasn't changed is that the Singaporean Chinese still have no idea what their doing in the bedroom. But why just the Singaporean Chinese... And it doesnÂ’t just involve the women but the men too. Maybe thatÂ’s why we find many Singaporeans dating Caucasian men... Some used to say it the wallet of the westerner that attracts the ladies but if we take a closer look, we will find that that is not true.... Or if it is only to a certain extent. Yes many "ang mo's " are executives in their respective companies however they are not the ones with the biggest wallets... The Chinese in Singapore have bigger wallets but their women still end up with foreign men. I don't mean to insult anybody here but has anyone ever stopped and actually wondered why??? Its not because the "ang mo" is better looking, its not because they have bigger wallets, its because they know how to treat a lady... I'm sure many people can defend their girlfriends and boyfriends but the truth of the matter still remains the "ang mo" knows how to better look after their ladies.</div>

On a side note, westerners lose their virginity quite young compared to easterners.  They also very independant and mature quickly.<br><br>It's a myth that westerners have bigger packages.  I know caucasian chicks some of them have small packages.  Some had gone thru surgery.  Whatever floats your boat.<br><br>They are some caucasian males/females that are wealthy and unwealthy.

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh i guess i really did ruffle a few feathers huh... CBC you make some god points... I think what i was trying to say got taken the wrong way but its also probably due to the fact that i didn't properly literate what i was trying to say and we've all just veered off topic...<br><br>Asians and Angmoh's really no difference.... I wasn't trying to say one is better than the other... Just that they go about things in a different manner...<br><br>Point of the matter is and i guess my question to you guys living in singapore is.... What has happened in singapore that made the girls easier???<br><br>Not really sure how you full blooded asians go about getting your women, but i now many ang mohs and they generally start off with a lot of bullsh*t, as for me i personally like to mix the bullshi*t with reality sort of stretch the truth... or bend it, but never break it...  As for the caucasians being wife beaters... Well i don't know about that... Yes it happens but i've also heard of asian guys doing that so no big difference there...<br><br>And just to reiterate what CBC was saying no matter where we come from and what colour we are on the outside, we all bleed red.<br></div>
