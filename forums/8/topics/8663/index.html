            <div class='col-md body'>just curious.<br><br>if one talks about his/her exs or crushees sometimes to their new bf/gf, does that mean that one is not over him/her? could it not be that sometimes in the context of the conversation that's going on, one has something relevant to contribute, does the fact that the person being mentioned is an ex or a crushee negates the love one has for the current bf/gf? i don't think so. just imagine that for fear of upsetting the new bf/gf, one can never mention one's ex or crushee, how tedious.<br><br>thoughts or memories are by association, sometimes, certain things just trigger the memories of one's exs or crushees, would you rather that your bf/gf is confident and comfortable enough to talk to you about them or you prefer to be kept in the dark while your bf/gf reminisces in private? which is worse? but of course, there must be a limit to everything, if your bf/gf is forever talking about his/her exs or crushees, it's clear that they have not gotten over them, then it may be best to let him/her know that it hurts when he/she talk about his/her exs or crushees.</div>

Don't leave it until someday, you break down and decided to jump to extremes for a breakup. It is sad if things would ever reach this state.<br><br>Sometimes, the guy has not gotten over yet. It is up to you to help him to tide thru it, to re-assure and help him to get over the period of pain.<br><br>Remember, u are now with him, and his ex is no longer with him.

It is analogous to being jealous to a dead person...<br><br>Hope you will sort it out.<br><br>yours<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights.

            <div class='col-md body'>Phuturistic,<br><br>you've been dating for six months and he still keeps on mentioning his ex??? If it were me, alarm bells would have been ringing in my head. It's normal for people to talk about their ex to their current partner for a month or two, but if he can't stop mentioning her after six months, it could very well mean trouble.<br><br>What I would advise you to do is to tell him how much this is upsetting u. If he still doesn't change, then it's time for a short separation to let him decide who he really wants. If he is really yours, he'll come back to you even if you let go of him. My 2 cents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hate to kill the roses in the picture but it's possible that he talks so much about her because he's still obsessed with the girl.  yes, you're the one who's with him now but what if the girl wants a reconcilliation with him?  it's not a simple matter, you should listen closely to what he is saying about her and whether he does it to exorcise her out of his mind or to keep her fire burning  instead.  good luck, and remember, there are millions of guys out there.</div>
