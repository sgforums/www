And i thank this country and you lot for being who u all are, Spore has given me this opportunity, even if it means serving some PEOPLE here, im cool with it, surprisingly for a foreigner eh? I guess that's because i have adaptatation, most likely due to my youthful travelling.<br><br>Back to this opportunity, an opportunity to get FREE california gym stuff rofl, im better now, i can 2.4 and more now lol woot, never could do that! But most importantly, i have a whole Company of Men who like and respect me for who i am. my NCC background did help also, coz i was doing most of the "helping" by advising on how the uniform was to be done properly, how the rifle is cleaned, how the drills are done, and how to SUCK it UP when the stress of being commanded daily kicks into the soul of young conscripted men.<br><br>I actually discovered what devil said was correct. People warm up to positivity, enthusiasm and a never say die attitude, rather than a pessimistic Nazgul creature of a man, which is wot i was.<br><br>Do you know how it feels to have a group of people look at you acknowledgingly when you come and join them? Do you know how it feels inside when people tell u their dissappointed ur not joining them? Do you know how it feels to have the love and care of a beautiful woman? Do you know how it feels to have people like you for a change as supposed to what seems like a lifetime of SHITTTY JC life? Most of you cannot sympathise because you have all led a sheltered life, i do not blame you.<br><br>Once again, although at this moment it sounds mad, i thank the SAF for the opportunity that has paid off for me emotionally and still continually pays me financially <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Emotionally healed, so to speak, I have managed to forge stronger links with my other existing friends, who like me more being a better person than wot i was. It can get boring for them to hear me always bitching and whining about my prior life, now i do the listening and the encouraging for them, and i like the change. One could say economically/metaphorically i am on an economic boom curve going upwards now, it certainly feels that way emotionally.<br><br>Not leaving out God. God works in mysterious ways i suppose, 1 second he f u c ks you and the next he loves you. I've been f u c k ed by him and now im loved, until he decides to fuck around with me again, as he does everyone and everything. Many of you disagree and still affirm he is the staunch benign dude ALWAYS 100% 24/7, but if he is that all the time, why then call him mysterious and why do we trust in him? Either way, that is my interpretation of you god, and i thank him and all of you none the less.<br><br>Call me a joke. Call me mad. Regardless, hahahah *To quote from ur BORING nationalistic messages* (no pun intended), THERE WAS A TIME, when i would tear myself up over such lessening comments to my masculinity, self worth etc, but not anymore.. I have picked myself up and nothing gets me down now, least of all a few narrow minded local SGers of ALL people lol.<br><br>But still i want to thank all of you for listening when i was down, which was a long time. I want to thank all of u for ur comments and advice; devil, gendaken, beautiful mind, EVEN fireice sometimes lol, and all of u. I appreciate sgforums.<br><br>ciao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>jesus christ guys, ur missing the point, this is not about NS. F u c k NS lol, im rejecting citizenship and PR after i ORD or ROD or whatever.. unless miraculously something stirs patriotism in me to defend and love this dull un patriotic country..judging by UR views and the views of many locals which demonstrate the complete failure of unified nationalism vis a vis a british passport... i seriously doubt it. *flame me* bring it on!<br><br>But i am here to say this: The point is i am better and healthier because of a new phase in my life, with proof points that i am not the bastard i thought i was and no one liked me in JC. As mentioned above. You people focus on monotony of it, prolly coz you either lead dull lives that do not form a contrast to what u are subject to during ur NS life. OR because you led great lives before NS and are subject to the monotony of NS. Regardless, i like what i have become during this phase and what i will become, in the words of Emily Bronte, "above and beyong you all."<br><br>Well done m@A. Thanks.<br></div>
