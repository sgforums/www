            <div class='col-md body'>In the past, men have been the sole breadwinners, providing for families and paying bills.<br><br>Men have also dominated nearly all fields of work, especially science and technology, financial industry and research and development.<br><br>As the 22nd century draws nearer, women are slowly filling the cracks left by men. As more women become better educated, they are unsatisfied with taking a backseat. More career minded females are now challenging men for the top posts. It is becoming more likely that your next boss may be a female.<br><br>Dwindling marriages and housewives are also becoming an issue in parliment. MPs and NMPs like Dr Amy Khor and Eunice Olsen are slowly become the norm.<br><br>Coupled with the fact that female leads in movies are become a greater hit than men....could it indicate a radical shift in dominance?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think organised religion may also have a part to play in women being marginalised. The Christians believe God is their Father (not mother), only men can get ordained and the head of the Vatican is a man, among others. Same for the Muslim ulamas. As for Wicca, it teaches that the Earth is a mother, since all living beings come from Her. Therefore, they have High Priestesses to lead their covens. Hence, I wouldn't be surprised that respect for women was more prevalent in the old days before the coming of organised religion. A pity Wiccans are being seen as evil despite the act that they oppose dark arts and strive to be close to nature.<br><br>Averywhere you go, there are gender stereotypes which are the result of assigning strict gender roles. Women are allowed to gossip but not men, when in effect, gossiping is bad for both genders. We get many double standards with regards to what each gender can or cannot do. Also note the uneven distribution of power between genders. The biggest example is Korea's <span style="font-style: italic;">hoju</span> system, where the matriarch of the house is subservient to her grandson even if his parents are dead since he is the only boy left.<br><br>Looks like women can only dominate in the bedroom and nowhere else. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
