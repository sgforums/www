Look at those who have been through it, when they meet up, they always talked about the funny things that happened during then. Laugh at those silly antics that was then bloody hardship and full of anger...<br><br>Oh well, I do agree we lose out on NS where I have a friend who is Malaysian and Singapore PR. 1 year younger. Came to SG to studied for 3 years in Polytechnic. Singapore government offered SPR provided he worked for a SG company for a min of 2 years (i think). Proclaimed he is Singaporean, had a Singaporean girlfriend.<br><br>While his true blue Singaporeans peers are running SOCs, he is happily working with a steady income and even overseas posting. Now he is a Regional Sales Manager at a tender age for a German company. I think most of his peers are still at Assistant Engineers position. I rememeber him saying, Singapore goverment GIVE him the SPR, not that he wanted it or what. Oh man!<br><br>Now with his SPR status, he is looking to buy a flat in SG with his new Indonesian GF, well he has since dumped his Singaporean GF. Sighz.. Am I jealous? You bet I am! But I guess there is no end comparing and complaining, we have to strive out our own career right?<br><br>So does NS helps or not? I dont know.

            <div class='col-md body'>The PM of Singapore has put out the challenge to make Singapore a Globalised City. What does this mean and why must Singaporeans do to gear up for the challenge of a Globalised city?<br><br>By globalising Singapore, it means that Singapore does not just belong to Singaporeans, it has to embrace the numerous foreign talents landing in Singapore for high quality jobs.<br><br>Our ministers have emphasised many times that Singaporeans have to improve their service standards to serve the people in this Globalised city. They have to take orders better and anticipate the needs of our foreign visitors.<br><br>Singaporeans should be proud when they serve their National Service. They are protecting not just their fellow Singaporeans but the large number of FTs and PRs that reside here.<br><br>In other words, NS has become more important in a Globalised City and Singaporeans must live to their new obligations to this Globalised City. All Singaporeans must now feel lucky for playing a more important role in this world. They should be thankful for the great leadership from the PAP leaders who have elevated Singaporeans to play this bigger role.</div>

Oh my... How can I forgot to include all these great leaders. War is fearsome but even so is the aftermath that follows such as social riots, politicals turmoils, races riots, gang fights, extortions, civil war etc. Luckily these leaders are bless with leadership trails and characteristics to be able to bring the country into stability and prevent unnecessary bloodshed just like what MM LKY did in the 60s.<br>Of course, great leader must be protected if <span style="font-style: italic;">possible</span>, but still God will forgive your soul if you can't... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
