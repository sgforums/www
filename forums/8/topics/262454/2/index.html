That's a tough one - the field covers a wide range of things from human resources, organisational strategy and industrial relations to human factors and ergonomics.  Personally, I've done some human factors work looking at pilot training and implementation of computer systems, but the biggest part of my experience in my earlier years was in designing recruitment and selection systems.  These days, I'm working on organisational culture and program evaluations.<br><br>I'm registered to practice in Australia.  The requirements are a postgrad degree in psychology (the registration board assesses the qualification to make sure that it covers all of the key topics in psychology), plus a minimum of 120 days' practice supervised by a registered psychologist.  my understanding is that Singaporean registration only requires 50 days of supervised practice.<br><br>As for education, I completed a doctorate in organisational/industrial psychology at the University of Melbourne.</div>

I think they're just jealous because we make more money than them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  When I was first being interviewed for the doctorate program, I asked the convenor how many applications he'd received.  Counting international applications, about 1200 Honours grads applied for the 12 places in my course, so I don't think I did too badly.<br><br>But yeah, it's fun.  I'm the sort to get bored easily and my range of clients keeps me happy.  On top of that, my work combines business and psychology, and that lends itself to a whole lot of applications.  In my free time, I tend to stick my fingers into cross-disciplinary work by throwing ideas about with friends and providing advice to them about setting up their management structures and processes, or the statistical side of medical research.</div>
