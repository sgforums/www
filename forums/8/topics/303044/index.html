            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Case 1 : Indian Guru</strong><br><br>I walked past Carlton Hotel last december . Then there is this indian sikh guy who came out from the hotel.<br><br>He said "Good Morning" and I smiled back. Realising that I have responded , he started to speak. He told me he is an indian fortune teller and he can read my future.<br><br>Thinking it was a kind gesture of him , I listened. Before that , he wrote something on the paper , folded it  and passed to me . I was told to open it later.<br><br>Next , He asked me to pick a colour except red and white. I chose blue. Ok then he broke the word "BLUE" into 4 different words , telling me how each word represent my destiny next year.<br><br>And finally he asked me to open that slip. Indeed the word "blue" was in the paper before I even told him the colour.<br><br>Well , thinking that I am convinced that he is the GURU. He passed me a blue gem , saying that I will need that to improve my luck. And then the scam comes , he asked me to pay him SGD $50!!<br><br>Of course I said no , and he demanded the gem back.<br><br><strong>Case 2 :  Credit Card Scam (Bank Of China) </strong><br><br><a href="http://www.sgclub.com/singapore/bank_alert_debt_44149.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgclub.com/singapore/bank_alert_debt_44149.html</a><br><br>Visit that link and see how the scam is carred out<br><br>I got a simliar case this morning. But this time round , the guy claim that he is from the collection department from Bank Of China<br><br>Said the same thing , that I owed 4800 credit card coz someone used my card to buy laptop. And in fact I don't have any credit card from bank Of China.<br><br>Gave me a number from Bank Of China which can be easily found on the website. And also ask me to settle this at their recollection department at another office. Which I later checked that it is an insurance company , not office from Bank Of China.<br><br>The guy spoke broken English and somehow have my IC number. He used the last 4 digit of my IC to verify. Should have checked with him the full IC number.<br><br>I sensed that it is a fraud. I prompted the guy on the phone to provide me the address details where the items were bought. While giving me halfway , the line got cut. Guess he also realised I knew the game all along.<br><br>The number I got is not a local number as well = +30721160<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">So dear people , please be careful.
