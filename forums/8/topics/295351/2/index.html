Now that the project is done, it seems no more than just meting out punishment to the guy.<br><br>Before you give him the fail sentence, do try to talk to him and be frank about the feelings of the team. Open up in front of him and show that you are ready to compromise if there are enough good reasons behind his problem and he can deliver something for the team. Let him see clearly the mistakes he has made in the project and if done correctly, you will see a change in attitude of a bad person.

            <div class='col-md body'>wat jojobeach stated is true. ur lecturer or ur management next time u work in may not buy ur excuse becos of one individual who is not contribute. they will rather see u as a failure who cannot lead ur team member to perform n view u as less interaction between ur team.<br><br>a real team share burden among themselves instead of finger pointings at one another when failure occurs. be glad there is a black sheep in ur team as u will expect to encounter them next time u step into working society.<br><br>what u should learn is how to turn him to contribute maybe a little for the team to make him feel important in his role as team member rather than thinking ways of kicking him off.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the advice. I must first said i do not want and does not want anything to do with him. I mean i have the authority to strike him off as i am the group leader and my tutor learned about his behaviour through the remaining 2 girls and the tutor said i had the power to strike him off.<br><br>I am a normal guy i do not have a big heart just a normal heart, the things he did is simply childish, things like he will talk and talk about ideas while never even do any research. We were each assigned individual tasks to perform. Example he will do half of the task and i do the other half and when the deadline is nearing, i will call and sms him whether had he completed his part. He will never reply and finally when i get to meet him, he will act ignorant and pretend that he cannot do it and seriously i curse him so nights when i have to cover his backside by doing his part.<br><br>The last straw comes when i combine the whole project and i email him a copy of the whole thing, and during the final stage of discussion where the whole group gathers. He will rave stupid questions like "How come it does not have this part or that theory etc". Then i will say its in page this and page that, apparently he does not even care to read the whole thing and yet still have the cheek to critize our hard work. Anyway the other 2 girls just call me and we decided to strike him off.<br><br>I mean the 3 of us agree if that joker even had a single ounce of proof that he did put in hard work to do any research we will let him be our group but seriously that guy is a joke</div>

Will you simply sack some one who is slacking in performance at the end of the year? Knowing he has a family to feed ? Or that he has medical needs which has to be paid for with this income ?<br>Shouldn't you have given him a warning letter and let him know of his unsatisfactory performance ?
