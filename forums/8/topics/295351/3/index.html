I must first said i do not want and does not want anything to do with him. I mean i have the authority to strike him off as i am the group leader and my tutor learned about his behaviour through the remaining 2 girls and the tutor said i had the power to strike him off.<br><br>I am a normal guy i do not have a big heart just a normal heart, the things he did is simply childish, things like he will talk and talk about ideas while never even do any research. We were each assigned individual tasks to perform. Example he will do half of the task and i do the other half and when the deadline is nearing, i will call and sms him whether had he completed his part. He will never reply and finally when i get to meet him, he will act ignorant and pretend that he cannot do it and seriously i curse him so nights when i have to cover his backside by doing his part.<br><br>The last straw comes when i combine the whole project and i email him a copy of the whole thing, and during the final stage of discussion where the whole group gathers. He will rave stupid questions like "How come it does not have this part or that theory etc". Then i will say its in page this and page that, apparently he does not even care to read the whole thing and yet still have the cheek to critize our hard work. Anyway the other 2 girls just call me and we decided to strike him off.<br><br>I mean the 3 of us agree if that joker even had a single ounce of proof that he did put in hard work to do any research we will let him be our group but seriously that guy is a joke</div></blockquote>Yes, I totally understand your anguish.<br>I've been through it myself.<br><br>Projects.... what I truly learned from it was not the subject matter, but more the human handling aspects.<br><br>You will, after all this is done and over with, look back and laugh at it.<br><br>Right now, do what you deem is most fitting.

Even if my superiors try to sugar coat things , I tell them to go straight to the point. If they criticise , I thank them and ask them how to improve. It is not easy to take negative comments but one has to soak it in, learn and improve oneself.<br><br>If the guy cannot take criticism - that's too bad. If he chooses to kill himself, it is his choice and a rather dumb choice since there is more to life than criticism. The only thing I regret is that he made such a dumb choice to leave his loved ones over one stupid things. I won't regret what I said.<br><br>So far I have not met any one so suicidal over professional criticism. And when you do tell a person off - you don't target them on a personal level - you target them on their professional performance in front of the team affected. One thing is I never yell - I talk in a normal tone - much easier to handle things effectively in a calm manner<br><br>If it is an indivdual performance - then I take them aside and talk to them. Yes I had one or two subordinates did cry before but I just tell them that there is no point crying - what is done is done - now is based on the future.<br><br>You cannot make the whole world like you and vice versa.<br></div>
