He always call her and thr there the r/s develop. when she finalli get to met him when she grad and return, she found out things which he had lied to her and becomes wary of him.  However they still get on together as couple coz she wanna give him a chance and to prove others wrong (that he is infact a trustable guy). Most imptly, she loves him. However, three mths later, the guy "disappear" frm her life ( no contact at all). She was sad and take the r/s as off.  Another three mths later, he reappear and now, asking her to start afresh.  Shld she forgive him again and give it a try again (try to trust him again) or shld she give another guy (who is currently after her) the chance instead?<br><br>------------------<br>Faces behind the masks...how many times do u actually....see beyond the "Masks"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sounds like this guy is pretty unreliable and could be just playing ard with yr friend... Any reason given for his missing act? Dun think yr friend should give him another chance w/o considering carefully the high likelihood of him doing something to hurt yr friend again.

            <div class='col-md body'>well from wat i read i think that the guy is not very trustable, and i feel that he just<br>plain lame cos he told lies to the very person that hes supposed to love<br>well she gave him a chance but he did not take it<br>so why should she give him another chance to start afresh<br>well she should forget about him and find someone better if not someone who truely cares and love her<br>well maybe the other would fit<br>but i think she would be wary after this exprience<br>well hope i gave u some light<br>this is just my two cent worth of help<br>:cooleyes:</div>
