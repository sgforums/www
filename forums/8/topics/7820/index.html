            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;Hi Hello Kitty,<br><br>Hey, try not to feel so bad okay? I know that it's easier said than done, especially since you're not feeling too well. If you were the g/f in this scenario, you probably expected your b/f to keep you company instead of gallivanting with his friends since he wanted to go out for coffee, chit chat and some smoking only, which is like not really important or unless your illness is infectious. And you would expect him to at least call, if not to check on how you're doing, then perhaps tell you how's he enjoying himself.<br><br>I gathered that you're quite young and therefore your b/f would be young too and they're usually not as mature nor as thoughtful (no flames from the guys please, it's reportedly a fact that most guys mature later than girls of the same age   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">), so do give him the benefit of the doubt and if he has some sense in him, should he read of your postings in this forum, I think he will feel contrite and hopefully be a more thoughtful person in future. Try not to let this affect your relationship too much but if you're the gal involved, only you yourself know what the best to be done.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Hi proddy:<br><br>In this instance, I think it has very to do with trust or whatever, it's just that when one is sick, one would expect one's b/f to keep one company and if that's not possible, at least to occasionally call to check up on one even if he's out with friends, especially since mobile phones are so common place these days and even if he doesn't carry one, one would expect him to go hunt for a public phone and call one.<br><br>Well, if I were the g/f in this scenario, my b/f better call me occasionally to check up on me, unless I am suffering from fever, when I need to sleep and probably won't have a clue what happened.<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 11 June 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Well, Hello Kitty,<br>When a guy and a gal is in a r/s, and the r/s lacks trust and communication, it becomes a problem. If your other half is out till even for 8 hours, you should at least go and rest and ask him later nicely. If you find out that he is cheating behind your back, then by all means, do what you want. But I think that you should just cool down and rest....</strong><br><br>Trust is never a question here. Does that mean you will rest without even checking it out first?<br>I am still maintaining my composure. I just feel numb.<br>I rested too. Around 6:30a.m. Just knocked out as soon as i hit my bed. I was so tired. Woke up at 12+. How i wished i didn't. Forever.<br>For the whole of the week, not a day had i have a good rest.<br>Still as tired but just can't bring myself to sleep.<br><br><strong>If r/s is just merely about a few hours of disappearance, then what more can we learn to love someone and be with someone?</strong><br><br>What does love mean to you then? Enduring and living with hours of disappearances? Will you do that to someone you love? Is that statement of yours equivalent to "If you love someone, you'll set her free"? If you can so easily let go of someone, that relationship is never meant to be.<br>Can u withstand the thought that you have been 'disappearing' for hours and, obviously, your beloved one don't even care? How about waiting till god-knows-when while the other person won't even give a damn? Try doing this for 8 hours straight, from a late night till the sun rises, on a day when you feel sick, weak and tired. This message will get across better if it happens that you are down with one of your most detested illnesses; one of those which really makes you so irritated you'll feel like banging your head on the wall. And after several months of thoughts of going to the doctor to request to be placed on medication of sleeping pills and anti-depressants. Morever, this is not the first disappearing act.<br><br><strong>*sigh*</strong><br><br>Seriously, i don't know what you are sighing for.<br><br><strong>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</strong><br><br>I fully agree with you on this. But if possible, you should dedicate your devotion to a more deserving lady who loves you. It shouldn't be a problem since you sound so optimistic.<br><br>------------------<br>LET ME DIE A VIRGIN !!!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Hello Kitty:</div><div class="quote_body">Tet, can you really get to sleep? When you have no expectation of someone, what is that person for? And when you can rest without worries, what is she/him to you?<br>Her/his presence is so insignificant yet so great an impact. The person will only be taking up space n time in your life, along with robbing you of your efforts and feelings;  you may as well do away with it.<br></div></blockquote>Well, sometimes, it is better not to have expectations at all. It make you feel depressed and disappointed. There are times where I feel depressed because I felt the loss of my ex-gf last year, and have very difficult nights to sleep... The r/s is for 2 years, and to break up before an important exams last year because of a third party, is not something easy to live with, consider the fact that I crashed my exams later. What I am saying, is that I understand how you feel. However, you have reached to the point that it gets really serious.<br><br>I have a very close friend, who recently called me in the middle of an important volleyball game between my college and some other college in the university. She was crying over the phone, because she waited for her husband for 4 hours in the bus station, as he was travelling from France to UK, and she cried over the phone and did not know what to do. I have to reduce the team to 5 and rushed to help her out. Luckily, by the time, I reached the bus station to check out what happened, he arrived due to the delay of a bus breaking down on the way and the first thing I did is to use my mobile to call my friend that her husband is okay. Can u imagine if the bus has caught in the accident and my friend loses her husband? I am sure that the feeling she gets is much worse than you. There are always things out there which are much worse, and you just have to learn to cope with it, whether you like it or not. In the end, I rushed back to the court to play the last game and by some luck,  we got thru.<br><br>Don't think too much. Hope that your bf has called you.<br><br>Do take care...<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>The Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hmmm....Kitty..It will have to depend on what kind your the other half is....Like for example...You know your the other half alwayz go home early..rarely before 12..Sooo..if he/she is still not home before 12...It's time to call him/her....</strong><br><br>How do you call when the hours are not regular? Can i only call when he reaches home? Will you call your boyfriend before he gets home? Will you or your boyfriend call to keep each other updated?<br><br><strong>I think the best is to make him/her call u when he/she reached home...LIke me and my bf...After tuitions or whatever crap..I make it a point to call him though matter how troublesome it is...</strong><br><br>What if he doesn't? Used to, on own accord, but not anymore? If he's claims he's busy?<br><br><strong>And another thing is to know his habits..So you'll know roughly what time he will be reaching home...For my bf..i kinda know that he has a habit of not reaching home until 3 or 4 in teh morning...And he calls..SO it's quite ok...And 'coz he works in Sparks and dun come home until 3 or 4..I DEMAND that he page me when he reach home even though i'm sleeping...In case something happen on his way home...</strong><br><br>What if it's not done even if you demanded for it?<br><br><strong>BUt overall...It still feels DAMN SUCKY to be stuck at home when your the other half is enjoying...But i think...trust for ur bf is impt...Try to prompt him to talk about his outings with his friends when you're not there...That way...at least you won't b completely out in teh sea...Know what i mean...</strong><br><br>I wouldn't do that. I won't ask my guy for the details, but i'll gladly be at all ears if he, miracally, does so.

            <div class='col-md body'>hi Hello Kitty,<br><br>if i didn't read your posts wrongly, it would seem that you're going through a bad patch in your relationship with your boyfriend. i know that you didn't ask for my opinions, do tell me to stuff if you want to but here is what i think:<br><br>i think you should talk it out with him, it's pointless to lose sleep over him continuously and yes, i know that it's easier said than done, but you'll just lose more sleep for a few weeks and you will feel even worse at the end of it and if things doesn't improve by then, a small part of you dies. what does that achieve except that you get a little more disillusioned? so, do talk to your b/f and asked him outright where does he sees the relationship going? if he sees it going nowhere, maybe you would have to cut your losses and let time heal your wounds, itÂ’s pointless hurting yourself this way. there are other better and caring guys out there.<br><br>and please try not to get sleeping pills for your sleepless nights lest you get addicted to it, if depression is what keeps you from sleeping, even if the sleeping pills aid you in sleeping the night before, youÂ’ll still feel depressed when you wake up. most of us handle depression differently, for me i try to sleep it off or go to Borders to read, i know itÂ’s difficult to think of happy stuff when all one wants is release, but do find something you enjoy doing, keep at it and yes even while at it, depression may creep in, acknowledge it and tell yourself that you rather be happy than depressed, it takes time but time does heal everything although itÂ’s a lousy beautician.<br><br>i hope you will feel better and get over whatever is depressing you soon.<br><br>yours truly,<br>colette</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prodigal, what makes you think that his safety has never crossed my mind?<br><br>Have you ever tried waiting for your girlfriend till late at night? And finally you have to go to bed first because she called you last minute to tell you that she'll be out for supper. You ask her to give you a call when she gets back. She agreed and assured (or 'entertained') you that she won't stay for long.<br>Left with the few hours, you have no choice but to sleep. Every one hour, you automatically wake up to see whether you have missed her call. You don't want to call her up; you don't have the heart to spoil her night out. Finally, the hour before you are supposed to wake up, you jolted up from the bed. The call never come. Your heartbeat nearly stop. You blame yourself so being so sleepyheaded.<br>You call her up. She's alright after all. You feel so relieved. She told you that she was already back just that a bit too late because she couldn't possibly be so rude as to make a move first. When you probe as to why she didn't give you a call, she replies that she didn't want to wake you up from your sleep.<br><br>This is the first and certainly not the last. You will have this kind of sleepless and burdened nights every now and then. The only consolation is that the fear will wean off and your reaction won't be so great and startling anymore.<br><br>------------------<br>LET ME DIE A VIRGIN !!!!!!</div>
