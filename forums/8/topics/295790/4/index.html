            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Meia Gisborn:</div><div class="quote_body">Regardless of what the criminal is armed with, if he is intent on doing you bodily harm, you stand a better chance of protecting yourself and your loved ones with a gun.<br><br>In most self-defense scenarios, the mere presentation of a firearm is usually sufficient to deescalate the situation, without shots being fired. It happened to a friend and me back in 2004: we were accosted by a pair of thugs demanding cash in an isolated parking ramp at night. We tried walking away but they trailed and then blocked us. When they ignored demands to back off and got too close, we both drew and presented our concealed handguns. The thugs immediately turned tail and left the area, and we (fortunately) did not have to discharge our firearms.<br><br>A gun is merely a tool that, in the wrong hands, can do great bodily harm. It is also capable, as googoomuck has pointed out above, of saving lives. If neither of us was armed that night, the outcome might have been different, and it's entirely possible I wouldn't be here typing this.<br></div></blockquote>I'm not disagreeing that in can save lives but you have to agree with me when I say that guns are used more often for crime than to stop it.<br><br>The reason why criminals have guns in the first place is because of the lax gun control laws, obtaining it illegally is easy for them when there are gun stores around and all they have to do is bribe the store owner or the guys shipping firearms in.<br><br>In Singapore for example, the only way you can get a gun is if you were a police officer or if you steal it from a military base if you're enlisted. If you wanted to get a gun illegally here it's VERY difficult if not impossible if you're a civillian. Whereas if you were in America criminals get guns whether legally or illegally very easily and that results in more criminals with guns.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by googoomuck:</div><div class="quote_body">Some serial killers kill many more victims without guns but at a slower pace. Control or ban the use of axe, a power drill, a chainsaw or a screwdriver? They are useful tools, so are guns.<br><br>If the criminals are better armed, they will still be deterred from committing a crime by the possibility of confronting a victim who has a gun.<br><br>The bottom line is guns can be used to kill, guns can also be used to save lives.<br></div></blockquote>Yes it's true that killers can use other tools to kill but honestly screwdrivers, axes, etc. all have purposes other than killing whereas guns are only good for one thing. If someone came at me with a knife or something of the sort I'd have a much better chance of surviving than if he pointed a gun in my face.<br><br>I have many friends from South Africa where the crime rate is extremely high and they defend themselves with baseball bats. Why? because criminals there don't obtain guns easily and they are also deterred by the aspect of having to fight their victim who'll most likely inflict major injuries on them in the brawl. Whereas if the criminal had a gun he could just pull it out and bang you're dead before you even have time to think.<br><br>As for the rest refer to my above post.</div>
