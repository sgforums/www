America is now in the midst of a presidential race. Neither party wants to endorse tighter gun control as both are aware that it can cost them votes.<br><br>Historically, the AmericansÂ’ forefathers fought and died for freedom. Now that they are enjoying freedom, they are not going to give up the right to bear arms; thereÂ’s a tendency that tyranny can creep up on them. Tyranny is natural and is all around the globe. It has happened in SINGAPORE and itÂ’s happening in Russia.<br><br>Statistically, the homicide rate has fallen over the last 12 years. Easy access to guns result in deaths more common in drug deals and gang fights. The world is a better place because these people are gone. In the decade since England banned all private possession of handguns, the BBC reported that the number of gun crimes has actually gone up sharply because criminals, who donÂ’t obey the law, have the upper hand. In America, guns play an important role in self-defense. More than 100,000 cases of self-defense occur every year.<br>In lax gun control America, nonÂ–gun homicide rates are 3 times higher than EnglandÂ’s non-gun homicide rates. This statistics indicate that murder rates donÂ’t fall because they canÂ’t use guns.<br></div>
