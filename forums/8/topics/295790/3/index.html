America is now in the midst of a presidential race. Neither party wants to endorse tighter gun control as both are aware that it can cost them votes.<br><br>Historically, the AmericansÂ’ forefathers fought and died for freedom. Now that they are enjoying freedom, they are not going to give up the right to bear arms; thereÂ’s a tendency that tyranny can creep up on them. Tyranny is natural and is all around the globe. It has happened in SINGAPORE and itÂ’s happening in Russia.<br><br>Statistically, the homicide rate has fallen over the last 12 years. Easy access to guns result in deaths more common in drug deals and gang fights. <span style="color: red;">The world is a better place because these people are gone.</span> In the decade since England banned all private possession of handguns, the BBC reported that the number of gun crimes has actually gone up sharply because criminals, who donÂ’t obey the law, have the upper hand. In America, guns play an important role in self-defense. More than 100,000 cases of self-defense occur every year.<br>In lax gun control America, nonÂ–gun homicide rates are 3 times higher than EnglandÂ’s non-gun homicide rates. This statistics indicate that murder rates donÂ’t fall because they canÂ’t use guns.<br></div></blockquote>I seriously just lost all my respect for you after making that statement.</div>

Will the criminals listen? Self-righteousness is reserved for people with the power to change things. I donÂ’t have that power. I can talk only.<br>You are not going to fight a big bully. He can easily twist your neck. You can stop him with a gun, maybe without having to fire a shot. This is just a simple illustration.<br>Criminals don't obey laws so whatÂ’s the better way other then to have a gun and face an armed criminal? </span><br><br>If guns are so easily obtainable when they're illegal then tell me why Singapore doesn't have many homicides involving firearms if any.

Not so sure about that...guns are easy to get illegally when a country sells them freely.<br><span style="color: blue;">There are some cases of homicides with guns. An enlisted man used his rifle and rounds issued for guard duty to kill a sergeant. Witness said that he was almost cut into two. There are 3 more I can think of, one army 2nd lieutenant and one NCO in the marine police. That was years ago. And a few more involving civilians and police, which I cannot remember vividly.

What are you on about? You expect people to overthrow oppressive governments just because they have access to guns? You've been watching too many movies.<br><span style="color: blue;">Yeah I like movies. ItÂ’s my favourite past time. Back to reality.<br>Freedom/democracy did not come free for every country. Most freedom are paid for with bloodshed except maybe former USSR. But I did not read much about fall of USSR. Demorcacy has its flaws but itÂ’s the best form of government.<br>Singapore has traded freedom for security. You donÂ’t find fiercely independent individualism here.</span><br><br></div></blockquote>Some serial killers kill many more victims without guns but at a slower pace. Control or ban the use of axe, a power drill, a chainsaw or a screwdriver? They are useful tools, so are guns.<br><br>If the criminals are better armed, they will still be deterred from committing a crime by the possibility of confronting a victim who has a gun.<br><br>The bottom line is guns can be used to kill, guns can also be used to save lives.<br></div>
