'cause you've been quoting her a lot. just please try to understand that not all "elites" are how you describe them to be. we are who we are. I know that society and the government messes up our brains sometimes, but please try to respect us as people. you said that people who go to neighbourhood schools are people. I respect that. I respect THEM. however, this doesnt mean that people from "prestigious" schools are any less human. please tell me how you would like me to work everything and I will. but only if its reasonable. if you cannot give me a reasonable way to word it, okay. stop blaming me and lazerlord for something that you yourself cant do.</div>
