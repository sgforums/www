I thought it could be some muscle ache due to my sleeping posture.  I told myself to go see a doc after work.   I had initially planned to see my company doc during lunch, but ended up having to attend a lunch meeting.  In the evening, I went to a GP near my place, hoping to get some pain killer to ease my muscles.  The lady doctor pressed my stomach.  There was this spot on the right side that gave a very very sharp pain when she pressed it.  She said that it was definitely not muscle cramp or anything.  She said that that part is either my right ovary or appendix.  But she refered me to KK hospital anyway, cuz she was positively sure it was ovary.  I almost cried when I heard that.

Couldn't move my right leg anymore, after the GP pressed real hard on my painful part.  Finally saw the KK doc who told me that ovary not so high one.  Cannot be ovary.  Quickly sent me to SGH.<br><br>When I was in SGH, I went for two x-rays, blood test etc.  Then I was warded for observation.  By the time I lied down on a bed, it was 1 am.  I tried to sleep.  So tired liao.  But every hour, somebody would come in and kah jiao.  Either a nurse wanting to take my temperature or a doc want to take my blood.  In the end, whole night didn't sleep.  Before morning, a doc came in pressed my tummy and decided to operate on me.  She said it is 90% appendicitis, even though the x-ray couldn't tell anything.  She said that the op will remove the appendix and avoid future problem of appendicitis.  Also with the op, they will be able to confirm what the real problem was if it was not appendicitis.<br><br>Just wanna share with you all cuz this problem is so common.  Dun be like me.

            <div class='col-md body'>its pretty frightening to have appencitics becos at the start u wouldnt know what the pain was.<br><br>i rembered last few years ago i read from a newspaper article bout a kid died of appendicitcs due to late treatment which cannot be cured, that kid was 12 years old! so young.<br><br>i think appendicitics is caused by food which arent digest properly which causes them to travel to your appendix and therefore enlarging your appendix and brings pain to u.<br><br>but sometimes when u feel some pain on the right of your stomache dont scared. wait awhile if the pain goes away its nothing but if it persist, i think u must be mentally prepared to go for operation ( the only way to get rid of appendix). the way to prevent appendicitics is not to jump or move around too much after each meal.!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. It is thought that appendicitis begins when the opening from the appendix into the cecum becomes blocked. The blockage may be due to a build-up of thick mucus within the appendix or to stool that enters the appendix from the cecum. The mucus or stool hardens, becomes rock-like, and blocks the opening. This rock is called a fecalith (literally, a rock of stool). At other times, the lymphatic tissue in the appendix may swell and block the appendix. Bacteria which normally are found within the appendix then begin to invade (infect) the wall of the appendix. The body responds to the invasion by mounting an attack on the bacteria, an attack called inflammation. (An alternative theory for the cause of appendicitis is an initial rupture of the appendix followed by spread of bacteria outside the appendix.. The cause of such a rupture is unclear, but it may relate to changes that occur in the lymphatic tissue that line the wall of the appendix.)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What Causes It?<br><br>Appendicitis occurs when the tube-shaped appendix becomes blocked, often by fecal material, a foreign body, or cancer. Blockage may also occur from infection, since the appendix swells in response to any infection in the body. As it expands, its opening gradually closes.<br><br>go below link to see the pics, symtoms and more.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><a href="http://content.health.msn.com/content/article/6/1680_53518" rel="nofollow">http://content.health.msn.com/content/article/6/1680_53518</a>[/u]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wuming78:</div><div class="quote_body">Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. It is thought that appendicitis begins when the opening from the appendix into the cecum becomes blocked. The blockage may be due to a build-up of thick mucus within the appendix or to stool that enters the appendix from the cecum. The mucus or stool hardens, becomes rock-like, and blocks the opening. This rock is called a fecalith (literally, a rock of stool). At other times, the lymphatic tissue in the appendix may swell and block the appendix. Bacteria which normally are found within the appendix then begin to invade (infect) the wall of the appendix. The body responds to the invasion by mounting an attack on the bacteria, an attack called inflammation. (An alternative theory for the cause of appendicitis is an initial rupture of the appendix followed by spread of bacteria outside the appendix.. The cause of such a rupture is unclear, but it may relate to changes that occur in the lymphatic tissue that line the wall of the appendix.)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>thank you!</div>
