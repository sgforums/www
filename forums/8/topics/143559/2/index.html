A indian cyclist dashed across at the junction.  My friend almost hit him, cuz she couldn't see him (neither could I) as it was quite dark at night (dun mean to be racist).

Driver again lor.<br><br>Given that gahmen don't ban them, but gahmen should do some adjustment to the law, like make it compulsory that they take extra care (install some safety feature and ride with care) or else ban/suspend them.  Well, drivers do get their license suspended if they offend the law more than certain no. of times.  Also gahmen should set the law in such that drivers don't get blamed for any accident.  Also a license plate should be issued to every bicycle.  This law was imposed long long time ago.  But now, I dunno whether gahmen do away with it, or ppl just don't follow anymore.  I suggest : No license plate = No riding in public areas, except East Coast Park.  At least, with the license plate, if there is any accident which is due to the cyclists fault, we can mark the license plate.  </div></blockquote>As i have said, don't let a few rotten apples spoil the whole barrel of apples.<br>Is it fair if i say, "all drivers are dangerous" just because i see a few people that are driving quite recklessly and the rest are not?</div>
