Also, I do ride regularly on the road and had my fair share of encountering ridiculous drivers who behaves like bullies in their expensive cars.<br><br>Regardless, to those who drive and rides as well, you will understand what I mean since you do have a better understanding of what are the issues that the cycling community is facing as well as what goes on on the road with reckless drivers.<br><br>Oh. Just to point out this as well.  Road accidents with motorists are much higher then with bicycles on road.  Car to Car, bus to car, car to motorcycles.. etc.  Why?  Also, there are also road hoggers who happened to be driving a BMW in the middle of the road at a speed of 50km/hr.<br><br>Suggesting to ban cyclist on the road? Well, I'd suggest you to sign up as a 24hours police officer to tackle most first hand road issue.  That is, accidents cause by the motorists.<br><br>Also to note.  Name me one incident that a bicycle rider while riding on road had hit a predestrain fatally.  I can name you a number of cyclist who were killed or almost killed due to careless drivers.<br><br>Human are not prefect and whatever they do will not be prefect.  Riders and drivers alike.  To the 1 micrometer sighted started of this thread, ban yourself from all activities before suggesting others to be ban, especially when you do not have an understanding of driving and riding issues.<br><br>*Sigh*</div>

Do please note that the serious riders are doing all they can to ensure their own safety and is a minor group as compared to the population of cars on the road.<br><br>1.

(Don't comment anything on this till you know what had happened.)<br><br>2. A van driver fallen asleep will driving and cuts from 3rd lane into the first lane diagonally and almost kill 2 cyclists.  Both got hospitalised and were on operations.  Who's fault? SmartA** Honeybunz can answer.<br><br>3. A taxi makes an illegal turn, ignoring the cyclist who is crossing the junction.  Knocks the cyclist down and claims that he did not see the cyclist and it's the cyclist fault.  Do note that, the driver lost his claims since there was bright lights, the riders is wearing bright jerseys, and the cyclist has the right of way.  Who's fault?<br><br>4. Happens to many riders.  While riding near the side of 1st lane, some drivers like to disturb by squeezing the riders to stop. Didn't that happened to a motorcyclist lately and got killed?
