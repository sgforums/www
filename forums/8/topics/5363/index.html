            <div class='col-md body'>I just come across an article in newspaper today about a man in Nottingham who puts his kitten by the name of Tilly into the microwave and switch the equipment on for 5 minutes . The report says that when he took the kitten out from the mircowave , he hung her by front legs from a ceiling smoke-alarm and laugh as she fell  . The poor kitten was rescued by his friend and he faced a possible jail sentence and a lifetime ban from keeping animals . I am quite shock when i read this acticle that there are such cruel people around . I mean , how could he do such a thing to animals . He's a saddist and I think that a jail sentence is too light for him . The kitten has horrific burns to her legs , paws and tail and amputation was the only option . By the way , the kitten manage to live !!<br><br>I just want to know how many people actually agree with me that such cruelty act derserved more than a jail sentence ? In my own opinion , i think that such people should have a taste of their own medicine and i suggest that he should be put inside an oven and be bake for a couple of minutes !!! what do u think ?<br><br>P.S  I think Rinoa would surely agree with me ! :-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>5 minutes in a microwave and the kitten survived?! Did you read this in a tabloid?<br><br>Anyways, cruelty to animals has always been controversial. Would you feel that strongly if that man microwaved a lizard instead? Or how about a cockroach? I doubt it. It's all because people think cats are cute.<br><br>Spraying insecticide on ants is pretty cruel too I might add. And breathing in those bacteria and germs!!! Killing them with your nose hair. Man, we're all guilty.<br><br>PS. Not that I think the man who microwaved his kitten did nothing wrong. I'm merely giving an alternative viewpoint.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that it's really controvesial, but we as humans have some kind of limit that we set...unless u become a monk and swear never to hurt or kill any living thing again...<br><br>Most of us are just humans after all...There is a limit that people set...and most people(Or I would like to believe) set that limit on not to hurt animals with more developed nervous systems...or set that limit on animals that they have as pets...<br><br>Animal cruelty is really...cruel man...sadistic...!!!  It's almost worse than harming another human because usually they can't defend themselves or are trusting to their owners...<br><br>I love animals so It's pretty bad to hear about the cat...very sad and angry...but sheesh...the cat must be made out of kryptonite to suervive 5 minutes in a microwave...those suckers can deep fry a whole chicken in less time than that...I must say also that when u microwave food it doesn't crisp the meat...It actually dries it out...the burns that the cat has would be radiation burns and should not be crispy burn t types...It must be a hoax...but in any event, cruelty to animals is a real shame in the ass man...they rank right up there with wife beaters and child molestors...:-(</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, whether this pple should be punished or not depends on their intentions when they commited the act. When I stomp cockcroaches, I don't do it with a cruel or sadistic intent or just purely for my own entertainment. But when this man microwaved the kitty for 5 minutes and hung it by the door, and laughed at it... now thats seriously for his own perverse entertainment... and for that he should be punished!<br><br>------------------<br>Why?

            <div class='col-md body'>yup agree its wrong....<br>lemme give my point of view....<br>i think if u kill something, whether it is criminal all depends on the reason why u kill it.<br><br>if i killed an animal because i am a hunter, then its fine....but if i kill it just for kicks, then its wrong....<br><br>for example, some fishing tribes that hunt whales are exempt from the conservation plans becos this is their way of life and has been for centuries......they kill for food....<br><br>if people hunt deer as sport, then thats wrong.......<br><br>BUT....if you kill a roach, you dun eat it and its not for sport but i think for this case its like the law of the jungle...the fittest survive....if u dun kill the roach, he contaminate ur food....u die......something like that<br><br>Likewise for spraying insectide or for rubber tappers hunting tigers<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I AM BACK to say a piece of my mind(though I have not finished my project)<br>For John, it is true what we kill insects ( especially those that we hate and detest like cockroaches) But we kill them almost immediately not torturing them. We are now talking about cruelty and abuse.(If u dunno what is the defination of cruelty,please look up in the Longman dictionary).I mean ppl dun just kill animals for nothing.The beef u eat in McDonalds everyday.The chicken in KFC or whatever meat u are eating, it is killed for food comsumption.(Unless u tell me u are a vegetarian.)<br><br>One year jail sentence is never enough.I think it is the best to have a taste of his own medicine and see how he feels (well, he has an option to taste my lethal weapon if he wants)!This kind of jerk just make use of the loose laws to have a kick of his fun.(Anyway, in jail, the government still have to pay money to keep those scums alive).I think coporal punishment like 10 strokes is even better than letting him going to only a few months of jail.Hit him hard on his butt(maybe can coat the "rotan"with HCl too,haha!)<br><br>To all the abusers out there,they all deserve more than just physical punishment!Give them some psychological treats like throwing him in a dungeon full of parasites like cockroaches and rats...(wah!Now i become a saddist!Sorry!Just a "mild" suggestion.Ha!)Lock them up for a few days to a week.(Is it too cruel?)Sorry....*Thoughts of punishment aborted*<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for those interested, this article was featured in the ST (i thk) in case you thk Sniperjim is "creative" enuff to come up with such an "imaginative" story. according to the report, the condition of the poor kitten's burns was comparable to tt of a cooked chicken. its hindlegs and tail had to be amputated. IMHO, i thk such "owners" shld be sentenced to 10yrs jail and 30 strokes of the cane. preferably, we shld put him thru the same kind of torture, but tt wld be stooping to his level wont it?<br><br>killing is never correct, unless it's for your survival. but i cant become a vegetarian cos i love meat too much. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> but killing chickens, pigs, cows, etc. for food is justifiable in tt, we need to eat dont we? but killing insects simply because you find them disgusting is... personally, i nv kill insects unless i have to. for eg, when my legs are being attacked by savage hoards of red ants. dont kill animals so carelessly and thoughtlessly; afterall, they have a life, who are you to decide when to end it? respect it as another living thg, and for being able to live........<br><br>------------------<br>I believe in the sun, even when it is not shining.<br>I believe in love, even when i do not feel it.<br>I believe in God, even when He is silent.<br><br>[This message has been edited by ataraxia (edited 25-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mmmm... personally, I don't even want to hurt insects, let alone animals. The thought of their guts/entrails squashed out of their system or limping around with missing limbs really irks me. I mean REALLY irks me. Like ataraxia, i will only kill insects when they attack me. but if they only happen to be there at the wrong place and wrong time, i just swipe them away. I will never hurt animals.<br><br>I remember one "massacre" when I was ordered to keep the flies away from the food during BMT. I still feel very sorry for the countless flies that i've killed then, silly as it may sound. Yeah, I also killed many insects when I was washing toilets during my NS stint in Thailand (no I wasn't a toilet cleaner, it's just one of our duties). Can't help it coz' they keep flying back when I try to wave them away. But believe it or not, I will say a little prayer for the insects when I kill them... i have no religion though, but that's the least i can do for them... sigh...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all your reply . I guess that human beings cannot be prefect all time . But being cruel to animals is unacceptable . Stomping on cockroaches and spraying insecticles on ants doen't mean that the person is being cruel to them 'cause they are harmful insects that may destroy your food or cause sickness to u . what I am trying to say that this is totally 2 different issues we are discussing . I just hope that those people can be given a more severe punishment and dun let them go free by just fining them .<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, we have to draw the line somewhere. If it was a snake, would you be as tiffed as if it were a cute lil kitty? Probably not, especially if it was done in defence. So yeah this cruelty to animals thing, is very iffy. Anyway if you wanna get specific, roaches and all are insects, so i don't know if they qualify... sheesh..<br><br>Don't get me wrong, i LOVE animals (and i do mean LOVE!), but i won't hesitate to kill a roach, I only squash ants when they're biting me, i leave lizards alone (well sometimes i chase them away), and beetles and spiders are ok with me. I had a pet spider for a lil while, but that's another story. Its really very sad (pathetic to say the least) the way humans treat animals, being of -suppoused- higer intellect, we certainly don't make full use of it. About the jail sentance, yeah one year is a little mild, but to most people, they'll probably see it as "just another cat, what's the big deal? About a litter is born every five minutes, we are certainly not in shortage here", well then i can say the same for babies, "what's the big deal? 5 are born every minute, no big shit". Is an animal's life of less worth than ours?? As people, we have already done so much damage to the earth, there's a reason why we call her Mother Earth/Nature, and she's desprately in need of our help. Do we listen?? No, we're all too tuned in to MDs and the incessant noise of our pagers and handphones. there are literally hundreds of animals on the endangered list. 1 MILLION sharks are being killed each year due to indiscriminate fishing, every minute, 500 ha of rainforest are being destroyed, I'm NOT AT ALL surprised that 97% of the worlds population is not concerned with these matters, considering the way we treat domesticated animals at home. The word INHUMANE no longer holds any meaning, it has become a way of life! We are soo caught up in making the next dollar, keeping up with technology etc etc we don't actually prioritize, or rather we don't realise we have our priorities are all wrong.<br><br>When we have problems, those of us here turn on the comp, and start whining at this forum. I'm, not saying its bad or anything, airing and sharing your views/ideas/probs is fine. But the thing is, after we whine abt it here, we turn off the comp and get back to our little lives. This topic for an example, JUST WHAT ARE WE ACTUALLY GOING TO DO ABT THE FRIED CAT??? We sit here and debate lenghty issues, we agree that cruelty to animals is NOT acceptable, but we do nothing! WHY?? We are taking the saying "Its the thought that counts" a little too literally here...<br><br>Frying/microwaving the guy who abused the kitten may be a solution, but going ard catching these law breakers is a tad tedious, and in the case of poaching, and fishing, is really difficult to track. what we need is awareness.<br><br>I think (as usual) i have gone off tangent here. But PLEASE DO ME A FAVOUR, think about what i've just said, sitting here whining will not change anything, but icrease the electricity bill and add blisters to the fingers, and sadly, i think that's all we have been doing. Yes, we do CARE, and caring can be the prelude to action, or it could just remain as that... WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?<br><br>[This message has been edited by MsSeuss (edited 29-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MsSeuss: Well said. I will donate money to that UN organization that cares for endangered animals, the name of which I can't remember at the moment.<br><br>Since I earn about zero per year, I'll promise myself I'll start when I do earn moeny. No, thats not a cop out declaration, because the money that I save from elsewhere I use for another charity.<br><br>At the moment, here's what I do:<br><br>I don't eat sharks fins. And I'll try to convince people that I know not to order sharks fins.<br><br>I'll recycle stuff that I use, so hopefully that will affect the amount of forests cleared.<br><br>I'll dob in whoever I believe is cruel to animals.<br><br>Thats all I can think of to help the big picture without making it too difficult for me to sustain it. Yet, if you are talking about the big picture, things happen because there are poor humans somewhere where the need to make money overrides what is good for the environment. The forests are cleared because some poor people have no other way of making money. Thats why they clear the forest to do whatever they do. I honestly need suggestions here so if you have any, I'm all eyes i.e. I'll read it.<br><br>Which brings me back to the cat. How would the environment be related to the cat? Maybe its the attitude towards the environment that people hold. Disrespect towards anything other than ourselves or our selfish purposes. However, cruelty to the animals is separate to that. That has to do with personal psychological pathology than what most of us do or fail to do. In that regards, I support heavier punishment.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 30-11-1999).]</div>
