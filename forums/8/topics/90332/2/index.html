Be it angmo or chinese or tamil or malay... the important point is getting the point across clear and concise without needing pple to scramble for the dictionary? Did u hear the speech made by LHL?

Some pple will never make it to be a polotician, let alone any post high in the ladder<br><br>2) If i ever know your bday, I will send you a mirror... cos some pple dun reflect on their ignorance and enjoying the bliss to cast their sacarism on others' views and posting.<br><br>3) The preoccupation with the talk about not going to outings reinterates mi's hypothesis on the Control Theory I proposed many a times.<br><br>4) The another preoccupation with "the people here know"... wat is this about others knowing... u r afraid to live in an isolation of thoughts? wat is there to fear when u do no wrong and has to utter such phrases of the mass knowing the better?
