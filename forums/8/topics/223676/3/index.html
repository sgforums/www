(Firstly, they have difficulty communicating, due to their strong accent or language barrier. Secondly, whatever country they go, they need a visa to enter the country. My Chinese friends joked that the only place where Chinese nationals don't need visa is China itself. Thirdly, nowadays too many Chinese smuggled illegally into other countries all around the world, so whenever an immigration officer sees a Chinese passport, he/she will take extra time and extra caution to check the passport and visa.)<br><br>Imagine there are 10 Chinese tourists in your queue.... If each takes 10 minutes, you'll have to wait 100 minutes... That's what happened to me in Macau around dragon-boat festival... Only 2 queues were for Macau/HK residents. All the other queues were for International passports, and they were jammed with Chinese nationals. The Macau immigration should have opened a queue for International passports EXCEPT Chinese nationals... Each Chinese passport took around 10 minutes, but my Singapore passport took less than 20 seconds...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> (Somemore during the 100 minutes of waiting, I had to endure the noises generated by thousands of people. It's louder than a plane engine...) Anyway all the Chinese were flocking to Macau to gamble. (There's no casino in mainland China.) I cannot imagine what happen when they flock to our IR. Will our IR be filled with phlegm? Will the immigration at Changi Airport be jammed with Chinese tourists?<br><br>I agree that a lot of Chinese people are uncivillised and plain irritating... But fortunately the Chinese friends whom I know are nice people and they are civilised and considerate. (Hence my impression of the Chinese is still not so negative...) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

One is two endure the spitting, while the other is to endure a confrontation. If you've read my post (which isn't so much about just spitting on the plane only), you'd understand which would be a better choice.<br><br>But I dare not deny that some part of me prefers to avoid a verbal battle on an international flight. Even if I were to confront the Chinaman, I would "come online to complain" regardless, for it is my intention to do so as it was the overall experience rather than a single encounter in China that prompted me.</div>

"Aimed at Singaporean readers" meant just that.
