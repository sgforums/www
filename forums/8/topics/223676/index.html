            <div class='col-md body'>As I flew home from China on SIA Economy, I sat beside this China guy who, I think, have never flown before.<br><br>Wah lao eh, throughout the whole flight he kept spitting his phlegm on the carpet of the plane. Everytime I hear the unmistakable sound of a Chinaman drawing up all the phlegm from the deep recesses of his bacteria-filled lungs, I cringe in utter fear and disgust.<br><br>Go to the plane toilet also dunno how to lock the door, come out also never zip pants.<br><br>And don't freakin' press every single goddamn button on the seat.<br><br>Call the flight attendant for more tea also dunneed to 'oei' until so loud right?<br><br>I understand you may be uneducated and uncultured, and never sat on a plane before. That doesn't give you the privilege of discarding any kind of common sense and moral values right?<br><br>The China gahmen has recently called spitting a national vice. They even had to put up signs in toilets to teach Chinamen how to pee in a proper way. Not that I'm complaining that the Chinese government isn't doing enough to help an apathetic populace. It simply isn't possible. At the risk of stereotyping, the fact remains that the China Chinese are a rude, uncivilized and inconsiderate bunch of simpletons with no ethical capacity. I don't refer to the &lt;10% of the educated and responsible in large business cities like Shanghai and Guangzhou, but I am flabbergasted at the attitudes of the rest of the 1.3 billion people in China.<br><br>Once, I watching an internationally acclaimed cultural show in Guilin, which featured many breathtaking light-shows and laser dances with the purpose to impress tourists. It was an 'open air' show, which means that there was no roof above my head. Despite the godzillion number of 'No Smoking' signs and many reminders by the crew, practically every single Chinamen smoked.<br><br>Goddammit, the rest of the audience couldn't goddamn stand the damn smoke. I witnessed some Singaporean tourists politely asking them to stop smoking, but the Chinamen couldn't hear reason. Oh nooo, they have to argue and fight, scream and whine, before lighting up a whole box of cigarettes to spite the tourists.<br><br>Like, what the hell were they thinking? No, I'm not referring to the Chinamen, but the Singaporean tourists. I mean, why bother arguing with these people, when they are as deaf as a pile of Panda dung, and as stubborn as a pile of Panda dung? It is China, after all.<br><br>There was that one time when I walked along the famous Nanjing Street in Shanghai. Great, I thought, a cultured and civilized megacity with well-dressed and hip people. I realized how wrong I was when I got repeatedly snatched of a taxi and looked upon a significant number of fist-fights because someone bumped into another in a small street crowded with zillions of people. Oh, and never mind the crowd, just because my phlegm requires expulsion gives me the right to aim at just about anyone's foot.<br><br>Sometimes, I curse in English at these people, saying the worst things that I never thought I could. Occasionally, I sympathize with them, because their country is just so freakin' screwed up. But every single time my experience was more physical than psychological. You needed athletic ability to dodge phlegm shots from 1.3 billion people. No wonder China have always won gold in gymnastics events.<br><br>Which brings me to my next point. Beijing 2008. One world, one dream. The Chinese gahmen invested millions and millions of RMB into their large stadiums and swimming pools, and held many social campaigns to educate the people of the words, "Wen Ming", or "Civilized". Everywhere you go, you'd see signs with these words on them. Throw rubbish in bins to be civilized; pee closer to the toilet bowl because you're not a sniper; don't spit, etc. I haven't been to Beijing recently to see how such campaigns worked out, but my expectations aren't looking too good. I mean, if they can't even read 'No Smoking' signs, why the hell would they want to pee properly? One world, one dream? Nightmare, rather.<br><br>The problem obviously lies with the people, not the government. There's nothing a centralised authority can do to change a society flaw of a country that has so many people. Hence, if even the government can't play a part, I doubt any solution is remotely feasible.<br><br>That means that we have to live with such idiocy. With globalisation and the opening up of China's economy, we will soon see this degrading part of China in every country in the world. Hell, with Singapore bringing in Foreign Talents from China, it's no surprise what may occur. Fighting in public? Pushing people onto train tracks? I don't even want to imagine what would happen if Singapore becomes Chinanized.<br><br>But let's say we do imagine such a situation. What would Chinanization of Singapore be like?<br><br>Imagine Orchard Road crowded and packed with people. Some Chinaman bumps into you and wants an apology. You apologise but he fights nonetheless.<br><br>Imagine public toilets with white flooring. Some Chinaman enters, pees (without locking the door) and leaves. You notice that the floor took on a new colour. Yellow. Maybe a little brown pile of chocolate in the far corner.<br><br>Imagine you taking a ride on some expensive transportation. You rest, trying to close your eyes for a quick nap. You hear the roar of the engine, the brilliance of Chopin's Sonata for Piano No. 3 in B Minor on your MP3 player, and suddenly the sound of phlegm going up the oesophagus. You wake up and see greenish-yellow jelly on the carpet beside your foot.<br><br>Oh wait, that already happened. On SIA Flight SQ803.<br><br><img src="http://forums.clubsnap.org/customavatars/avatar31979_1.gif"></div>

The only hope is the younger generation, those who are more educated, those who have learnt more from the western coutries from the internet, or those who went overseas to studied.<br><br>And whatever the government try to educate the nation, mostly the youngers one will accpet it, the older ones wont. Those kids/teenager who are still schooling, they still have the mind trained to obey orders. Once you leave school, you think you are on your own, you only listen to your boss for the sake of money.

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know. But in the coffee shops and hawker centers in Singapore, you see old Singaporean men spit as well. I guess they must also die fast, as suggested by one of the forumites? A lot of the problems you see in China arise from the economic under-development. The less economically abled and less educated portion of the polulation understandably are less exposed to the outside world and international etiquette. You must sympathetically understand all these unsightly behaviours (spitting, etc) wihin this in mind. But then again, it is a bit obnoxious to generalize to the level of national charater and denouce a whole nation's worth based on the few unpleasant encouters you had, as some of the forumites here are doing with much vehemence. Some of the points you raised here are apparently exaggerated. You worry about the influx of the Chinese into Singapore resulting in street fights and rail track murders (?). There is already a large portion of Chinese nationals here in Singapore. Have those worries been confirmed in any way? Or is it just your bias doing the worrying there?</div>
