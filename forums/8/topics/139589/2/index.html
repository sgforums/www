MO totally not professional n qualified to be a doctor at all. From my observation, the high ranking regulars report sick or rather chao keng will able to get mc but nsf u need to wait long long. They dun give a damn to nsf at all, think they only care abt nsf is when they going to die, faint, shot by bullet, heavily bleeding etc den they will believe<br><br>Once i waited for mo for 2 hours plus as i'm having dirreahoe, the fuc king mo in the room do nothing at all, chatting with those sissy nsf medic, drink coffee, read straits time. I'm totally fustrated at tat scene, our country use so much tax payer money to pay the so call doctor a few thousands a mths juz to chit chat, tok cock in the medical center?? Wat abt those patients outside waiting for him?</div>
