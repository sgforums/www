I can tell u that I have lots of friends in there which have result good enough to go anywhere else.<br><br>Just that RP is a new poly doesnt mean that its not a good poly. In RP everything  is just so special and different from what other poly have, the way we learn thing let us remember and understand the same thing better then what other students in other poly because we very independent learners and not just listening to lecturers to tell us what is the "correct" way and what is not.<br><br>if u look at a far sight, rp is a new school and it is using overseas' way of learning and teaching,it does have a good prospect, i belive that  it will be the same rank as other poly after some time.

Because we use a different learning system, we cannot just get notes from other polytechnics and compile and give to students. The facilitators (what we call them), have to think hard for a problem, which will contain the module's learning objective. For example, the learning objective for that day is to know basically how an MRI machine works. They have to slowly formulate it, come up with a worksheet so that we can work through it step by step. They also have to find resources for us. It is not easy. That is why we have a limited choice of courses. And tell me something, will you go to a polytechnic which offers the same course as other polytechnics? We have to balance common courses like IT, engineering and biomedical courses and have some rare courses like materials sciences.<br><br>A lack of recognition -- we can't help that. We have to show that we are able to work with the diploma we graduate with, of which we don't have because nobody has graduated from RP yet. If this year's year 3 students can find jobs that are related to their diploma and are doing very well, you can't say that we are from a "lousy" polytechnic. But, our polytechnic is gaining recognition fast. Some foreigners and a lot of secondary school students have come and have a taste of our learning system. Some like it, some are not so sure, some think they will not like it.</div>
