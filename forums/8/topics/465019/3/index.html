              <p>i hope i am able to help you as much as i can as i am someone who been through such trouble. a local polytechnic will gain u access to local university while a private diploma is usually only 9 month to a year but gain u access to a not so good university which you can google it. in the eyes of the employers, a local diploma is definitely more recognise by alot compare to a private diploma so your senior just lied to you. but do keep that in mind that a local diploma protect you in some instance. in what way? </p>
              <p>3 year local diploma, upon finishing can find work easily straight or go to local university or private university, both which will give you exemption.</p>
              <p>a 9 month to 1 year private diploma, upon finishing give you parital exemption to a degree that is associated with that cert, usually some weird university name. the exemption is usually 1 year only. </p>
              <p>local diploma are definitely hired more as compare to private diploma. put yourself in the shoe of a HR manager, who would you hire, someone who did 9months of dip or someone who survive 3 years of local diploma under a standardise and trusted system approve by MOE.</p>

              <p>First your friend, now then "people", I believe that it is you yourself who are scolding the poly and said it bad. You are living in your twilight zone believe that private school is better than poly even if <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the private school's lecturer or teacher is an poly student themselves</span> which is I agreed with what you said "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">People say learn in private is same with poly.</span>" and rarely do I see an private school lecturer with an degree holder or NIE-trained. You didn't know if you can get positive feedback here, so you cook up story that your imaginary friend say private school is good and "aliens" people also agreed private school is good and if sgforum people also said private school is best, then you are really making the "right" and extraordinary choice.</p>
              <p>Anyway if you want to go to private school, nobody will stop you, you just make the private school richer while normal people could just pay an "subsidy" school fee to study in local poly.Not to mention if you are lucky, the school either isn't going to closed down suddenly or class is not cancel due to low intake. And I believe you never heard of the thing called "open-book" test in poly or if 80% of poly student failed that particular module, will the poly expel all the 80% of their student or try to "pass" them according to the "average" score of the whole class?</p>
              <p>Finally your private diploma might have better value for labour job like road sweeper and in term of further study, that is if universities in Malaysia, India or Indonesia even recognized it and allow it as an pathway for further study, or if it is recogized only by that particular "private" school ?</p>

              <p>Going to Polytechnic is good.</p>
              <p>It provides you with skills that you can use when you go out to work. Comparatively with the A level (for example), it may be a better qualification.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Before I start off i'm Singaporean btw...</p>
              <p>Sad fact is that in Singapore people would rather go with a 
              "safe" approach when recruiting employees hence it is better to go by 
              the safer route which is to get a governemnt recognise 
              education/diploma/degree.</p>
              <p>There seems to be a sterotype of private degrees espicially about
               the reliability or unrealibility of modules taught in a particular 
              university resulting in either sufficient or insufficient 
              knowledge/expertise or technical skills in the gradauting student.</p>
              <p>The above mentioned may or may not be true, hence it is always 
              better to do some research on that particular university rather then 
              ASSUME or sterotype. There are even recognised university who offer 
              private degrees.</p>
              <p>People should realise that the qualifications on paper at most is
               just a reflection of your technical knowledge in the subjected field 
              and NOT a reflection of how well you are going to suceed as an employee.</p>
              <p>While it is necessary , it does not reflect on how well u will 
              suceed as an employee or wheather you will adapt with the organization 
              morale or values or culture</p>
              <p>There are other MORE important "skills" not taught in school such
               as critical thinking, creative thinking, innovative thinking, effective
               communication, people skills, social skills etc etc and even personal 
              characteristic which are often overlooked</p>
              <p>To say you WILL be better then other people just because you have gotten a locally recognised degree is........</p>
              <p>But to be fair the same can be said about private degree.</p>
              <p>Now we turn the tables around imagine this scenario....You are going overseas armed with a local diploma/degree from Singapore.</p>
              <p>Your potential foreign employer is probably going to look at you 
              and probably will have thoughs about the validity of your local 
              diploma/degree.</p>
              <p>So in the eyes of a foreigner they too will doubt the validity of
               our locally assigned diploma/degree, hence most of them are more opened
               or acceptable towards the diverse levels of education.</p>
              <p>But just remmeber...this is Singapore, they go by a safe approach</p>

              <p>Risk mitigation is exactly what it is at best but not gaurenteed.</p>
              <p>Whether NUS (which is ranked 25th in 2012) can match the standards of much a globally recognised university is exactly the same steortype which is being applied to the private vs government recognised debate.</p>
              <p>Fom which perspective will you be speaking from then?</p>
              <p>Maybe that is what is wrong with our society? Too much selective sterotype.</p>
              <p>What about being <strong>socially responsible. </strong>Even cooperate companies and organziation not to mention the government must be socailly responsible to the nations citizen.</p>
              <p>Are you going to tell me that citizens who fail to make the cut to earn a spot in the government recognized schools in their earlier years SHOULD NOT be given a chance to suceed in our modernised global society which if i may remind you is become more and more diverse in culture and nationality, education etc etc, not only in singapore but gobal wide, despite the fact that they have never given up on themselves and taken the time to pursue a private education?</p>
              <p>Doomed to fail then? If thats the case my heart goes out to all those people who have failed to obtained a government recognised education</p>
              <p>And how many CVs and resume get put away with the mention of a private diploma and degree without given a chance to bypass the sterotype which has been tainting them for years.</p>

              <p>But I believe it depends on how one markets himself. </p>
              <p>Jobs may not be found entirely through traditional means and employment of different means to land a job might prove advantageous.</p>
              <p>And I am not buying that "socially responsible" argument.</p>
              <p>If you can't change the world, then you will have to change yourself.</p>
              <p>Too often have we looked on the system and blamed it for various failings. </p>
              <p>Doubtless the system can be improved, but speaking of lofty things won't exactly get one anywhere anyway. So why not play by the rules first and change it from within?</p>
              <p>Between choosing someone who is "certified" against someone whose credentials are less established (but might be better), it is easy to see how employers would choose all else held constant.</p>
              <p>What then differentiates you from the crowd will therefore be your soft skills, and these cannot be found in certificates. Which brings me back to the point on employing different ways to land a job.</p>

              <p>Since you showed me a work from Prof Irene Ng, if you are curious enough about social inequality and long term implications, try to read research work by Prof Vincent Chua. he specialises in that field rather, especially in inter-generational inequality.</p>
              <p>My view lies more with Prof Tan Ern Ser, who....well, disagrees to an extent with Prof Chua. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Actually i kinda regret going to a local poly. I chose a polytechnic diploma over an A level with my not so bad O level results. After my 3 years in poly, if actually didnt like the course i was taking. Did not so great. 3.1 GPA. Cant go local University. And my friend who did worse than me in Olevel and went to MI went to NUS. I was like WTF!!! I missed the fuckin chance to go local Uni. fuck!!! Yes however, the limitation is that u aint got nothin to do with a lousy A level result, therefore u need to do well in A levels. A poly diploma will get u a job easily. Trust me. Anyways, i was just wondering, is a university degree everything in life??</p></div>

              Just get into local poly, it can find job easily. Recently there's a survey conducted, "local" poly grads get employ fast. They have attachment and receive some hands on training, what about private diploma? 
              
              At least get diploma from local poly. Than if ur results good, just go uni. If not, try private degree. Well, or else go ns and perform well and go ocs, through ocs study uni. Maybe?

              <p>I think Singapore's polys are better than private. It makes you more prepared i feel. Having 3 years to learn a lot of things, rather than rushing into 7-8 months finishing at private?</p>
