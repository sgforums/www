            <div class='col-md body'><p>RegretRain, are you a guy or girl?. Let me share some of my thoughts with you (a more complete version)<br><br>i assume that you did qualify for local polytechnic courses with decent O level scores or good Higher NITEC GPA. Ask yourself, which is a better option? I personally think that local polytechnic offers better option. It gives you better recognition, to be honest. <br><br>Second question, are the three years in polytechnic wasted? Sure, you can just spend a year in private institution or doing private diploma but my question to you is,<span style="color: #ff0000;"> what's </span>the rush? Surely a private diploma will let you finish your studies earlier, but at the end of the day, what do you take away from it? I always believe that an education is not just about enriching yourself academically, it is also about learning in life and be someone who can think not just for him or herself, but for others too. I enjoyed my days in poly the most and made friends and buddies whom they were part of the important milestone in my life. All these friendships were forged and going through thick and thin together (projects, studies, examinations...) made it possible. School life is exciting and develops you as a whole. If you take private diplomas in private institution, they may not be able to provide you with holistic education as your aim would just be finishing your studies and get it done and over with. <br><br>Third question, are our local polytechnic diplomas very well recognised? The answer is yes, in fact many of it allows you to gain advance standing and module exemption in many Universities not just in Singapore, but worldwide too. Private diploma may not offer you the same amount of recognition (unless of course, the private dip that you are taking is strongly affiliated to the University that you want to go and (or) allows you to gain advance standing)  <br><br>With the above, i urge you to consider again. You can PM me anytime if you have further questions and i will try my best to help you.</p></div>

              <p>If you are planning to embark on a private degree, especially in engineering , and <em><strong>with the intention of registering yourself as a professional engineer</strong></em> in Singapore, please read the following:</p>
              <p><a href="http://app.peb.gov.sg/Html/pe_approved.html">http://app.peb.gov.sg/Html/pe_approved.html</a></p>
              <p>Depending on which university you go to, the act seems to require you to study at least 3-4 years for your degree. <br><br>Read more on Professional Engineer here: <a href="http://app.peb.gov.sg/">http://app.peb.gov.sg/</a></p>
              <p>I did my diploma for 3 years in Singapore Polytechnic, and during the time for uni application i actually wanted to go for SIT's 2 year Degree in Aerospace Systems by University of Glasgow. <br><br>I went for the talk and at that time they are not very sure if my Diploma in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with specialisation in Aerospace and Communication will allow me enjoy the "2 years get degree". <br><br>At that time Diploma in Aerospace Electronics was recognised, and if i recall correctly, few years back glasgow have not yet reviewed republic polytechnic's syllabus for them to enjoy the program, and nanyang poly grads need to go for interview and tests.<br><br>Thus my point is that i dont think studying for private diploma is a good choice, as if you want to further your studies, some university may not be ready to 'recognise' your private diploma.<br><br>Also, I asked my lecturer for advise, most of them told me to go local uni, as it would be better because of the name as well. In the end i still applied for NTU</p>
              <p>However i think if you are going for private diploma/degree in accountancy, that will lead you to get professional certificate in accountancy from ACCA, that should be fine</p>
              <p>In the end it all depends on how you wanna make use of your diploma and degree, i may be wrong, maybe there are a lot of advantages for private degrees that i do not know of, like my friend is working well now with a SIM diploma+degree.</p>

              <p><br>It does make a difference!Finally,my role kicks in.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> Working hard does not equate to success.  </p>
              <p><span class="goog_qs-tidbit goog_qs-tidbit-0">Nothing guarantees success.  Working a lot doesn’t guarantee success.  Having everyone behind you</span> doesn’t guarantee success.  Having innate talent or being gifted doesn’t guarantee success.  Having all the resources in the world doesn’t guarantee success.</p>
              <p>You must also learn to work smart.The only way to work smart is by constantly adapting to different circumstances. If you need tips on working smart,pm me.</p>
              <p>Overall,I suggest you choose the local diploma route.It's true that time cannot be recovered and is more important than money. I support you in this portion,i hope that you can work hard for your goals,since you understand how important time is right now.</p>
              <p>Alright,why do I still insist you choose the local diploma route? Think about it in terms of work experience.Would your boss want to hire a man with a year of work experience or three? Of course,the answer is obvious,unless you are planning to work overseas,I will suggest the private route. Why do people emphasise the importance of getting a job now instead of getting the fast private diploma route?</p>
              <p>In the past,getting a degree will enable you to find employment and stay in the company for the rest of your career or switch once.</p>
              <p>Right now,ask yourself.What can you do with a degree which is not universally recognised?(generally private-uni degree) Even,with a standard degree,it is possible that you may have to wait months to find a job or worse,switch jobs each year.It is common to switch jobs in modern times.</p>
              <p>The decision is yours to make,your future is yours to fulfill.</p>

              <p>A private 1-year diploma is NOT equivalent to Poly's 3-year diploma.<br><br>The 1-year diploma leads to the advanced diploma (also about 1 year) and then to the degree course.<br><br>And this essentially require a 3-years duration for the completion of a diploma to degree qualification.<br><br>This 1-year diploma alone is of not much help when seeking employment. It is just a stepping stone to a bachelor degree.<br><br>If you think you will proceed with the advanced diploma &amp; degree programme then it is a shorter path to obtain a degree.</p>
              <p>Please be careful when choosing the private path. A diploma from X school might not be as recognised as one from Y school. Some transcript/cert might state whether you attended full or part time, so try to attend full time instead of part time for the private courses.<br><br>As for the poly's 3-years diploma, most Aussie/UK degree do grant advance standing for relevant subjects studied. Some might grant up to 2 years exemption for a bachelor programme.</p>
              <p>Though it needs 3 years to finish the course, after deducting all the 
              holidays and vacations, you actually don't spend 3 year to obtain one.</p>
