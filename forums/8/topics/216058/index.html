            <div class='col-md body'>I too, read with sadness about their plight and this was discussed on a radio show this morning.<br><br>By actually taking his life, he is, in a way, leaving his problems to his children and spouse - who incidentally, is not well.  If he has stayed, at least he could seek help to find work, etc to take care of his family.  While we can debate until cows come home why he choose to jump, etc, I think what we can do is to see how we could help this family as well as many others who are suffering in silence to minimise future recurrance.<br><br>Its usually those who don't shout for help that need most help and it have got to do with personal pride.  Whilst we see many others going to seek help wearing rolex watches or driving mercedes to grab free text books meant for needy students. What about those who are suffering, not knowing who to turn to or not wanting to "trouble" others...how can we reach out to others.<br><br>I agree partially to the point above not to blame the government, because I think to a certain extent, the government should lend a hand to these families.  Reduce HDB prices or waive HDB instalment payments, utilities payments, etc are within the control of the government and agencies.  Like the poor wife who cannot even afford to take transport to collect her dead spouse's body,  how about free transport for her ?<br><br>Work with grassroots to identify those needy people and work on how to help them and sieve out those genuine cases - if the government has the ability to track down who is downloading illegal music, surely they have the means to track down these needy people.  And I particulary don't like to hear about the RC people saying they dunno the family need help because they din't approach them.  Whatever happened to pro-activeness ?</div>
