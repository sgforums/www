            <div class='col-md body'>There are many help groups,organisations n welfare groups in sg.The problem is do these people know where to seek help?Even if they know where to seek help from its such a long n tedious sometimes complicating process.U wont be able to get immediate help either u have to wait.The help u get might not even be substantial or enough n could even be juz temporary relief.<br><br>Take an example my friend owes HDB for his flat,everytime he defaults on the payment he is issued with a reminder letter n charged admin fee for it.(to a poor man the admin fee is alot).Even after maybe say asking for a deferment of payment or wanting to pay in thinner instalments the interests% still carries on.So the debt would juz keep accumulating.Its not juz the case with HDB its with almost everything,be it a bank loan,handphone bills,PUB bills etc.Worst still if these poor people are uneducated or old n cant get a job or maybe end up with low paying jobs.Some bosses would den take advantage of these people knowing they cant get a job elsewhere.Spiralling debts,low paying jobs,rising costs etc these are juz some factors.So some people with these problems juz cant see the light at the end of the tunnel n plop! they choose the easy way out by commiting suicide.While others will juz try their best to live on or improve their quality of lives.So it also comes down to the individual character n his attitude towards life whether he is a quiter or fighter.<br><br>We cannot juz blame the govt for every little thing or conveniently shift the blame to them,it doesnt help.wad we could probably do is offer help to poor people if we do know of any by the means which we are comfortable with n probably ask the govt to improve or provide more assistance to these people.<br>Seriously instead of choosing the easy way out of our problems,please we should try our best to improve our lives.God bless all the poor people.<br><br>Im also a poor man.Lets fight n strive for a better tomorrow! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Some youngsters nowadays spend borrowed money to look rich, using money which they don't have to impress friends and others. Some years down the road, they may regret eating at expensive resturants, be a slave to the car instalments, enjoying vacations through credit cards, stuff like that. It's a pity people sometimes to fall for such fallacies, an illusion that does not help, a trap which many people, especially youngsters are so willing to jump into. Even my gf is one of those set in the trap, ends up I had to take out part of the investment money to pay off all her debts and house loan.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just leave a death note or let someone know if you want to commit suicide. the aim is to send the message right? by ending the won life at the mrt station means disrruption to the train system. u make eveyone busy and disrupt traffic. thousands were affected on that day. and didn;t the person himself think that out of these few thousand people some may have to go home sleep so that they have enought energy to work tomorrow for their own families?</div>
