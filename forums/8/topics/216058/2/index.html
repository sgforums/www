He was wearing a light-coloured T-shirt and dark shorts at the time.<br><br>The CCTV footage has been handed over to the police, said SMRT officials. The police are investigating.<br><br>Those travelling on the train - which was moving at a speed of over 50kmh - said they felt it hit something and screech to a stop. At the same time, the lights in some sections of the train went out.<br><br>Said polytechnic student Ricky Ong, 20: 'We didn't realise it was anything serious. We just thought the train had broken down.'<br><br>Passengers were led to the front of the train and let out.<br><br>Train services between Jurong East and Boon Lay MRT stations were disrupted for about an hour. About 5,000 people were travelling between these points during this time. By 10.45pm, SMRT had arranged for buses to ferry stranded commuters between these points.<br><br>Passengers who were unable to complete their journey can claim a refund from any of the 51 SMRT stations within the next three working days.<br><br>SUJIN THOMAS<br><br>I heard that the guy's kids and his own wife was suffering from some kind of illness isn't it?</div>
