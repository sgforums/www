I noticed two girls sitting across from me saying something about international school students and being one myself I was a little curious as to what they were talking about. They apparently were saying that international school students were all spoiled rich kids with fake accents and were just plain b*tching about them even though they could see that I was obviously from an international school. Well I got kinda pissed and told them off but they just ignored me so anyways, what are your thoughts on the matter?</div></blockquote>Wait.......are you a local Sg person....or foreigner? If foreigner, yeah i can understand you going to Inter school.<br><br>But if you're a Sg, wat are you doing in Inter school?  Local Sg school not good enuff for u?

That's where our national school system fails.

The choice is pretty clear. At least we turned out confident, though naysayers love to call us cocky ABC wannabes. It's never a crime to be eloquent and skeptical at the same time.</div>
