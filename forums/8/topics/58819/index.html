            <div class='col-md body'>I LIKE THIS ONE THE BEST!!!<br><br><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/stories/nationalsorryweek.gif"><br><br><a href="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/article.php?sid=1198" rel="nofollow">Gahmen Launches National Sorry Week<br><br>by K.K. Cheow and Lau Cheow<br><br>The perceived effectiveness of Environment Minister Lim Swee SayÂ’s apology for the shortcomings in the Environmental Health Institute, which led to a researcher contracting SARS, has led the Gahmen to organize a new apology campaign Â– National Sorry Week.</a><br><br>Â“It was a groundbreaking moment when Mr. Lim apologized,Â” said Prime MinisterÂ’s Orifice spokesman Mr. Cheng Hu Kong at a press conference today. Â“People were so impressed that the Gahmen was saying sorry that they really didnÂ’t pay too much attention to the fact that no one was being fired and no penalties were being levied for a really serious breach. All we had to say was sorry, and maybe Â– just maybe Â– weÂ’ll punish someone later, and ta-da! Apologizing was so successful at deflecting blame, weÂ’re really sorry for not trying it earlier.Â”<br><br>Dispelling the notion that "Sorry No Cure", Mr. Cheng added that as far as SARS is concerned, "Sorry Got Cure."<br><br>A reporter swiftly pointed out to Mr. Cheng that this was actually not the first time a member of the Gahmen had apologized of late. Present Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan had apologized for the North East Line debacle and HDB CEO Niam Cheng Meng had also apologized for the problems with upgrading in Marine Parade. There was of course, former Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang, who famously apologized twice Â– first for keeping a baby alive, and second, for having said he was sorry for keeping a baby alive.<br><br>Â“Sorry, my mistake,Â” said Mr. Cheng. Â“But it just proves our point even more. A near outbreak of a deadly contagious disease, a massive transport cockup and a total renovation fiasco, yet as far as we know, no oneÂ’s being forced to take a paycut, let alone step down. We think this can be applied to many other situations, from the rise in GST, the fight between Starhub and SingTel over laying broadband cables, the IDAÂ’s mistake in overpaying $388 million to SingTel, the appointment of a Lee family member to the head of Temasek HoldingsÂ… Just say sorry, can oreddy.Â”<br><br>Â“Expressing some form of regret has been very effective at managing many of the GahmenÂ’s problems,Â” Mr. Cheng continued. Â“So we want the people to adopt this practice too.Â”<br><br>HereÂ’s some of the Sorry Practices that the Gahmen is advocating as part of National Sorry Week:<br><br>Ordinary Singaporeans can apologize to the Gahmen for not being cost-effective enough to help Singapore out of its recession;<br>Ordinary Singaporeans can apologize to the Gahmen for harping on issues like Ministerial pay which could distract Ministers from doing their job;<br>The Gahmen will apologise to Singaporeans for No More Good Years, although as explained exhaustively many times before, it is not to blame. More Good Years will be promised again, starting in 2007. Really.<br>Ordinary Singaporeans can say sorry to all the foreign talent theyÂ’ve been maligning while they come in to create new jobs for locals;<br>Foreign Talents should apologise to Singaporeans for giving the impression that they are taking jobs away when in fact they will be creating more jobs;<br>The WTO and UN can apologize to the Gahmen for the crappy global economic outlook which led to SingaporeÂ’s recession;<br>Osama Bin Laden, if he can be located, will be asked to apologise for his terrorist attacks on the US, which made the US recession worse, and also for the JI terrorist plot in Singapore, all of which direct caused Singapore's poor economic performance;<br>Saddam Hussein, if he can also be located, will be asked to apologise, for having given the US the impression that he possessed WMD, causing the US to invade Iraq, bringing down tourist traffic worldwide, which, along with SARS (see separate apology) caused Singapore's recession to worsen this year;<br>Malaysia can apologize to Singapore for all the headaches theyÂ’re causing us about water, railways, land reclamation, causeways and being kicked out of Malaysia;<br>China will have to apologise to Singapore for its part in the Suzhou debacle, which ruined Singapore's reputation as a business leader in Asia. Also, it has to take the blame for unleashing the SARS virus on Singapore. Finally, China should apologise for taking away foreign investment and manufacturing jobs, causing the recession and massive unemployment in Singapore right now.<br>Said Mr. Cheng, Â“We also want to assure people that the Gahmen will also be saying sorry, all the way to the top. For instance, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong will be apologizing for not remaking Singapore fast enough for new leadership to take over, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew will be apologizing for not being young enough to run the country again, and Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will apologize for not being old enough to take over the country earlier.Â”<br><br>Does the Gahmen really think the campaign will be effective?<br><br>Â“If itÂ’s not,Â” said Mr. Cheng. Â“Then weÂ’ll just say sorry, lor.Â”</div>
