And also how the others around you view it...?<br><br>I see the confusion on Love now largely based on my 'Law of Secondary Requirement'.... Like a bread's sole purpose should most probably be to feed a creature... But you can also use it for decoration..? Catch worms for fishing? etc... Love has much more manipulations put into it...

So all the feelings prepared their boats to<br>leave.<br><br>Love was the only one that stayed. She wanted to<br>preserve the island paradise until the last possible<br>moment.<br><br>When the island was almost totally under, love decided<br>it was time to leave. She began looking for someone to<br>ask for help. Just then Richness was passing by in a<br>grand boat. Love asked, "Richness, Can I come with you<br>on your boat?" Richness answered, " I'm sorry, but<br>there is a lot of silver and gold on my boat and there<br>would be no room for you anywhere."<br>Then Love decided to ask Vanity for help who was<br>passing in a beautiful vessel. Love cried out,<br>"Vanity, help me please." "I can't help you", Vanity<br>said, "You are all wet and will damage my beautiful<br>boat."<br><br>Next, Love saw Sadness passing by. Love said, "<br>Sadness, please let me go with you." Sadness answered,<br>"Love, I'm sorry, but, I just need to be alone now."<br>Then, Love saw Happiness. Love cried out, " Happiness,<br>please take me with you." But Happiness was so overjoyed<br>that he didn't hear Love calling to him.<br><br>Love began to cry. Then, she heard a voice say, "Come<br>Love, I will take you with me." It was an elder.<br>Love felt so blessed and overjoyed that she forgot to<br>ask the elder his name. When they arrived on land the<br>elder went on his way. Love realized how much she owed<br>the elder.<br><br>Love then found Knowledge and asked, "Who was it that<br>helped me?" "It was Time", Knowledge answered. "But<br>why did Time help me when no one else would?", Love<br>asked. Knowledge smiled and with deep wisdom and<br>sincerity, answered, "Because only Time is capable of<br>understanding how great Love is."</span></div>
