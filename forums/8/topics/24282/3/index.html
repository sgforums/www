(which most of us.. would prefer anyway..) one has to learn to let go before one can recieve right?? no night would come if there's no day..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>obiwan<br><br>we are not here to look for sympathy but i believe readers or ppl here give support<br>yes, its true ther are hundreds n thousands of unfortunate people in this, i do think about them too. even when i eat, i tell myself i must finish every single grain of rice for i know i shouldn't waste food as there are millions, and i mean millions of people suffering from famine, hunger, but can YOU do anything about it, i might as well say u give your everything to them, live like them. I'm sorry if i offended you but diff people have diff problems and everyone will think that their problem IS the BIGGEST.  have you considered about people who are facing issue like divorce in the family, they too are stress, upset, angry. we all have a problem no matter big or small, but can we help it? not all problems are just as simple as you say, live happy. if there are, there wont be sucide or robbery or thef.<br>people in third world countries have their problem and I ADMIT i couldn't do anything unless im some rich son of a bitch, I will donate if i can, but i know i cant.<br>we are here to give  support to people who needs them, you may have your problems, i duno, they may hurt you before, but during the period when you are "injured", dun you wish that some1 can gif a support or a helping hand so that you may carry on with your life.<br><br>Never here to fight a war, but always looking for friends<br>like they say, love you enemy like you friends and friendship may just blosom<br>Take care<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>donch worry lah dont end your life lah. especially not next year. jialat if you end up in stretcher and hospital, worse man. worse for people like me also i hope evryone dont kena any accident or heart attack, best of all DONT GIVE BIRTH!!! anyway i'm sure you will find your love everyday. thnk of it this way i dont understand love as people paint the picture, because all i see around me is  "alternate love". alternate love is, when you love someone then that someone dont love you so you move along. then you meet someone else. and more often than not, that someone you met also same thing same situation as you, so you all happy happy pair up! and enjoy life as a couple happy ever after! that's called alternate love. and, that is the most common form of love i see around me leh!!! some people actually is alternate many time the love, try and try until finally end up with someone they love. wah lau you know what i call that? thats called "boh pian" and "kiasu left behind"<br>ugly one who want, fat on who want, poor one who want, bo tak cheh one who want, lagi got some illness and disease, still got people want!!! so relac my girl...</div>
