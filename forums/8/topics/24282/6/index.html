(maybe if u watch the jap serial "overtime"..., then u will see the same thing) maybe ppl will tink i am stupid, but i rather not have her if i can't have her heart... to love is to let go...<br><br>[color=red]If Love fails, set yourself free, let your heart spread its wings and fly again. Remember you may find love and lose it, but when love dies, you never have to die with it. The strongest people are not those who always win but those who stand back up when they fall.</span><br><br>i know it is easier than said, if i, the weakest one, can do it, u can too... it always hurt when the one u love doesnt love u back... i dun tink u are childish, it is jus that u are not yet reach the point that u can said, okie... i can face her now... maybe u can't do it now, but i believe u will one day as u grows along life...<br><br>yes, the feeling of betrayal sometimes hurts even more n sorry can't really undone everything... n life still goes on... it is hard for me to tell u what to do, but i hope one day someone can untied all the little knots that is in yr heart right now... who knows, when u find tat someone, u have to thank the 2 of them becos without them, your someone might not appear...<br><br>ahh, fate... it is really a mystery... predestined... somehow i believe it to some extent, but i believe that we are able to change it... maybe sometime we didnt really took the right step and go towards the left, but the left might have more beautiful things lay b4 us...<br><br>fate, life, chances, decisions... so many things to decide everyday, n every decision come a diff path... becos i chose to eat sotong mee today, i meet my soulmate on the way... or becos i chose to eat sharkfin, i meet my heartbreaker of my life...<br><br>life is all about conquering the unknown and the next second... tomorrow might never come at all... life is about finding the goals or the someone u want, someone u can hold your hands together till you are old and said i have no regrets living with u... life is about braving the storm, overcoming waves and ride upon the tides, so that when the sun shines again, you can stand up right there and feel the warmth...<br><br>if love have hurt u b4, dun be afraid... becos if love have never hurt you b4, then it is not love...<br><br>warmest regards<br>esp to hartdal, nooki and all listening in...<br><br>PS: i always love this song by depeche mode, sombody... and i dedicate to everyone here...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> [/color]</div>

But perhaps it might not be as simple as I think... Still trying to iron out the details....<br><br>As for your case, I can say it's most probably ATTACHMENT and/ or EGO...? When you truly love someone, of course you would want the best for him/her.... In wanting (demanding?) to be the <span style="font-style: italic;">creator</span> of his LOVE KINGDOM, your love for him should be largely based on a CONSTRUCTIONAL one.... To be INVOLVED... Building of a relationship... Somehow an EGO....<br><br>This is the part which is a little hard to catch? In Quantum Quote, what's ALMOST existing there fades into NON-EXISTENCE when a Quantum Lapse take place.... In sacrificing yourself for his love and hence fading into NON-EXISTENCE from his Life, you're accomplishing the formation of a 'True Love'.... And the fact that the NON-EXISTENCE take place put it TOTALLY ILLOGICAL to you.... Your friend, you blamed because LOGIC FAILS you... Channeling your love for your ex bf and the inability to blame yourself, your friend gets hit by the OFF BALANCE...<br><br>Human's instinct... What more <span style="font-style: italic;">value</span> does a love holds when it goes into NON-EXISTENCE from your Life....? Let's put it this way... A dollar when no longer in your hand, still holds the value... Just that you're no longer beneficiary from it... There's a DETACHMENT there.... <span style="font-style: italic;">If you can learn to see Love in a bigger picture one day</span>(you're mainly seeing it in the form of BGR now...)<span style="font-style: italic;">, you might just learn to cherish the fact that your dollar coin, someone's still using it....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span></div>
