            <div class='col-md body'>starhub issues differ from location to location cos blocks of users share a single cable line.. diff location diff cable line..<br><br>anyway either starhub or singnet - there shld be no problems if you connect thru LAN to a router cum modem or a router to a modem then the modem connects to the net.. BUT leave the modem and router on 24/7 dun disconnect it.. unless u dun haf unlimited..<br><br>the above also solves the 3rd party software issue for singnet (win poet etc) because thru lan no software is required. most routers can b managed thru internet explorer / safari and most routers/modems have the ability to stay "always on" and "auto reconnect" to your PPPoE or Cable connection..<br><br>the new singnet plans that come with the 2wire modem cum router is pretty stable.. so that's a marked improvement from the past i guess.. but still the customer service sux to the core for singnet..</div>

Downloading using bitcomet is about 10 - 30 Kbps overall, thou there are a few time I hit 100 over Kbps(rare). Downloading a 5mb mp3 took about 3 - 5mins, not too sure as I use a downloading manager, 1 - 2 mins. Large files (maple story full installation - 400mb) took about 2hrs, using dl manager about 30 - 40mins. Playing online games or steaming movies are quite smooth overall.<br><br>Thats what I experienced.</div>
