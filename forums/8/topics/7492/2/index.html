And sometime it can make you do stupid things like going into a relationship just because you don't want to fight the loneliness anymore..<br>And just for giving up this fight, loneliness makes you drag in another innocent person and hurt them like loneliness hurts you...And to them, the pain maybe 100 times more painful then what you are feeling...<br>I know...Loneliness have gotten me so many times...<br><br>Jim Beam I like your quotes..it's kindda profound  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that not everyone will find their mate in the end. Thats not because you (as in generally, not pointing finger at anyone) are not desirable, but because there the circumstances just didn't work out. I won't argue about whether finding a gf or bf is right or wrong, but I think so long as you can be happy in your current situation, thats the most important thing.<br><br>Lets say, for example, that I belong to one of those who will never find my mate, but that shouldn't mean that I don't live the  other areas of my life to the fullest. No, no one has said that they are crippled by this feeling of loneliness so far in this thread. I'm just trying to put in some words of encouragement with a slant at being realistic.
