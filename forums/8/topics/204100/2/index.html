            <div class='col-md body'>I got one VERY VERY simple job for you. Air con environment and all over Singapore sight-seeing possible.<br>I will provide you with the tools and you only need to take pictures and ride the MRT ALL DAY LONG.<br><br>I will give you a baseball bat (for protection), a Polaride instant camera ( to take pictures of people), a MP3 tape recorder (to record people talking).<br>You job hours are very flexible, you can eat and talk and sleep anytime you like. But daily I only need at least minimum 10 results from you.<br><br>You job is to just take pictures of people breaking the law while on the MRT, mostly eating/drinking and dirtying the MRT cabin.<br>Also record down your conversation with them like "I saw you eating on the train, I got photo proof and I am going to exercise my citizen civil minded responsibility and report you to the station control for breaching the MRT by-laws, my lawyer HP number is 123456789, you can talk to him if want clarifications ". At this point you will give the other party my namecard.<br>Then all you need to do is keep recording and alight at the same station as that person and quickly inform the station supervisor that a crime on the MRT has being committed and you have the proof. Try to get the station supervisor to 'catch' the culprit and take down his particulars. You will tell the station supervisor that YOU will be the witness and have picture to show when the court case comes along.<br><br>So there are two outcome in such matters.<br>1) The law breaker will consult with his lawyer and his lawyer will talk to your lawyer(aka Me, a qualified lawyer). And I will negotiate a out-of-court settlement with the other party's lawyer.<br>2) If the other party wants to go court, then let him be. You would be congratulated by the judge as a responsible and rightous Singaporean. Maybe the police will award you with a Courage medal and your face will appear on TV.<br><br>So what you will earn is 20% of the out-of-court settlement that I managed to get each one of them.<br><br>Expected salary projection. Assuming you take 10 pictures per day or 200 pictures per month(five day workweek, WOW!!). Assuming 50% of them decided to settle out-of-court, that will be 100 cases.<br>Assuming I negotiate a $300 from each case. You will get $60 per case.<br>In total $60x 100 = $6000 per month!!! Not bad eh??<br><br>Give me a PM if you are interested in this job.<br><br></div>
