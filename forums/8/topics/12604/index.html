            <div class='col-md body'>Just happened that my colleagues and friends were talking about this group of Singapore graduates who is damn smart, but apparently dun really think, although they think they think.<br><br>This group of people belongs to the elite in the university. They are the Singaporean scholars, graduate with 1st class honours (doesn't matter which university, 'cos it's still the brain), high IQ but 0 EQ. And usually, they wear spectacles, frame: black. They don't wear contact lens.<br><br>They are damn obedient. They do what their supervisors tell them to do (that is, if you don't tell them, they don't do). And when there's something to be done, these group of people will be among the first to rush and try to do it.<br><br>Some call them scrapy-doo (from a cartoon series). Others call them chao scholar (stinko scholar).<br><br>Post this for amusement... Their behaviour is really damn amusing. Good laugh for a blue monday morning.<br><br>They may be your colleagues, or classmates. But think again. These are the group of people getting scholarships to top universities and they will probably be working in some government ministry, controlling how much tax we will pay next time or decide how to invest our CPF funds. Worst still, they may be in PAP next time, running Singapore...<br><br>The next few posts are the anecdotes. If you got anything about this chao scholar, share hor... i can tell my colleagues more stories  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Scrapy-Doo 1:<br><br>My colleague's wife started this thing about scrapy-doo. She graduated from some foreign university and is currently working in MAS. Most of her colleagues are from NUS or NTU, 1st class honours.<br><br>Her obversation of this group of elite is that whenever there's job to be done, everyone rushes to do it. They don't think (or they think they know how to think). They don't think whether it's their job to do it, or if there's anybody else in a better position to do it. Everyone tries to be responsible for that job and tries to prove themselves. They just keep doing and doing. Well, apparently, they don't think of the point that if things dun go well, they get the blame too.<br><br>Anyway, it's good if you have this kind of people as colleagues... they will rush to do all the shitty jobs too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Scrapy-Doo 2:<br><br>This is from my manager.<br><br>In his previous company, my manager used to have an assistant. My manager's boss was damn proud of this scrapy-doo. Apparently, this scrapy-doo was on the dean's list (straight As) throughout university (i think NUS).<br><br>Typical of scrapy-doo, this one is very obedient too, listens 100% to supervisor. What happen is that my manager used to have a lot of heated discussion over technical stuff with his boss. To my manager and his boss, those heated discussions are normal, nothing much. What my manager heard from the secretary was that whenever they have heated discussions, that scrapy-doo will tremble with fear. I guess the scrapy-doo is used to instructions and commands, ONLY LISTEN. Those heated discussions, to him, was like challenging authority, out of line, defiance, etc...<br><br>In the end, that scrapy-doo couldn't take it and resigned.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>aiya, in my faculty in nus, grades are so important! this is the only place ever in my life i have found myself continually at the bottom. all my life, i've at least managed to do reasonably at least. i'm not sure how much people study, but some people have the ability to do well academically, and are driven as well, so that's their good fortune. but i've realised that grades don't make much sense when what you achieve later in life depends on your ability rather than how much you can write! just a little survey of the richest men in singapore alone would come to the conclusion that most don't have degrees.<br>this was what i was told by a wealthy indonesian friend years ago: you don't need to have good grades, you don't need to be brilliant. all you need is to be able to EMPLOY these people to work for you. you make use of them...<br><br>makes sense?</div>
