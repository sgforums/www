Hur hur.<br><strong>Yati</strong>: You bad person. Yati no like you.<br><strong>Counsel Singh</strong>: Like I care Yati, like I care. One last time Yati.

Counsel Singh is showing off.<br><strong>Judge</strong>: Overruled. Being MM Lee personal lawyer, it's only right that we allow Counsel Singh to show off once in a while. Counsel Singh please carry on.<br><strong>Counsel Singh</strong>: Thank you your honour. Mr Durai, will it now occur to you that your defamation suit against my client now appears to be ill conceived.<br><strong>Durai</strong>: Damn you Singh. Damn you and your turban.<br><strong>Counsel Singh</strong>: Your honour, to' kill off' this case, I like to call upon my next witness. HeÂ’s none other than (long pause for dramatic effect) Â“The ContractorÂ”.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: red;">The whole room goes Ooooooooo. Some even soil their pants.<br>An Ah Pek approaches the stand.</span></span><br><br><strong>Counsel Singh</strong>: Mr contractor, am I correct to say that you are the one responsible in installing the tap?<br><strong>Contractor</strong>: Ha nah.<br><strong>Counsel Singh</strong>: Were you asked to install the gold-plated tap in Mr Durai bathroom?<br><strong>Contractor</strong>: Si lah. That Ah Neh said he only want the best and he told me to install the gold one from the catalog loh. I sibeh buay song after that becos hor how can anyhow waste people money like that wan. Si bor?<br><strong>Durai</strong>: *looking agitated* Ok dammit. We did installed a gold-plated tap. There I admit it. But I see nothing wrong with it. It was entirely within the guidelines and regulations of the board. Everything that was done was above board.<br><strong>Counsel Singh</strong>: You know Mr Durai, with regards to what you just said, we Sikhs have a old saying, Â“Milakum nahbahsoli krisnathamÂ”. It means Â“What a pile of bullshitÂ”.<br><strong>Counsel Khoo</strong>: OBJECTION your honour. Counsel is insulting my client.<br><strong>Judge</strong>: Overruled. Not only is Counsel Singh allow to show off, but he is also entitled to make sarcastic insults now and then. No choice. MM Lee personal lawyer mah.<br><strong>Counsel Singh</strong>: Thank you your honour. With the testimonies of the two witnesses, we can safely conclude that the articles in question which were printed by my client has in no way defame Mr Durai in any capacity but were simply reporting and conveying the facts to its readers. Facts which we have already proven in this court. As such I would like your honour to end the session now and throw out this suit not only because of it's ridiculousness but also because I'm getting hungry.<br><strong>Counsel Khoo</strong>: OBJECTION your honour. I haven't had my turn yet.<br><strong>Judge</strong>: Objection my ass. I'm getting hungry too. Lets just adjourn for makan before resuming the session.<br><strong>Clerk</strong>: Hear me hear me, the Judge is leaving for makan.
