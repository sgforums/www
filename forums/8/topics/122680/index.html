            <div class='col-md body'>Looking ahead down the stretch of Orchard Road with its Christmas trimmings gleaming and bouncing off streaks of lights, the whole place was teeming and afrenzied with activity..<br><br>Stacy blinked, but couldn't speak.. She tried to smile, and failed.. She pull a cigarette and lit up.. Its getting more expensive with each coming days.. when is she able to quit?  All she could do was stare.. she was retrenched by her so-call good friend..  Stacy started to walk slowly, anachronistically along the pavement, she couldnÂ’t help feeling she was caught up in her own dazed bubble, set apart from all the dash and rush that was going on around her..<br><br>Â“Would you care to donate to the Salvation Army, MissÂ” A short bespectacled boy manning the charity counter came up to her.. Months ago, she could easily donate, in fact she was so good at spending money that she wouldn't even bother the small amount, like -- a donation..<br><br>Stacy smiled weakly and dug into her gucci bag, recognising the irony of the situation.. She fished out a fifty-cent coin.. Â“IÂ’m afraid thatÂ’s all the change I have on me at the moment,Â” she offered and gave it to the boy who beamed, Â“Thank you, Miss - any amount counts.Â”<br><br>Stacy looked at her bank balance.. she would need that for house payment and groceries, not forgetting her mum's medical treatment.. A week back, a friend suggested she work in a night-club, in which she rejected outright.. she can't imagine a former banker like her should stoop so low as to be a girl in a night-club.. The thought of letting men old enough to be her dad touching her makes her nausea..<br><br>There was a big travel fair in the shopping centre atrium.. Stacy wandered aimlessly along the rows of partition from the various tour agency.. Each year, there would be such a fair where you can get all the bargains.. In the past, these events will not attract her as she dislike the thought of being associate with aunties for cheap bargains.. some how, it was perhaps a way for her to remind herself the situation her had arrived.. She browse through some of the brochure and found some real cheap package..<br><br>For a long time, in fact since she was capable of earning money, she've never brought anything for her mum.. She couldnÂ’t buy the big houses and flashy cars that her contemporaries owned, but at least she could get her mum the much needed break that she deserved, for all the years of toiling and working overtime to see her through university, for all the years of undeniable love and care her mum had given.. She regret the neglect for her mum, hoping that it's still not too late and paid for a 1 week package tour to shanghai..<br><br>For the first time of the day, Stacy smiled, relieved.. she had never felt so good since the day she was retrenched.. Nothing else really matters now.. Just the thought of watching the delight face of her mum is enough for stacy..<br><br></div>
