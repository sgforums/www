            <div class='col-md body'>Me thinks ... ZGL is smarter than SMY .. coz the fall of the Shu kingdom is not solely b'cuz of ZGL refusal to take the throne but rather external factors like Liu Bei himself and his generals. Liu Bei, to start with, is too kind by nature, so called all 'sun3 ren2 li4 ji3' things he wun do loh , gotta be more ruthless! Somemore his generals some also dun listen to ZGL orders and not loyal somemore, like Liu Feng and Co. refusal to rescue the trapped Guan Yu. Inevitably, when Liu Bei went charging trying to avenge Guan Yu, his troops went up in smoke and everything went downhill from there. ZGL may be smart but there is limited talent in Shu Kingdom to support him[his successor Jiang Wei couldn't do much .. though I like him], unlike Cao Cao's pool of talent. As the saying goes, 'san1 ge4 chou4 pi2 jiang4, sheng4 guo4 yi2 ge4 zhu1 ge3 liang4' So sooner or later, Zhuge Liang died of being overworked ... In fact, ZGL had a chance to kill Sima Yi if not for heavenly intervention in the form of the rain  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ... One last thing, though not really the fault of Liu Bei, he had a really useless son!<br><br>Eh? Idol?
