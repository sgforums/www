            <div class='col-md body'>Precisely. Gers in Jap are well-dressed and pretty, but not all are what the TS sees in AV flicks. A lot of these gers I have spoken to are very materialistic and hard to handle. I have also seen a lot of fat jap gers too. On the other hand, I have spoken to gers from Vietnam and even the rural parts of China, they are very girl next door, down-to-earth, and honest. Possessing a real charm about them. They may not be as smart to an extent, but that is because of their lack of proper education. With education, I am sure they be as smart, if not smarter.<br><br>And working girls from Shanghai are amazingly shrewd and cunning, they would turn any Singapore man or woman around their little fingers. If the TS says that they are stupid, he aint see nothing at all.<br><br>While I got nothing against local gers, I hate it when this young ignoramus fool come up and talk as if he has seen many gers in his life. He is embarrassing not just himself but us Singaporean guys.
