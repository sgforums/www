            <div class='col-md body'>by Nyonya Kway<br><br>A top Gahmen official was convicted today in the High Court of outraging modesty. The official, Mr. Wah Wooh Looi, had apparently exhibited his salary to Dr. Chin Pai Quah, without any invitation on her part. Said Dr. Chin during her examination at trial, Â“I thought their salaries were supposed to be modest, so I was outraged by how large it was.Â”<br><br>Mr. Wah had apparently gone to Dr. ChinÂ’s clinic in Bukit Gorblok in July last year, claiming that he had been hurt by accusations that his salary was too large.<br><br>According to Dr. ChinÂ’s testimony in Court, Â“He insisted I inspect it to see if it really was that large. He insisted it was only moderate in size and couldnÂ’t understand why people were asking that it be cut.Â”<br><br>Dr. Chin testified that, Â“He said, Â‘Why must potong? I not Muslim, what!Â’ and then flashed me his, um, payslip.Â”<br><br>Dr. Chin said she was horrified when she saw how large it was.<br><br>Mr. WahÂ’s lawyer immediately objected, saying that Dr. ChinÂ’s opinion was neither here nor there and that she should have inspected Mr. WahÂ’s private sector, which would have shown that Mr. WahÂ’s endowment was modest.<br><br>However, Dr. Chin refuted this criticism, saying, Â“IÂ’ve compared it to the CEOs of many multinational corporations, and even those of statesmen from other countries, and Mr. WahÂ’s was outrageously huge, especially for someone of his stature.Â”<br><br>Mr. Wah also apparently insisted that Dr. Chin inspect his spending power, and that, apparently, was the last straw.<br><br>Â“I just couldnÂ’t watch him spewing stuff out of his pay packet any further,Â” she said as she broke down in the witness stand.<br><br>After Mr. WahÂ’s pay packet was exhibited in Court, presiding judge Justice MPH Rubbing instantly convicted him of outraging modesty.<br><br>In mitigation, Mr. WahÂ’s defence counsel asked Justice Rubbing to take into account Mr. WahÂ’s Â“substantial contributionsÂ” as a Â“fine, upstanding citizenÂ”.<br><br>In a departure from normal open court principles, however, the nature of Mr. WahÂ’s contributions were not made known. Instead, a multi-page document was handed to the judge for his deliberation.<br><br>This special treatment has led to frenzied speculation in the bar room amongst lawyers that Mr. Wah must have been a senior figure in an important department of the civil service or government.<br><br>Â“Very funny leh,Â” said lawyer Khee Hai Kok. Â“He was found guilty of exhibiting himself, yet when it came to mitigation, they covered up his, ahem, substantial attributes.Â”<br><br>Â“Aiyah, to be able to get this done means he must be damn tua kee lor,Â” ventured fellow litigator Chee Sup Kok.<br><br>Mr. Wah, however, denounced such speculations. Â“These people better stop talking about my cock, I mean, talking cock about me! Wait I show them then they know!Â”<br><br>Mr. Wah was eventually sentenced to one dayÂ’s jail, giving a whole new meaning to the term Â‘jailbirdÂ’. However, he was spared receiving strokes from the rotan. Said Justice Rubbing, Â“ThereÂ’s been enough stroking in this case as it is.Â”<br><br>Many have also received the news of Mr. WahÂ’s jail sentence as a welcome sign that unbecoming conduct will not be tolerated in Singapore, even for a Â‘big shotÂ’.</div>
