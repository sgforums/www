            <div class='col-md body'>actualy assemble, upgrade and configure all my computers.<br><br>My experience in SLS indians shops are disappointing. They are cheaper, but a lot of risk. Some of them tends to recycle faulty products back to you with cheaper price.. suck you in.. and refer you back to the principle supplier when you go back to them. Despicable practise. That's how some so them push up sales. I don't mean all. But many of them. The trouble of installing and going back there to exchange is such a husltle.<br><br>When I approach them and they give my airs, I will just simply walk away. Chinese do give better service and sound advice. Just afew dollars difference, why should put up with the attitude.. they are not even $10 difference max.<br><br>Some Indian shops do give ample service, if they are not too busy. I know two that I always go back. But I do buy majority of my componenets from chinese. For the service and advice.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once, I went to SLS on a slow Monday, met a shop owner from India. He tried to sell me a thumb drive at an incredible price about 50% above the other local shops. I told him nicely about this diff. He was in a friendly mood and I chatted with him.<br><br>It seems to me their bussiness model is diff from the local. The local will only hold enough stock to prevent obsolency. But they purchase in big bulk (for export). So when they met with export problems or stock obsolency, they run into problem. Otherwise, they canl make tons of profits exporting to India.</div>
