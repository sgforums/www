            <div class='col-md body'>Be wary because artificial conditioning done to  your hair can cause hair loss. it happened to a friend...he lost a good part of his hair. And waited 6 months it did not grow back. Baldness in males are common and it is co-related with the degree of baldness with members of the family from the mum's side...Basically means if your mother's dad or brothers are bald, u will mor elikely to go bald or take a mnor form if it is the case...And things like health problems, styling your hair or using chemicals (hair dyes,gels) can trigger off that genetic inherited hair loss earlier than expected....As in the case of my friend, his maternal side of family were all bald but all of them lost their hair after 30s but HE lost is in his early 20s...<br>better have simple unfashioned hair than lose all your hair.</div>

I believe it involves a series of polygenic addition (which also determines the degree of baldness) rather than a single gene that is particular responsible for balding of hair.<br></div></blockquote>The explanation is that the genetic reason for Pattern Baldness is linked to your mother's X-Chromosome. Everyone get one-half of their genetic make-up from their mother and their father. The final chromosome pair of the 23 pairs is the sex determining set. While males are XY and females are XX the determination of an individuals sex is made by the father. It is the father who gives either the X chromosome, which matches with the woman’s X resulting in XX and a female child or the Y chromosome which joins with the woman’s X resulting in an XY match and a male child. It is the X chromosome or female sex chromosome that contains the gene for Male Pattern Baldness.<br><br>Since men have only one X chromosome, the gene for baldness is a single expression gene that shows up because there is no possible dominant gene to suppress what would normally be a recessive or hidden characteristic. Since Male Pattern Baldness gene is only on the X chromosome and men can only get that chromosome from their mothers, it is simple to see how this type of baldness is passed from mother to son.<br><br>The fact that it seems that men in families often have many generations of bald men tend to make this explanation of hard to believe, yet genetics explain it. Male Pattern Baldness is a condition that as previously stated is on a gene on the X chromosome. Since this form of baldness is recessive, it will be hidden if only one of the dominant genes is present. Since women have the XX chromosome pair, baldness will not occur unless both chromosomes have the recessive gene that causes baldness<blockquote>If that is the case, perhaps you do not even need to "wait to get bald" but rather, will be bald since you're born</blockquote>Hormones come into play during your puberty.the Baldness gene makes one's hair sensitive to hormones in the body...it will be a while (past puberty ect) before u start losing yr hair since baldness is an autoimmune response which basically means the your immune system starts rejecting the hair cells and yr hair falls out because hormones ( DHT, testesterone and estrogen) clog up the hair cells. Now this does not happen overnight, in fact your hair is always been clogged up by homones since puberty started, It hangs on till the body gives up the fight and your autoimmune response takes over by rejecting the hair. Now when this happens is called the triggering of baldness. So in the first place if u want to avoid baldness your hair should be genetically resistant to hormones in your body. And this  depends on your family's genetic history.</div>

But doing it worsens or may trigger major problems for your hair earlier especially if u are predisposed genetically to lose your hair. If  u notice your mum's brothers or dad are boths bald, u are doomed.Science has figured out that the Gene for baldness lies in the X chromosome (female gene)<br><br>All life forms as female ( X chromosome)<br><br>boys = X from mum + Y from Dad = XY (male)<br><br>Girls = X from mum + X from Dad = XX (female)<br><br>This goes to  shows since females also have hair loss the same as males, by studying the male genetic code (XY) , we deduce that the baldness gene culprit lies in the X chromosome  since Y is not found in females.  And so are many other deadly diseases known to man lies in the X chromosome. X chromosome from the father (if u are female, that is XX) comes from his mother. So It all sums up mum's side= culprit<br><br>But all is not destined to go bald. It is the degree of inheritance and family history which determines if u are a minor balder or a major balder.<br></div></blockquote>baldness is x-linked? your lecturer tell you ah?</div>

And if u born with hiar which are genetically resistant to hormones ( whihc means u have no inherited issues), u will not go bald and chemicals and hair conditioning will not trigger your hair loss. Sure u will have hair loss by stress on your hair due to chemicals but u will grow it all back once u stop using them. This form of hair loss is not called Inherited baldness, it is hair loss brought about by external factors. And nobody goes bald forever by this form of hair loss. it's just like an allergic reaction. And also Hairloss due to third degree  Burns, chemotheraphy or cancer/Aids/malnutrition belong to this category<br><br><strong>But</strong> If u are genetically born with "weak" hair which means sensitive to hormones, your hair is constantly under attack and after a certain period of time, baldness starts for u because your hair simply got weaker and gave up the fight to grow againnst the hormones...Now if u are going to add chemicals and other stuff to your hair. this will further weaken your hair and make it give up the fight earlier and thus tirggering baldness.do u get the picture? The triggering will appear earlier for u if u do nasty things to your already weak hair...And this hair will not grow back because baldness has already been triggered. Thanks to your hair styling chemicals, it has been triggered earlier than expected.</div>

Females need both Bad XX to go bald<br><br>mama doesnt show hair loss since both  her XX is not Bad<br><br>but your mama;s brothers do because they got the same  X (which yr mama has) from their own mother (your mama's mother) which means a BAd X.....now this is tricky because u dont know yrself which X ( u only have one since u are male u inherited from your mama). Remember your MAMA got one of the X from her own mother and one X from her father. <strong>But one of these Xs is surely bad , which passed on to her brothers and they bald</strong><br><br>Npw that she give birth to u :- Which X pass on to u no one knows, .....<strong>But 1 thing is sure, since u are male, u have only 1 X and that is 100% sure from your mum, your DAD only gave u a Y and u are born XY</strong> This is a double edged sword because the X u have only one as a male, if it is good u are fine....but if it is bad  , u are doomed. why? because if u are female if u have 1 X bad,  u are still fine, but if u are male and u have 1 X bad, (the other is only Y) u are the same as a female with Both XX bad. <strong>As u can see the whole affair becomes like a  dangerous gambling game of mix and match to hit jackpot!</strong><br><br>There is a recent research saying that baldness can be prdicted by observing more on your mothers father and her brothers than ypur dad's side...do that and predict your own.<br><br>This is the reason why your mother's side of your family matters most for baldness<br>As the age old  saying goes<br><strong>Baldness runs in the family</strong></div>
