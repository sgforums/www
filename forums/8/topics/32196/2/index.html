            <div class='col-md body'>well well well, its all back to such debates again huh hahahaha..<br>firstly, someone tell me an universal definition of GOOD MUSIC.  Everyone has a definition of what GOOD MUSIC is. I am no exception. I can tell you frankly that the onli good music i think is around are rock and hardcore and punk. But am I universally right? I hardly think so. its just my preference. And i can tell you, i hate chinese songs and japanese bands (i like some lah...like Gorbachev..neber heard b4 rite?) i hate chinese songs, most of them, cos all they sing is love, sure win formula, sure make money. i hate japanese bands cos they are poseurs...glam rock? all we need is rock, no need glam.<br><br>But in the end, do i condemn them as musicians, talents? no i just dun like their music! do we take out a personal agenda against pple who do and enjoy such music? if u do that, u  are not fit to listen to music. I play in a band who plays wat i enjoy to listen to. but what the heck, i attend other gigs , jazz, pop watever though i dun enjoy the music, the people who plays them are my frens, i respect them as doing what they do best, making music that relates to them!<br><br>So  to those who say R and B sux, there will be people who will hit back at the music u adore. those who tries to defend R &amp; B, cool it, listen to what u want and understand that music cuts across differences.<br><br>so, show some respect to music and their makers.</div>
