The only time I will let my guy carry my handbag is when I really need him to do so (eg. when I need to squat down to tie my shoe lace, or my both hands busy doing something etc).  But I will try to take the bag back from him as soonest as I can (maybe only a few seconds) so that he won't be spotted carrying a woman's handbag by anyone we know.<br><br>He will carry shopping bags for me if they are too heavy cuz some aunties say that girls should not carry heavy stuff too often (will break the back lah, will have difficult giving birth next time lah... etc etc).<br><br>Guys got a lot of pride one.  Some guys say they don't mind, not because they really don't mind.  They are just being nice.  I'm sure they won't feel good when they are being stared at in the public for carrying a cute cute handbag for the girl.  While we ask guys to be more sensitive to us, we have to think for their feelings too.</div>
