            <div class='col-md body'>only once,i feel curious so i tried practicing a meditation technique some sort like yoga by concentrating my energy to my toes, and moving up to my feet,ankles, shins, knees, thighs, hips, fingers, hands, arms,... I concentrated on slowly and deeply relaxing every part of my body and my mind. I felt my chest get heavier and breathing slower. And my head got heavier. I felt like I was slowly sinking into my bed. The gravity seem unlimited. Once a limit was reached, I felt my feet rising, as my head sunk into my bed, until finally it felt like I was in a vertical position, upside down, facing the wall behind my bed with my feet in the air. At this point, I tried to unlock the momentum but found that I couldn't. In fear, I tried to shout, but no word come out. I didn't know what was happening to me, and I was afraid. I tried to move, but couldn't.. I was totally paralyzed. I started to see thing very far away feeling very light. With a violent jerk, I returned to my body. This was a scary experience, i m sure i m not dreaming because i can feel what i was in there.</div>

The out of body is like when sleep until very soundly, then suddenly want to wake up, cannot wake up. Try very hard to open eyes, eyes cannot open, soul trapped in the dream land or other world like that, then I can feel my heart beat so slow, so slow, like going to stop. A force telling me don't try to wake up, no use. Going to die.<br><br>Then I will panic, and really use a lot of strength to jerk my body up, then I wake up, heart beat very very fast. Sweat a lot.
