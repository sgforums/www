The land speed record for a crocodile is 17 kph (10.6 mph) measured in a galloping Australian freshwater crocodile. Yes, some crocodiles do gallop! It's remarkable to watch them bounding along in a most un-reptilian manner, but it's the fastest way to get back to the water when danger threatens. However, only a handful of species can gallop, including Cuban crocodiles, New Guinea crocodiles, African dwarf crocodiles and even smaller Nile crocodiles. People often ask whether it's possible to outrun a crocodile, and the answer is yes! Don't bother trying to zigzag while you run, though Â— just cut a nice, straight line away from the crocodile as fast as you can, and you'll easily beat it. The danger that crocodiles pose is not their ability to run after you, but their ability to strike before you even know what's happening. In other words, keep your distance and you'll be safe.<br><br>Croco Hw fast u run ??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><strong>Q: On Crocodile Size</strong><br><br>The most believable record-holder for the longest saltwater crocodile was a massive adult male killed on the Fly River in Papua New Guinea in 1982. The animal had already been skinned when a visiting zoologist measured it at 20.3 feet (6.2 meters), and because we know skins shrink slightly it's likely the animal was nearly 21 feet long. It would have weighed between 1 and 1.5 tons!<br><br>Croco wads ur size ??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><strong>Do all members of the crocodilian species have the same body posture when they are ready to defend?</strong><br><br>To some extent yes Â— after all, there's no point being ambiguous about your feelings when you're threatened. There are some differences between species, mostly depending on the intensity of the signal they're conveying.<br>At very low levels, when a crocodilian is best described as "slightly concerned," it will gape to expose the teeth and yellow tongue. It's an effective way of saying "Hey you! See these teeth? Don't try anything!" and is common to all species. If this doesn't work, the crocodile gets a little more agitated and typically begins to vocalize. The universal reptile signal for "I'm not happy with this!" is a hissing sound Â— air is passed through a constricted opening (e.g. nostrils or glottis) to create an unmistakable sound.<br><br>After this, the crocodile starts to get serious, changing its posture dramatically to make itself look more intimidating. The body is inflated to increase apparent size (a very volatile signal between crocodiles), small to medium-sized crocodiles often stand up if on land, and most species arch the tail if in water. Many species, if standing, tilt their body axis toward the attacker, perhaps to present a more armored surface to potential attack. If the threat persists, then most species become more active Â— some twitch or flick their tails, some produce fluttering infrasounds or vibrate their entire bodies to send pressure waves through the ground or water, some produce groaning vocalizations and some snap their jaws together. In water, several species will "bite" the water and produce a loud popping noise and plenty of bubbles. Intimidation is the key word here.<br><br>At any stage during this routine, the crocodile may decide to flee if it doesn't feel secure. Alternatively it may attack. Again, the type of attack can vary Â— some species try and bite, some will use their heads as sledgehammers and literally smash an opponent, some will rush or swim toward the threat from a distance, even chasing them onto land or galloping after them for a few steps!<br><br>Ultimately, all this posturing serves a simple purpose Â— to avoid an attack unless absolutely necessary. Violence is not always desirable because the crocodile risks injury, whether it's fighting a rival or facing a potential predator. Most individuals will flee first or try and bluff their way out of an encounter. As humans, it's a good idea for us to learn the basic crocodilian threat signals! The best advice is always to maintain a respectable and safe distance<br><br>Hw bt u croco ? u got the same posture as them ??<br><br><strong>What is the evolutionary advantage of the crocodilian species having a four chambered heart like the human heart? Do all crocodilians have them or just the big ones?<br></strong><br><br>All crocodilians have a four-chambered heart, very similar in fact to birds and of course mammals. Birds and crocodilians share a common ancestor, so this is perhaps not surprising. Unlike birds and mammals, it is no exaggeration to say that crocodilians have the most advanced heart we know of.<br>The heart performs two main functions Â— pumping blood to the lungs (pulmonary circulation), and pumping blood around the body (systemic circulation). The four-chambered heart is the most efficient design because it separates the pulmonary and systemic circulations Â— there is no mixing of oxygenated blood from the lungs with deoxygenated blood from the body.<br><br>This separation also confers another advantage Â— the ability to grow to much larger sizes than animals with incomplete separation of pulmonary and systemic circulation (e.g. lizards, with three-chambered hearts). Large animals need high pressures from the systemic left ventrical to pump blood around the body, and such pressures would rupture the delicate tissues in the lungs if the pulmonary system were not separate. In the four-chambered heart, the right ventrical is much smaller and provides the correct pressure to send blood to the lungs.<br><br>This four-chambered design enabled crocodilians at some stage in their evolution to develop a means of bypassing the pulmonary system altogether. There is a valve called the "foramen of panizza," which connects the pulmonary and systemic outflows from the heart to an actively contracting valve in the heart. This valve shuts off the pulmonary system during diving Â— in fact, crocodiles are totally unique in that they have actively controlled muscular valves in the heart. This is important for crocodilians because diving essentially makes the pulmonary system redundant until the animal resurfaces and takes a breath. Hence, blood is diverted from the pulmonary system to the systemic to provide more blood and a greater aerobic capacity while submerged. Combine this with remarkable hemoglobin levels in the blood, which carries more oxygen and releases it to oxygen-starved tissues more readily, and you have an animal ideally suited to extended periods of submergence while still remaining active Â— perfect for hunting in and around water.<br><br>Croco ur heart look like tat ??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
