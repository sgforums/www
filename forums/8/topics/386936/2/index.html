              <p>Not to offend anyone, but muslim under the Islamic laws is to produce as much as they can, therefore, muslim malays tend to produce more childrens than other races, and they are proud to have all these childrens, to them, it is a glory and pride to have more childrens than their counterpart in name of Islam, so if you give 4, i try to give 5 and so on. But for other races (no pun intended on anyone ya), instead of producing more decendents, they indulge in self interest and money.</p>

                  to sell their 4-room flat.   They are on financial aid by
                  govt.    Getting a miserable amount of $200 for

              <p>I don't want to sound unsympathetic, but imho this family is suffering because of poor financial planning.  Why live in 4-room flat if you can't afford to? Why have 4 kids when you can't afford to give them a reasonable quality of life? Don't they have any savings at all?</p>
              <p>Even if we want to help them, the solution is not to give them free handouts. Help them to be gainfully employed instead.</p>

              <p>The question is not whether the malays are producing more children but can our finite world resources sustain big families malays or non malays.</p>
              <p>In the old days when most people are peasants and live off the land, big families are indeed more beneficial but with the rapid development last 100 years with more people moving to the cities this has become more detrimental to parents earning average incomes unless you're from upper middle class.</p>

              <p>I don't want to sound unsympathetic, but imho this family is suffering because of poor financial planning.  Why live in 4-room flat if you can't afford to? Why have 4 kids when you can't afford to give them a reasonable quality of life? Don't they have any savings at all?</p>
              <p>Even if we want to help them, the solution is not to give them free handouts. Help them to be gainfully employed instead.</p>

              <p>Not to offend anyone, but muslim under the Islamic laws is to
              produce as much as they can, therefore, muslim malays tend to
              produce more childrens than other races, and they are proud to have
              all these childrens, to them, it is a glory and pride to have more
              childrens than their counterpart in name of Islam, so if you give
              4, i try to give 5 and so on. But for other races (no pun intended
              on anyone ya), instead of producing more decendents, they indulge
              in self interest and money.</p>

              <p>from what i understand.. many take long term loans... one good example is courts.... offer upto 5 year loans for appliances... <br>a salesman said that when u buy above $xxx on credit, can buy this stuff at $1, and said many malay families take up tt offer.. seems win-win to them...<br><br>but long term... think of the interest rates</p>
