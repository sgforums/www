              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">1.	Barry Wain was formerly with the Asian Wall Street Journal and Asia Week.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';"><br><br> 2.	Presently he is with the Singapore think tank, the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies.<br><br> 3. He knows that if he writes anything against Singapore leaders he
                  would be dragged to the courts, sued and forced to pay huge indemnity. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">His colleagues have all been found guilty of defamation when they wrote
                  something that was not approved by Singapore leaders.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';"> There has never
                  been a libel suit by Singaporean leaders which has been thrown out by
                  the courts. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">It is safe for journalists to impute all kinds of
                  misbehaviour by Malaysian leaders. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'lucida sans unicode';">There have been many cases where the

                  In Barry Wain's book I was accused of losing Government money over the
                  purchase of tin being sold by speculators. When the time came for them
                  to deliver the tin, they could not deliver as they had no physical tin.
                  But the London Metal Exchange ruled that the speculators need not
                  honour the contract to sell to us.<br><br> 5.	We lost money but not in billions of Ringgit as alleged.<br><br> 6. Bank Negara traded foreign currencies.I don't know how much but we
                  lost money. Government stopped the trading by Bank Negara. Again the
                  amount is not as imputed by Barry Wain.<br><br> 7.	The third case is with regards to the losses by Bank Bumiputra in Hong Kong.<br><br> 8. Altogether I don't think the amount lost added up to RM10 billion
                  even. If we had lost 100 billion Ringgit the Government would be in
                  deep trouble. But although we did have poor growth during certain
                  years, the Government had never failed to meet all financial
                  commitments including the servicing of loans. In fact we had enough
                  money to prepay loans. The projects of course cost a lot of money. But
                  the projects can be seen by the people. Penang Bridge, Twin Towers, KL
                  Tower, KL International Airport, North Port and West Port in Klang,
                  commuter train, LRT and monorail, numerous expressways all over the
                  country, electrification and double tracking, Putrajaya, Cyberjaya,
                  Langkawi development, Proton, Modenas, Silterra chip manufacturing
                  plant, cement plants etc. etc. However, I don't think Barry Wain was
                  referring to these projects when he said I burnt RM100million of
                  Government money.<br><br> 9. The five years of Tun Abdullah's regime saw unprecedented profits by
                  Petronas due to the high price of oil. In my 22 years Petronas paid to
                  the Government 126 billion Ringgit. Petronas paid to the Government of
                  Tun Abdullah a total of 270 billion Ringgit in five years.<br><br> 10.	How was this huge sum spent? There are only empty corridors everywhere.<br><br> 11. The public has a right to know how 270 billion Ringgit in five
                  years have been spent. What projects have been financed by it. Why do
                  we have to borrow money from China to build the second Penang Bridge?<br><br> 12. I know every effort was made to find whether I had misused
                  Government money. Failing to find anything the Abdullah Government set
                  up a Royal Commission and accused me of being influenced by others in
                  the choice of judges.<br><br> 13.	I have a right to clear my name. Tun Abdullah also has a right to clear his name.<br><br> 14. The Government should cooperate and open all its books. There
                  should be no cover-up. The Government is committed to transparency. It
                  should demonstrate that it keeps its promises. </span></div>
