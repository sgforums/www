            <div class='col-md body'>i am in hurry to rush back to my chalet now but this is something that interests me alot and i feel like writing it now, after all, i nearly fell into the same trap too.<br><br>i have never meet the involved subject before and come to think of it, i have never meet anybody from here before! Point aside, she proves to be a very interesting study for psy and soci students. she had a knack for turning the cyber world into her own playground and and had her feet firmly implanted in the real world<br><br>For example, she doesn't care much about her life as HK. You can be extremely nasty or nice to her in V life but she doesn't let it swarm her head. it brings to my mind a phrase, perfidious albany, in which there is no permanent enemies or friends and this is truly amazing! who can say with assurance that cyberlife doesn't affect them at all? it's hard to draw a line when net and flesh merge, in which i know who A is. but i am afraid that is something HK kept to herself.<br><br>Another point to tender and tease your inquiring mind.<br>"my friends and i were laughing over..."-Hello Kitty<br><br>Think about it people. To her, this is a playground where she and HER REAL friends laugh over issues that she doesn't care about? What is hello kitty to the REAL hello kitty? Something to vent her boredom on? Or some experiment writ on a larger and grander scale?<br><br>Ultimately, HK is a person most feared by netters. She is a distinct personality...something most people are not here. As my dear Maya had mentioned before, if you can't stand the heat, sell your modem for a buck and breathe in the garden air.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mr Hata-san (edited 10 October 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mr Hata San,<br><br>Well said. The fact that she doesn't seem to care about what anyone thinks or who they are sure makes her formidable. If she does she sure as hell doesn't show it. Thats one tough cookie.<br><br>You brought up an interesting point about this place being an experiment for her. Personally I think its also interesting to see that all sorts of people can coexist in sucn an environment, our sgforums. We have those that appear as they are in real life (really, I think they exist); we have those who just want to see conflict and excitement (names escape me); and we have those in between. One of the types of people in between keep quiet most of the time but surface once in a while to give an overview of whats happening. Some have come and gone. Coco is one of them. Do check if he/ she will be interested enough to comment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is that different people have different uses for the internet. Be it escaping real life, interacting with like minded people, learning, or just poking (like when you poke an ants' nest and see what happens.)<br><br>I read somewhere about some comments on the effects the net will have on the future generation. Someone suggested that people from this era will view appearences (that includes race, height, looks, bra size) as less important, and views/ opinions/ solutions as paramount to their "clicking". Good or bad, thats a personal call. I think with this freedom from physical restraints or preconceived notions attributed by what we see, there comes a certain level of irresponsibility as you are less likely to be held accountable to what you say. Simply because its difficult to check what or who you are in reality.<br><br>Personally, I think this sort of interaction is an adjuvant to real life interacting. Time and again, I have to be reminded that real people around me are more important. Perhaps thats something that Hello Kitty has grasped, and I have to come to terms with.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 10 October 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me further espouse on my theory.<br><br>Distinct Personality.<br>Do we have it in here? I am afraid the answer is no, much as people liked to deny it. When groups meet up and outings are formed, the line is crossed. This is the telling moment when you bring flesh to your virtual ghost and your identities are merged. Whatever I post in here, it will be forever and extricable linked. I will definitely take care of what I post. Reputations and image matters. Friends and potential suitors and suitees matters. Herd mentality is formed and there you have it, the forming of a rea-virtual community.<br><br>And back to our subject, Hello Kitty...<br>Is she distinct? Most notably so.

However, as i have mentioned before, this is her playground. She will whine and complain, milk as much sympathy and flame as possible, before laughing all it off.
