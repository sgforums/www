To what extent do you think it is effective? Elaborate.<br><br>Security cameras are definitely going to prevent terrorists from attacking , because it is going to film the terrorists and with their face captured on the cameras, they will be scared.<br><br>Security guards will help because they got batons to fight against AK-47 wielding terrorists, and with batons we can defeat home-made bombs!<br><br><strong>NJC PRINCIPLE GRADING : A+<br><br>GO STRAIGHT TO PRESIDENT SCHOLAR AND BECOME A DEFENSE MINISTER</strong></div>
