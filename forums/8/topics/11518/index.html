Generally I think it don't really deserves to hit the big screen (Unless the movie goers are only out for their idols)<br>I find war movies rather realistic and nice except for the fact that the 'story' could be a bit exaggerating at times... But I find that many of these movies like to emphasize on 2 THINGS... HEROS and LOVE (BGR)... Commercialised for the taste of the consumers...? To date I find 'The Thin Red Line' one of the best war movies made....<br>Question about 'Pearl Harbour'.... What is the movie really emphasizing on...? How about 'Enemy at the Gate'? Which one would be better... Would be another 'commercialised' or realistic movie...? No offence, but from the 'shots' that I've saw on 'Pearl Harbour' I've got a STRONG FEELING that it's gonna be another 'commercialised' movie.... Most movies start off with quite a good emphasis on the objective of its shooting.... But SADLY enough to say MANY eventually can't escape the fate of being 'packaged' and commercialised for audience's taste....<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've watched The Tree yesterday. Personally i find the show touching and meaningful. I would say Zoe really performed very well. If you want me to compare this show with valentine or other shows that are more exciting, i would say, you can't compare the both. The Tree teaches something in life, the reality of life. I particularly like the part where Zoe knows that her husband didn't leave her, and her husband trying his best to stay on just to guard and take care of his wife and child. This shows teaches us that we shouldn't take what we have now for granted, as living with a regret is very painful.<br><br>As for other shows like valentine, yes, they are thrilling, but the moment you step out of the cinema, its history already.
