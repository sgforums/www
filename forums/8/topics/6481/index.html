            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Heterosexual,<br><br>The last time I declared myself heterosexual in the purity test, I lost 4% and got a 60% pure in my purity test (That is meant to be a joke).<br><br>Coming back to the topic. First of all, I can give you an alarming statistic. Every year, there are 30000 graduates from Singapore (educated either in overseas or local) goes to US to work. The quota is 30000 from the US embassy such that it is always filled up.<br><br>Young people would leave for a few reasons :<br><br>1)The rising standards of living. But it is even worse living in London and New York. I think the standard of living is still low in Singapore compared to the other big cities.<br><br>2)The job opportunities : Face it, Singaporeans want to pursue in the other areas which is not hot in Singapore, or they want to pursue where the big money is (like Wall Street in New York)..<br><br>3)Biased towards Foreign Talent : the emphasis of foreign talent had made some Singaporeans in my uni, want to give up on going back and thinking of settling elsewhere...<br><br>I would think of more, when I have something in mind....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't speak for youths, but I'll still give my own perspective.<br><br>The grass is always greener on the other side. Especially when you have gone to study in another country while hearing the horror stories of how tough working life is in Singapore. Long hours, stressful environments etc.... I'm sure those conditions can be found anywhere, but I'm not sure. What I'm trying to say is that somehow the working environment is less threatening compared in Singapore. Just a guess. I've never worked seriously before.<br><br>The cost of living is high in Singapore. Lots of things that people desire, like a house or car, are so expensive. No, of course I'm not saying that they are what you have to use to show your achievements, but they play a large part in assuring people that they have earned something.<br><br>Singapore is small. I hear friends lamenting about having few places to go. Compared to what they think they can do in a larger country, Singapore will appear boring and lifeless after some time.<br><br>There seems to be a lack of oppotunity  to argue with the authorities, even when you have the right arguments. Somehow people get swept up in the various policy changes and have to take it sitting down. Good luck to those who try to voice dissent, even when the decisions are idiotic. Again, I'll admit that this is my own impression.<br><br>As for myself, my current wish is to sustain a comfortable (though not cushy) existence without having to slog day and night with little time to do the things that I would like to do. Or, to put it bluntly, I want a life outside of my career. To me, at the moment anyway, that seems hard to achieve in Singapore.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 08 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For a Teenager, my gripes, on giving up my Citizenship are as follows:<br>1) NS. NS. NS. Instead of 3 years in NS, send me 1.5 years to Isreal, and I bet I can beat any of the so called regulars into pulp in a <strong>REAL</strong> fight. (Lets not even mention about being a better weapons master.)<br><br>2) Everything is so expensive ! I can get a house in Australia that's literally double/triple the size of a condominium for the cost of a 4 room HDB flat ! (I'm exaggeratting, but you get the point.)<br><br>3) The education system here sucks. Dispite all that they teach you in school, how much do you really UNDERSTAND ? I mean, you just need to memorize, and memorize, and you'll be able to do well. That's dumb.<br><br>4) Singapore seems to be more of a All Talk, No Action Country. People talk, and debate, and talk, and debate, but if you ask them to do it, they will give excuses, and such, being not willing to do the jobs which they had previously so vehemently say they could do better.<br><br>5) People look down on rebels. On the Outcasts, who go against the "natural" and "established" order of things. If you're different, you're a freak.<br><br>Everything else has already been griped on by the previous posters.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rulakir (edited 09 March 2000).]</div>

I think roots wd run deeper than how far money can run in Canada or the USA.  It wd seem duanting to leave frienships built up over many yrs &amp; start building relationships again...and integrate into a new culture...and leaving parents behind...maybe at the end of the day the people here wd outweigh every other consideration.<br><br>Is it a worthwhile sacrifice?

            <div class='col-md body'>Mateo:<br><br>You are definitely right. Other than the stuff that people look out for, there ARE reasons to stay back in Singapore. If nothing else, I myself have trouble fitting in with a foreign environment. But you have to admit that the lifestyle factors in other countries are a big pull for young people. I really don't think its the money, because I think the wages in Singapore are quite good. Its more than the money. Its the lifestyle. No, its the life.<br><br>Speaking to friends, I found that more often than not the only reason in making them stay in Sg is because of relatives and friends. Maybe I'm a bit disappointed by Singapore having nothing else to offer other than that reason to stay. Family and relations and friends are totally legitimate reasons. But I was hoping there was something more. A sense of belonging perhaps. Still, I haven't seen everything anyway.<br><br>I think first generations migrants generally do well, but its their children who really fit in. So some do it for the sake of their children.<br><br>In any case, not everyone is welcome in all countries.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is really nothing wrong with Singapore, or its government. Sure, they make mistakes, they pass strict bills and there are some goofy laws.<br><br>Freedom of speech and thought is somewhat limited compared to the US, but much better compared to China.<br><br>Yes, it's expensive to live here. Crime is not a big problem. So what's the problem? Discontent? With whom?<br><br>Sure, Singapore's not the best country to live in. So just live with it.<br><br>------------------<br>This is merely the path I have chosen. You decide yours.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I will like to address certain issues brought up by some of you.<br>But before i continue, I will like to let you know that I had worked in Singapore, China and UK before. And I am a pure Singaporean.<br><br>[Living Standards]<br>Some complain that the living standard in Singapore is too high. Too high for us to afford. But is the living standard really increasing at an enormous speed ? Or is our expectation increasing faster than our salary ? In China, the houses are cheap, food is cheap, transport is cheap but do you know how much a CHIEF ENGINEER earns ? 5000 yuan. Which is equivalent to about $ 1000. A secondary school student can easily earn that in Singapore. In London, I earn pounds. I will be rich if I spend my pounds in Singapore. But sadly, I can't. The NUMERICAL prices of food and daily necessities in London (or uk in general) is the same as in Singapore. If a book costs $ 15.00 in Singapore, it will cost Â£ 15.00 in UK. The exchange rate of Sing Dollar to Sterling Pounds is $ 2.76 to Â£ 1. But the salary I draw here is not 2.76 more than in Singapore.<br>After travelling to numerous countries in the past few years, I finally discovered that the things in Singapore are still very cheap, considering our developed economy. A house in Leicester cost Â£ 60 000 with a nice garden. Damn cheap. But houses in London cost Â£ 2 millions, without garden, though both Leicester and London are part of UK. So it all depends on where you are comparing singapore to.<br><br>[grass is always greener on the other side]<br>You never know until you get to the other side. I still feel more comfortable in my own 3 room flat than my fren's bungalow.<br><br>[boring and lifeless]<br>This is something i must agree. There are fewer things we can do in singapore. Less happening. But this also made it a more peaceful place to live in. If you migrate to UK and stay in London, well, your life will be VERY happening. But if you stay in a place like Leicester, it can be worst than Singapore. If I am tired of Singapore, I will travel  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But Singapore will still be a place I return to when i am tired. Of course I am assuming that u have the money to travel.<br><br>[freedom of speech]<br>We are having more freedom of speech now then 30 years ago. We are still a young nation. Are our thoughts mature enough ? Are our sense of belonging to Singapore strong enuff for us to have the WHOLE NATION in mind when "arguing" ? And not for personal benefits. I am talking about how mature are we as a nation ? There will slowly be freedom of speech, but it takes time. Let's wait until our educational standard is higher, people more cultured and the nation as a whole becomes more mature. Moreover, freedom of speech can be dangerous in a multi-racial society ....<br><br>[Paper Qualification]<br>I do agree that "papers" are very important in Singapore. I personally will not take up a course if I will not be given a certificate at the end of the course. To many international students I met in UK, this is weird. Many international students i know study for knowledge not for papers, this is something i truly admire, and i believe they enjoy more during the learning process. But if we do not stress on getting good results, what will happen ? I dunno. Maybe students will become more laxed, "pass is good enuff" attitude, or even "fail also nevermind" attitude. What will the whole nation become ? And when the foreign talents come in, how are you able to compete ? Don't let them in ? Then we are just running away from the problem and not solving it.<br><br>[people not tolerant of failures]<br>This I strongly agree. In England, I dun find it. This is something we need to change.<br><br>[Arts and Culture]<br>We are young in this. But we making great effort. I myself had involved in drama production before when i was younger. And I had discovered that Art activities are not very much supported by the public. The government can pump in $ 50 million (right ?)into Arts (Budget 2000) but if the public does not support it, it will never flourish in Singapore. So who to blame ? YOU. Well, at least now we see street performers along Orchard Rd, World class performances like Les Miserables and Plantom of the Opera coming to Singapore. Wait long long if it is 30 years ago. There is improvement, let's take things slowly. Dun force the chick out of its egg, it will just die ...<br><br>Personally, I like China's cheap and nice food, cheap transport and breathtaking nature. I also like Hawaii's slow pace of life and UK's nice cultured people and France's strong Arts and Cultural scene. There is no one place which I find perfect YET. But I am glad that being a Singaporean, I can travel to China, Hawaii, UK, France etc etc so easily. To me, they are just charlet houses, and Singapore is my permanent home  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Remember, the moment you are considering to migrate, you are already enjoying a privilege that billions in this world do not enjoy. Why ? Because you ARE a Singaporean.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i read in the press but didnt go too much into the details.<br><br>i think that if the ERP at the evenings could successful reduce traffic congestion like wat it does in the morning, then i think the govern should implement it, and to continue to fine tune the system. but i hope that it would be implemented in the evening rush hour only, and not including the periods of time after this.</div>
