              ya but
              
              is a limited credit card but still money rite?
              
              at least still customer rite?
              
              if that bitch chase one customer away, for example me rite now, does she know that how many other ppl will not apply or invest citibank anymore? cuz i will confirm tell my relatives, friends, colleagues how terrible their management are.
              
              this reflect badly on their image
              
              try to think ahead, u can understand le
              
              moreover i work in retail sales line b4 last time, i oso got scolded by customers at times for unreasonable requests
              
              i oso control my temper, and escalate to my sales executive and manager.
              
              i seriously feel that some people they need to go on course for services

I called to ask if I've gotten the course and a lady picks up the call, she told me that I didn't get into the course... However, I didn't even provide my name and IC number, how the heck she knows who the caller was? Instantly told me no... I was like ---&gt; "wtf"</p>

              the citibank clear card requirements are
              u need to earn more than or equal to 18000 per year
              mine is around 20k just enough to apply
              the cpf is u must submit online
              if u wanna submit your cpf online u go to
              www.citibank.com.sg - credit cards - others - theres a + sign click on it and choose apply for cpf submission
              it will lead u to singpass website, u just need to log in and click the authorise button this will allow citibank to check your past 15 month cpf contribution.
              u cannot print out cuz they dun accept hard copies.
              this one is the helpdesk ppl told me then i know...
              and u need to print out 3 copies of the relevant documents also
              
              nric, latest payslip, the application form and mail ot fax to them
              
              then they will process...
