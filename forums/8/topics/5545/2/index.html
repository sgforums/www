            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, one of my interests is fotography...amateur-pro fotographer...:-)<br><br>or so I'd like to think....<br><br>My foto style?  I believe in developing a look for myself when i shoot.  I find that everyone uses high quality equipment with sup-strobe lights, and super nikor flex-bend-behind shoot straight 2000 times zoom.....<br><br>I would go the other direction and go as natural as possible. When I take fotos, I would prefer my subjects not use stage make-up...normal street makeup is perfect...as natural to what they wear everyday as possible.  I've seen too many pictures of beautifully composed women and men in mags and portfolios....Why should I go and do the same thing.  And also, it is meant to challenge the idea of the perception of "processed beauty" that we often see in magazines and other media.<br><br>I always believed in not trying to make the person look like something they are not.  At the most, I will just use my on-camera flash...as it gives it a friendlier and down-to earth feel to the picures than the "pro" ones...but also it gives it a tad bit of class.  I also have some really crappy fotos that I like personally and I might post it in my other site....later tonight maybe.<br><br>for landscapes and buildingscapes, I also like to take the most natural shot as possible to try and give it that "normal guy taking foto look", but in a better composition and under different intentions...So my pictures won't ever be super-gloss modeling shots....there are eneough people doing that..<br><br>But it's still a hobby....:-)<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 12 November 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi pple<br><br>well this is my first posting here in this fourm so there's still things that i can really figure out... hehe<br><br>but from those posting regarding the topic, i'm interested in discussing some of my ideas of singaporean guys' standards in looking at gals ....<br><br>i agree with firewire that most of the gals in singapore are really pretty to the sense that they are natural ... unlike some that are acting 'CHIO' but actually they are not .....<br><br>also can anyone answer why is the standards of the singapore male that high as some commented that those pics that firewire posted on his webpage ?<br><br>i personally thinks that they are present looking and maybe they are approachable but that are the things that we can see it on a  still picture....<br><br>i come to a conclusion that althought a good first impression of a gal is a good start for a relationship .. but there are also other factors(not physical) that makes a guy go after a gal that is not the 'Perfect' gal they picture in their mind ...<br><br>really for those guys that are having high standards who calls those gals 'shit', do u think that u are really going to find gals that are 'UP TO' ur standards ?<br><br>looks are not the upmost thing on the list of judging whether a gal is pretty but nevertheless, looks are one of the top issues that guys are looking for .... hehe<br><br>in the end, i hope that those guys with 'SUPER HIGH' stnadards reflex on themselves whether are they compatible to 'SUPER CHIO' gals ...... if they really can find one ...<br><br></div>
