Once I get SexGod's blessing to post pics here, I will post a picture 4 u ladies also....<br><br>But it won't be a regular occurrence as it might take the focus away from what has made this board so special...conversations/discussion and perceptions/viewpoints....:-)<br><br>Thanks people.

            <div class='col-md body'>Really?  I think that the two look quite good.  Or maybe the foto doesn't do them justice.  When I met them, I was pretty blown away...It must have something to do with the fact that in real life, u get influenced by their personalitites/characters/exhuberrence...whatever.<br><br>Anyway, I sacrificed my whole night and today and my work to fix up a few proper pages on Xoom.<br><a href="http://members.xoom.com/firewire_iee/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.xoom.com/firewire_iee/index.html</a><br><br>Try out the site again.

            <div class='col-md body'>God, u people sure do have very high standards....<br><br>Actually, a lot of guys I know have very high standards...If u ask me, a bit too high.<br><br>I noticed from hanging around the local guys (the single ones...) that their preference is so high that the majority of girls I say can, they say cannot.....<br><br>to me it blows my mind because maybe if u only have one idea of what beauty/cuteness/prettyness is then u would be really picky.  I guess that must be why they are single....<br><br>I personally find a lot of girls qiuite attractive here...maybe because I'm into the visual arts, so beauty comes in many forms for me...and whatever form it does come in, I can appreciate it.<br><br>My friend asked me why my taste is so bad, and i told him frankly,..<br><br>..It's not my tasste that's bad, but ur perception of taste that is funny.  This coming from a guy who thinks that art can only be viewed from one stance only and any other way of appreciating it is wrong....<br><br>duh?....<br><br>Anyway, I think that these girls I put up are quite attractive...to me anyway.:-)  First of all because I know them so it helps a lot in that respect...if ur looking for drop dead gorgeous models on my site, then U'll probably never see them.  Besides, I prefer the normal girl to the beautiful ones...Don't know why...I find them sexier...in a sense...ha ha:-)<br><br>As for Slash, u really live up to ur nickname....I know it'ds just ur opinion, but a lot of people don't fotograph well...usually u'll find that meeting them in person brings a whole new light on how they look...if that's all that matters....<br><br>Anyway, I think that saying that they look like shit is really drastic!!!! to say the least.  Maybe not pretty by traditional chio standards, but they definately aren't dogs...:-)  If u consider them shit, then I pity the majority of the female population in ur eyes/standars...Of course if ur really goodlooking, then I withdraw my words...but I really doubt that ur so good looking that u can throw words like "shit" around....<br><br>...am I right...?  :-)<br><br>In any event, there are hundreds of thiousands of women in Singapore that are beautiful,...as with all things u just have to open ur eyes in more than just the physical sense.  Expand ur awareness...<br><br>on a final note...Let me just say that i guess ur not the only person who thinks like this....<br><br>Final example...Of all my Singaproean guy friends who I hang out with often...I am the only one who knows when pretty girls are around.  Of all the girls on Orchard Road, these same people can only come up with maybe a few girls that they think are pretty or worth chasing after...<br><br>...like, duh!!!<br><br>Thousands of girls on Orchard and u can only see 3 or 4 within a 10 hour period?  Either Singaporean girls are extremly ugly(which I know SexGod will disagree along with me), or something is wrong with the way beauty or Chio-ness is seen.<br><br>When I go out and there's girls around, I usually don't know where to look because there are so many "pretty" ones to me...Especially on Orchard...Suffice to say that I would almost go for anyone on Orchard...I smy standard low?  My standards aren't based on specifics and I see every person as themselves.  When U start to compare, everyone isn't pretty...:-)  Believe?...<br><br>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder....But the beholder must be able to see first.:-)<br><br>Ha ha:-)<br><br>Hope that clears up any illusions on what is considered pretty or shit.<br><br>My question would be:  Is there a fundamental difference between local guys and foreign guys when it comes to beauty or attractiveness?  an interesting question I think....hmmm<br><br>PS-on a final note-I rememebr once I met this girl I thought was really cute and pretty and my friend asked me why my taste so bad(or something along that line)...in the end, he fell for her and got somewaht jilted by her...hmmmmm  things that make u go, hmmm..<br><br>here's a picture of that girl...she's in the pink.  The 2 on her right are models now...this was back in 93?...<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 10 November 1999).]</div>
