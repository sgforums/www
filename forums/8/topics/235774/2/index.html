Are you trying to tell me that jesus christ is not son of god but merely a mortal, since you don't believe in god, if u say that u are Jehovah witness, i might actually believe you, the ironic is first, u mention that u are an antheist, then u change your mind to become free thinker, so what are u? </div></blockquote>I was a clerk in army, and when filling the personal dockets for all our people, whenever the person did not have a particular religion like Buddhist, Taoist or anything like that, we had to put free-thinker. Maybe SAF's definition of free-thinker is wrong, but since then I always had the concept that a free-thinker is someone without a religion. I only wanted to go one step further to specify that I don't believe in Gods/deities/spirits.<br><br><blockquote><strong>So who the HELL, create this god damn universe or earth, and who create man or woman? can you please you enlighten me, O almighty TS<br><br>OR!!!!!! even simple question - egg or chicken? which one was born first.<br><br>First of all.<br><br>I did wiki and read through the whole meaning of this Atheism,<br><br>A: Are you a freaking scientist, if you are one, then i might actually believe that u are a atheist!!!!!!<br><br>P.S. udontknowme, please do, pay a visit to wiki and read through the whole page then reply to the post that i mention or rather......<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism</a></strong></blockquote>I've read through your link and the impression that I get is that there are different types of atheists, and that an atheist doesn't necessarily have to be against any religion. I did not open this topic to talk about how the earth was created and who is wrong or right regarding that. I just wanted a better understanding of what an atheist is so I don't wrongly tell people what I am.</div>

You cannot use the statement that i'm Atheist when you are just trying to say that you do not believe in deism.
