So the CLT who was acting RSM for the spec cse want to nominate him for BOS duty. Our Coy CLT want to nominate him for COS duty. They both dunno, and in e end when they fund out, they decide to make him both BOS AND COS for the day, and they throw in ration party for fun also. E nite b4 he was BOS COS n Ration Party, our COY CLT come n talk to us, say:<br><br>"Eh tomorrow hor, when he is BOS, I want u all to show him defiance. He ask u do something, don't do. Give him attitude also."<br><br>So we did. He had hell that day. Run around commanding a bunch of ppl who have been told beforehand to didobey him. Somemore the CLTs make him wash the ration party tonner by himself. tonner at one corner of e camp, water point at e oppo corner, one lone guy carry 2 jerry cans, run back n forth, sibeh jialat. at nite stand by bed, we clean nice nice liao, but the RSM CLT purposely say bunk dirty, but never punish us, only punish him. H got slapped, and pushed n shoved and had the RSM CLT screaming at him full force in his face. He even got his CPL rank ripped off his no.4. After RSM done giving him hell, he totally just collapsed in a heap on e floor, crying. In e end, they did allow him to pass the cse with a 3rd sgt rank though.</div>
