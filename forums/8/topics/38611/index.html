            <div class='col-md body'>You may be well-aware of the recent rape case happened to a student who<br>was<br>being followed by a man and she fell from the stairwalk, hurt, backbone<br>broken and still being raped by the rapist under the stairway. This was<br>all<br>happened in day time at 2.30pm!! So, please read on this message. A<br>group<br>of rapists and date rapists in prison were interviewed on what they<br>look<br>for in a potential victim and here are some interesting facts:<br><br>(A) WHO<br>(1) The first thing men look for in a potential victim is<br>hairstyle.<br>They are most likely to go after a woman with a ponytail, bun,<br>braid<br>or other hairstyle that can easily be           grabbed. They are also<br>likely to go after a woman with long hair. Women with short hair are<br>not<br>common      targets.<br><br>(2) The second thing men look for is clothing. They will look for<br>women who's clothing is easy to remove    quickly. Many of them carry<br>scissors around to cut clothing.<br><br>(3) They also look for women on their cell phone, searching<br>through<br>their purse or doing other activities while     walking because they<br>are<br>off guard and can be easily overpowered.<br><br>(B) WHERE<br>(1) The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a<br>woman<br>is<br>in the early morning, between 5:00a.m.    and 8:30a.m.<br><br>(2) The number one place women are abducted from/attacked at is<br>grocery store.<br><br>(3) Number two is office parking lots/garages.<br><br>(4) Number three is public restrooms/toilets.<br><br>The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman and<br>quickly move her to a second location     where they don't have to<br>worry<br>about getting caught. Only 2% said they carried weapons because rape<br>carries a 3-5 year sentence but rape with a weapon is 15-20 years.<br>If you put up any kind of a fight at all, they get discouraged because<br>it<br>only takes a minute or two for them to realize that going after you<br>isn't<br>worth it because it will be time-consuming.<br>These men said they would not pick on women who have umbrellas, or<br>other<br>similar objects that can be used from a distance, in their hands. Keys<br>are<br>not a deterrent because you have to get really close to the attacker to<br>use<br>them as a weapon. So, the idea is to convince these guys you're not<br>worth<br>it.<br><br>HOW ?<br>Several defense mechanisms he taught us are:<br>(1) If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage or<br>with<br>you in an elevator or stairwalk, look them in the face and ask them<br>questions like " what time is it? My friends are supposed to be here 10<br>minutes ago." etc. This is to show that your friends are on the way, so<br>it's not worth for him to take the risk. Secondly, it shows that you're<br>a<br>CONFIDENT person and you're not the type that look timid and can be<br>easily<br>take over. Thirdly, now you've seen their face and could identify them<br>in a<br>line-up if they are caught.<br>So, with this you lose appeal as a target to these rapists.<br><br>(2) If someone is coming toward you, hold out your hands in front of<br>you<br>and yell "Stop or Stay back!". Most of the rapists this man talked to<br>said<br>they'd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that she would not<br>be<br>afraid to fight back. Again, they are looking for an EASY target.<br><br>(3) If you carry pepper spray (this instructor was a huge advocate of<br>it<br>and he also carries pepper spray with him wherever he goes,) yell to<br>the<br>rapist: "I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY!!" and holding it out will be a deterrent.<br><br>(4) If someone grabs you, you can't beat them with strength but you can<br>by<br>outsmarting them. If you are grabbed around the waist from behind,<br>pinch<br>the attacker either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in<br>the<br>upper inner thigh - HARD.<br>This instructor was told by a woman in his class of defence, said that<br>she<br>used the underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her and<br>the<br>rapist was so upset as she broke through the skin and tore out muscle<br>strands!! - the guy needed stitches.<br>Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand it; it<br>hurts.<br><br>(5) If you slap a guy's parts it is extremely painful. You might think<br>that<br>you'll anger the guy and make him want to hurt you more, but the thing<br>these rapists told our instructor is that they want a woman who will<br>not<br>cause a lot of trouble.<br><br>(6) When the guy puts his hands up to you, grab his first two fingers<br>and<br>bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing down on<br>them as possible.<br>The instructor did it to me without using much pressure, and I ended up<br>on<br>my knees and both knuckles cracked audibly.<br><br>IN ALL CASES, DO NOT PANIC!!<br>By the way, it is also worth to leave scratched mark on the rapist any<br>part<br>of his body for easy identifcation if he is caught. Of course the<br>things<br>we<br>always hear still apply. Always be aware of your surroundings, take<br>someone<br>with you, eg to the toilet, to the car park, if possible if you can and<br>if<br>you see any odd behavior, don't dismiss it, go with your instincts. You<br>may<br>feel a little silly at the time, but you'd feel much worse if the guy<br>really was a trouble.<br><br>PLEASE READ THEN FORWARD THIS TO ANY WOMAN YOU KNOW, OR TO GUYS THAT<br>HAVE A<br>WIFE, DAUGHTER, OR GIRLFRIEND. AND TO YOUR SONS-AS YOUNGSTERS ARE NOW<br>TEMPTED BY THE WORLD AND THEY COULD BE LURED BY FRIENDS AND INVOLVE IN<br>DATE<br>RAPE/GANG RAPE. TEACH YOUR SONS/MEN TO RESPECT WOMEN. SO, PLSE SEND OUT<br>-<br>IT'S SIMPLE STUFF THAT COULD SAVE A LIFE.<br><br></div>
