            <div class='col-md body'>John invited his mother over for dinner.  During the meal his mother couldn't help noticing how beautiful John's roommate was.  She had long been suspicious of a relationship between John and his roommate and this only made her more curious.  Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between John and the roommate than met the eye.<br><br>Reading his mom's thoughts, John volunteered, "I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Julie and I are just roommates."<br><br>About a week later, Julie came to John and said, "Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the beautiful gravy ladle. You don't suppose she took it, do you?"<br><br>John said, "Well, I doubt it, but I'll write her a letter just to be sure."<br><br>So, he sat down and wrote, "Dear Mother, I'm not saying you 'did' take a gravy ladle from my house, and I'm not saying you 'did not' take a gravy ladle. But, the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner."<br><br>Several days later, John received a letter from his mother which read: "Dear Son, I'm not saying that you 'do' sleep with Julie, and I'm not saying that you 'do not' sleep with Julie.  But, the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle by now.<br><br>Love, Mom.<br><br>Lesson of the day:  Don't lie to your mother.<br><br>------------------<br>To luf someone is nothing, to be luf by someone is something, to be luf by the one you luf is everything.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Element Name: WOMAN<br>Symbol: WO<br>Atomic Weight: (don't even go there!)<br><br>Physical properties: Generally round in form.   Boils at nothing and may freeze any time.  Melts whenever treated properly.   Very bitter if not used well.<br><br>Chemical properties: Very active.  Highly unstable. Possesses strong affinity to gold, silver, platinum, and precious stones.   Violent when left alone.  Able to absorb great amounts of exotic food.   Turns slightly green when placed next to a better specimen.<br><br>Usage: Highly ornamental.  An extremely good catalyst for dispersion of wealth.  Probably the most powerful income reducing agent known.<br><br>Caution: Highly explosive in inexperienced hands.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Element Name: MAN<br>Symbol: XY<br>Atomic Weight: (180 +/- 50)<br><br>Physical properties: Solid at room temperature, but gets bent out of shape easily.  Fairly dense and sometimes flaky.   Difficult to find a pure sample.  Due to rust, aging samples are unable to conduct electricity as easily as young samples.<br><br>Chemical properties: Attempts to bond with WO any chance it can get.  Also tends to form strong bonds with itself.  Becomes explosive when mixed with Kd (Element: Child) for prolonged period of time. Neutralize by saturating with alcohol.<br><br>Usage: None known.  Possibly good methane source. Good samples are able to produce  large quantities on command.<br><br>Caution: In the absence of WO, this element rapidly decomposes and begins to smell.<br><br>------------------<br>To luf someone is nothing, to be luf by someone is something, to be luf by the one you luf is everything.....</div>
