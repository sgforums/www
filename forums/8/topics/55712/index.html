            <div class='col-md body'>Mars, the Roman god of war, was called Ares in Greece. Because the month of March was named after him, Romans believed that March was the season of wars. Juno, the wife of Jupiter,was the mother of Mars.<br>Flora, the goddess of flowering and blossoming plants, touched Juno with a magical herb and she became pregnant with Mars. Being the god of war, Mars was often angry and violent.<br><br>Mars had two sons, Romulus and Remus. They became the founders of Rome. That is why Mars was considered the ancestor of Romans. He was believed to help Romans in times of crisis.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mayans were sophisticated observers of the sky. Mayans used their astronomical knowledge to predict future human events. They were aware of the movements of Mars.<br>In one of the ancient Mayan books, the Dresden Codex, Mars is represented by a series of pictures of a long-nosed beast shown descending to varying depths from a sky band. This sky band is the segmented body of a sky serpent that hangs over the scene.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In Hindu mythology, the planet Mars is known as Mangala. Hindus believed in the existence of nine planets called Navagraha. The planet of Mars is identified with the war god Karttikeya, known also as Skanda. Karttikeya was born from six sparks that fell from the eyes of the god Siva into a lake near Madras. From the sparks, six children were created who were nursed by the Krttika, the Pleiades.<br>But once, Parvati , who was Siva's wife, embraced them all together with such affection that she squeezed them into one body , six heads, and twelve arms The newborn became the war god Karttikeya who is often depicted riding a peacock called Paravani and armed with a bow and arrow.<br><br>There are numerous accounts of Karttikeya's birth. Some hymns tell that he was the son of Siva and Parvati, whose union was brought about by the gods for the purpose of creating the god war who would defeat the rival of the gods: the demon monster Taraka. Karttikeya accomplished this task using a powerful lance, that had been forged from some of the shining rays of the Sun god Surya.<br><br>A variant of the legend tells that he was the son of the fire god Agni and the goddess Ganga, associated with the sacred River Ganges. Karttikeya is particularly popular in southern India. He is also associated with a particular month of the year called Karttika, which was believed to be the most appropriate for warfare.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
