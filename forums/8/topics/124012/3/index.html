            <div class='col-md body'>Hi. My very first post. I'll try to respond to your queries should you have any. okay.. first thing's first. one, I'll be entering year two in a few days time. I'm from SEG (School of Engineering). So if you wanna meet me up or something, feel free to contact me or whatever. and i guess there are a few rp students here as well. man.. some of these guys are giving the wrong ideas. i'll be correcting them below.<br><br>two, especially those already accepted by rp, rest assured you'll have a very enjoyable time in rp. and.. welcome to rp. =p<br><br>finally.. if your friend(s) says rp $uck$ or whatever, tell them to see me personally. lol.<br><br>kay here goes..<br><br><strong>one</strong><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by yayay:</div><div class="quote_body">Err only 1st year student got PBL learning or year 1 to 3 student all got PBL learning?I also heard year 1 student all take same modules regardless of which diploma..true anot ar?</div></blockquote>yes, that is somewhat true. in rp, we make use of pbl. as for the modules, yes, you take the same module(s) but only for elective modules.<br>engineering/IT/science students all take the same elective module EXCEPT for the core modules. there are 3 elective modules in year one if my memory serves me right.<br>for new media students, i have no idea how is it gonna be like. but i THINK the elective modules are mandatory for all courses/ schools.<br><br><strong>two</strong><br>regarding pbl. yes, pbl is about working in teams. (not "group". "group" and "team" are two different things.) you usually work in team of fives. okay... the good thing is, you get to split the tasks. this means, the job to accomplish will be much easier, more efficient and faster. there is this saying "two heads are better than one". in this case, there are five minds put at work doing the tasks together. so the quality of work done is much higher than doing alone. also, team mates can actually help one another. usually the first few days when you first meet everyone in the team abit quiet one.. but as time goes, the uh. natural things will happen.<br><br>next, attitude problem team mate(s). in pbl, there is this thing called 360 degrees evaluation. you evaluate your team mates and yourself at the end of the day. the facilitator too, will evaluate you. he/she doesnt contribute, just give him/her poor evaluation lor. else, dont be scared to approach the facilitator and request to change to another team or reshuffle team. probably the best solution for this one is to <span style="font-style: italic;">tekan</span> the person. all do it together. so he/she will feel pressurised. with a little bit of patience, the problematic team mate will eventually help out. these people do bear in mind that they do not want to have poor daily grades. so no matter what, they have to help out. but do try to talk things over or have ahhh heart-to-heart talk or something. over time, the person will change for sure. hey, it works for me!<br><br>"i dont like working with people". tsk tsk. pbl actually improves and increases your relation/ interaction/ communication skills with your peers which is very crucial when you go out there to work. out there, you may have to work with people. with poor relation skills, be prepared to get a scolding from your future boss.<br>difference between pbl and traditional lecture based system. basically in pbl, they dont spoon feed you. you go search for the knowledge. lecture based system you just relax one corner while notes are passed down and hear your lecturer talk and talk and talk one whole day. what is this...? so big already still act like a child.. pbl makes you independant. in future when you go out to work, especially for solo projects, you dont expect your boss/colleagues to help you, do you? also, unlike lecure based system, the knowledge you get is not restricted. example: today in class do about the topic on "weather". so today just cover on that particular topic. but in pbl right, we can go further than that. we dont just cover the main topic. we can also cover supporting/additional topics. it's all up to you whether you wanna learn more or learn just enough to cover the day's topic. of course, learning more than expected is a plus as it helps you for future topics as you already have some ideas in mind.<br><br><strong>three</strong><br>presentation: yes, in pbl you present what you have covered, understand, learned or point of view  with supporting details at the end of the day. usually it's done when your team mates are done compiling all the information.<br>one more thing i need to clarify, when it comes to the 6th presentation, i.e. facilitator's turn to present, it may not necesarrily means he/she is presenting the correct answer. pbl got no right or wrong one. everyone has their own beliefs/opinions/views/way of concept. the facilitator's job is basically to sum up what you have covered for the day and provide supporting evidences and information for you to think even further. after that, everyone have to do a quiz to show your level of understanding for the day's lesson.<br><br>"why rp has 1st and 2nd meeting one..?" to put it simply, the first meeting is to warm you up and focus of the day's topic. there is no right or wrong in the first meeting. everyone can just shoot his/her ideas. after the first meeting, teams are supposed to do research. as for the 2nd meeting, the facilitator will basically check whether you are on track or not, and ask everyone's ideas again based on what each student has covered.<br><br><strong>four</strong><br>regarding university applications: pbl is accepted in MANY popular univerisities. may it be abroad or local uni. if im not wrong, if you graduate from rp, you can advance to second year. i think it's the same thing for other polys also. but rp also has many links to many overseas universities. if you're good, you may advanced to third year in uni instead. this was reported in the papers some time back.<br>as for local unis right, the only pending (as in YET to be approved) uni is NUS. other than that, SMU/NTU/the rest accepts RP. but that doesnt mean rp is no good. it's still in the waiting list. we're quite new anyways.<br><br>okay. i think thats all about it. if you have any more queries, feel free to contact me or something... the best, visit <a href="http://www.rp.edu.sg/" rel="nofollow">republic poly website</a>. more info regarding the pbl approach here: (<a href="http://rp.edu.sg/about/pbl/index.asp" rel="nofollow">click</a>).<br><br>cheerios~</div>
