            <div class='col-md body'>To me there's nothing wrong in speaking Singlish so long as it's reserved for informal occasions such as conversations with friends, etc. Of course standard English has to be used for more formal affairs such as job interviews and meeting.<br><br>That said, the government's campaign to discourage Singlish is ill-advised. Period.<br><br>After all, Singlish is one of the very few things that give us an identity and make us truly Uniquely Singaporean. Sure, outsiders can't really understand us, but then again, Australians can have their own brand of English. American English is different from British. Heck, even the Brits have their own English dialects, so to speak (I'm not sure.... I think there's Geordie, Liverpudlian, etc, etc....)<br><br>The government should encourage standard English (aka Cambridge standard) among our students.... but at the same time, to equate Singlish to bad grammar is akin to robbing us of our cultural identity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing I find amusing is those 'announcers' whether in the library or whatnot. For some reason, some of them have to pronounce each word carefully, so much so, that each sentence comes out word by word as if there is a certain reluctance to say those words. And at the end, they seem to be out of breath. Why can't they just say it the way they want to, instead of torturing themselves?<br><br>And I think Singlish is ok. Even if we unintentional mix it in, we can easily correct it but not for accents. We can't ask them,"Sorry, can you speak in Standard accent English pls? What? You mean your government doesn't teach you Standard accent English?"</div>
