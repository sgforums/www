            <div class='col-md body'><br>I dont think miracles will help much to convince many people. There are still people who would not believe and try to explain that with "scientific reasons" such as a mirage or lighting refraction. But for sure if God allows such a miracle to appear, there must be an important reason, even if it is just to make only ONE person to believing, it is still important.<br><br>I remember when my faith was still little, I attended an exorcism in a church. The pastor was exorcising evil spirits from a girl, and the girl was like screaming and cursing away like lunatic. Everyone was trying to hold her down, but she was too strong.<br>Upon seeing this, I did not really believed.<br>I kept telling myself that the pastor and the girl were just puting on a show trying to get more "church members".<br><br>So in my opinion, miracle is not a correct way of making up the foundation of Faith.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, although I'm not a christian, I'd like to contribute my ideas. The thing is, the Bible states that no man has seen God's face:<br><br>John 1:18<br>No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared [him].<br><br>As the gospel of John so clearly states, we can only 'know' God through Jesus' ministry.<br><br>The Christian's belief extends to the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, which states that the Father (God as Creator), the Son (God as Savior) and the Spirit (God as Messenger) are one and the same entity. When Chistians in Indonesia say that they saw the apparition of Christ, they did not mean that they saw God Himself, but Jesus.<br><br>Jesus is the "human" incarnation of God, according to the Christians. As is found in the Bible, God regards Jesus as His only begotten son:<br><br>John 3:16<br>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.<br><br>In order to go to heaven, Christians must believe that God sent down his only Son to die for the sins of mankind.<br><br>Ephesians 2:8<br>For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God...<br><br>------------------<br>For a rollicking good time, come visit my homepage at: <a href="http://clik.to/pebble" rel="nofollow">http://clik.to/pebble</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, in response to rckong. It is clear from the gospel of John that God's face remains hidden from the eyes of men. While Islam (my faith), does not share certain points with Christianity, Muslims believe too that God's face is hidden. In the words of Karen Armstrong (a Catholic nun who left the ministry and became a religious commentator on the three faiths of Judaism, Christianity and Islam): "God is simply too awesome an experience!"<br><br>This can be easily discerned from the stories of the Prophets in the Biblical Old Testament. In one scene, God told the prophet Isaiah to hide behind a rock because he wanted to pass a vision to him. Isaiah petulently asked why he had to do that, and God replied, "You will go mad if your eyes even saw a small part of me"<br><br>In the book of Deutoronomy, when God appears to Moses on Mount Sinai to pass down the Ten Commandements, Moses experiences God as a "blinding light"...in some apocryphal (meaning works that are not considered official or "inspired") writings, Moses was said to have been blind when he descended from Mount Sinai.<br><br>Anyway, about the idea of Jesus being a temporary face for God. Think about this, the Hindus share an almost similar belief. Like the Christians, they too have a Trinity consisting of Bram'ha (the Creator), Vishnu (the Sustainer) and Shiva (the Destroyer).<br><br>In Hinduism, Vishnu is said to have sent down an incarnation, or an avatar, to earth. This incarnation's name is Rama.<br><br>In hindu temples, you'll find the faces of these entities reflected on the idols. Similarly, you'll find plenty of statues of Christ in Catholic churches too.<br><br>The idea of a "temporary face" is somewhat moot, don't you think?<br><br>[This message has been edited by salivateforme (edited 27 September 2001).]</div>
