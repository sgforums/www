To save all the trouble of going to make police report, angry that you got molested, mentally being hurt. Stay home. By going there, you are already show that you accepted having the risk of being molest in any kind of ways.<br><br>Just like girls who like to wear short skirt or over exposed clothes and dont like the feeling of guys constantly looking at them. You yourself in the first place do something that attracts people's attention first, now you got it, why complain?<br><br>Girls... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>About anti-bangalas thread, ask yourself for those who dislike them. Are you willing to do what they are doing? Road sweeper, construction workers, Waste cleaner etc that the bangalas are doing. By saying this, it doesn't mean I support what they did that cause so much trouble. I just want to say that there are good, friendly bangalas and what you see is just some minorities. Even if you can accept the job they are doing, how many other Singaporean can?</div>

My friends and i deliberately avoided the crowds and went walking the back route behind taka and wisma.<br><br>Banning aerosol cans will not solve opportunists from molesting girls.
