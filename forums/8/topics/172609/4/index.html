            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, the problem can be easily solved if they offer a reward to those who help stop a crime taking place.. Haha<br><br>Seriously, if every one of us have the courage and civic mindness to help one another, I guess there will not be a problem. How many of us actually witness a molest that took place there and went up to help the victim?<br><br>We just remain as indifferent gawkers and maintain the Singaporean attitude ie "If it's not my problem, I shudn't care."<br><br>Crowds not exactly my favourite kinda place, so I always avoid such places.<br><br>Girls, you understand the situation that will take place in such an event, there's no water tight preventive measures. So, all you have to do is well dress a little more, short skirts aren't exactly an ideal choice in a situation.<br><br>Yes, you may say that girls are allowed to dress how they want, the fault falls entirely on the assiliant. Think about it, would leave your house unlock and go for a holiday? I'm not saying you girls are asking for it. Just keep in mind that not everyone is a good person..</div>
