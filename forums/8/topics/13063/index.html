            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, from what i c, there's nothing wrong and right for singaporean girl to be like tat. The only thing that make it wrong is the society. For the ger as an individual in her mindset, there's nothing wrong at all to be a modern highly educated, high demand female. The only thing that make something seem wrong is when there's alot of single high educated sg woman in singapore when viewed by a human-resource hungry society esp like singapore. It's an era where the girl is choosing the guy now in singapore. Wat can the guy population do when they cannot satisfy the ger's demand?? As i had pointed, nothing is wrong with these female. It's their choice, It's everyone's own choice. That's why we have sg guy getting oversea wife and sg girl getting oversea hubby.<br><br>Peeling prawn for me to eat? Normally i eat the whole thing. However, my wife is expert with peeling prawn using forks and spoon. Being lazy, just din bother to go and learn.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 09 January 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FIRST, the ARTICLE... A POINTLESS sense of WRITING... Over a debate which have gone by over centuries... The only DIFFERENCE? TIME has CHANGED....<br><br>What makes the Singaporean women who they are today? Personally, I think it's MEN, the SOCIETY followed by 'INTERNET' (or rather interaction at the INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.... What makes Singaporean MEN who they are today? The 3 qualities mentioned above and replace the MEN with WOMEN....<br><br>SINGAPOREAN WOMEN today are MOSTLY INDEPENDENT and STRONG... MAIN REASON? The SOCIETY and WORLD SHAPED them to be so.... Women SUPPOSINGLY (not all, but by 'default'...) emotional creatures... FACED with STRESS and DEMANDS in life... Have sort been holding a 'SUPRESSED' feelings... Some just naturally ACCEPTED and got USED to it.... With the ACCEPTANCE of a STRONG SINGAPOREAN WOMEN IMAGE at INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.... MOST slowly SHAPED towards the TREND.... Of GREAT ACCEPTANCE...<br><br>SINGAPOREAN GUYS? When you can't reach for the TOP, reach for the bottom... SAME INTERNATIONAL ACCEPTANCE principle.... I still REMEMBER my good old primary school days... Teachers like to compare the results of the TOP MALE and FEMALE students in the CLASS... The PRESSURE is ON... Because you're competing with your OPPOSITE SEX... And to MEN? SUPPOSINGLY the 'weaker' sex.... EGO... EVEN GREATER PRESSURE arises... When Singaporean women are not longer the 'weaker sex'.... YET, Singaporean Women still holds MANY previledges they used to have... For Singapore Men? FRUSTRATIONS? It's a COMPETITION... Either you're IN or you're OUT.... Singapore Women faces the EQUAL 'frustrations' as the Singaporean MEN's FRUSTRATIONS build up... Being treated UNFAIRLY at work and in life... The RESULT? A HEATED UP SEALED-TIGHT COOKER with no ALTERNATIVES.... SOCIETY PROBLEM... People move along... Either you FOLLOW or you don't...? Either you KEEP UP, or you FALL...?<br><br>COMPETITION... NATURAL SELECTION... SOCIETY's TRICK.... SOCIETY's PLOT.... <span style="font-style: italic;">To reach for the HIGHER SKY....</span> EITHER you're IN.... OR you're OUT...?<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH. FOR YOU ARE MY 'ENEMY'.<br>DEVIL PHRASE I<br><br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....  DEVIL PHRASE II<br><br>Though NOT the RIGHT thing to do,<br>This might be the ONLY NATURAL thing to be...<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Just like heat</span> is produced when work done...<br><span style="font-style: italic;">EVIL</span> is the GENERATION of SYSTEM FLAWS... <strong>DEVIL PHRASE III</strong><br><br>In DREAMS you CAN NEVER DIE.....<br>For YOUR LIFE is about the EXISTENCE of....<br>Your Happiness.... Your Sadness... Your Pain.... Your Pleasure....<br>Like a painted sky, when it rains... All CEASE to BE...    DEVIL PHRASE IV<br><br>When Law &amp; Rules are there,<br>they are NOT about JUSTICE.<br>While reality &amp; dreams are there,<br>they are NOT about SURVIVAL..<br><br>And Life &amp; Death NOT about LIVING...<br>Good &amp; Evil NOT about definitions....<br><br>IF truly there is EVIL, it is NOT just one of its kind......<br><br>DEVIL'S SEVENTH PHRASE<br><br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....<br><br>[This message has been edited by Devil1976 (edited 09 January 2002).]</div>
