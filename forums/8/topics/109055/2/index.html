Those 2 A bombs, plus the firebombing of Tokyo, are no better to Hitler's Luftwaffe &amp; V2 attacks on London. In fact, had Hitler not changed the Luftwaffe's target to London, the Brits might have lost the Battle of Britain because the RAF was starting to feel the strain. By switching to attacking London instead of military objectives, Hitler had unknowingly, in fact, given the RAF the breathing space they needed, to resupply, rearm, reinforce!</div>

Ramsay was the one who yelled at Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, the 1st Sea Lord, for withdrawing the Royal Navy's destroyers. Destroyers could take on men more quickly than any other ship but Sir Dudley was worried they might be destroyed. Ramsay got on the phone and yelled at Pound till Pond agreed to order the destroyers back to Dunkirk immediately, which was one of the factors in prevent the capture of much of the BEF.</div>

Winston Churchill only got sworn in on May 10, while the whole chain of events leading up to the defeat of the BEF n the downfall of France was already happening b4 he was prime minister. I'd say in fact, Lord Chamberlain(the PM b4 winston right?) was responsible.</div>

Examples:<br><br>1. What if Hitler never came to power? Would the Allies have to face Stalin instead?<br><br>2. What if Pearl Harbor never happened? Could the Allies still have won the war without the Americans?<br><br>3. What if Hitler never invaded Russia? Would the Cold War have happened?<br><br>So many ifs.... we'll never know the outcome.</div>
