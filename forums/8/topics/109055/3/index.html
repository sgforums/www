Pardon me if i seem absurd to bring up such a topic at this yuletide season, but i had recently read some books on it and i think i should  share some of the horrible acts the germans had acted upon the jews..... to remind ourselves that peace should not be taken for granted.<br><br>the germans and the nazis as led by hitler consider jews as inferior race , and consider them even lower class than dogs. as such, they wanted to get rid of all the jews in what was called the ' Final Solution' . I am terrified to learn of the way which they 'slaughter' the jews -- millions of them. the jews are brought to Death camps in Auschwitz, Poland via train which was originally used to transport cows. upon arrival at this death camps, immediately, people are separated into 2 queues -- one consisting of the young,&lt; 15 yrs old, the elderly, pregnant, women with children while the other consist of able -bodied men and women with useful trade. The former group will be immediately gassed to death , and the procedure which they do this is inhumane. firstly all their belongings are taken away from them. then all of them will be required to strip naked, while they were deceivingly told that they had to go take shower to cleanse themselves before being transported to elsewhere. a few hundreds of jewish children, elderly, women, pregnant women are being brought into buildings which even had fake shower heads attached. they are then locked inside, and cyanide pellets were then released from the ceiling in to the cramped showering area. immediately, the people died... and more people struggled as they were asphyxiated. within 20-25 mins , the germans job was done. all the jews were exterminated.<br><br>next came the removal of bodies ... their hairs were all removed and gold dentures all extracted first. apparently the jewish hairs were used to make cotton socks for the german soldiers. the bodies were then carried to the crematoriums and burned. up to 8000 jews are gassed and cremated in a death camp daily........<br><br>and the most amazing thing is that the germans were treating it like a production factory job, with the aim in mind of getting rid of all the jews.<br><br>there were many more instances of atrocities  which i didnt mention here.<br><br>any views?<br></div></blockquote>well dude, open up your narrow mind and read more..cause other more barbaric people did stuff much worse than that. alexander the great murdeed all males in the cities he conquered. those damned japs butchered much more chinese than the germans did with the jews and we dont complain and bitch. so screw those damn jews its time they got over it.</div>
