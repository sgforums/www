Love has its own time, its own seasons, and its own reason for coming and going. You cannot bribe it or coerce it, or reason it into saying. You can only embrace it when it arrives and give it away when it comes to you.<br><br>But if it chooses to leave from your heart or from the heart of your lover, there is nothing you can do and there is nothing you should do.

            <div class='col-md body'>no matter how hard i try to talk to the girl i like, she always leave me heartbroken but i've forgiven her each and every time. her replies to my messages are as if she does not take them seriously. whenever i wanted to talk to her, she will be with her group of friends chatting away, leaving me all alone. honestly, i only knew her for not a long time but i grew to like her because of her lively character, the way she carries herself and her looks although it's not that incridible. day after day, i'll be waiting for her outside the lecture halls just to have a chance to talk to her but to no avail. i rather choose to do this than meeting my friends for a basketball game. and after she left the school, i'll be sending her messages only to receive a few meaningless replies. i can't stand this crap anymore. all i want is a chance to know each other better. i have sacrificed a lot of time and effort for this girl i like and all i got is nothing.  now i've lost interest in anything else in my life. completely given up a game that i used to indulge myself playing it a few months ago, not as enthusiastic in basketball and in lessons. nothing the lecturer says gets into my head.i even experience a loss of appetite now. i've been trying hard to not to get anyone else involved by keeping this a secret but it so happens that one of my friends found out today. i hate what i'm going through now and i want her to at least give me a chance to get to know her better. i'm treating her so well and i'm sure she knows that.. so she might think i'm interested in her and thus avoid me for this reason. i really don't know what to do right now.. my life is so screwed up. is all i do worth it for someone who probably doesn't even care about what i do? each time i see her, i feel happy and at the same time heartbroken about how she treats me. i'm willing to give up almost anything just for this girl to give me a chance. should i just go forward and tell her about my feelings? or what should i do?</div>

Things cannot be forced. Dun make ur own self so miserable.<br><br>Personally, the way u conduct urself n continuously looking her up can be intimidating and probably scary. Possibly bordering maybe.

End up you will start to do really stupid things and lose focus one the more important aspect of life.<br><br>I never believe in one sided love. Cos you end up torturing yourself with a feeling that demands something out of somebody , which is something you will never recieve.<br><br>So take it from me, stop focusing on the girl. It is hard, but if many other forumites here can do it, i am sure you can.<br><br>Start by ignoring the feelings. If it comes, condemn it and focus on something else. Soon you will realise that it slowly dissapears.<br><br></div>

There is nothing wrong with you. Love just didn't choose to rest in the other person's heart.<br><br>If you find someone else in love with you and you don't love her/him, feel honoured that love came and called at your door, but gently refuse the gift you cannot return. Do not take advantage, do not cause pain.<br><br>How you deal with love is how you deal with you, and all our hearts feel the same pains and joys, even if our lives and ways are different.<br><br>If you fall in love with another, and she falls in love with you, and then love chooses to leave, do not try to reclaim it or to assess blame, Let it go. There is a reason and there is a meaning. You will know in time.<br><br>Remember that you don't choose love. Love chooses you. All you can really do is accept it for all its mystery when it comes into your life. Feel the way it fills you to overflowing, then reach out and give it away.<br><br>Give it back to the person who brought it alive in you.<br>Give it to others who deem it poor in spirit.<br>Give it to the world around you in anyway you can.<br><br>This is where many lovers go wrong. Having been so long without love, they understand love only as a need. They see their hearts as empty places that will be filled by love, and they begin to look at love as something that flows to them rather than from them.<br><br>The first blush of new love is filled to overflowing, but as their love cools, they revert to seeing their love as need.
