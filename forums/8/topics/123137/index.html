            <div class='col-md body'>Hi!<br><br>It would be easier if you point a direction for us to go.....like tell us how long you'd be there, when you'll be there and where you'll be staying.<br><br>Basically....<br><br>Locally-made stuffs are cheap.  Like nice T-shirts at MahBoonKhrong Centre (at Siam Square area) going for 99 baht (S$4) each.  But the quality is not always good and you can tell after a few washes.  Shorts are also cheap too, at S$4 a pair too.<br><br>For women, there's lots of locally-made underwear like Wacoal (manufactured under licence) sold at the department stores like Tokyu, Isetan, etc.  They're half the price compared to here.  But they come only in Thai sizes, which seems to be smaller than Singaporean sizes.  If you wanna go to the roadside shops to buy no-brand underwears (for those use and throw occasions), it even cheaper....and some in funny colours like dark purple, maroon, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>At some department stores like Tokyu, Central, etc...you can find cheap branded sports goods.  Like Adidas, Umbro shorts selling at S$7-8 per pair.<br><br>There are lots of fake goods too, but I wouldn't recommend buy them.  If people know, very paiseh.<br><br>When going for massage, remember to ask for "ancient massage" or "traditional massage".  This will be around 150-300 baht (S$6-12) per hour.  It depends on which shop, whether you massage at the shop or in your room, etc.  Usually, they would recommend 2 hours at a go.<br><br>If you're charged higher than 300 baht per hour, be very suspicious.  Either you're being cheated, are getting hotel tourist prices....or getting a dirty massage.  It would be nice if you specified "massage <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lady</span>" too, just to be safe.<br><br>The spas are mainly located in the good hotels (Banyan Tree Hotel, Pathumwan Princess Hotel, etc).  They are not that cheap, but cheaper than Bintan or Singapore.  As usual, service is Thai style - very friendly and makes you feel like a queen.  Unless you really love spas, I think going for the normal massage is enough.  Spas are usually S$100-200 per session, depending on what session you take (1-3 hours).<br><br>I assume you're going on one of those 3-day trips, which means you won't have much time to do anything else if you're going massaging and a bit of shopping.  Food is good and cheap, but hard to recommend....unless we know what kind of food you like.<br><br>Are you interested in religion, history, culture, sports and sightseeing?<br><br>Aiyah, I want to write more, but the dye on my hair is reaching 30 minutes liow...gotta go rinse off now.  Sorry...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Steph,<br><br>Very boring in the office today leh, so I'll continue my travel guide....<br><br>I assume you're going on a 3-day free and easy package, which actually leaves you one day in Bangkok itself because the other two days will be used for flying in and out.  This will also mean that flights, hotels and airport transfers will be taken care of, which is good if its your first time.<br><br>HOTELS<br><br>- Pathumwan Princess (lots of Singaporeans).  They'll be a bit more expensive, but its worth it because you'll save lots of time.<br><br>- Asia Hotel is cheap and just out of the city centre (lots of Singaporeans).<br><br>- Siam Novotel (mainly Japanese and English clientele) is also a good choice.<br><br>All the above hotels have a Skytrain (overhead subway) station just next to them.<br><br>SHOPPING<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">National Stadium Station</span><br>- Mahboonkhrong, which has Tokyu and many other shops in it (my fav.).<br>- Discovery Centre, a very high-end shopping centre with branded goods.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Siam Station</span><br>- Siam Square itself, with lots of small shops (shop house type).<br>- Siam Centre, next to Discovery Centre, with middle range type shops.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chit Lom Station</span><br>- Sogo, don't go there....small and boring.<br>- Gaysorn Plaza, don't go there unless you're a millionaire.<br>- World Trade Centre, now called Central World Plaza, with Zen and Isetan - good.<br>- Central Department Store, the biggest branch is there, with a Marche/Movenpick (or whatever) type food court on the top floor - good.<br><br>The above 3 stations are within walking distance from one another (about 20-25 minutes walk from one end to the other).<br><br>SHOPPING - OTHER AREAS<br><br>I can't recommend too many other places because you don't have time.  One place which you can go to at night is the Silom/Lumpini Park area (which is near Siam Square).  Don't go there in the daytime and don't take cabs there because the traffic there is horrible (Thais call it the "Rama 4 traffic").<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Skytrain Station:  Sala Daeng</span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MRT (underground) station:  Silom</span><br><br>- Patpong, the infamous red-light district with its night market.  More expensive than other places.  Just look and don't buy.  Don't even bother to bargain.  Only robot tourists buy things from there.  You will see no Thais here.<br><br>- Silom Plaza, with a branch of Central Department Store in there.  Lots of sports goods on the top floor.<br><br>- Robinsons, with a Movenpick/Marche (whatever) type food court on top.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MRT (underground station):  Lumpini</span><br>(Only one stop away from Silom MRT station).<br><br>- Suan Lum night bazaar, with a big open-air hawker centre with free song/dance performances.  Pronounced in Thai as "Soon Loom".  Sells everything from clothes to bags to souvenirs, but don't shop here....very expensive (for dumb people only, you will see no Thai shoppers here).  Not very lively too, except for the hawker centre.  Some nice and affordable restaurants (S$5-20 per head) are here.<br><br>- Lumpini Thai Boxing stadium is just there, next to Suan Lum bazaar.  Its only open on certain nights and on weekend afternoons (matinee fights).  Only if you're interested in such things.<br><br>- The TRSC lasik centre (eye surgery) is midpoint in between Silom and Lumpini stations.  I'm mentioning this because I've seen some threads here where people were talking about lasik surgery.<br><br>OTHER AREAS<br><br>I don't recommend these areas, although they may be slightly cheaper than all the above....<br><br>- Chaktuchak weekend market at Mo Chit station.  Only opened on weekends, day time.  Very hot and stuffy.  Bird-flu prone too, as they also sell live poultry and animals.  Sells everything, from clothes, bags, to dogs and snakes.  You can order a baffalo if you want too - just give them some time for delivery.<br><br>- Pratunam market.  Where the tallest hotel, Sky Baiyoke is.  Very hot and stuffy, not worth going.  Sells everything from clothes to bags, etc....but only slightly cheaper than Siam Square area.<br><br>- Kaosarn Road, Banglampoo area.  Nice, backpackers area.  Expensive stuff, but with nice atmosphere.  Sells everything - clothings, bags, etc.  No subway station and quite far from city centre.  Nice place for a drink at night.  Can get a bit wild, so be careful.  I used to live here, on and off.<br><br>- Victory Monument (Victory Monument Skytrain station).  Has some night market type shops around the monument itself, which sell at rather cheap prices (t-shirts for 70 baht, or S$3)....but not really worth going all the way for it.  Not a very lively place, sells mainly clothes and bags.<br><br>- Future Park, and Fashion Island, both at the Rangsit area.  This is actually outside Bangkok, near the airport.  Very nice places, with huge department stores (Big C, TOPS, Central, etc.) and prices generally much lower than Bangkok itself (sometimes even up to 50% less).  But only if you have time (eg. if you decide to extend your trip and intend to shop a lot).<br><br>Bangkok has two subway systems:  MRT (underground) and Skytrain (above ground).  These two stations cross each other at two points only - Silom (Patpong area) and Mo Chit station (Chaktuchak weekend market area).<br><br>Not everything in Bangkok is cheaper than Singapore.  Electronics and some other imported goods are much more expensive - from 20-50% more.  This is because they have high import taxes for "luxury items". Chocolates, suitcases, handphones are some examples.  Their GST is 7% (they call it VAT or "government tax").  If you buy a lot (more than 5000 baht in a day), you can claim back this GST amount when you leave Thailand.<br><br>The best way to judge if a place has tourist prices is to see whether there are any Thais shopping there.  The Thais themselves know which places to avoid.<br><br>Er...by the way, I'm a guy.....but I know a bit about ladies underwear lah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Next time I'll tell you about food and massage ok?  My boss is looking at me now....I have to go.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Steph84:</div><div class="quote_body">Wad are the preferred hotels in Bangkok??? </div></blockquote>For a 3-day trip, location and convenience are first considerations.  Following this, the two which I tend to recommend first are:<br><br>Pathumwan Princess (my first choice everytime) - right in the middle of city centre, very very convenient, with SkyTrain station next to it (National Stadium station), a bit expensive, nice hotel, many Singaporeans. <a href="http://www.pprincess.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pprincess.com</a><br><br>Asia Hotel - one stop away from city centre, SkyTrain station next to it (Ratchathewi station), cheap, run-down, many Singaporeans. <a href="http://www.asiahotel.co.th/bangkok.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.asiahotel.co.th/bangkok.htm</a><br><br>Your travel agent should have the above two hotels in their list as options.<br><br>Another convenient hotel in city centre (1 minute walk from Siam station) is the Siam Novotel.  Same price and almost same location as Pathumwan Princess, but the facilities are not so good...and a bit more run down too.  Mainly Japanese and British clientele. <a href="http://www.novotel.com/novotel/fichehotel/gb/nov/1031/fiche_hotel.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.novotel.com/novotel/fichehotel/gb/nov/1031/fiche_hotel.shtml</a><br><br>Of course there are many choices, from different locations and price ranges....but I would say try the above 3 first lah.<br><br></div>
