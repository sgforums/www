It is  job creator.<br><br>And look here you freak, why don't you read up more before you go around with you baseless criticism.<br>And thirdly, as i have mentioned above, i find you a totally repulsive character.What mekes you think you are an angel then?<br>A person, even with a perfect body, but with a mind like yours, should be considered a freak of nature and an outcaste of the human race.<br>Freak in the sense that you can't even think rationally.<br>If this operation had succeeded, it would benefit both the twins and our economy.More companies would have been interested in investing in us, and hence create more jobs in the bio medical hub.And on the other hand, it would give this two individuals a right to live as a normal human being.<br>It was just a gamble that we are trying to make.<br>Self centered idiots.You criticise for the sake of criticising and miss out the whole picture.I really dispise you all.</div>

HECK! if i had money, i would have much prefered to give it to a friend in financial difficulty.

So quite harping about the 500k, if we sould predict the outcome of the operation we would all be freaking millionaires. The operation got botched so tats the end of that, and if 500k was spent to find that out well thats too bad.</div>

Now you have shown your true intentions and nature, there it is.<br><br>So there, if you can't pratice what you preach, I think I speak for everyone here when I think you should shut up and do more thinking instead of yapping like a those noisy and aggressive but yet utterly impotent, small, pint size toy dogs they like to dress up in tutu dresses.<br><br>Thank you and have a nice days.</div>
