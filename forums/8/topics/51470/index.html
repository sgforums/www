I dun think that when they are doing the OP, FAME was in their mind. I think they wanted the surgery to succeed too. I dun think the doctors are thinking "Oh shucks, they died, there goes my fame." They are one of the saddest people....high hopes placed on them but yet they failed. Imagine the pressure you have when a whole nation and two lives are being put into your hands. I dun think they feel good at all and FAME is the last thing on their minds.  Maybe as a CORPORATE ENTITY, Raffles, had a secret agenda, but the DOCTORS must be saluted for they almost succeeded and gave the sisters a new life.</div>
