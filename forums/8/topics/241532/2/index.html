            <div class='col-md body'>The aunty's attitude sucked.  she should have at least checked to see if the person was hurt.  Anyway she probably couldn't have claimed insurance cos the cost of repairing the damage would have been less than the excess on her insurance.<br><br>Anyhow, pedestrians really should take care of their own safety.  If they're not going to be bothered to they can't expect drivers to do so on their behalf.  Most drivers would agree that irresponsible pedestrians make driving even more hazardous than it already is.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Objectively speaking...<br><br>Your story can't be taken as it is. It's one man's word against another. Since the victim is a friend, the tendency is for you to incline it as such.<br><br>Secondly, what is your idea of speeding? I doubt the Auntie was speeding. If he is still alive, then it's obvious she's driving at less than 60kmh (which is the legal limit on the road). IF you read up sufficiently, you'll realise that anything pass the speed of 50kmh, would already have resulted in your friend getting serious injuries. At speeds of 80kmh, he would probably have died.<br><br>So, I think it's best if you could advise your friends to wise-up and stop blaming the world for their pathetic behaviour.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think TS friend is really at fault here. Firstly, Jaywalk is wrong. School zone got so many zebra /  red light crossing but must jaywalk and never even check.<br><br>2ndly, I really don't think the driver is speeding. What is your definition of speeding. If is really speeding and bang your friend, then I don't think your friend is there to tell you the story.<br><br>As a driver, I really don't like people jumping out in the middle of the road. As a pedestrian, I don't really like reckless driver with poor attitude. At the end of the day though, is the one who kena bang lose out.<br><br>Yest I drive drive down orchard and so many people try to jaywalk. Stop in the middle of the road some more. I really don't know whether to stop anot. They like want to cross but don't know hesitate for what. Next time I just continue at my speed liao, heck care them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I will hold the opinion that the driver is at fault.<br>The driver has a duty to drive carefully, everytime in every situation. Especialy so at a school zone.<br>Therefore she should be on a look out for students who "anyhow run across road".<br>It is not as if the friend's friend suddenly appeared on the road. The driver should have been looking ahead, and should see the student at the road side, and be alerted. Instead she continued as if she owned the road because she paid through her nose for the car. That's why she is more concern for ther mirrors than for the student she knock down. Her idea of driving: she has the right of way, therefore anyone, or anything in the way, she just run over.<br><br>All drivers have a duty of care. They must be aware of what can happen and drive accordingly. And not just step on the accelerator, and sorry to anyone who "anyhow run across road'.<br>At the most lenient, the fault ratio,  80:20, driver:victim.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's simple for people who ain't behind the wheel to say that it's the driver's fault.Yes it is wrong of the driver to knock down a pedestrian and trying to claim compensation instead of helping them.<br><br>However there are also other factors to look out for other than those potential jaywalkers and those who cross the roads as though their father owns it,like other vehicles on the road and those $@%@! motorcyclist.<br><br>This reminds me of driving at Tampines mall where those morons always dash across the road when it's red man or just jaywalk.Have to honk my way through them to get the message across!<br><br>Like the others said,it's pretty dumb to cross the road without looking left and right.At this point of time,both parties are at fault.One for jaywalking and the other for knocking TS friend down.</div>
