            <div class='col-md body'>POP star Shakira may get you grooving on the dance floor with her hip-shaking, waist-twisting antics.<br><br>Australian belly dancer Laziza Layal. --Pics/CHRIS HUZZARD,SEDA JURIN,DAVID CHONG, PYRAMID DANCERS<br>But you ain't seen nothing yet.<br><br>Come 19 Aug, the second Singapore Belly Dancing Festival will showcase some of the hottest dancers from Turkey, Italy, Singapore and Australia, at the Peninsular Excelsior Hotel.<br><br>It will be more than just a navel-gazing experience. Or a torso-bearing gig, organiser Samra El Said told The New Paper.<br><br>'Belly dancing is not just shaking your booty like J-Lo,' she said.<br><br>'It is a cultural dance, but not without its commercial appeal.'<br><br>And the pictures say it all.<br><br>The dancers are drop-dead gorgeous with bodies to kill for.<br><br>Belly nice, you say.<br><br>It may seem easy. The provocative motion gives us the impression that, hey, if Britney Spears can do it, I can too.<br><br>Italian dancer Rose.<br>But the craft involves more workout than just grooving around, explained Ms Samra, who also runs Pyramid Dancer, a belly dancing workshop along Arab Street.<br><br>'It takes hours of practice to coordinate body movements to the music,' added Australian dancer Laziza Layal, 34.<br><br>Wait till you see these women in action.<br><br>As the lights dim and the mesmerising sound of Turkish music fills the room, local dancer Norina Hall, 23, floats in wearing a turquoise midriff and breezy pants, along with a matching beaded headdress, ankle bangles and hip wraps adorned with gold coins.<br><br>Her smoky eyes and long mane hint of seduction as she sways her torso, her bare feet tapping to the pulsating music.<br><br>As the rhythm intensifies, she removes her veil elegantly and whips it behind her back.<br><br>She gazes intently at the audience while she snaps her hips from side to side, to the earthy drum beats before sliding across the floor in front of a seated crowd.<br><br>It is like a scene from Arabian Nights.<br><br>Local belly dancer Norina Hall, 23.<br>MULTI-PURPOSE DANCE<br><br>Belly dancing, said an Italian dancer who wanted to be known only by her stage name, Rose, 38, started as a woman's dance to celebrate femininity.<br><br>It dates back to as far as 4,000 BC.<br><br>Today, it is a dance for everyone, added Seda Jurin, 35, who is a popular belly dancer in Istanbul, Turkey.<br><br>She said: 'It's not always a solo female performance. The audience plays a part too. We teach them how to do it and invite them to join us for a dance. Kids enjoy it too.'<br><br>Besides its entertainment value, many are turning to belly dancing as a form of exercise.<br><br>The movements help to relief tension and stress. After a session, you feel relaxed, the dancers said.<br><br>Turkish belly dancer Seda Jurin.<br>In the ancient days, belly dancing was practised to prepare for childbirth as yoga is today. It also helps to shed those post-natal pounds.<br><br>Laziza and Seda are living proof.<br><br>Both are yummy mummies. Laziza has three children aged 8, 4 and 2 while Seda has a 6-year-old daughter.<br><br>'You stretch all your muscles in a 30-minute session. It burns calories and keeps you fit. Look at my tummy!' said Laziza who has been performing for 12 years.<br><br>Though the Oriental dance has taken many forms in the West, purists of the craft scoff at suggestions that it is nothing more than a dance of seduction.<br><br>Or a bedroom skill.<br><br>So will the festival lure a room full of testosterone-driven men?<br><br>There is an element of sensuality, acknowledged Samra who has been teaching belly dancing for more than 20 years. But it also depends on how the audience perceive the art.<br><br>She said: 'Belly dancing has evolved through different cultures over the centuries. But the principle hasn't changed.<br><br>'The dance is synchronised to the rhythm and the dancer uses her body to keep up the pace.<br><br>'The sharp movements follow the rhythm of the drum, while the fluid moves go with the melody of the flute.'<br><br>She added, with a laugh: 'If the girls are beautiful, you can't blame the guys for ogling them, right?'<br><br>TIPS AND PICK-UP LINES<br><br>'Sometimes the guys want to tip us,' added Norina.<br><br>'Other times, they hang around after the performance to try and get our numbers. The best way of showing appreciation is to come back to watch our performance.'<br><br>With their hourglass figures (nothing less than a C-cup), they do make the men go wow.<br><br>And women go green with envy.<br><br>But Laziza, Rose, Norina and Seda were quick to add that they have the same insecurities as other women.<br><br>The profession, they said, comes with high expectations from those who engage their services as well as the audience.<br><br>Physical attributes are important. And makeup, hair-colour and a beauty regime are tricks to looking good.<br><br>'We don't wake up looking like Cindy Crawford, you know,' said Norina, who is of Indian and Australian descent.<br><br>'While belly dancing does help us to stay in shape, we watch what we eat too.'<br><br>Now, who wants to pay to watch a beer-bellied woman dancing?<br><br>Some dancers like Rose have a strict exercise regime. Hence, her toned figure.<br><br>It is also no secret in the industry that some dancers go under the knife for bigger breasts and flatter tummies to squash criticism and stay ahead of competition.<br><br>TOO SKINNY, TOO PLUMP<br><br>'In Australia, it doesn't matter if you're a blond or a brunette. The audience prefers a dancer who is not too skinny or plump,' said Laziza.<br><br>'Someone once told me I was too thin to be a belly dancer. It is a constant battle for me to keep some fat to appease the audience. And long hair is a must.'<br><br>In Turkey, Middle-Eastern belly dancers are in demand because of their exotic looks.<br><br>'Belly dancing has also taken a whole new concept,' said Seda who is the forth generation of belly dancers in her family.<br><br>'The dancer must know how to perform in a cabaret show - big stage, bright lights - other than a club or restaurant setting.'<br><br>So what can we expect from the festival?<br><br>Nothing less than a scintillating performance, said organiser Samra, who forked out $10,000 for the gig.<br><br>'Two male dancers will take to the stage too. This way, the female audience won't feel left out,' she added with a laugh.<br><br>SHOW INFO<br><br>WHAT: Singapore Belly Dancing Festival 2006<br>WHEN: 19 Aug<br>WHERE: Peninsula Excelsior Hotel, Grand Ballroom, 7pm till late.<br>TICKETS: $55 (available at Pyramid Dancer, 38 Arab Street, call 6396-7598 or e-mail pyramid.dancer@gmail.com<br><br>NOT I promoting one hor hahaha....</div>
