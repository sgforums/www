            <div class='col-md body'>basically the doors are suppose to open back when they hit something. how true this is i don't know. i never trusted the stupid thing when the door didnt stop during the new years eve of year 2000, when the whole orchard mrt was packed.<br><br>although once i saw this sch girl, rushing for the train, then she couldn't make it so while the doors were closing, she stuck her hands in between the door and they opened again, then she went in.<br><br>you notice how when the mrt door closes, it stops at a certain point first for about a second or two, then it fully closes? i think it is during that point, that if the door cannot close properly, the doors will open back. if you stick your finger in between i dont know whats gonna happen...lol. good luck to whoever tries that.<br><br>but the mechanism was flawed definately, since the doors didnt stop after it bumped into the stroller. thats why i never trusted the damn thing....lol<br><br>they should have a second safety system or whatever, in case the first one screwed up. like the freaking mrt shouldnt even move if the doors arnt closed properly.</div>
