            <div class='col-md body'>True story, I was happy. My girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married. My parents helped us in every way, my friends encouraged me, and my girlfriend? She was a dream! There was only one thing bothering me, very much indeed, and that one thing was her younger sister. My prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when near me and I got many a pleasant view of her underwear. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else. One day little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived. She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. I was in total shock and couldn't say a word. She said, "I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me." I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house. I walked straight towards my car. My future father-in-law was standing outside. With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, "We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.<br><br>"The moral of this story is:"<br><br>"Always keep your condoms in your car."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Three guys, a Canadian, Osama Bin Laden, and Uncle Sam, were out walking together one day. They came across a lantern, and a Genie popped out of it. "I will give each of you one wish -- that's three wishes total," said the Genie. The Canadian responded with, "I am a farmer, my dad was a farmer, and my son will also farm. I want the land to be forever fertile in Canada." With a blink of the Genie's eye, "POOF," the land in Canada was forever made fertile for farming. Osama Bin Laden was amazed, so he said, "I want a wall around Afghanistan so high that no infidels, Jews, or Americans, can come into our precious state." Again, with a blink of the Genie's eye, "POOF," there was a huge wall around Afghanistan. Uncle Sam (a former civil engineer) asked, "I'm very curious. Please tell me more about this wall." The Genie explained, "Well, it's about 15,000 feet high, 500 feet thick, and completely surrounds the country; nothing can get in or out -- virtually impenetrable." Uncle Sam then made his wish: "Fill it with water."</div>

Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say,<br>"All passengers who are disembarking from the train, please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon." She hears the little boy continue,<br>"For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today."<br><br>As the mother began to smile, the child added, "For those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR delay, please see the $itch in the kitchen."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One day a hunter was out shooting wild ducks. He sited a really nice plumb bird just starting it's take off. He tracked it for a moment before he knelt, taking aim, and fired. It was a perfect kill. The duck spiraled to the ground, landing in a farmers yard. Just as the hunter was hopping the fence to get it, the farmer came out and picked up the duck, starting to carry it away.<br>"Hey, were are you going with my duck?" asked the hunter fiercely.<br>"Your duck? It landed in my yard, therefore it's MY duck!" exclaimed the farmer. The arguement went back and forth over the ownership of the bird, when the hunter came up with an idea.<br>"Tell you what, I'll challange you for the duck... First, I'll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me, we'll go back and forth until one of us falls down. The one left standing gets the duck. How does that sound?"<br>The farmer agreed, saying,"Well, I'm pretty good at taking pain, and that duck looks like a mighty fine dinner."<br>So the hunter went first. He stepped back, wound up and gave it all he got right up between the farmers legs. The farmer screamed, his face turning beet red, and crunched over, but did not fall. After several minutes of catching his breathe the farmer finally panted, "Oh... Ok... It's my, my turn to... kick you."<br>The hunter replied, "Nah, that's ok, you can keep the duck."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A lawyer and a blonde are sitting next to each other on a long flight from LA to NY.The lawyer leans over to her and asks if she would like to play a fun game. The blonde just wants to take a nap, so she politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. The lawyer persists and explains that the game is really easy and a lot of fun. He explains" I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5, and vice-versa." Again, she politely declines and tries to get some sleep. The lawyer, now somewhat agitated, says, "Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5, and if I don't know the answer that you'll ask me, I will pay you $500!." Figuring that since she is a blonde that he will easily win the match. This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring that there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game. The lawyer asks the first question. "What's the distance from the earth to the moon?" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches in to her purse, pulls out a five dollar bill and hands it to the lawyer. Now, it's the blonde's turn. She asks the lawyer: "What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?" The lawyer looks at her with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references.He taps into the Airphone with his modem and searches the Net and the Library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends E-mails to all his coworkers and friends he knows. All to no avail. Afterover an hour, he wakes the blonde and hands her $500. The blonde politely takes the $500 and turns away to get back to sleep. The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, "Well, so what IS the answer!?" Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5, and goes back to sleep.</div>
