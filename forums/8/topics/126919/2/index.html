He said it had<br>nothing to<br>do with me and not to worry.<br>On the way home I told him that I loved him, he simply smiled and kept<br>driving.<br><br>I can't explain his behavior; I don't know why he didn't say, "I love<br>you,<br>too."<br><br>When we got home I felt as if I had lost him, as if he wanted nothing<br>to do<br>with me anymore.<br>He just sat there and watched TV; he seemed distant and absent.<br><br>Finally I decided to go to bed. About 10 minutes later he came to bed.<br>I decided that I could not take it anymore, so I decided to confront<br>him<br>with the situation but he had fallen asleep.<br>I started crying and cried until I too fell asleep.<br><br>I don't know what to do.

Then he saw an envelope propped up prominently on the center of the bed. It was addressed, "Dad".<br><br>With the worst premonition, he opened the envelope and read the letter with trembling hands:<br><br>Dear Dad,<br><br>It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with mom and you.<br><br>I've been finding real passion with Joan and she is so nice-even with all her piercing, tattoos, and her tight Motorcycle clothes. But it's not only the passion dad, she's pregnant and Joan said that we will be very happy.<br><br>Even though you don't care for her as she is so much older than I, she already owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. She wants to have many more children with me and that's now one of my dreams too.<br><br>Joan taught me that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone and we'll be growing it for us and trading it with her friends for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want. In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so Joan can get better; she sure deserves it!!<br><br>Don't worry Dad, I'm 15 years old now and I know how to take care of myself. Someday I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your grandchildren.<br><br>Your son,<br>John<br><br>PS: Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at the neighbor's house. I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than my report card that's in my desk center drawer. I love you!<br><br>Call when it is safe for me to come home.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A son asks his father, "What can you tell me about politics? I have to learn about it for school tomorrow." The father thinks a little and says, "OK, son, the best way I can describe politics is to use an analogy. Let's say that I'm a capitalist because I'm the breadwinner. Your mother will be the government because she controls everything, our maid will be the working class because she works for us, you will be the people because you answer to us, and your baby brother will be the future. Does that help any?" The little boy said, "Well, Dad, I don't know, but I'll think about what you said."<br><br>Later that night, after everyone had gone to bed, the little boy was awaken by his baby brother's crying. Upon further investigation, he found a dirty diaper. So, he went down the hall to his parent's bedroom and found his father's side of the bed empty and his mother wouldn't wake up. Then he saw a light on in the guest room down the hall, and when he reached the door, he saw through the crack that his father was in bed with the maid. The son then turned and went back to bed.<br><br>The next morning, he said to his father at the breakfast table, "Dad, I think I understand politics much better now." "Excellent, my boy," he answered, "What have you learned?" The little boy thought for a minute and said, "I learned that capitalism is screwing the working class, government is sound asleep ignoring the people, and the future's full of crap."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Tech Support:<br><br>Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed that the new program began making unexpected changes to the accounting modules, limiting access to flower and jewellery applications that had operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0.<br><br>In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.9 but installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0. Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and HouseCleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system.<br><br>I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail.<br><br>-- Desperate<br><br>***<br><br>Dear Desperate,<br><br>Keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package, while Husband 1.0 is an operating system.<br><br>Try to enter the command: C:/ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME and install Tears 6.2. Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications: Guilty 3.0 and Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to GrumpySilence 2.5, HappyHour 7.0 or Beer 6.1.<br><br>Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will create "Snoring Loudly" wave files. DO NOT install MotherInLaw 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend program. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.<br><br>In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. Consider buying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend HotFood 3.0 and Lingerie 5.3.<br><br>Good Luck!<br>Tech Support<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A wise old gentleman retired and purchased a modest home near a junior high school. He spent the first few weeks of his retirement in peace and contentment. Then a new school year began. The very next afternoon three young boys, full of youthful, after-school enthusiasm, came down his street, beating merrily on every trash can they encountered. The crashing percussion continued day after day, until finally the wise old man decided it was time to take some action.<br><br>The next afternoon, he walked out to meet the young percussionists as they banged their way down the street. Stopping them, he said, "You kids are a lot of fun. I like to see you express your exuberance like that. In fact, I used to do the same thing when I was your age. Will you do me a favor? I'll give you each a dollar if you'll promise to come around every day and do your thing." The kids were elated and continued to do a bang-up job on the trash cans.<br><br>After a few days, the old-timer greeted the kids again, but this time he had a sad smile on his face.<br><br>"This recession's really putting a big dent in my income," he told them. "From now on, I'll only be able to pay you 50 cents to beat on the cans."<br><br>The noisemakers were obviously displeased, but they did accept his offer and continued their afternoon ruckus. A few days later, the wily retiree approached them again as they drummed their way down the street.<br><br>"Look," he said, "I haven't received my Social Security check yet, so I'm not going to be able to give you more than 25 cents. Will that be okay?"<br><br>"A lousy quarter?" the drum leader exclaimed. "If you think we're going to waste our time, beating these cans around for a quarter, you're nuts! No way, mister. We quit!"<br><br>And the old man enjoyed peace.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A woman walked up to a little old man rocking in a chair on his porch.<br><br>"I couldn't help noticing how happy you look," she said. "What's your secret for a long happy life?"<br><br>"I smoke three packs of cigarettes a day," he said. "I also drink a case of whiskey a week, eat fatty foods, and never exercise."<br><br>"That's amazing," the woman said. "How old are you?'<br><br>"Twenty-six," he said.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A blonde and a lawyer are seated next to each other on a flight from LA to NY. The lawyer asks if she would like to play a fun game?<br><br>The blonde, tired, just wants to take a nap, politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks.<br><br>The lawyer persists and explains that the game is easy and lot of fun. He explains, "I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5 and vice versa."<br><br>Again, she declines and tried to get some sleep. The lawyer, now agitated, says, "Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5 and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500."<br><br>This catch the blonde's attention and, figuring there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game.<br><br>The lawyer asks the first question. "What is the distance from earth to the moon?"<br><br>The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pull out a $5 bill and hands it to the lawyer. "OK," says the lawyer, "You turn."<br><br>She asks the lawyer, "What goes up a hill with three legs and come down with four legs?" The lawyer puzzled, takes out his laptop computer and searches all his reference, no answer. He taps into the air phone with his modem and searches the net and the library of congress, no answer. Frustrated, he sends e-mail to all his friends and co-workers, to no avail.<br><br>After an hour, he wakes the blonde, and hand her $500. The blonde says, "Thank you!" And turns back to get some more sleep.<br><br>The lawyer, who is more than little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, "Well. what was the answer?" Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hand the lawyer $5, and go to sleep</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>So as I walked out of the dry cleaners, I saw the police man writing out the parking ticket. Hurrying out, I asked him to stop, and that I was just leaving. The police man did not stop. I called him a looser, and said I was wasting tax payer's money on him. He started to write another one for a broken rear view mirror. I called him a jerkwad. Another ticket. I called him another name, another ticket. Six tickets later, he had left, and I walked three blocks down to where my car is parked. I like to do something fun everyday.</div>
