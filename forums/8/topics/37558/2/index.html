I see specialist drive vehicle out during  OC not in go watch movie. Onli clerks are bad? Hardly. Everywhere in SAF, got good people got bad people whether clerks or not.   If you seriously think clerks are a waste of money, go suggest to SAF lor then maybe they will make u a chiong sua man who will also do ur own leave, do ur own paper work, do ur own indent, do your own Parade State, do ur own filing.... better still since u tok until as though u very GOOD, u might as well be the FIRST chiong sua NSF  as well as take care of the whole SAF's administrative matters.
