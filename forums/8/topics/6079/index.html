            <div class='col-md body'>Terrance &amp; Messeuss,<br><br>You seem to think yourselves as superior to everyone else in this forum. Is is that you two are insecure and that you must have a "release" of your frustrations through your attacks or is itjust that you are pretending so that you can court the girls in this forum because you are so pathetic that you cannot get girlfriends in real<br>life.<br>A forum is precisely a debate whereby anyone can say whatever they want without having to substatiate personal attacks about their class or status. This is true democracy and it is hypocritical of you both to advocate this point whilst at the same time demonstrate that you are the most bigoted and less tolerant people around.<br>As one prominent US politician once said "I detest all that you are saying but by God I will defend you to the end for your freedom to say it".<br>Pokeman, I don't care what class of person he is... it doesn't matter, has a view and he has expressed it. Vulgarity is very much judgemental. Your own postings are nuseating at the best of times and does show your immaturity in your own actions and opionions. It seems like that you still have not a realistic grip on world or social issues but the world surely does not revolve around you. You try to act mature but reading them makes me think that you still have a lot to learn from life. It is when you really interact with real people that you realise what a wonderful this is with the diversity of people, classes and culture.<br>I can only imagine you to be people with frustrations in your life and blaming it on others such as labourers, immigrants or whatever and you tend to look down upon these class of people. For your information, it is precisely these people who fought and died for Singapore and with their forthright hardworking attitudes built up Singapore for what is is today. They sacrificed their own educations and youth so that people you can have an education and become lawyers, doctors...etc You can be smug and dismiss what I write simply because you think I am from a lower class than you, but you do not know me, you do not know what or how I think and vice versa and frankly I don't care. Pokeman has an unabated right to say whatever he wants, if you do not like it then don't read it but you two do not have a right to attack him personally.<br>In the meantime.... please grow up !!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bengboy, I understand what you are trying to say but definitely, some recourses of responses are crude and downright vulgar. When faced with a response like that, what would you do? Lower yourself to that level and start spouting vulgarities like nobody business?<br><br>Voicing out your unhappiness over somebody is alright, but when it degrades to the level of personal attacks(name calling) and attacks aimed at your parents... that is just a bit too much to take. Esp. when "colorful" language come into play.<br><br>I do not really think that MsSeuss and Terence think they are a superior breed over the rest. Not when defending against crude and vulgar personal attacks. Saying that, I think its the moderator's job to remove offending posts which are tactless, crude and just downright rude.<br><br>------------------<br>Why? Why me?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is not a personal attack and I have dedicated a posting to show the hypocrisy which exists. I can understand the concerns but if we are to censor such things, then where do we start..??? where do we draw the line? There may be things which are not vulgar but offensive to a particular race, class, people, religion..etc. Do we censor those? What gives us the right to dictate what is right or wrong? If you say in a forum that "God does not exist", isn't that offensive to Christians or that Ah Lian's are whores... Isn't that also offensive to young uneducated girls?<br>I do not care what social class Pokeman's from but it seems like a lot of people do. I don't care whether he is educated or not, it's not my problem but I do care that people are being righteous and condeming him for expressing himself.<br>In one of the postings, I and John Wong were condemed as being unfit to inhabit this planet because of an excellent piece of literature that he wrote and I supported.. sure bought a new exciting dimension to a boring topic. I respect your views and you are quite welcome to debate with me but was there any need to be so personal?<br>You are the ones to have set up a posting for debate. What do you expect?<br><br>So long as there is no "incitement" or anything that endangers "national security" then it is acceptable. After all this is just a forum for young people and not exactly earth shattering revelations that would have implications on national elections<br>or world peace.<br>The situation in Austria is a perfect example of double atandards and the definition of democracy. The Austrian Right Wing party has been voted in constitutionally with an overwhelming majority, but because of their views, they are rejected by the EU and America who take offence and are to boycott them. But remember, they were freely elected. If they can be censored then democracy is a farce and is to the dictates of whoever is the most powerful. Does democracy only mean selected democracy which is only democaratic and free if expressed by certain groups of people?<br>If things Pokeman say are vulgar, then it may be offensive to you but to others it may be music... but is he doing anything which is illegal? that is the main point.<br><br>We live by the rule of law, that is the basis of our constitution. People cannot going round censoring people because they find things socially unacceptable to them.<br>Different people like the Chinese, Singaporeans, English, Americans, Malaysians or Indians have habits which others may find disgusting but in their own place it is acceptable. Do we say that to them "sorry, although your habits are legal, we don't like them, you are not allowed into our country?"<br>Censorship is so subjective and so prejudiced. My attitude is if it is lawful then let it be. Pokeman's rights are the same as everyone elses. What gives us the right to dictate to him his lawful rights. He may find your views offensive and then what??<br>You can do two things, report him to the authorities who will only laugh or use the moderator to censure him, but then you lose the essence and the whole concept of this forum. Everyone will be agreeing with each other and patting one's back.<br>Is this what we want?<br>Come on guys n girls, you have a lot to learn.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The beauty and genius of the ideal of Freedom of speech is only illustrated when opposing opinions clash and fight in the public arena. It is only then when observers and progenitors of opposing views alike can see the integrity of these opinions. The Freedom of speech notion is not just saying anything you want but being able to engage in a mechanism that brings your opinions to test in the external world. True, Pokemon has a right to post his opinions, just as people have the right to question him, but in the process of engagement, Pokemon has resorted to vulgarities (which one assumes he also has a right to) but he has failed to defend his ideas.<br><br>bengboy,<br>If you had given good reasons as to why you thought the piece of porn JW cut and pasted was such an excellent piece of literature you would have shown more liberal thought and enlightenment than by merely stating your fondness for it. It is easy to say you like it but it is harder to give valid reasons why. If you feel so aggrieved by the slight on your taste in literature you should explain why you like it instead of wanting to sound fashionably 'cool' or like some enfant terrible just for the sake of it. The way in which you articulated yourself made you and JW sound like folie Ã  deux.<br><br>There is also no need for me to impress anyone here. Most are people I will never meet. My career route has been pre-paved (I have no say in it) and thus have no need to 'prove'my achievements or abilities to people who will never enter my personal sphere of existence - just like I will never enter yours.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 06 February 2000).]</div>

Its a big comfort really to find so many grown ups in this forum.<br><br>I don't know where you guys get the idea that i think i'm superior to all of you. But whatever the case, think what you want to think. We live in a FREE country, where we can very actively practice FREEDOM of speech (and vulagrity as i gather, but of course this is alll HIGHLY subjective, as we have learnt), and of course what one person thinks will one day clash with what someone else thinks and thus results in a disagreement. Somewhat like this one we have here, where each party is only EXPRESSING themselves. Of course one of the parties gets on the defensive (or rather offensive)and starts spewing vulgarities, and then we begin to think, where exactly do we draw the line? Which is why maybe a communist/totalitarian system has its merits because then no one is allowed to say anthing and then there shall be peace and harmony on earth... yaay...<br><br>ok, if you don't get that whole bit, forget it.

Now don't blame me if you do not have a sense of humour or that you found it vulgar, that is your opinion and I sympathize. It must have been your education and upbringing.<br>You should explore the world more, get to know more people and interact, not in the way you want with your eloquent English talking condescendingly down to them but on the same level... yes that includes vulgarities as well. People will respond better and respect you more for that. You are not above anyone just because of your education or upbringing. You have brought this retalliation upon yourself. I do not know Pokemon, never seen or heard of him before. He doesn't mean anything to me, but his freedom of expression does. Let's face it, you hate him because you assume him to be of a lower class and I think that is what is bugging you and the rest. You on one hand say that this is his only outlet for his frustrations then go on to deride him when he cannot argue back using your form of English. But doesn't SUX BIG TIME and FUCK YOU mean more than what you try to say in hundred words, not queen's english I agree but less words and more meaningful then some of the gibberish that you pass off.<br><br>I see that you are looking for Forums with "proper intellectual" debates and where there are censors, this may be your sphere of influence where you can join your "buddies" into discussing social and economic developments in Singapore. Good for you, you may enjoy it. You may find me one day joining you in one of those debates but equally I will be discussing other issues like "Periods" or "Best position for sex".<br>This topic has been opened for debate and we should respect it's existence.<br>Remember there is more in life than drinking tea at raffles.<br>To the rest of the people who are on their high pedestals to get down and get a grip on reality. People with education only pass exams but perhaps Pokemon knows more about life than you all do. Stop this class nonsense.<br><br>Now don't try and pyschoanalyse me... you cannot and will only end up being fools.<br><br>By the way when does John wong get the prize?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why is a person trying to impress or acting superior just because of the words he uses? Impress girls? Pick up women? Surely the range of motives behind precise speech and writing must extend further than that or is that what your world consists only of? I happen to think grasping a language firmly facilitates for accurate conveyance of message and a wider vocabulary allows for more articulate expression. Forgive me but I was not brought up to spew vulgarities in the frustrated expression of thoughts and feelings and consequentially know that there are alternative words to F**k you. Dwell in your particular lexicon puddle if you must.<br><br>Porn to liven up a boring threat? Ah, the logic of your justification for porn is unshakable! Superior logic Â– hey, IÂ’m bored, lets go blow up a building! Seriously though, if you had argued that my eschewing of porn was symptomatic of the cultural idiosyncrasies of traditional contextuality, the same type of contextuality that rejected D H LawrenceÂ’s Lady ChatterlyÂ’s Lover, I might have sat up and taken notice. Or that the hidden representations of certain pornographic literature possess binary powers of objectification and subjectification to reveal the culture of eroticism in a given historical period, like say, Marque de SadeÂ’s work, to transcend its medium into another, I would have respected your reasons. However, nooooo, you came up with, porn is ok because the thread is boring. Well done. Debating society president are we?<br><br>I hope you continue to prosper in your well-paid job and revel in your education. It must be morally satisfying for you to be able to push them aside and participate in Â‘PeriodÂ’ and Â‘Best Sexual PositionÂ’ threads. But donÂ’t assume for a second I am a snob just because I value a vocabulary.<br><br>cheers<br></div>

Yes you may be learned and true, but in fact you are just playing the fool!<br><br>Again you villify me because you find my argument does not conform to that of a true gentleman. Again you hide behind your powerful lexicon of jargons and idosyncriticies forming an argument based on the power of English. You do not respect because you believe me not to be worthy since I find the cheekiness shown by John Wong entertaining.<br>There is no logic in this, I agree there is none, but does there have to be?<br><br>I can just imagine you at a party ... definately life and soul when everyone is cracking jokes and you stony faced "Where is the logic in that?... let's debate about the merits of the joke!"<br>Why should I argue about lady Chatterley's lover when I find the whole book ultra boring?.<br><br>Yes, I am also prepared to debate issues like "Best sex Positions" &amp; "Periods" as well as Shakespeare &amp; Wordsworth and why not? What a boring forum this would be if there are no extreme diversities. This is not the Oxford debating society although you want it to be.<br><br>I find these topics humourous and I am sure most others do.<br><br>There are other topics such as "man's arms" or "virginity" which have attracted a host of other replies. These are considered erotic but because they were not posted by a "low class scum" you consider them worthy of debate.<br><br>You are in your own dreamworld cocooned in a fantasy world of literature and arts, a utopia of the upper class gentlemen drinking brandy at exclusive men's clubs.<br>You seem to think that people who do not have the knowledge of Rembrant or a Marcello are plebians.<br>I speak the ordinary language, it is not cool but pratical. I do not need to hide behind a wall of vocabulary when speaking to them because I believe this is snobbish and condescending. I reach out to all parts of society whilst you are afraid of interaction because you do not wish to "lower yourself".<br>You do not understand that actions are done and words are spoken based on emotional appeal. You seem to think that all arguments should have an rational articulated response as determined by your own perceptions.<br>This is not reality.<br>Your own words "I have no say in my future" sums you up very well. You are not in control of your own life. I am. Perhaps you should get a reality check!<br><br>I declare myself the Judge of the heart sobbing competition.<br><br>By the way... WHEN IS JOHN WONG GONNA GET HIS PRIZE??????<br>I felt so emotional after his story... thanks John.<br>Pokemon also wrote a great liternary piece based on a piece of porn picked up from one of the pages of the Internet but too long ma.... cut down la, poke.

            <div class='col-md body'>Amusing. From just a few posting you have managed to paint a whole world.<br><br>Â“You are in your own dreamworld cocooned in a fantasy world of literature and arts, a utopia of the upper class gentlemen drinking brandy at exclusive men's clubs.<br>You seem to think that people who do not have the knowledge of Rembrant or a Marcello are plebians.Â” (its Â‘plebeiansÂ’, by the way).<br><br>Its easier for you to appropriate an image of me and then tear it down yourself isnÂ’t it? And in doing so you have missed the point of my earlier mail. Point being, it is easy to say one likes something, its hard to say why.  It doesnÂ’t have to be a Â‘logicalÂ’ reason, it just has to be an understandable one. The lack of reason open up issues for hijacking by ulterior motives.<br><br>And of course you attribute my way of writing as snobbish and elitist, after all its easier to recede into the recess of self-justification by appealing to notions of Â‘ordinary languageÂ’ and being part of the Â‘peopleÂ’. And in the process you have miss blindly the point I made about vocabulary.<br><br>Also, donÂ’t kid yourself. I never decried Â‘extreme diversitiesÂ’ in this forum. Throughout your mail, you have been so taken up with personal agenda you have attributed to me things I never said. (low class scum?) This forum is a public space and if one chooses to post views in a public realm he or she must expect those views to be interacted with, finding agreement in some quarters and antagonism in others. That is the life of a view in a public realm. Of course issues are pushed to its logical conclusion. You canÂ’t expect to say something and not have someone else question your stand. There are some who defend their views and there are some who canÂ’t and deflect counter-arguments by resorting to de-intellectualisation, notions of Â‘funÂ’ and accuse others of all sorts of things.<br></div>
