            <div class='col-md body'>bengboy.<br>it's well to hide the fact that you do not understand what is being said by saying that Terence is hiding behind his english.  i do not see you address what he is saying, instead you just move forth like a steamroller.  did you really read them at all?  you know who is a bigot?  you.  you can't accept the fact that someone speaks in different manner than how you do it and just because you're among the majority you think that you're oh so cool and everybody else unlike you is a poseur.<br><br>as for john wong and his prize, i'm okay with stooping low to pokemon's level: fuck you fuck you fuck you.  now that it has been put so eloquently, do you get it?  it shows lack of manner to go to a thread and post an unrelated post.  and if you want to be the judge and decides who won, then you by all means can give JW the prize.<br><br>[This message has been edited by MayaJade (edited 08 February 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by MayaJade (edited 08 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sunnydays honey, if you don't like this thread, you really should just ignore it. This forum is pretty big on that you see. Never mind it just waay up there and in your face, if you dislike it, don't read it, ignore it as they say time and time again. Some of us learnt this the hard way. :]<br><br>bengboy&gt; hi, just wanted to say something, I mean, i haven't fully matured yet and stuff, but it seems to me, some of your views are really *gasp!!* bigoted too...<br><br>like when you assumed that ah lians are young uneducated girls, and how you seem to cling on to the image of terrence you have conjoured, oh sorry, i meant pieced together, just from reading his posts!<br><br>I really don't understand why you think we are desprate pple using fancy language to pick up girls, but hey! for one, I'm a girl (MS seuss??) and two, holy smokes! talk about sad, give us some credit here! "Speak in Queens English, it really gets the girls!" Where do you get these ideas???!<br><br>I say let Terrence write how he wants to write. Freedom of choice in play here. If Pokemon can spew vulgarities (which is of course, highly subjective) Terrence can surely use his bombastic (as some have claimed) vocab.<br><br>I really don't get where you're coming from, on one hand, you say you advocate freedom of speech, and on the other, you're basically telling terrence to shove it with his english. And your point on censorship, i have never heard so much tommyrot in my life. People obviously need censorship. Just like a garden, you can't just toss in  a few seeds and hope for the best! You need to water it and weed it regularly to ensure it grows nice and pretty, not overrrun with weeds. Censorship especially self-censorship is pretty crucial when it comes to freedom of speech &amp; expression. As mayajade said, "time for topics that show a little respect for the women to flood the forum". Sorry, but "menstrual period" just doesn't cut it.<br><br>[This message has been edited by MsSeuss (edited 08 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This world is so full of shit... why can't people just live in peace? I guess without competition and some of these hard knocks we would lose our edge, but all the killings, fighting, arguments...... sigh....<br><br>Damn all those who deserve to be damned.

Everybody has a bone to pick with somebody else. Everybody's only concerned about themselves and petty shit. We need more noble people in this world. We are too complacent. Our ancestors have fought for nothing if this is the way our generation is heading.<br><br>Think the kids in East Timor squabble about whose English is better? They are scrambling for their lives... and here, we, the supposedly educated people just blab and blab about rubbish. I think education takes us further from our humanity and senses....<br><br>The internet has brought along with its promise of information and communication a whole load of other undesired consequences.<br><br>Forgive me if I offended anyone.
