It's his job &amp; that's what he is paid to do, to give better life to malaysians in anyway he can &amp; these ways also include politicking. If malaysians loose this leader, then they are in serious need of God's help.<br><br>Regarding my identity, I am a true world citizen &amp; look at boxes from outsides, &amp; not standing inside the boxes to see what's happening outside.

But in the end I am not a judge &amp; I should not be passing comments on others, but if someone is wrong then I can't control myself &amp; hope to express my views &amp; i could lash out at anybody, including Malaysia &amp; Dr. Mahathir, yes he is doing good for his people, cos he is a nationlistic &amp; all nationalistic do these kind of things so they can stay in power. but extreme nationalism makes others feel uncomfortable &amp; a specific nation when feels very nationalistic starts to look down upon other nations. like americans, when they got nationalistic, they start killing thousands in afghanistan, simply cos they had to show that they are a great nation.<br><br>&amp; like the way mahathir behaved during the muslim countries meeting &amp; saying shit like suicide bombing against israel should be condemned. is he supplying any weapons to palestinians so they can properly equip themselves against israeli aggression &amp; torture &amp; killings of the innocents???? No.<br>he is just talking shit, cos he wants to please jews &amp; americans. Give Palestinians all they need &amp; put them on equal military weaponary might as the level of israel &amp; then see how israeli rats look for their holes.<br><br>Sorry guys, u made me start again on politics, anyway, to back my claim I am gonna paste some very disturbing pictures here, which not all of u might wanna see. so here is the warning:<br><br>sorry, I do not know how to paste them? can anybody teach me how to paste pics/ thanks.<br>theose pics are brain openers.<br></div>

You do not wish to belong to any specific country even when your passport states so. Do you feel this way because politicians from where your passport says you lived once played with your feelings?

What you judged as "right" and "wrong" are clearly your own personal views. Somebody in your view who is "wrong" might be right in other people's view, so dont judge too fast saying other people are wrong.

And during the Independence day for Israel and Palestine (both races the Jews and Palestinians shared the same piece of liberal land under the rule of UK)the UNO wanted to divide the land for Israel and Palestine, Israel was happy with the decision, but the Palestinians disagreed to letting the Israelites settle down in their own country because they claim that all land in the MiddleEast belongs to the Arabs, not Jews. So together with their muslim brothers of Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Jodan, Saudi Arabia etc they started a war wanting to eliminate the Jews, yet in the end the Jews won the war and conquered more lands, including some lands from Palestine.<br><br>For many years till now the Palestinian pointed their fingers at Jews for invading their home country and kept attacking the Jews with suicide bombers just because they couldnt live their lives co-existing with the Jews.<br><br>Who is actually the one being intolerant of his neighbour here?<br>Who started the war first?<br>Muslims claim they fight for right, yet history showed that the Jews rightfully own their land!<br>Who is right, who is wrong, dont ever judge  by your own personal views.

Why dun u name me one case where the local govt has openly critised malaysian politics or the way they run their country?<br><br>Just one would be nice.<br><br>Our govt deals with out own affairs. So shd ur leaders. Let me say that i admire leaders like Dr M. I have nv overlooked the fact that he has done much for his country and is continuing to do so. But when they start making wilds claims that meddle in another nation's affair, then it becomes cannon fodder for the malaysian media and ppl like u who think tat it's "propaganda".<br><br>This isn't the cold war era. Dr M is free to attract investors to his country. I'm not against it.<br><br><blockquote><strong> take ur shit somewhere else &amp; stop fuc**** with people's brains, so they brain can do something else &amp; not worry about pathetic politics, which waste 8 hours or our time everyday. </strong></blockquote>Unless u're immature there's no need for vulgarity in this forum. It only lowers ur standing.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>where did I say that?

"<br><br><blockquote><strong>whether he is propagating or lying, he is just protecting his people,</strong></blockquote>Sorrie. That cuts no ice. Nobody protects his ppl by "lying" (like u so bluntly put it). It's even more preposterous when those lies are common knowledge. Back it up with facts, then u have credibility. Otherwise, dun blow ur foghorn.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>which is his right, why does it bother u &amp; singaporeans &amp; even chinese, I know people who want malaysia to be controlled chinese, cos chinese got better skin color &amp; they come from china &amp; since china is big now, so it should be the chinese who take the lead as malaysians are coward &amp; lame even if chinese are only 20%.... </strong></blockquote>I made no mention anywhere in my post that Chinese are "better" then malays. What rubbish are u dreaming up? Hearsay and more hearsay is all we get from u. U want to respond aggressively to my post, please come up with facts, not fiction.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>so mahathir totally knows his neighbours intention &amp;  his statements maybe early but not untrue. </strong></blockquote>Oh so now u think Dr M can predict the future? Can he prophesise wat will happen 10 years down the rd then? Leaders plan well for their country and ensure that the nation has direction. But jumping the bandwagon and making grey statements is just shooting urself in the mouth.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>u are provoking &amp; making people think that they are or will be treated discriminantly under mahathir &amp; mahathir's people will be protected. it's true, but why should it bother anybody, including enthnic chinese living in malaysia. </strong></blockquote>Though i never metioned an iota of Dr M practicing discrimination in my post, please feel free to continue contradicting urself.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>If ur government wants to improve your living standard by restricting foreign labour so that u can have more jobs. Will u be happy think ur government is treating them bad? or let's say the labour which u have in ur country is not treated as u are treated if u are in the same job,then what do u call that?</strong></blockquote>Foreign labour is invited to work in s'pore to improve the nation's competitiveness. They are sometimes given significant incentives far better than locals such as  accomodation, a company car, even pre-paid return airline tickets in business class.<br><br>FYI.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Mahathir is just doing his job. leave him alone, u are welcome to do anything in singapore &amp; he should be welcome to do anything in malaysia.  </strong></blockquote>Absoultely. But if he thinks has earned the "right" to meddle in another nation's affair, then my response will always be cryptic and blunt. I dun condone his sweeping remarks anymore then i agree with LKY's occasional unfounded statements.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I have read &amp; understood ur post, just the way u wanted to say it, but are unable to write it as u got no gutts to say it the way, u want to. just look deep inside u &amp; u will know where ur message is actually coming from. </strong></blockquote>All i've got from u is fiction and story-telling. U've got no facts, no concrete backing to support ur remarks. U listen to all that Dr M has said and believe it without disecting the information and determining whether it's true or untrue. How am i suppose to convince u or even try to explain something u refuse to understand?<br><br>Just like u're so fond of saying: u are welcome to do anything in singapore &amp; he should be welcome to do anything in malaysia.<br>This has been the theme of my post. Do wat u want in ur boundaries and quit passing statements abt other nations that would sour cross-straits relations.<br><br><blockquote><strong>your greed comes from ur chinese ancestry, as the chinese are simply feeling very bad that they are living under malaysian rule even with such a big majority &amp; ur greed keeps telling u that it should be u instead that should rule malaysia, cos then all the money will come to ur pocket... cos u are singaporean &amp; are better then malaysians. right?  stop bringing politics in here &amp; get a life. work on ur future, hit some books, get a wife &amp; give ur children a good life. stop messing with people's life &amp; people's brains, cos that's what the politicians want, scapegoats like u who can promote what they want. </strong></blockquote>Again u enjoy putting words in my mouth. Go ahead, quote me where u think i mentioned that i "dislike chinese living under malay's rule"? Or even "singaporean's are better then malaysians"?<br><br>If u dun have the guts to admit that there is err in ur statements, u're just a poor flamer who must have the last say simply becoz u were "offended" by my starting post and can't accept someone criticising objectively.<br><br>Go do ur own soul-searching b4 coming here and speculating.</div>
