Let me say that I am really impressed with your very humane and balanced views.<br><br>Sadly, these objective views are not shared by many people and that is why the cycle of violence are seen everywhere in the world from Palestine to Kashmir, Ambon, Madura, Gujarat.....and the list goes on.<br><br>Have also surfed many local websites of political discussions. Many a time, self professed zealots are advocating that only their way is right and very one sided view of events. Hate to say this but have to as it is a fact, one of the websites that advocate this calling itself the spokesman for Singapore is Fateha.com. Recently, one chap even said that Singapore is a Malay land and our grandfather robbed them of the land.<br><br>What is he advocating? That we are like Jews occupying Palestinian land? If more were to be like him, what will happen? Suicide bombers in Singapore chasing out the other races which are infidels and kafirs? Mahathir in his speech said that the Malays are marginalised here only add fire. There will be some that believe him and may take action on their own. That man only care for his political interest and does not care a hoot should his comments which may cause bloodshed here. Is he then a responsible leader or a selfish bigot? He is in power and with power must come heavier resposibilities, not only to his people but the global community as well.<br><br>We already have Yishun MRT bombers wannabe.  Who next? With such thinking, how? From those websites, there are many more.<br><br>I saw a nine year old kid chatting on the net recenty with a presumably same age internet pal. That guy was praising Osama. I happen to see " Osama is a great man. He kill the Americans who are not innocent because they are friends of the Jews. He kill them for Allah. Allahu Arkbah."<br><br>Huh? Kill people for Allah is glorious and justifiable?  That means the MRT bombers is justified if the bomb kill Singaporeans in the subway as it is in the name of Allah?<br><br>That was a message typed out by pre-adolescent kid. It must have been  taught to him by some adults and his influence from where he is. What will this kid grow up to be like? How many of these kids are out there? How many adults are out there teaching these kids? This is dangerous.<br><br>I wish you can help to spread your peaceful message when you come accross zealots.<br><br>Best Wishes<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alright. First thing First.<br>My apologies to all of you for using vulgar language. I am pretty messed up between so many cultures, political views, religious views, economical views &amp; pretty much everything around me. But neverthe less it does not mean that I am blinded by them, it's just that my anger makes me not express myself in a constructive way, but I am ready to give it another shot.<br><br>Singpore geographically does belong to Malaysia. And offcourse it's true that Chinese have taken over Singapore from Malyasia. Nobody can deny this. Just like the Europeans have taken over control over America by killing thousands of ethnic Indians &amp; just like Jews have taken over Palestinian land by killng &amp; mass murduring thousands of Palestinians &amp; the same goes to Kashimir. A muslim majority area controlled by indians cos they want to keep it for financial benefits &amp; also cos kashmir is a hill top area, which if goes to pakistan can have significant setback for indian in terms of defense.<br><br>Now Malaysians are jealous of sigapore's presperity &amp; it's constant upgrade of milirary might &amp; it's occassional bullying of it's neighbours &amp; it's show of strength economically &amp; militarily. Singapore is afraid of malaysia's power &amp; attempts of upgrading it's power &amp; it's control over water &amp; it's influcence over other neighbours &amp; offcourse singapore in the end does belong to Malaysia, so chinese are afraid that singapore will be taken back from them &amp; someone already has mentioned that in a thread up here. I am sure you will not deny this fact also. But you won't see it happening as long as you do not behave nervous &amp; like jews. Jews are nervous &amp; all their actions are to protect themselves &amp; they think that the best defense is a best offense. Right? most military men think so. So if singapore behaves the same way like the jews by constantly upgrading it's power, it's simply going to be taken as provoking &amp; it shows it's deep unease about it' security &amp; future. Just like the jews. Y can't people learn from mistakes? Y can't singapore stop trying to be self appointed police of asia, just like australia is trying to be? offcourse cos of it's deep insecurity. So politicians from both Malay.. &amp; Singa.. keep doing what they are suppose to do &amp; that's what I have been tring to say from the beginning that why ordinary people play in the hands of politicians as these politicians create nationalism which is provokes other nations to dislike them, either cos of jealousy or other reasons, which in the end results in war.... it's just like 2 neighbours &amp; one buys a tv &amp; announces it loudly to the whole street, hey, hey, I got a tv &amp; the second neighbour goes &amp; buys one too &amp; in a few days time they are fighting cos 1 or the other can't see his tv channels clearly cos 1 neighbour put an antenna on his rooftoop.. or something similar... Singapore should avoid this kind of provoking &amp; just mind it;s own business &amp; take care of it's economy &amp; it's people &amp; make good relationships with it's neighbour &amp; refrain from trying to become the Jews of Asia. If you do not believe that singapore is on this way, then read some of the posts in "is it an Arms race" &amp; see what the youngs of the singapore say? &amp; see if they regard war as a game &amp; see if they regard weapons as toys..<br><br>Now. Jews did live under the british, but the were sent there by the UN as they were seeking refuge from Hitler. Arab gave them land &amp; sympathised with them &amp; now they are pissing on Arab people's face. This conflict will never be solved cos muslims know how much the jews hate them &amp; the jews know how much Muslims hate them. Now jews are heavy handed, when it's muslims turn, then they will do the same. I give it maximum 5-15 years for jews to be back into Europe or America &amp; that will be the end of this problem. It's in fact the impotency of all the Arabs that they are unable to unite &amp; kick jews out of the middle east, cos as soon as they are united, this conflict can be solved. But instead they are looking up to the United States which does not want to see peace anywhere in the world &amp; offcourse how can u wish to see your client disappear. Isreal is their client of weapons &amp; under hugh american dept &amp; it's also a strong presence in the middle east of america, so it's not in american interest to let jews be kicked out of Middle east. Please don't be blind, we all know that. You wanna believe what u wanna believe &amp; I will believe what I believe.<br><br>Osama is a CIA AGENT. it was the jews &amp; the americans who killed &amp; arranged for the terrorist attacks. whether or not osama was involved is a different story. The main reason is simply that americans can dig for more oil in Afghanistan, so their target was afghanistan from the very beginning &amp; the second reason is that their economy takes a dive in every 10 years. REmember bush's father attacking Baghdad? then also their economy revived cos they created demand of weapons by creating insecurity among countries &amp; the same thing happened now &amp; we can all see that their economy<br>is already recovering... If you say that Osama did it &amp; al Qaeda did it, then please forward ur proof...??? I have not seen a single proof that says Osama did it. Every citizen of this world must see the proof that Osama did it. &amp; then if he did it then was War the only option &amp; killing thousands of Innocents Taleban? It is built in taleban tradition not to ask their guest to leave their home. Simple......<br><br>But Taleban regime was a biggest threat considered by americans as they were promoting true picture of islam... About an year ago, I already see an email trying to gather people's signature so that america<br>can attack Afghanistan. At that time September 11 did not even happen. So If you want to be blind "cos u want to suck american cock" then I got nothing to say to you. sorry but I must swear here cos it makes me sick to see people tyring to show that they are very intelligent simpley cos they have been brought up in the american cultural way &amp; they love to be associated with Europe &amp; west rahter than Asia. It's not just singapore but actually the whole of asia &amp; whole of middle east like to be associated with west &amp; Europe &amp; in the end it's the poor country of Afghanistan, which suffers the most. When are the rich of the world will learn to respect human rights &amp; give to the poor what they need &amp; deserve &amp; what is their birth right &amp; what is their land &amp; their economy???<br><br>Enough for now, still I want to talk more, but message is getting too long.<br><br></div>

That piece of land belong to the Jews two thousand years ago. They were seperated throughout the world especially in Europe after their homeland Israel was destroyed.<br>The british were merely giving them back their homeland and that land was under the British rule, not the Arabs.<br><br>The main problem is:  almost all people in the Islam country do not know this, or do not want to accept this, that's why they are calling the Jews "invaders".<br><br>Of course you believe what you want to believe, but it will only make you a blind follower of your faith if you refuse to listen to what history has got to tell you.<br><br>[This message has been edited by obigood (edited 22 May 2002).]</div>

It's in fact the impotency of all the Arabs that they are unable to unite &amp; kick jews out of the middle east, cos as soon as they are united, this conflict can be solved. But instead they are looking up to the United States which does not want to see peace anywhere in the world &amp; offcourse how can u wish to see your client disappear. Isreal is their client of weapons &amp; under hugh american dept &amp; it's also a strong presence in the middle east of america, so it's not in american interest to let jews be kicked out of Middle east. Please don't be blind, we all know that. You wanna believe what u wanna believe &amp; I will believe what I believe. </strong><br><br>Galvanizer,  go find out from history books if you really want to know.  That piece of land belong to the Jews two thousand years ago. They were seperated throughout the world especially in Europe after their homeland Israel was destroyed.<br>The british were merely giving them back their homeland and that land was under the British rule, not the Arabs.<br><br>The main problem is:  almost all people in the Islam country do not know this, or do not want to accept this, that's why they are calling the Jews "invaders".<br><br>Of course you believe what you want to believe, but it will only make you a blind follower of your faith if you refuse to listen to what history has got to tell you.<br><br>[This message has been edited by obigood (edited 22 May 2002).][/B]</blockquote>Obigood, think u will like this story.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok. Good. now when you have said so that let's not dig the history about who occupied who's land... &amp; I can promise you that now matter how well educated we are &amp; how much we give importance to negotiations &amp; talks between parties to solve their differences. There will be wars, over &amp; over &amp; over again... we have no choice to avert... be we muslims, jews, christians, we will be fighting against each other till the day we all are destroyed by God...<br><br>Meanwhile to give our lives improtance, all the young should refrain from politics &amp; hatred &amp; if someone is wrong, then they will receive the results of their wrongdoing. God is extremely fair.. He is watching, he does not act often, but he is not sleeping... If mahathir is wrong to you, then he will get what he deserve. no point venting our anger against him &amp; creating propaganda.<br><br>Now further Islam does not accept Judaism nor christianism or other religions &amp; they regard Moses also as one of their very respectable prophet, who came before the prophet yusuf (jesus) &amp; all the messenger did leave a message behind to say that their religion is not final &amp; there will be a final religion &amp; a final book, so wait till then, &amp; even gave signs of the prophet, how he will be &amp; which area he will be from. That prophet was Muhammud. But both christians &amp; Jews refuse to recognize him, cos then muslims will have the control over them..  so according to this history, jews does not belong to Middle east, if their religion has taken them out of Middle East thousands of years ago or be it that the arabs drove them out of the Middle east. Remember that to muslims Palestine is as holy as it is to the jews. Since muslims also hold dear to them these 2 prophets so they have all the right to be there &amp; claim that land, as they got no problem with the birthplace of jesus or moses &amp; hold these places very important to themselves. Acutally in the muslim holy book it mentions that jews will never have their own land &amp; they will keep migrating, because they betrayed prophet Moses. All muslims trule believe that. yes Muslims want to kick out the jews of the M.E, but it's not cos it says so in their religion, but mostly for material gain, like land &amp; economy &amp; most of all can not stand the brutality bestowed upon them by the jews, daily torture, daily rape &amp; killing of innocent children. Islam does not promote material life &amp; maybe palestinians are in trouble, bcos they are after land more than the birthplace of their propehts &amp; jews are equally hungry for land as well, so that's why they are occupying palestinian land.<br><br>Y do u assume I am a muslim. you will already also be assuming that I am a terrorist? good for you. this is the kind of attitude americans have towards muslims. keep following on american footsteps, u will be happy in both worlds.<br><br>Infact everybody who speasks against the west is a muslim. right??? u all have already got a perfect terrorist's picture in ur brain with the name galvanizer?<br><br>now... war is the only option to palestinian problem &amp; to all the world problems... we all gotta die, if it's not us then it will be our children, &amp; our grand grand children,,,, this is world, Wars are enevitable... God did not make this world so we can have peace... Cos he gave us a heart which is greedy &amp; which is racist &amp; looks down upon others. be they jews, muslims or others, we all are greedy &amp; materialistic... do u see any muslims fighting for islam??? no... All muslims around the world should be fighting for islam.. not with weapons but with the weapons of education... But our arrogance &amp; greed will keep us fighting &amp; we will be buying more &amp; more weapons &amp; we will be destroying each other till the end... till the day we are all dead.. that's life's story... so why bother so much &amp; waste our time about such things... why can't we spend our time, finding a nice girl for ourselves...??love flourishes from home... no point in arguing...<br><br>now... let's come to brother Osama.. American equipped him with weapons &amp; actually sold him weapons to drive Russia out of Afghanistan.. Can anyone remember there used to be a country called RSSa, or something like that. (God I can't even remember it's name now) So Osama is an american appointed agent...who works for americans...&amp; receives financial aid &amp; money from Americans &amp; works for their interests. Now why americans or jews will do it. There are so many benefits.<br><br>1)immediate divert of attention from M.E to USA.<br>2)revival of american economy, thus saving billions &amp; means saving millions of people's jobs... will u kill just 3000 to save billions around the world, if u were incharge..?? Yup. I willl. for sure... look at the big picture &amp; stop being a moron.<br>3)initial intention was to bomb pakistan as americans thought that pakistan will not let americans bomb afghanistan, but they were wrong, as pakistan became their ally. now the new intention is to<br>4)make india attack pakistan so american in afghanistan &amp; pakistan help india destroy it too... americans can't stand muslims having nuclear weapons in their hands &amp; they will go to any extent to get these weapons out of the muslim community's hands.<br>5)oil from afghanistan.<br>6)basing in afghanistan, so keeping an eye on Iran, tajkistan, uzbekistan, russia &amp; all of central asia... how does that sound. sounds typicall american plan... open ur eyes guys... (I called u morons somewhere up there, take it as a friendly moron &amp; not a strong moron  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )<br><br>if u were america, will u not kill 3000 to have so many benefits, actually someone sent me a list of about 20 benefits which americans have gained from killing 3000 peoples of &amp; did not know that 3000 jews did not go to work on september11? now u are going to ask me the proof again. neither do u have proof that osama did it, nor do I have that he didn't &amp; jews did it.<br><br>But we all can guess from the sophistication of this attact that "twin towers &amp; "1 1" &amp; then september &amp; then 911, (american dialing code for emergency? who thinks of things like that? do u think the dump afghan got so much brain to do such a thing??? U must be dump then.. it's americans all the way from top to bottom...<br><br>even if osama did it, which I doubt, not that he can not, if americans tell him to, he would do it, but I have not seen a single proof that he did it. cos I have seen all his tapes &amp; he only praised the people who did it, but never said he did it. If he is a true muslim, he will not lie... he will specially not lie after americans bombed everything in afghanistan... Mullah Omar told the same thing to BBC the other day that he praises those who did it, but taleban or osama did not do it... so what's the point... if they can invite a super power to destroy their home &amp; still say they did not do it, do u think they are still scared. does it make any difference if they now say that they did do it???? I don't think it does... so get a live people.... stop blaming osama &amp; wake up,,,,,,,,,. alright... u watch too much american tv &amp; most or ur customers come from america, it does not mean that they are right.... I have not seen a single tape on tv, where osama says he did it. I can understand arabic too &amp; everytime osama opens his mouth &amp; says somehting, the american media will mute his sound &amp; start barking &amp; say what they wanna say... it's up to u to believe. I was watching David letterman's show one night after the americans crashed a chinese plane in china &amp; americans were being held up in china &amp; when china was asking bush to apologize.<br><br>letterman had this few minute show where bush was speaking to a gathering of students &amp; telling them how things were, while on the subtitles, it was written, I am stupid, I am very very very sorry, I apologize to all the chinese, &amp; i will never do that again...<br><br>Letterman said that this is the apology we sent to the chinese, offcourse it was a joke, but that is what american media is all about, it;s a joke... &amp; they are all a<br>joke..<br><br>so wake up, americans are liars &amp; they will do anything for their own benefit &amp; this includes giving weapons to israel or money to destroy palestinians so they can continue to have their presence in the middle east. beside israel is their biggest customer...<br><br>oh boy. my neck hurts....<br><br>ok.. thanks for reading &amp; for the few nice jokes...<br>Illegal operation: we would really appreciate if u waste ur time somewhere else? since u were never invited to reply to a troll. Thanks in advance. (E&amp;OE)</div>

If you say that Osama did it &amp; al Qaeda did it, then please forward ur proof...??? </div></blockquote>interesting theory, to be tactful. US refused to publicly show the proof due to secutity concerns. i shan't bother with whether this excuse was valid, but i've mentioned this before in another post: even Dr M accepted the proof shown to him by the US. so did the leaders of Saudi Arabia, even though currently some of their people who were not shown the proof disregard them. S'pore's leaders accepted the proof. in fact, i do not recall any world leader rejecting the proof when shown to them.<br>if, even after so many world leaders accept the proof, you still choose not to believe, then i doubt you will believe even when shown the proof. perhaps you will say the US easily doctored the proof since osama was working for them.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by galvaniZer:</div><div class="quote_body">who came before the prophet yusuf (jesus)</div></blockquote>allow me to provide a little correction.

Ah Beng's grandfather came to Singapore to find a job in 1935. He married Tan Ah Mui, a teochew and gave birth to Ah Beng. Since Ah Beng was born in Singapore, since Ah Beng's grandfather decided to stay in Singapore for good, since Ah Mui lives in Singapore for good too, it makes them Singaporeans.<br><br>Let's see the bigger picture now.
