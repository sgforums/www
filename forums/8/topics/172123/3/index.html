Anyway I think $8k is really very little. Imagine a multimillion coropration CEO could easily earn more than 20k-50k+++ A month. And even a Master Warrant or Colnel in the army earns as much as $8K. $8k is quite underpaid for running a multi million corporation which could be quite draining in your life and time. Imagine an average CEO works about 70 hours a week. Frankly I think its already quite under paid. I could have earn as much and more without running a big organisation like that and working less hours.  Even a specialist surgen or a GP doctor could earn as much and more. What he earns through other means is really none of the public business. If he wants to put on a show... why would he do so at no benefit of himself? Zero pay more working hours and no fringe benefits at all, not to mention that the church doesn't give dividends and shares. Would you guys do that?

            <div class='col-md body'>Alright, I am a member of a neighbourhood church before i turned to joining CHC as a member attenting their sermon's and occasional BS. Firstly i guess most people have the wrong impression on the word "Church".<br>Firstly, It takes lots of money to operate a almost 30,000 strong per sermon church. Never mind what it takes for all the work needed to be done.<br>Next, a school would need around 30,000 per month for bills, after MOE subsidised the cost. Surely a church wouldnt be less.<br>Thirdly, If the pastor or and head or the church shouldnt get paid, nobody would want to do it. We all have families.<br>Fourth, Nobody is forced to give donations, the did out of their own free will, and rest assure nobody will give u a dirty stare.<br><br>The thing i have got to agree is that, the need to build a Titanium body church is not there.</div>

Zero pay more working hours and no fringe benefits at all, not to mention that the church doesn't give dividends and shares. Would you guys do that? I know I wouldn't.<br><br>Since he is offering to do for free as social service to others why the bother and the fuss? Afterall he is not paid.  There are already enough threats of this church... Please close ban thank you.</div></blockquote>You're working on the assumption that a CEO devotes 70 hours a week to his "CEO duties" and that he has to be paid the big bucks by his CEO job because he has no other sources of incomes?<br><br>I believe that many CEOs have alternative sources of income to supplement their CEO salary. Durai and the CHC guy all admitted that they have other sources of income unrelated to their main CEO job. While there is nothing wrong about working many jobs to earn more, nor is there anything wrong about drawing a high pay that you deserve, it does negate their argument about not having enough money to support their family and about being poached over to another organisation.<br><br>Why should people worry that the CHC guy can be paid more in other companies as a CEO? CHC was set up by him, is he blackmailing himself? Durai sat on so many boards, he was even willing to take a cut in pay so as to be able to chair even more boards and committees.<br><br>Another thing that flummoxes me, if a CEO works an average of 70 hours per week, assuming a 6 day work week, that's 11.7 hours per day, where are they going to have time and energy to chair boards, companies and committees outside?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) I think firstly getting the pay and putting the effort by world's standard yea It is quite under paid. Maybe you're saying that a religious person should eat rice only and wear torn and tattered clothes? I think this is not really the case. Perhaps depend on which religion you're looking at. Ever question what the pope wears? I believe in effort for money. If he produce good results and productive he at least deserve a decent pay which in my point of view is underpaid. Furthermore he is volunteering now what more do you want to argue? If you think he should pay back every single cents... let's assume he be working free for the next 20-30 years... I think he already paid everything back with interest not to mention the mingle pay he was getting. There's nothing wrong with getting a decent pay for your effort can't expect him to eat air everyday right.<br><br>2) The 70 hours a week is a statistic done by surveyor and printed on magazines like Fortune.  So no need to argue. Imagining running such a big church on a 9-5 basis is it possible?<br><br>3) I believe every organisation charitable or not should be run in a systematic way. The corporate way is a good and proven method. Sticking to the old ways you'll never grow the church this big. Anyway which big organisation don't run in a corporate manner? The only big organisation that runs in a small chinese business model will only face outdate and corruption. Probably like NKF which lacks transparency.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And personally whether you give tithe it has no relationship to you going to heaven. If you are a christian you should understand that the criteria for having your salvation. Tithing is only for a open heaven... which was a law during the ancient time by the Judasim. Judasim still tithe... I'm sure the church don't teach other wise.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alright now you see, I am a Christian. So what i post may sound bias. According to the previous post and replies, I have to say, there is nothing wrong with living in a multi-million dollar house wearing hugo and stuffs. 8K per month for a Mega-Church like that is definitely not out of the world. Rev.Kong IS rich not because of church, its because he is rich even before that and of course, due to the reason that his wife is a chart-topping singer in the states and uk. What i am trying to mean is, he set up the church for a good reason, and let the members of the church help with the maintaining is definitely not over the border. He used to draw salary from the church, yes thats true, so what is wrong with being a volunteer with decades of years to come? Imagine this, you are rich, and now because if your better half, you are even richer, so what is wrong with buying houses which you love and brands which you like? Its not as though he used our money. Would you say for past decades he had not been contributing?</div>
