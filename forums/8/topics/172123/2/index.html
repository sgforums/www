Like Friars take a vow of poverty so by right they cannot lead an extravagant lifestyle. Parish priests have to handle chruch funds that can amount to very large amounts (ie $12k SGD per week). But unlike certain people, they do not blackmail themselves for million dollar salary (ie since they are handling so big amounts of money, they must be paid big bucks to prevent them from shovelling bushels of cash into their underpants).<br><br>A priest might be issued a car to use to go to hospitals and parishners' place only when the need arises.

            <div class='col-md body'>His wife should STFU too.. I've read a lot of negative remarks about her from websites/blog. Personally i dont like her also cos majority of her 'fans' are church members. They got to buy her album and promote her.  I dont like the idea of promoting her career/album in church. If they want entertainment news, they can log to her website/watch tv or newspaper.<br><br>A lot of singers are Christians also, THEY GO TO CHURCH but none of them promote themself in church. They are just ordinary members in church. At most, they'll be noted. She's a disgrace...</div>

I encountered it in CHC...<br><br>They all tell you that its in the Bible to give a tithe and its "sorta compulsory".<br><br>If you don't give, they give you dirty looks like you're some kind of criminal. They tell you that you're short changing God and that "the more you give, the more assured your place is in heaven"... and they get pissed when I asked them what is the market rate for buying a place in heaven...</div></blockquote>short charging god ??? wah lau, machiam as if their god is like some merchant and u give them less then they KBKB. the argument is flawed lor, God should not care how much or whether if u GIVE at all, since he is supposed to love u all the same, no matter what.<br><br>And what kind of saying is that the more u give, the more assured ur place is in heaven?? Like that I rather burn hell notes, ask my ancestors help me book a place along with them even better. At least u burn hell notes supposedly will reach them below mah. U give money is give to the church, to humans, who knows what they do with the money. Sooner or later, I dare say one of the church will kenna the NKF saga, mishandling of the money</div>
