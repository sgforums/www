            <div class='col-md body'>After going thru the post.. It made me wonder..<br><br>Did success of the church made SUN mo KONG richer.. answer would be yes.<br><br>The success of the church made Kong's books, videos and oversea's pastering success and rich from royalties.<br><br>The success of the church enable SUN to sell concerts and records worldwide.<br><br>Conclusion... would be yes.<br><br>The success of the church also very much depended on zombies doing free advert, recruitment and services.. which truly cut down cost. The tiths are for maintianents of the church which are huge... therfore too much surplus would be available.. and no where to spend, since free zombies are doing all the manual work. Then what built churches lor... but still have funds ... built titanium structure lor...<br><br>You see the problem.. they do not want the money to acumilate .. and have  NKF problems. KONG then says no salary.. because he already benefited from the church tidings wat.<br><br>They can actually do more social donations but did not... they can even setup a funds for poor members, but instead they taught our young to be materialistic and .... do the money goes to god ???? HOW ??? Burnt it to him  !!!! so why hunting ferociously for tiths<br><br></div>
