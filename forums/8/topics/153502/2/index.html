            <div class='col-md body'>That is their prob, now ours. What have been doing here in singapore? Ape the westerners also rite..It is wrong to say only after the indian beauties won the crowns were they becoming westernised...They are already westernised during time of the british occupation of India. If u watched some old black and white Indian movies, the western culture was already found..<strong>They are the same as those old western movies where people sing songs and dance.I think it is u who is inferiorty complex ridden , not them for u feel other cultures and people who u deemd as inferior have long surpassed you and u did not even realised it</strong>......What do u mean by learning to talk, dress, smile ect? Aishwarya and Sushmita are educated professionals..Asihwaya is an architecture graduate....For our info, they can talk english better than most hong kong stars..India was westernised even before singapore was a just fishing village...So dont bad mouth others when yr own back is dirty...Ghandi was already talking about non violence and  freedom when Singaporeans were still fishing in the sea...<br><br>Liberating effect or cultural oppression are not issues here. These women represet the new gender equality idea...They are new age modern women no longer oppresed by outdated ideas conceived by men to control women<br><br>for you rinfo, ashwaraya rejected mr Bond's offer to act in his film because of kissing scenes. They know where to draw the line..Give me a single case of a sex scandals involving this beauties. U can find any...but look at the hollywood and hong kong stars..plenty....<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by crazy monkey:</div><div class="quote_body">To the inferiority complex ridden Indian elites, the Indian beauties who won international crowns gave them a hope, that if they continue to ape the West in its mannerisms, lifestyle, consumption patterns, fashion designs and what have you, they will one day make it to world class, just as Sushmita and Aishwarya did by learning to walk, talk, dress, smile and wear makeup like Hollywood stars.<br><br>On the surface, participation in these beauty contests may even give the impression of having a liberating effect on the supposedly tradition-bound Indian women by encouraging them to enhance their physical and sexual appeal.<br><br>To see Indian women parading confidently in front of men and being sexually provocative could be seen as a sign of self-assertion of their womanhood and sexuality.
