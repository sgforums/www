            <div class='col-md body'>by Koh Kok Kway<br><br>After a long talk with a senior politician, pilots representing Alpa-S (Alamak, Lee Paying Attention Â– Sorry!), the union body of SIA (Sir, IÂ’m Apologetic) pilots, have pledged to start afresh on improving their relations with their employers.<br><br>In the 2 hour dialogue session, it was reported that mention of Â‘playing of ducks and drakesÂ’ and Â‘sacred cowsÂ’ drove the message across to pilots as both parties grappled over contentious issues.<br><br>Â“Wah lan eh, the moment he said he would play ducks and drakes with us, I thought, our goose is cooked oreddy,Â” Captain Wah Chin Kiang analyzed. Â“DonÂ’ch play-play, man. Now got bird flu, got mad cow disease, how to fight with him on ducks and drakes? An when he mentioned killing sacred cows, I knew we all kio tio goo lan!Â”<br><br>Chairman of Alpa-S, Captain Hua Puay Ki, concluded after the meeting that the pilots will not seek to peg their salaries against their higher paid international counterparts.<br><br>Â“We are deeply apologetic for our folly which caused all this hoo-ha. After the long talk, we have realised how well and kind the management has been to us. Even the government has been caring enough to step in to enlighten us. <strong>They are truly worth every cent of their high salaries, even if itÂ’s benchmarked against that of high-flyers in other parts of the private sector.Â” </strong><br><br>When interviewed, a pilot, who declined to be named, appeared unsettled and perturbed.<br><br>Â“Die lah. Why I so suay?Â” He lamented. Â“I just only bought six houses in China, Australia and England. Some more my kids are now studying overseas in Melbourne. Siao liao lah! My friend already kena shoot liao. I better shut up now before they come up with a thick file on me next.Â”<br><br>Captain Hua summed up the mood of the moment.<br><br>Â“We were warned about Â‘broken headsÂ’ and thus we need to re-affirm our intentions to make the relationship with the management friendlier,Â” he said. Â“Wah, <strong>now be pilot also not good man, itÂ’s a riskier job then most think. The higher you try to fly, the greater your chance of breaking your head.Â”</strong><br><br>He is contemplating the possibility of quitting his current job in the near future to settle for a less stressful job. He did not rule out on a shock move to assume the post of President of the Singapore Kite Flying Association. <strong>Â“Now fly plane so hard. Think got no choice, lah. We go fly kite better.Â”</strong><br><br>To aid in helping their pilots consider alternative careers, Alpa-S will be issuing all its members copies of Â“What Colour is My Parachute?Â”<br><br>Â© http://www.TalkingCock.com 2001-2003.
