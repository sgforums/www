            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm, Anyway, just wondering on what basis are the guys comparing SG girls to girls from other countries. Do they REALLY know girls from other countries that are supposedly demure, nice, un-materialistc?? I mean, i would suppose that girls from other countries would have girls who are like that as well, not just Singaporean girls..<br>I guess there isn't any concrete basis to prove that SG girls are like, unless to some of the guys, who have faced problems with SG girls before. *Shrugs*<br><br>And guys are also materialistic to some extent. Probably not as evident in fashion, but probably in gadgets, etc etc...<br><br>In any case, this thread probably won't get anywhere.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Oh yeah, and I believe that Singaporean gals care for thier families more than girls from other countries....

            <div class='col-md body'>Only the minority? Hmm, I must say that the girls I've met, most of them have been very pleasent. True enough, there have been experiances of the so called "SG girls" that some of you guys have described, but I beg to differ that the majority of the gals in Singapore are materialistic, or money faced.<br><br>Maybe some of us are too critical on the way we judge people?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, maybe you are lucky or maybe your definition of a good girl are different from mine. Good as i had said before good is a very subjective terms. Being good as in a good plain friends, a good wife or good colleague?? Good in what sense? If most sg girl are good in a sense that you will consider them your lifetime partner, then why are we having singlehood problem in the first place? Could it be that their expectation are too high cause they think they are too good to be settling down with a plain local man or the local guy are typically too lousy to be consider a good partner? Why are there long queue every working day at the SIR for pple applying PR status esp for their foreign wife? Have anyone care to analyzed?<br><br>There is no condemn done to put down <strong>ALL</strong> SG girl. Not <strong>all</strong> sg girls are bad and hence being condemned but just that fact are stated to point out the moving trend of our female populations. When such trend is noted, the local guy should know how to tackle. The advice which you will not find too unfamiliar for local guy is to start building up your career, forget about dating too much at your young age when you should be studying hard. Once your path is stable, you will not have too much problem maintain a bgr in the future.<br><br>On the street of singapore, you can see lots of teenager behaving like ah-beng, smoking, playing cool just to get the attention of those girl. Do you think they will be successful?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in the animal kingdom (i am not saying we are animals, but we do belong to the animal kingdom, don't we?    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">), a female chooses a male (or a male attracts a female) based on certain genetical attribute so that her offspring will live and become mature into adults. in the human world, i believe there will be a similar too...its all part of a natural selection process...<br><br>similarly, if a guy can ask for a gal to be pretty (believe this is the opinion of more than 1 guy), then whats wrong if a gal ask for a guy to be able to provide for her.<br><br>but then again, a person's thinking may change over time. as a person matures and begins to understand what they really want from relationships, these criteria to be good looking or must have a lot of money may change or shift in priorities...<br><br>Unless the gal specifically says and bases everything solely on $ and material items, would that really be the materialistic one many have been refering to.

Sg women realised life wld be more exciting &amp; less stressful wifout such losers....they can survive wifout loser sg guys...Very True indeed or else why do we have a high percentage of educated single career woman that make the government frown?<br>Circumstances had made the wheel turned around. I donno why also but there's nothing wrong in these sg women. They have their freedom to do what ever they like.<br><br>Just like what you had said, it's none of your business if local guy had diverted to getting foreign wife. That's their problem n not yours. You are earning your own money, enjoying your life as a sg woman. The idea of the discussion is to make known to others the trend of our modern female population's thinking. To advise those teenagers to build themselve up instead of being considered a loser on the street. Study hard when young instead of dreaming, playing with puppy love and even commit suicide just becos of a girl just like the news not long ago (a lad jumping off the flat opp his ex-gf's flat).<br><br>It's a sad case when you see lots of ah-beng on the street cho-bo and wasting their life away, trying to woo girls off the street with their coolness and handsome look without themselve realising the fact that these girls are no longer those simple ah-lian of the past. Puppy love might be what they seek but how long are they going to last with it? Love without bread (or MAC) won't last cos $$$ counts in bgr in this practical world.</div>

Pls enlighten me.<br><br>Maybe this is true. What i can say is this, foreign girl who come over to sg to work are typically more hardworking just like those foreign guy. They came over, being alone and independent tend to do more housework. I would think there's nothing wrong if we the local guy want them as partner.<br><br>Take for example, like my ex company's china project manager. His China wife typically do every housechore you can think of so that her husband have no worry and concentrate in his business. It came to me a surprise that he had never iron his clothes b4 in his entire lifetime but always was his mother and now his wife who prepare his ironed clothes and breakfast every morning b4 he come to work. Both already long term PRs in singapore.<br>My wife being a malaysian like to be a small woman at home instead doing all the housechore. She likes to keep things tidy and cook every meal instead of wasting money eating out. As for ironing and washing of clothes, since i was already used to doing those for myself at home, i insisted doing my own sometime even when she offers to help. She commented that malaysian guy are generally more mcp and let the wife do every housechore while they concentrate in working just like my ex project-manager.<br><br>Yet again, we have such kind of sg woman who like to do housechore. But is it a majority? And don mistake me again, doing housechore is not a must have quality cos in sg, i think everybody is busy working and making $$$ to keep up with our ever increasing high standard of living to pay off debt ( car loan, HBD flat loan etc etc). Who got time to bother with all these?</div>
