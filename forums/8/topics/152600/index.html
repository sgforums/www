            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I'd like to ask a question.<br><br>We all know animals can camouflage themselves. Like zebra with their stripes. They can blend in among the tall grass. Or polar bear with the white fur, to blend in with the snow.<br><br>OK.<br><br>The question is. How do they do it?<br><br>I mean, does a zebra think like this 'OK that lion looks like it's going to eat me and there are so many tall grass here, I better tell my hair cells to start drawing stripes. That seems like a good idea for me and my species.'<br><br>And, does a polar bear think like this 'OK all this snow is white all over, I better tell my hair cells to grow white, it will help me and my species to blend in.'<br><br>And let me move on to another similar example. Plants.<br><br>You know a rose? flowers.<br><br>Are roses beautiful? Are flowers beautiful?<br><br>Flowers are very pleasing to the eyes, even for human eyes. How do the plants do it, really? It's so sophisticated and complex isn't it?<br><br>Have u ever really looked at a flower? The bright color, the pattern, the symmetry. They attracted  bees (visually as well) and even humans. How the plants can figure out what other creatures deem as beauty?<br><br>That, is a big question, really. Isn't it?<br><br>Can anyone give some insights? Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Something to do with the gene pool.. anyway this is what I remember from my biology...<br><br>Let say for a certain insect that lives on tree trunks. Many many years ago, its ancestors come in varied colors. Those who are bright and colorful are eaten up by predators. That leaves a small proportion of dull colored insects that eventually reproduce and form the insects that live today..<br><br>So in other words its survival of the fittest. Animals and plants that you see today are the remaining ones that survived due to their special color/properties etc.. And since those that we see are the majority, we tend to think that they must be of that color.. eg. there might have been white zebras in the beginning<br><br>This is just my laymen 2 cents  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Mr. Li,<br><br>I always found that your post is very serious. Very different from the atmosphere in chit chat forum.<br><br>I try to be as serious. Hope no one will laugh at me.<br><br>I tend to believe your question comes with an intention - hoping people to answer it with evolution principle. I think the following conversation kind of proves it.<br><br>Before I give my input, I want to let you know that there are plenty of literature out there answering your questions. So, go Google. You will find some of them useful.<br><br>Why animal becomes the way they are? The answer can be both philosophical and technical. From the viewpoint of philosophy, they are of course what they are. Sounds zen? But this is true.<br><br>Technically, or in term of evolution, survivors the fittest. I think someone mentioned it. It needs no need to think in the way that 'I want to hide myself in the desert, so I better develop into something more complicated'. No, there is no such a need.<br><br>The nature will select those genes that fit the environment. So only those zebra which could hide themselves better survive and passed down their genes. After many many generations, you see the current zebra.<br><br>Rose. Is rose beautiful? I think not everyone agrees to it. Baby might not agree. But if you keep telling baby that rose is beautiful. It becomes beautiful. Of course, I am not denying that the symmetric of rose isn't something, but it is simply not the foundation of beauty.<br><br>The sense to differentiate beauty is mainly influenced by experience and knowledge gained later.<br><br>Go read Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene and River out of Eden. You will gain more insight to the current academia thinking.</div>
