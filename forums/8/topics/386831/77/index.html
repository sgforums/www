              <p>KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's former premier Mahathir Mohamad claimed the Sept 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, which killed nearly 3,000 people, were staged as an excuse to 'mount attacks on the Muslim world'.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the General Conference for the Support of Al-Quds (Jerusalem) here, Tun Dr Mahathir said killing as an excuse for war is not new to the US.</p>
              <p>He also argued that Israel was created to solve the 'Jewish problem' in Europe, saying the Holocaust had failed as a final solution against the community.</p>
              <p>'In September 2001, the World Trade Center was attacked allegedly by terrorists. I am not sure now that Muslim terrorists carried out these attacks. There is strong evidence that the attacks were staged. If they can make Avatar, they can make anything,' The Malaysian Insider reported Dr Mahathir as saying.</p>
              <p>The former premier said Israel was created after the Europeans failed to massacre the Jewish community.</p>
              <p>'The Jews had always been a problem in European countries. They had to be confined to ghettoes and periodically massacred. But still they remained, they thrived and they held whole governments to ransom.</p>
              <p>'Even after their massacre by the Nazis of Germany, they survived to continue to be a source of even greater problems for the world,' said Dr Mahathir, who was noted for his anti-Western and anti-Zionist stand while in power for 22 years, until October 2003.</p>
              <p>Dr Mahathir also expressed his disappointment in US President Barack Obama, who marked his first year in office yesterday.</p>
              <p>'I am a bit disappointed because so far none of his promises has been kept. He promised to get out from Afghanistan but he ended up sending more troops there instead. He promised to close down Guantanamo but he has not closed down Guantanamo.</p>
              <p>'It is quite easy to promise during election time but you know there are forces in the United States which prevent the president from doing some things. One of the forces is the Jewish lobby,' he said.</p>

              <p>Yes, not cheap. I did contemplate on buying a MB watch, but i got quite a few watches liaw. And its kinda pointless, u can only wear so many watches per wrist.  Its like u can only drive so many cars, eat so much food. sigh.. but i also believe that money is to be spent ma. lol! Stress man..</p>
              <p>U dun need wait so long.. u just need to save up. lol! And then think.. is the juice.. worth the squeeze !</p>

              <p>On a side note:</p>
              <p><em>&gt; Sin Chew Daily</em> reported that two Vietnamese sisters from
              Ho Chih Minh City had married Singaporean men to enable them to fund
              the education of their brother back home.</p>
              <p>The sisters, aged 20
              and 22, were working as labourers in sewing factories, and their
              earnings were not enough to support their 14-year-old brother’s
              education. Their parents are farmers.</p>
              <p>They decided to look for
              husbands in the island republic after their friends who married locals
              told them that Singaporean men were more loving and would not beat
              their wives.</p>
              <p><em>Sin Chew</em> also reported that Singapore police
              were in the process of buying gambling tables and Roulette tables to
              enable them to learn to detect cheats.</p>
              <p>A police spokesman was reported as saying that the training would cover Blackjack, Caribbean Stud and Texas Hold’em.       <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="icon_surprised.gif">)</p>
              <p>Time to go to your friendly policeman friend's house to gamble..  in the name of the law !</p>
