              <p>singaporeans can be rude and confrontational too. They like to debate their point in your face until you die.</p>
              <p>if you like living in a 3 room apartment that cost USD400k, then go for it.</p>
              <p>better, cheaper and faster culture. Stress out.</p>
              <p>singapore is design to make people work - everybody stands, everybody walks, everybody runs. Motion creates work. Therefore you hardly see seats at the bus stop or the shopping malls. Because the PAP govt wants you to stand not to laze around.</p>
              <p>Big income gap between the normal work-to-death singaporean middle class professionals and the PAP robing ministers who earn $3 mil a year and pentecostal pastors who earn $500k a year.</p>
              <p>Hot and humid weather. Prepare to sweat a lot. And bath 2 times a day.</p>

Foods are never an issue, but for a healthier and environmentally friendly like you, go for a bit different at least several days a week ... http://www.vegetarian-society.org/fdl A lot of activities, like fund raising run,walk, communities relaxation, indoor, outdoor, convenient of public transport....list goes on.... and the dignity of humanology depends on how you want your heart &amp; mind to be. finally, if you decided to stay in sg, let go US when u r in sg land, for goodness sake, otherwise, the comparison never end and your self-psychiatrist may stigmatize you....</p></div>

              <p>ARe you really sure you want to settle down in Singapore?    Singapore is rated very low where human right is concerned.   The govt is ever ever money hungry on getting people to pay and pay and keeps giving rise to the cost of living.     Majority in Singapore agree that the singapore citizens are treated second or third class people in their own country.,</p>
