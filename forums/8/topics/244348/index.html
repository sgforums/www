But there are others who said other wise too.<br>Cause i can actually qualify for a better JC too, so did i make the wrong choice as what the article said its most probably a wrong move?<br>Also, its said that a gpa of 3.5 and above will have a higher chance of securing a place in the uni, how true issit, and is it very difficult to obtain this score?<br>Thanks!</div>
