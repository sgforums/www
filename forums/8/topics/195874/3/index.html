One of the more fun experiences was trying out wines made by an ex-SAS officer and now film producer who owns his own vineyards in New South Wales - we started talking after I commented on his TT Blue Sub, by which time he'd already spotted my SD, and we got into a conversation about the Sub's versatility.<br><br>Yes, fifity years ago it may have been a faux pas to wear a Sub with a tux, but Ian Fleming's done a lot of good work in that department.  The Sub/SD may not be the most pricey timepiece out there, but it's as much of a timeless design as a PP Calatrava. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>On top of that, I can still wear my SD when I'm running, diving or wearing a T-shirt and jeans, all of which would look awkward with an FM, Lange, VC or Patek.<br><br>The Rolex 3135 movement is already COSC rated - why would I want a tourbillon?  If I wanted that kind of accuracy, I'd go for a Seiko Spring Drive which is as accurate and is more reliable.<br><br>Anyway, being a watch nut I like seeing watch photos that people have taken personally, rather than press or advertisement shots.

If it is, you may be able to recalibrate the hands and reset them to zero by yourself.  before moving over to Rolex, Seiko was my favourite brand.<br><br>Oris is much better value for money than TAG or Omega.  If you're in the $1000-2000 range, try the Oris TT1 Chrono.  If you want to move up further, I would suggest the Breitling Chrono Avenger M1 - it's got these cool magnetically-activated pushers that allow you to use the chronograph functions underwater, and the movement's rated as a quartz COSC, if I recall correctly.  I'm thinking of getting one of those as a beater.</div>
