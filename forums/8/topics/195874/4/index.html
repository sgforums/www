Within that price range, they'd be the ones to go for.  Actually, if you want to go for something well-made and relatively scarce in an even lower bracket, take a look at Vixa or Sinn.  Vixa's build quality is usually very good, and I'm sure one-niner can vouch for Sinn.</div>

One of the more fun experiences was trying out wines made by an ex-SAS officer and now film producer who owns his own vineyards in New South Wales - we started talking after I commented on his TT Blue Sub, by which time he'd already spotted my SD, and we got into a conversation about the Sub's versatility.<br><br>Yes, fifity years ago it may have been a faux pas to wear a Sub with a tux, but Ian Fleming's done a lot of good work in that department.  The Sub/SD may not be the most pricey timepiece out there, but it's as much of a timeless design as a PP Calatrava. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>On top of that, I can still wear my SD when I'm running, diving or wearing a T-shirt and jeans, all of which would look awkward with an FM, Lange, VC or Patek.<br><br>The Rolex 3135 movement is already COSC rated - why would I want a tourbillon?  If I wanted that kind of accuracy, I'd go for a Seiko Spring Drive which is as accurate and is more reliable.<br><br>Anyway, being a watch nut I like seeing watch photos that people have taken personally, rather than press or advertisement shots.  Got any of your FM?</div></blockquote>You are absolutely right about Rolex's elegance. That I won't question.

Slap that liar in the face!<br><br>Swatch owns Omega, and Omega and TAG tend to use Eterna ebauches.  An ebauch is a generic movement (or mechanism) that is bought by another manufacturer and customised.<br><br>Rolex, on the other hand, make all of their own movements.  The last non-Rolex movement in a Rolex was the Zenith El Primero in the Daytona, before Rolex finally introduced their in-house 4130 movement in 2000.  The 3130/3135/3185/3186 movements that power the rest of their Oyster line are designed and built by Rolex, and the 31XX line can trace its heritage back to the cal. A2XX movements, also designed and produced by Rolex and installed in the Explorer, Submariner and Turn-O-Graph models of 1953.</div>
