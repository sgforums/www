You have heaps of fun.<br><br>If the internet and a forum such as this is so anonymous, why then are there people who take pleasure in meeting people they can click with? Why bother to find out who someone who flames you is in real life? Can you shut it off just like what is the people here are supposed to do? Fine. I take the point that there are people who have no want to meet up and befriend other people. Be consistent then.<br><br>In my view I think its exrememly audacious to slap someone in the face metaphorically and then say "hey, take it with a pinch of salt." I'm all for being mature and see what life has to offer to widen my perspective, but when things have gone too far, they have gone too far. No matter what variations of excuses centering around journalism/ real life reporting or whatever pursuits a person can come up with.<br><br>I might be reading too much into this in terms of the principles behind it. Oh well. So I take things seriously sometimes.<br><br>On a brighter note, I did get to understand a bit more about myself out of this, thanks to 2 bright young men who shall remain nameless, and a few lovely ladies.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>1) That there is a right and wrong in specific cases.<br><br>2) We should make no apologies for our sexuality. Yes, Coco, thats me talking.<br><br>3) Talk carefully in IRC. There are people who don't value trust as much as you do. Someone warned me about that a long time ago, but its my loss to forget that. Will you ever forgive me Elva?<br><br>Et tu Buffy? Woe is me.<br><br>On the other hand (no, my other hand is not doing that "otherthing". Not today anyway), without such a controversial scandal or sorts, there would be no such interesting discussion. Such a paradox.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 02 October 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Im sure if any of HKitty's victims actually say something that is not acceptable, that conversation won't be here as well. HKitty knows her limits and what i feel is, if the victims themselves don't mind much about it, why should the others be so fed up?<br>And also, like what some of the rest have said, HKitty didn't mean any harm in doing this, this in fact should be taken as a joke rather than anything else. Before Hkitty posted my conversation with her inside, i already knew im going to be one of the victims. But knowing the real HKitty, i believe she won't do anything really bad.<br>Some things are meant to be taken seriously and some are not.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Kitty,<br><br>i just wanted to say that i really did like you, not that it matters to you or not, right? even though you're foul mouthed, i still like you then, i'll always remember your efforts to talk to me pleasantly. i sensed that you know that i don't like vulgarities, you made every effort not to spew those at me and i appreciate that. i guess i still like you a little for me to bother to try to explain.<br><br>you mentioned about someone being nice to you and then stabbing you in the back, i don't know if you meant me. but i want you to know, i don't stab people in the back, i do it to their faces.<br><br>we both have different stands on this matter and by now, i think you've a taste of the hurt some of these people may feel, regardless of the fact whether they posted their displeasure or not. you may think that i've butted my nose where it's not wanted but it did offend and saddened me to see you poke fun at them using something as sensitive as the issue of sex.<br><br>if you want the kind of cyber friend (i'm being too presumptous here for you may not even consider me a cyber friend) who will stand by you regardless whether you're in the right or wrong, then i can never be that kind of friend to you. i always believe that good friends are those who have the guts to tell one off when one's in the wrong.<br><br>but do think about this Kitty, what kind of friends support you all the way if you're in the wrong? you'll never learn anything that way. if they do make an effort to make you see that you've been wrong when you've cooled off, then they're friends indeed but if they add fuel to fire, take care, Kitty.<br><br>i never intended to flame you, this is an open forum, just like you, i have the right to post how i feel.<br><br>and i'm not here to win some Popularity contest, neither am i here to lecture you, perhaps because i'm older than you, i see things differently. i see how fragile egos can be even though we present a brave front but inside, it bleeds and it hurts to be laughed at.<br><br>just thought i'll explain a little.<br><br>and lest anyone here thinks that i did what i did because of pacman, rest assured it's not. i would have done the same thing even if his log wasn't posted. and yes, i still lurvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvve him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 03 October 2000).]</div>
