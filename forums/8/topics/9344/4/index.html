            <div class='col-md body'>I initially found this this topic rather amusing. But why not put ourselves<br>in the shoes of those if any who might have been adversely affected by it.<br><br>And so what if subsequently none of the so called victims ever felt victimised? (But there are quite a few who are offended) That's not the issue.<br><br>The point here being, did Hello Kitty ever take into consideration their feelings?<br><br>The general mindset here is "I think this thread is funny." "Why make such a big deal out of it?" "If you dare do it, why be afraid for all to see, unless you<br>are of course guilty."<br><br>Are we even in the positon to make such comments? When we might not even be<br>implicated or adversely affected in this particular incident.<br>Such words are cheap. It doesn't cost you a thing to say it. Especially when you aren't even the affected party. A appropiate expression would be, "if the thorns ain't pricking you, you will not feel the pain."<br><br>And this brings me to Hello Kitty. Those who know her well would know she's playful and full of crappy talk. Sometimes you have to cater yourself to her online character. And it was with this intention that might have led them into the conversation, and in the course of it, earning undesired publicity.<br><br>As much as I enjoyed this thread, aren't the victims justified in their actions? The doubt creeping in that some might now have a negative albeit misunderstood opinion of them?<br><br>So will there be any form of discrimination? Most probably not. Unfounded worries? Maybe, but unfortunately, the doubt might perpetually remain. It's not as simplistic as some of us might perceive.<br><br>I do know of at least one or two victims who have been very upset over this whole incident. Mainly because they are known personally among the Sgforums circle of peers. Despite some of your unsavoury airing of grievances (like hurling abuses and curses) on IRC earlier in the day, I do understand your plight.<br><br>The bottomline is, try looking at things from a victims perspective. And like mentioned above, some of them do feel offended. Lets not just look at the surface of things. It might be funny to you, but not to them.<br><br>As for Colette, I do agree with some of the things you said. But hurling abuses like "bitch" doesn't really speak too well of you.<br><br>And what about me? Am I one of the victims "ganging up" against Hello Kitty?<br>Why is it that when we practise impartiality, we are deemed to be ganging up against her? Just because as her cyber friend, we are suppose to stick by her irregardless of any inappropiate behaviour? Lets put it this way. Eck, Pacman and several others weren't even adversely affected. Why should they even have bother getting embroiled in this controversy? Unfortunately, there are people who are guilty of standing up for her, oblivious to any of her misdeeds.<br><br>Taking into account her playful and immatured personality, I for one never thought she ever harboured any malicious intentions. Presumption it was plain and harmless on her part, without taking into consideration the possible repercussions and consequences.<br><br>Do I feel upset over it? I am but a anonymous character hiding behind a nick. And thus it seriously never did affect me. Just let me hide behind the veil of a new identity, attend future forum outings, and prey on cute and beloved Yandaos like FNU and Pacman.<br><br>[This message has been edited by y2care (edited 03 October 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Neurotica,<br><br>i've been thinking why i'm so affected by this matter and today, yes today, finally it hit me. it's the issue of trust, one's right to privacy and the duplicity of human nature. when i first read the first few posts, i was already offended but when it just grew and grew and grew, i guess i lost it then and today i know a little better why.<br><br>maybe i'm afraid that similiar things will happen to me with those i ICQ with or email with. with some people, i've been more than trusting with my feelings and words, i don't wish one day to read of my private thoughts in this public forum, i just don't want to be hurt that way. i'm not afraid of my thoughts becoming public, it's the betrayal of trust that i don't think i can handle, that i've been made a gossip piece in the wild wild net. gossip is a fact of life and i practice it myself, but gossips between friends and being in the public glare, duh, that's two very different kettle of fishes altogether.<br><br>sgforums is so small, perhaps the entire population, regular population anyway, doesn't exceed 50 users, duh, personally i've multiple nicks in this forum, so i believe although we see a lot new nicks, basically, it would be just the regulars abandoning their old nicks for reasons known only to themselves.<br><br>it was with a sick, sinking feeling that i realised i may have been foolish to think that people can be trusted, especially on the Net, man, am i naive and stupid at 32 or what? and this matter has shaken me, making me ask myself, can i even trust those i'm in contact with almost daily and whom i thought i knew?<br><br>when i first came to this forum, i was going through a rough patch in my life, this forum was a distraction, then it became an addiction, i never thought that i would stay this long but i have made friends (well, i hope that they regard me as a friend) and i am happy for that. now, i ask myself, the friendships i thought i made these months, are they even real or are they just figament of my imagination. do we keep in touch because it's better than nothing or because we genuninely enjoy each other's company? i don't expect undying support or devotion but basic trust is a must, isn't it, in any relationship?<br><br>i read of the defence that no damage has been done, that the people involved are not even complaining, so why should i kick up a fuss, i didn't know it then but now i know why, i kicked up a fuss because besides feeling outrage which was also as much for them as for myself, i felt fear, i fear being hurt. at least to me, there was damage done, yes, i know that i've repeatedly said that i don't get involved, that my cyber life and my real life are separate but i guess not. i ask myself, why do i even bother to spend hours in front of the screen daily, keeping in touch with people i've never even met when i've have real friends waiting for me, friendships to renew, relationships to maintain and strengthen? why do i read posts that may not even be a reflection of the poster, why do i care? because i've become attached to this place, that was my greatest mistake. everything seems to be a joke here because it's the CYBERSPACE, but i can't take this type of joke.<br><br>i don't intend to drag this at all, just that this has shaken me badly, that's all.<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 03 October 2000).]</div>
