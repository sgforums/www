            <div class='col-md body'>THE first group of undergraduates from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) to go for six-month stints of study and work overseas will leave next year, with 250 of them flying to China and the United States.<br><br>They will go to five renowned Chinese and American universities where it is hoped they will, among other things, be better able 'to argue a point and see more angles in issues'.<br><br>In expressing this hope, the university's president, Professor Su Guaning, also disclosed that it is looking at sending students to India as well as neighbouring Asian countries.<br><br>It will also be expanding the pool heading abroad each year. The target is for one in five of its annual enrolment of 4,000 undergraduates to go on these stints.<br><br>In the meantime, the pioneer group will head for five universities: Beijing, Tsinghua and Shanghai Jiaotong in China and the University of Washington and Georgia Institute of Technology in the US. They will also get to work in start-up companies.<br><br>These two countries were picked because China is the world's fastest growing economy and the US, the world's largest economy.<br><br>By going there, the NTU students will understand better how the important economies of the world function, said Prof Su.<br><br>He also hopes the students will network with other students and colleagues in the start-up companies and be infected by their enthusiasm and entrepreneurial spirit.<br><strong><br>Studying abroad will give them that 'competitive edge' too, he added. 'They are well prepared in their chosen discipline, but there is a gap - in their ability to talk back, to argue a point, to be broader in their outlook and to see more angles in issues.<br><br>'We hope their time abroad will close the gap,' he said.<br></strong><br>Part of the costs involved will be borne by the students while the university is seeking sponsors to help pay for the rest.<br><br>Tuition fees in top US universities can amount to US$10,000 (S$17,000) for six months.<br><br>The NTU scheme is similar to that at the National University of Singapore (NUS), which has in the last two years set up colleges in Silicon Valley and Philadelphia in the US and Shanghai in China. Its students can do courses at universities there or work in companies.<br><br>The NTU students are thrilled at the prospect of an overseas experience.<br><br>Said first-year business student Diane Lim, 20: 'I have always wanted an overseas education, because you can't beat the kind of exposure you can get abroad.<br><br>'But of course I couldn't afford it, so six months in the US and China is the perfect alternative for me.'<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>so we are openly acknowledging the fact that a local university education is not as good as an overseas one? that the gaps will exist when one studies locally?<br></div>
