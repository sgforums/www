            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I've been trying to break out of this vicious cycle that has been occuring in my life. Currently still a student  in a poly. I've noticed a similar pattern in my life. I always screw up in major examinations. For instance, it has always been my goal to get into a fairly good secondary sch, however my results were only average and it got me into a neighbourhood school. Worked hard and aim to get into the better classes in my secondary school and did so. After tht proceeded into 1st 3 mths Jc. Thoroughly enjoyed my time there and wanted to stay on. The worst happened and i flunked my eng.<br><br>Never would have expected my eng as it has been one of my more comfortable subjects. Sadly, couldnt stay on and had to move on to a polytechnic. It was one of my only chance of redeeming myself(how i felt tht time lar). Bcos of my eng , i dare not apply to take business related courses in poly. It has been a struggle since, coping with a course i do not enjoy.(taking computer related course). Maybe it's because i just werent prepared to go to a polytechnic, hence , the condemnation of everything in poly. This prejudice against it. Though i retok my eng and got a B3, i stayed on in poly due to the fact it felt funny going back to a jc again.<br><br>Now that my poly course is coming to an end, i am aiming to further studies elsewhere, most probably overseas. Sometimes i just wonder what it takes to jsut succeed in this world. I am tired and seriously at times pessimistic about my future. Anyone had similar experiences? Is it that it has to do with my mental state, over time reinforcing my thoughts that thigns would not work out that in the end the results are expected? Maybe you  guys can provide me an insight on how to break out of this vicious cycle of life? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I define success as able to achieve my full potential. There's this saying that if you put your mind into doing something, nothing is impossible.

I guess environment has a part to play in me being so pent up and closed up. Friends are just selfish, boring , or plain inconsiderate. No offence to poly students, maybe it's jsut the guys in my class, but i found i could relate and chat better with the friends i had in jc. Hmm....i want to quit ranting and whining. Only option is to look forward. Sounds easier said than done. I have to try. Do you believe that each of us are endowed with diffenret gifts and talents? Or rather the sheer power of the mind to succeed to allow one to make good in life?<br><br>Haha, or rather it's just me. Do share with me your views and suggestions.
