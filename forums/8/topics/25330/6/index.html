            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by jOhO:<br><strong>i was just talking to a female fren about this..<br>this is the way i worded the question:<br><br>if a couple was arguing and really angry with other... and each gave a slap to the other, and say both slapped each other at the same time, for the purposes of this problem, then who is [b]more</strong> wrong?<br><br>she thought about it for a while.. and since i worded the question this way.. she had no choice but to say both are equally wrong.<br><br>but she HAD to add further that "no matter wat i just have this deep feeling guys shouldn't hit gals..."<br><br>so i said..  so u feel stronger about guys hitting gals, than gals hitting guys? she replied yes.. it just FEELS that way...<br><br>the only saving grace is that she's obviously female, so she'd have a better idea of how it feels for a gal to be hit.. (not that i know whether she's actually been hit b4)<br><br>now i conclude, just becos u are female and know how hurtful (physically and emotionally) it is to get beaten by your loved one, doesn't mean it's MORE PAINFUL than if u are a guy!!!!<br><br>i'm quite thru with this topic chamenos... help me buddy!!!<br><br>it's not a guys vs gals topic..<br>it's a logic vs emotions topic...<br>and fuck i guess guys are more logical and gals more emotional...[/b]</blockquote>to everyone here: what joho is trying to say is that people tend to feel its ok to hit a guy and very wrong to hit a girl, whereas my stand, his, and AD's is that hitting anyone is usually not called for and should be avoided, whether the person is a male or female.<br><br>i guess the reason people in singapore feel that hitting a guy is ok but not a girl, is partly because the laws here send such a message. women are regularly convicted of similar crimes as men, and a fairly common form of punishment besides a jail term or fine is the archaic and barbaric practice of caning men. women are completely exempted from it.<br><br>parents set an example for their children, the same way a government sets an example for the people. as a result of the government using fines or other monetary disincentives to enforce certain laws here, singaporeans have become more money-minded and kiasu; and as a result of the legislated discrimination that men face in terms of the corporal punishment metted out by the courts, singaporeans think physically abusing men is no big deal, but women who are capable of the same misdeeds as men are somehow above men and exempted from it.<br><br>the "men get caned but not women" argument as another common rebuttal that i get from people when asked about this issue. i guess the point of this post is that unless the government changes the policy of caning by either allowing it for both men and women, or completely scrapping it, the message most people thinking with their emotions and hormones and not with their minds are going to get is that its ok beat the crap out of a man but not a woman under the same circumstances.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
