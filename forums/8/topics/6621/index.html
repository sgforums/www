            <div class='col-md body'>Racism is giving different treatment to people based on their race.  It can be very mild like thinking that africans have beautiful voice to more extreme treatments like genocyde.<br><br>While mass extermination of a race should be prevented by any means necessary, one really cannot help but committing other acts of racism.  For example, every time my room mate decides not to stay in the hall anymore, I spend the next few days dreading that the next one who comes along may be an Indian.  I cannot handle the smell of the incense that always seems to waft out from them.  Maybe not all Indians carry this smell, I'm sure to them this smell is good, but those that I've met make me dizzy after 1/2 an hour.<br><br>Isn't that being racist?  Yes, I have started to make assumptions on a person based on his race.  It is true that people of the same race share similar traits and practice similar customs.  Because Man are forever finding patterns, we can't help but associating certain behaviour with certain race.  If we do not like that behaviour, it is inevitable that we feel certain antipathy towards the race, knowing that there might be anomalies but unwilling to take the risk.<br><br>------------------<br>The appearance of these faces in the crowd<br>Petals on a wet black bough</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MayaJade, I understand what you're trying to say. While some people are outright racist, maybe there is a 'racist' streak in us all? it doesn't mean that we HATE the person from a different race, but maybe our experience of some members of their race has made us feel that way towards them all.<br><br>maybe if you do get a roommate who is Indian, you should let them know as politely as possible what you like and what you don't. Maybe after you talk to them abit, you can gently tell them? I'm sure they are feeling quite worried about what you might be thinking about them, being new and all.<br><br>worst comes to worse, sleep with the window open!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>kueh lapis: thanks for the advice though I wasn't looking for advice, really.  Even though we don't hate them, we are still judging them based on their race alone and that is racism already.  So do you agree that we can't get rid of racism no matter what?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, my two cents (popular phraseology isn't it?)<br><br>race is a concept. an abstraction. it is not a real thing, perceptable to the sense. it is an idea used to distinguish and classify human beings. other, similar ideas, like gender, are also used to classify human beings. so what is unique about race as taxonomy? race is a concept which has unique relationship to other concepts and objects which is then linked in political discourse. deconstructing the race concept begins with the identification of its field of objects and concepts presented in discourse. race is a means of describing the world, and like any other means of description, it is a means for organising the world. for better or worse.<br><br>------------------<br>When I was a kid, I used to pray every night for a new bicycle. Then I realised that the Lord doesn't work that way, so I just stole one and asked Him to forgive me.<br><br>Emo Philips</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think you're very right to say that we can't completely get rid of racism, because humans will always be classfied based on their race. As long as this continues, how can we not be racist??<br>Racism doesn't necessarily have to have such evil 'neo-nazi/Hitler/Pauline Hanson' type meanings behind it, and I guess it's because of people like them that we are all so scared of becoming racist<br><br>ps: sorry for giving advice!! wasn't sure if that was a real situation or not!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True lah, it's virtually impossible to eliminate racism. There's bound to be a tiny part of us that simply cannot stand certain races.<br><br>I tend to link certain races of people with certain characteristics, but of course I won't elaborate  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. But I do have friends of different races (my present flatmate is an Indian). It's when you really get to know them and appreciate their race and culture, then it's a different story. But sad to say sometimes, it also confirms my viewpoint of them.<br><br>Comparing with what is happening in other countries, Singapore is not that bad. Anyway, the only thing to do is just be a bit tolerant and be discreet. Respect them for what they are lor.<br><br>Oh ya, some people adore the western culture. Ya, you try and come live with them under the same roof. You'll be disgusted by some of them if you see how they live man. I think those overseas will know what I'm talking.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think that it's true that there's a streak of racism within each and every one of us. sad as it may be, there seems to be no real acceptance of each other but just mere tolerance. depsite the fact that race is just but a social construct used to assert authority and power, it continues to play a part in a world that claims to be largely equal and all. isnt it all a farce?<br><br>even looking at sg, a place where "racial harmony" seems to be the correct buzzword wherever we go, is there true harmony? i seriously do not think so.<br><br>wonder what would it take for the world to be rid of racism? a complete change of mind and the erasing of the social categories that are being applied to everyone??</div>
