              <p>Productivity does not mean that the quality would be lousier.
              Productivity lets us create more and do more with less effort, it
              is the means by which we improve our quality of life.</p>

              <p>That is so wrong. Productivity means the quality will  be compromised, as evident in the microwaved food and poultry fed with chemicals.</p>
              <p>With microwaved food and poultry and farm animals fed with chemicals, we have an increased risk of getting cancers and terminal illnesses. Quality of life is greatly worsened.</p>
              <p>If it takes 1 hour to bake pastries, I rather wait that 1 hour than to buy microwaved pastries.</p>
              <p>If you're not a patient person, you better learn to be patient. Otherwise, you have higher risk of cancers. Productivity must be invented by an impatient person.</p>

              <p>Saw this slogan on the exterior of a bus:<br> “We have found a way to cook our [products] 10 times faster, that’s
              productivity!”<br> <br> I saw this ad, I sighed and added that company to my list of banned
              food. Turns out, the so-call productive way is microwave. Those who
              don’t know, please google “microwave food causes cancer”. Those who
              thinks microwaved food is still healthy, please continue eating
              microwaved food, it’s your health, not mine. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"><br> <br> Faster isn’t always better. Let’s take poultry for example…<br> <br> Chickens have been fed with hormones and steroids so that they grow
              and mature quickly in 6 weeks. They have to be harvested (ie;
              slaughtered) at 6 weeks because if they grow to 8 weeks, they will
              die of heart attacks as the heart does not grow at the same speed
              as their bodies. No wonder, I’ve been seeing <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">pink</span></strong> chicken flesh when I bite
              into fried chicken at K**! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"><br> <br> Same goes for cows and sheeps, so that they grow faster and produce
              more meat and milk. All in the name of PRODUCTIVITY! What happened
              to natural farming?<br> <br> Something closer to us, our workplace. I’ve worked in companies
              where 1 person was hired to take on 2 persons’ workload/tasks in
              the name of productivity. Such jobs are often labelled “fast-paced,
              dynamic environments” in job ads. Employer gained cost-savings but
              still lose money due to high employee turnover. Nobody will stay
              long in such jobs. Some ppl will take on such jobs due to long
              periods of unemployment, ran out of money or unaware, but nobody
              will stay long.<br> <br> Some productivity is good but when overdo it, it yearns adverse
              effects. Do you agree?</p>
