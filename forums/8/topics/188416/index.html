            <div class='col-md body'>1. I think problem is because youths are now exposed to 'western' style of affection. Long time ago our parents and our grandparents were got show affection one?! Take care of you not affection meh?<br><br>2. Also, last time it is very easy to show a child you care. My father until now remembers how my Grandaunt helped him when he was very poor. He borrowed their machines to work at night and one night, she came down with a cup of Milo for him. He said he remembered how thick and tasty it was.. and because it was so expensive last time, most people used to make it rather bland.<br><br>Now ah, you make Milo for kid, he say he want Macdonald Iced Milo. Your one dont taste nice.<br><br>3. Last time when everyone is struggling with work, mother is busy with housework, father is busy with outside work, where got time simi spend with their children or what! The kampung children entertained themselves, took care of themselves, and don't need what attention or watever. So leh, my conclusion is.. kids nowadays, too much time.<br><br>4. Too much time never mind.. no creativity to go and FIND things to go. Like i said, kampung kids got what?? No nintendo, no nothing. And the kids now say Singapore is 'boring'. Last time the kids have so much less, but they never say boring - they had tins and grasshoppers and spiders.<br><br>I'm not saying parents are not at fault. I am just saying... Hmm.. a lot of influences raised expectations of kids, but not able to teach the parents how to parent this new breed of youths.</div>
