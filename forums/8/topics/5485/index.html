            <div class='col-md body'>Whao... a girl who professes to have an utter disdain for shopping. This is something we don't see often.<br><br>Good for you that you don't spend your time walking around Orchard Rd aimlessly. (Wish my girlfriend thought that way). But sometimes, roaming around Orchard Rd (or any other parts of Singapore for that matter), can be a highly enlightening experience.<br><br>You get to see what people wear, the way they walk, talk, behave..etc.. something that's most refreshing.. takes the bore out of our already mundane life. Dunno about you people, but I for one confess to have this love for observing people, not passign judgement.. just observing... try it... maybe you'll love it too..<br><br>Cheerio!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To ataraxia:<br><br>I hope you would be enlightened after what I have to say.  I hope i am saying the right thing!  The reasons that guys hate shopping could be as follows:<br><br>1.  They are lazy to walk.<br>2.  They get bored by walking aimlessly (to      most guys not having the intention of        buying things, shopping is aimless for       them)<br>3.  They don't like looking at girls, so<br>shopping could be one hell of a boring     task! HAHAHAHA!  Ya, Right!  How many        guys do u know dont like looking at         girls)  Maybe if they are walking with       their gfs, they are not allowed to look      at other girls.  Case in point, look at      firewire (poor guy! sorri firewire! i am     not picking on u but it is true that ur      gf doesn't allow u look at other girls -     those pretty ones!)  In fact, when I am      walking with my gf, I am not allowed to      look at other girls too!  Possesive or       what?<br>4.  They have groin problem!  Can't walk for     a long period of time.  HAHAHAHHA!, I        know this sounds sick and bad, but can't     resist of not posting it! HAHAHAHA!<br>5.  They are homely type of people; just<br>don't like going out. period.<br>6.  God knows!<br><br>Anyone have other reasons?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What I think is that if everyone is the same .. liking the same stuff .. girls liking to do what the guys do all the time and vice versa .. where's the diversity ?? Isn't that what makes life so interesting ??<br><br>I'm sure that if a guy is interested in a girl .. it's gotta be coz of something he finds interesting about her .. which can also be translated into something which is relatively new to him ..  I certainly would not hold much interest for a subject/thing if i already know what to expect ..<br><br>As for why we can spend hours shopping .. that's coz we have so many stuff to look at *LOL* Realise that malls where made with women in mind .. every floor has girlie stuff .. whereas the guy's stuff is only confined to one floor .. mabbe less *shrugs* =P<br><br>Oh well .. my three cents worth .. =)</div>
