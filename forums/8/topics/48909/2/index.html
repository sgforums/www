            <div class='col-md body'>whether malay muslim marry the people of the book (christian, jews), they date/ marry pork-eating gals. Do you lot mind? I guess the muslim guy will ask the gal to stop eating pork to show her love for him..and also the need to convert to be a muslim. Not only that she has to behave like one too..Depending on the guy whether he's strong in faith (sooner or later) the gal has to wear the cover, a change in individual externally. Indirectly, it's also a conversion of her own race to other race, a self-imposed denial of oneself just because of one's love for the other. and I think such religion is stupid and wrong. It's total change of a person..<br></div>

This is NOT about religion. Its definitely A OK in having a relaxed attitude towards life. Its A OK too not to be absorbed in materialistic welfare.<br><br>BUT, this will only work fine if you live in the countryside depending on subsistence farming to feed yourself and your family.<br><br>BUT we are in Singapore, a developing or developed country, where the pace of life is quick, where every minute is money, where every citizen counts. How much each of us put in is indirectly responsible for how well Singapore does on the world stage AND how our decesendents will live their lifes. Our forefathers have worked hard to build our foundations and bring us where we are today.
