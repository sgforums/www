I would encourage you to read the post again. We do not aspire to be the best in everything; our forefathers work hard and it fell on our laps. And since it is in our hands now, how can we ever lose it? It is like finishing top of the league the first season and then getting relegated the next season. Does it work this way? Is it logical? How can we lose our competitive edge that our forefathers have built up so hard?<br><br>It is exactly people with your mindset that Mathathir is lamenting about. Listen and understand, we have no choice. We are in Singapore. Singaporeans. If we dun work hard to keep our competitive edge, we will soon find ourselves devoured by our bigger neighbours, who have large natural resources and vast lands to tap on.<br><br>Being stressed and selfish is a social letdown because of Singapore's lifestyle. This is when we must know when and where to stop and take stock of the people and the environment around us. Despite this, we must still keep our competitive edge and the history and foundation that our forefathers have built up. To relax now is akin to throwing away what our asccendents have given us. We just cannot do that, understand? We are in no position to do that. Not right now at least. A land-scarce Singapore can only depend on technology and manpower.<br><br>Where are you from?

We dun think all the time about cash, but we think about improving ourselves and our family's standard of living. We have no choice because we live in Singapore; everyone is trying to improve all the time. Singapore is such that if we dun move along with the times, very soon we find ourselves lacking behind everybody.
