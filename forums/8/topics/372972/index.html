                                      television each day. Over the course of a year, we see roughly
                                      twenty-five thousand commercials, many of them produced by the
                                      world’s highest paid cognitive psychologists. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Their job is to figure out how to grab
                                      our attention and make us feel deficient if we don’t own their
                                      clients’ products. And these heavily produced advertisements are
                                      not merely for products, but for a lifestyle based on a consumer
                                      mind-set.</strong></span> What they’re doing, day in and day out,
                                      twenty-five thousand times a year, is <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>hypnotizing us into seeing ourselves as

                                      as a sphere of mature conversation and dialogue about our common

              I admit i fell victim to this kinda behavior in my young days..trying to tweak myself so that i cld fit into the crowd..
              
              But as time went on i told myself i don't have to change myself to impress others..just be yurself..everything else falls in place..its betta to be humble than to model yurself based on others..it only highlights yur low self-esteem..

              <p>you're absolutely right, I was trying to "fit in" all the time when I was 14 - 16 years old. But slowly I've come to realize this truth. (18 now btw).</p>

              <p>The concept about "impressing" others is seriously dangerous, as I feel it will only erode away your own values, and ultimately lose yourslef in the process.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>to each his or her own lah. conformist? herd mentality? common identity? it all depends on how one wants to see it. besides, being a non-conformist actually also means conforming to the non-conformist ideal. everyone conforms to some standards</div>
