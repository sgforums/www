            <div class='col-md body'>Ask her about her hobbies and you can get a rough idea on where to bring her liaoz,movies and makan after that is something that sure to work,maybe shopping etc etc.If she likes books,can bring her go Borders for free browsing(or reading in my case),haahah or if she likes music,can bring her to HMV to listen free music,don't get too stressed about it or it will show when you are out with her,just relax and enjoy her company,hehehe   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>It's take a second to look at my makan,a minute to finish my burger and a lifetime to enjoy all the food i want <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Diablo 2 rockzzzzzz  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

It's ok to be nervous, it's ok to stammer or say stupid things. Think about you date as well. She might possibly be thinking the very thoughts that you are thinking!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ya, i agree with them, you should just be yourself and just take her as a friend first.<br>There is some important points you should note&gt;&gt;<br>1) Know the dress code, you won't want to wear very casual when she's wearing formal.<br>It looks awful together. Have a good sense of fashion too.<br><br>2) Do not go and cut your hair or style funny pattern on that day, why?? Cos it will make you lose self-confidence.<br><br>3) Try not to watch movies ok!! Why?? You can't communicate with each other as both of you are watching the show. Have the movies arranged last and after that, send her home.<br><br>4) Don't not ask stupid, no sense, idiotic, questions and don't even bother asking about her family life or what's her siblings' name as you two both of you are not that close yet unless....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>5)Remember to be yourself though, try to be cool, man and someone who can decide .<br><br>6)Talk, talk and talk! Get to know her better and and when ever you decide something, ask her whether she likes it anot<br><br>7) .......... pray to God for good weather, luckiness and everything!!<br><br>------------------<br>Be LiKe ThE sIlVeR sUnShInE,<br>PoUr Ur SwEeTnEsS OvEr Me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahahahaa, going out on a date, well, it is true that you should be yourself, but no obnoxious behaviours like burping and everything, it puts a girl off. And actually, instead of asking you to be yourself, my advice would be to avoid being someone you are not.

You seem pretty EXPERIENCED at this I must say! *LUFFZ* Say, what if she does NOT like books and music? What to do then? NOT all gals are really into books... *YAWNZ* As for music, don't you think that it's pretty boring to go listen to free music at HMV on a 1st date?  :p<br><br><strong>brian:</strong><br>1) What is considered a good sense of fashion then? An ah beng may find an ah lian with a good sense of fashion but others may NOT! Some gals may like guys who look grunge but other gals may prefer a preppy look so how can you gauge if someone has a good sense of fashion? What do you normally wear when on date with gals? Why NOT let me judge if you have a good sense of fashion?  :p<br>2) Why styling one's hair in a funyn pattern may cause one to lose confidence? Who knows? If the look is WACKY, gals may just fall all over for that look so how can his confidence be dashed?  :p<br>3) Why must watch movies LAST? I thought it's pretty nice to catch a movie and talk abt it over dinner after that? *GRINZ* But then again, movies sound BORING! Why not go Omnimax theatre instead? At least it's 3-D!<br>4) Asking about her family life is idiotic and senseless ar? Hmm, I think MANY guys are IDIOTIC and SENSELESS then! *LUFFZ*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>5) You tell him to try to be cool and yet be himself? So does he PRETEND to be COOL or be himself? Please don't contradict yourself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>6) Talking too much is NOT exactly COOL you know.... so why do you suggest that he keep talking? What if the gal got turned off?<br>7) Good weather = sunny day isit? *SMILEZ* A rainy day sounds pretty romantic though..... *LUFFZ*  :p<br><br><strong>Double Tap:</strong> Do what you deem fit. Since she agrees to go out with you, she must have felt that you are nice and she can be comfortable being around with you. Treat her just like any other friend and take the whole thing as a FUN date, go out have fun and go home. There's NO need to impress. Let nature takes its cos!
