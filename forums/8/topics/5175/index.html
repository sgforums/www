He can be consider my first bf, the rest are juz puppy love.<br>Problem is, during this 3.5 yrs, we hv been quarrelling (often over small matters) quite often, however we always made up all the time. Although we love each other deeply, sometimes I feel so lost and tired of the fights that we hv.<br>I hv juz started working in July and there are many changes in my life. Now I prefer to hang out wz my frens and go clubbing than to go out wz him. We used to meet very frequently (from nearly everyday in the beginning to now only about once a week).<br><br>------------------<br>Who says the best LOVE will always last?<br></div>
