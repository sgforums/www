            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Forgotten in Time</strong> Â– a short story by AngelDark<br><br>It was once said, that stars would fall upon the earth in a glittering shower, enshrouding the chosen one in a magical moment only for a single night. This shower grants the chosen one a wish that will be fulfilled instantly. It would begin exactly every ten years on the first day of the whole year, the First of January. Word has gotten around since then, and people from all over the world, starts to search the ends of the world to find the place for the next twilight shower.<br><br>Tonight however, things have taken for a change. Ten years has passed since the previous twilight shower, and this year the heavens have chosen a young boy to receive this precious gift. This boy, Mel, born from a poor family of cobblers, is a quiet and reserved child. He has neither been to a school, nor been taught of anything else but mending shoes. The townsfolk owe much to MelÂ’s family for mending their shoes, but none of their children would want to get close to Mel.<br><br>MelÂ’s mother passed away when he was only a baby, and his father was the only one who looked after him. This year Mel found out that his father had fallen ill, and could not mend many shoes of the townsfolk in time. This made his family short of money to survive through winter, let alone to buy medicine for his father. Even the joy of having a warm Christmas dinner was not enjoyed by Mel and his father; most of the townsfolk decided to stay indoors to celebrate it and to stay away from any risk of getting infected by MelÂ’s fatherÂ’s illness.<br><br>This cold and lonely night, MelÂ’s father had a relapse and was in need of a doctor. Mel decided that he had to run through the cold snowstorm to the local pharmacistÂ’s which was about a mile away, to get the doctorÂ’s help. On the way to the pharmacist, Mel ploughed through the thick snow, braved the chilling winds of the callous snowstorm. However, whilst ploughing through the piles of snow, Mel tripped and was covered in snow almost immediately.<br><br>It seemed like hours, Mel lay there stiff, and cold.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">It canÂ’t end like this</span>, thought Mel. <span style="font-style: italic;">IÂ’ve got to save Father, or else itÂ’s going to be too late!</span> Mel tried to free himself from the heavy pile of snow, but no matter how hard he tried, he was unable to move. This icy prison kept Mel freezing and was sapping the remaining breath out of him. <span style="font-style: italic;">ItÂ’s freezing, I canÂ’t move and FatherÂ’s waiting for me at home. I wish Father was well, I wish I hadnÂ’t fallen. How am I to survive? How can Father survive?</span><br><br>Fate, was so special, the Gods were watching a show. Neither the less, Mel was the chosen one for this year, and the time was almost right for the Twilight shower to grant MelÂ’s wish.<br><br>Mel was already frozen, and frostbites were all over his body. <span style="font-style: italic;">ItÂ’s over; IÂ’ll never be able to save Father this way. Oh how I wish that Father is alright. I donÂ’t mind if IÂ’m the one to replace his death, but just let my father live on.</span><br><br>The Gods were amused. Such selflessness seemed to make the Gods want to change the rules.<br><br>Just then, Mel suddenly felt warmth surrounding his body. He felt weightless and started floating out of the snow pile. Mel turned around, and gave a very loud gasp. Right before his eyes, a myriad of colours, surrounded him, and dazzled him with magical lights. But before he knew it, the star shower stopped, and he remained hovering in the air. He took a look towards his home, and found that the star shower showed up there too, so he floated towards the direction of his house.<br><br>Looking into his house from the windows, Mel saw his fatherÂ’s face filled with life, and stopped coughing. <span style="font-style: italic;">My wish! It has come true! But IÂ’ll never be able to see his face again!</span> And as quickly as the twilight shower began, it ended, taking away Mel towards the heavens.<br><br>Â“Mel? Welcome to heavenÂ”<br>Â“What!? IÂ’m in heaven? Who are you?Â”<br>Â“Why, IÂ’m God.Â”<br>Â“YouÂ’re God? So you were the one who granted my wish?Â”<br>Â“Exactly, your heart was as pure as the white snow that buried you, and you did not even make a wish for yourself. It was admirable of you.Â”<br>Â“So does that mean IÂ’m staying in heaven for good?Â”<br>Â“Actually, we decided to bring you back to life again, for you still have a long and fulfilling life to lead. But that would mean you are the last one to receive and be granted of the wishÂ”<br>Â“Back to life? Wish?Â”<br>Â“Yes, you are to live and take care of your father, and do many more things. The Twilight shower will never happen again, and your tale will only end forgotten history. Go now, back to your father and take good care of himÂ”<br>Â“ThankÂ…..Â”<br><br>It was dawn already, and Mel was lying in a patch of green grass. <span style="font-style: italic;">Grass? But it is still winter isnÂ’t it?</span> Mel got up and looked around him. He was still surrounded in the thick walls of snow. <span style="font-style: italic;">IÂ’ve got to head back home. Father must be worried.</span> And so Mel climbed back out onto the snowy path and headed back home.<br><br>And thus, Mel returned home and of course, his father recovered from the illness, and the Gods stopped the twilight shower. All seems well of course, and whatever happened last night, never happened. It was to be forgotten in time.<br><br><strong>The End</strong><br></div>
