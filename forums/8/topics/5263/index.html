            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa, I was about to post the same topic!!! Kind of related to my previous topic.<br><br>Well, personally, I do not feel any difference about marriage and cohabiting, in the sense that if I love my GF very much, what extra good does it do to register it? Like asif registering will make our bond stronger? Or like asif register oready won't get divorce(just like my previous posted topic). To me, a divorce and a break-up is about the same, except for the extra legal implications, which can get really troublesome.<br><br>If the couple wants a kid, then registering may make sense, but the case is that I dun really want a kid, and thus does not feel anything relevance to register for marriage.<br><br>Well, I did ask my GF about this topic, and she insist that there must be registration... citing family pt of view, etc which I agree also... cos it may appear atrocious to our parents if we were just cohabiting... u know, they are still kinda traditional...<br><br>But in the end, this registration thing to me is just a meaningless process, just wasting my time.... I understand some girls view registration as very important, and I think my GF thinks that way also... but what I can say is that registration does not make me love my GF more or less...<br><br>if you can trust your partner, you can trust your partner. Registration does not make it less difficult for him to cheat on you... just make it more costly for him to cheat... and if you need this costly thing to keep your husband faithful, then might as well get a divorce...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>Bochap...<br>I can roughly know what is actually going thru your mind...(psyc student..hehe!)Well...to a majority of girls, registration of marriage is a form of recognition that she is officially your woman...(meaning that she is taken as well as U)..I guess it is a form of security for woman so than man will not "fool" around.<br><br>I guessed most ppl might think that there is nothing wrong with cohabiting without marriage but to a more conservative individual, it might means that the bond or relationship can be broken anytime, thus no assurance and security..That is why ppl buy insurance to act as a back-up...<br><br>Well, I think my parents woild definately object to me cohabiting ( to them, it might means that you are degrading yourself, and ppl might talk behind your back...)<br>Oh well....Marriage has become such a fear....divorce and such is really hard to handle. Affairs of your partner is so perplexing...So come to think of it, is Marriage really sound??<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm.....seems like more and more ppl are having a phobia abt getting married! i don't think u can be 100% sure things will work out in a marriage. but perhaps co-habiting will help you decide. thing is, once u start, and it works out, u may think why get married? well of course there will be societal and family pressure against co-habitation. and for some a religious prohibition as well. but i think there really is something different abt being married. it's not just a matter of registration or legal proceedings. it is like a pronouncement of your love and commitment to one another (maybe that's why u have to be "pronounced" man and wife). and i think that's something you should take pride in. so perhaps marriage vows are undertaken, in part, to satisfy our own vanity and pride! haha! (some ppl, by no means all, really take pride in saying, "come, let me introduce you to my WIFE!").<br><br>but i think the best (meaning most practical, cautious, prudent, realistic) approach is to have some form of cohabitation before marriage. some ppl have taken the option of going for a long trip or holiday, just the two of them.....and i mean a long one. this may be an option for ppl who want to see if they can stand each other in a pseudo-marriage environment but at the same time don't want peer or family pressure that they are doing something ethically wrong. then after the holiday u may be able to decide whether marriage will work out for you. (some ppl even have to take multiple holidays just to be sure!).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With divorce cases being so overwhelmingly common, I think it makes sense to cohabit, at least for a certain period of time. And that can be as long as five to ten years... I think if u trust each other enough to that extent, it certainly surpasses any relationship that marks its official union with a marriage only to end its term prematurely. If you can stay three years or even thirty years together without a wedding, it speaks a lot about your faith in love being so strong and steadfast that it eclipses any sense of insecurity. I mean of course if you love the prestige and grandeur of weddings, you can always -- a la Elizabeth Taylor -- marry, divorce, marry, divorce... But make sure you have enough money to spare your ex's after each divorce!<br><br>------------------<br>J A S O N N E X<br>http://jasonnex.cjb.net</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wouldn't mind cohabiting personally, provided I know where I am heading in the relationship (marriage of coz). I feel that cohabiting also requires certain amount of commitment and devotion coz you are living as thou like a married couple, just albeit the legal stuffs.<br><br>Marriage just means recognition by all that you are legally bonded.. so long you are happy with each other, there is nothing wrong with cohabiting.. or so I think.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Marriage is just a formality. Yea... you can say that after marriage a woman can feel more secure cos they both went through some  ceremony declaring their fidelity to one another. But then this is only a ceremony... if one of them (typically the guy) decides to have a ex-marital affair.. there is nothing the other can do much about it. So it then to result in a divorce. So do you think the marrriage certification means anything to the 2 ppl who in the first place who took their vows ( in sickness and in health... blah blah blah..) ?<br><br>I am not condemming marriage neither am i promoting cohabiting with someone. I have known ppl who dun get married but have children and stay together. They are like one happy family. The only difference is that they are not officially married. I asked them why not and they both replied after marriage everything will just die and the magic will be gone.<br><br>Well i guess this is a personal kinda thing.<br>Being in a marriage does not mean that they there will be someone there to take care of you and the kids.<br><br>I guess with all the climbing divorce rate. Marriage has kinda loss it's meaning.<br><br>In our society, ppl frown upon cohabitation as it often results in kids born out of wedlock . But then no one mentions about divorced parents with kids.<br><br>But what if the 2 ppl who cohabit really love their kids and care for them and are responsible for them. Which makes some divorced parents pale in comparison. In such a case what would the ppl say ?<br><br>Perhaps one day our society will being to accept such behaviour but then that will be a long time to come....<br><br>I hope to hear the viws of the rest as this has been buggin me for some time and is one of the reasons i dun feel like getting married.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry DizzyDawg, but i disagree with what u have just say abt cohibting without marriage...<br>I t might be alright for a guy ..but not for a girl at least..Can u imagine ur girl being pointed at wherever she go..<br>Sometimes things can be better if u just follow the traditions..it might take all the trouble..but at least ur girl is recognised as ur wife in ur family clan and as for her<br>she will also would feel unsecured as ur woman...<br>As a boyfriend..i think that u should do something to tell her that u want to world to recognise her as ur boyfriend and not just go off with it becoz it takes too much trouble<br>Think abt ur girlfiend and her future...don't u want her life to be haappy and being blessed by ppl around u?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DizzyDwang...<br><br>Hmmm...though i have not come to the thought that I dun want to get married becos of the divorce rates increasing, but I know your concern when marriage does not work, a lot of factors will be involved...legal fees, custody of the kids and sneered by the conservative relatives and such.<br><br>True, marriage does not ensure that it will lead to eternal love and living forever happily after, but I guessed it is really the so called "official status", that is making ppl to go to the marriage realm as well as declaring the whole world that you have asked your gf to be your wife.<br><br>I think to a girl, the idea of marriage is a wonderful thing, wearing the white gown, having the sacred church ceromony...exchanging vows and as such.I still think that no matter how much you are afraid of the consequences after marriage, you still must have a go at it. Imagine, if your kids are born, it will be soo weird for him to know that their parents are not married but he is existent in the world. He might be somehow feel different from his friends.<br><br>I still think that regardless of the love after marriage... One should not be daunted of the consequences cos regardless marriage is still a magical and divine process...<br><br>(If all the guys dun want to get married, then my ideal marriage scenerio will never ever get to realise..*sigh*)<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to point out that basically, divorce and splitting up of a defacto relationship is the same. The only thing is that there are legal issues involved if you are married, but it comes down to 2 people splitting up.<br><br>Also, when two people split up, whether in a defacto relationship or marriage, its after some time, after they discover problems which have not presented itself earlier, or when the relationship changes due to personality change or some other problems.<br><br>So, I don't think cohabitation is any good predictor of a relationship, although it is of some help. I still think in the end, if there are to be problems of differences, it will come up whether 2 people are married or in a defacto relationship.<br><br>Lastly, I think marriage is more than just a formality. I'll respect anyone who has different views of course, but to me walking down the aisle is a process to say that you are taking a next step in the relationship. To some people, this process of making a public vow is valuable to them. To others, their love for each other is strong enough to be able to do without this. You choose.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I prefer a period of cohabitation b4 marriage. Ideally, the period of cohabitation serves as a long honeymoon and once you get married, you will have gotten use to your partner and the couple's lifestyle.Also, if you want kids, you will be better adjusted after the period of cohabitation and can jump right into parenthood after getting married.<br><br>If I can, I will definitely cohabit with my bf now (but I can't). It will have saved both of us a lot of time (on the phone and travelling to meet each other) and we can have a honeymoon-lifestyle for at least 2 years instead of rushing into marriage and parenthood (like what typical Singaporeans are doing).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Depends on how you define cohabiting.<br>And the cohabit location.<br><br>In a big house, you can live upstairs, I can stay on the ground floor. We can meet and talk in the living room and the dinning table. We shall not share the same bed until we get married.<br><br>Or, we'll live like a married couple, without being married, and if an unplanned baby comes along, get registered, if not, set a date and assess our cohabiting, re-assess again if necessary, until we cannot stand each other, or until we cannot stand without each other.<br><br>Sometimes, the trying of baby strengthens the<br>bond, which I guess is a no-no in for asian couples cohabiting. I might be wrong. Afterall, cohabiting itself is a bold move.<br><br>The location.<br>It's just the both of you, under the same roof, in different rooms, or in the same room but on different beds or sharing the same bed.<br><br>Or is it the abovementioned, but with either party's family. This means that either one of you is trying to fit into the family. He or she can continue to live together(with the family) after getting married or the couple move out to stay after getting that "paper".<br><br>Lastly, it can be the combination of both families, with the couples unregistered. Although this scenario is perhaps the least remote compared to the other two, it can still occur especially when both families is reliant on both(especially if they are sole bread winners)<br><br>All the above will determine the effectiveness, and perhaps the meaningfulness of the cohabit. Sometimes, marriage is not as simple as a "he" and a "she" who register together and get the certificate(or perhaps the "license") to live together.<br><br>If only life could be that simple...<br><br>[This message has been edited by ocean (edited 04-12-1999).]</div>

Dun worry Riona not all guys are like me : )<br><br>sad to say i am rather pessimistic and i dun look at the bright side of things...<br><br>it's just that when your hopes are high .. when you fall you fall equally high.<br><br>thanks for replying<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Call me conservative, but marriage is NOT just a formality. It's a sign of commitment. To show that you are really serious about the girl (and vice versa) and is ready to settle down.<br><br>However, this system is abused by a minority few who make a mockery of it. People such as those who marry for the sake of getting the government discount for HDB flat, people who marry and have affairs, etc...<br><br>There is really nothing wrong with cohabiting, but my question is, is the reason for cohabiting is to avoid the hassle of having to divorce later due to untolerable lifestyles/habits?<br><br>Cohabiting involves the purchase of a house/apartment as well as other stuff like furniture etc... wouldn't it be just as difficult dividing these properties? In fact, getting a marriage nullified/divorce is so much less hassle then splitting of property.<br><br>Not wanting to have kids is not the reason to cohabit and not get married. Like I said, marriage is a sign of commitment to the other party, kids or no kids one must be prepared to show that kind of commitment if he/she is serious about the relationship.<br><br>oh well.. don't really know what I'm talking about anymore... just came back from pubbing.. so excuse me if i'm a little incoherent or repititive.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe many here like the idea.<br>As one of us put it, it is a good time to understand each other very well. My gf and I are into the ideas but dun think it is possible coz her parents are not that open minded. But anyway, I do like the idea.<br><br>But overall, it will be like an unregistered marriage, no one got the cert or warranty for anything. Anytime, anyone can just back out of this "marriage" without going through too much "trouble".<br><br>But what does the parents think? Both side. Either both must rent an apartment outside, else how to face the parents are really very open minded and can accept it.<br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But I'm a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, the problem with cohabiting always lie with the parents. It is sad that parents more or less object to this because they want 'face'. They just dun see the point of cohabiting and usually, they think those who cohabit are usually 'loose' pple. [must have watch too much tv ]  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I believe the place won't be much of a problem, especially for those who have already started working. One can just rent the place and put in some money to decorate the apartment. It will be just like a home  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I'm sure for cohabitating b4 marriage. I think its a good measurement of how my partner can stand my disgusting living habits  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> There's usually a 2nd side of me when I'm in the freedoom of my own home and I think its best if my partner can come to terms with it b4 we get married.<br><br>And of course, I can have a greater understanding of her lifestyle. But I would like to live in a neutral environment like a newly rented apartment rather then her's or y house. Problem here of course would be how others are going to view you esp. the older generation. Coz I certainly won't like pple calling my gf a cheap woman if she happens to be cohabiting wih me.<br><br>Cheers!</div>
