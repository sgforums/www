              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I would like to get some feedback on some issues. I'm currently a fresh grad with a double major degree in Marketing in PR. However it's from a Australia uni, thus I think it's not very regconised in Spore, as I'm having a tough time looking for a relevant career.</p>
              <p>I'm actually thinking of retaking my O level English. Previously, my O level English was a grade C6, n I can assure u that is not my usual standard at all. I did manage to go to Poly and then followed by uni, however I feel that I am going no where in life. I feel that my English grade in O level affected my course choice in Poly, which thereafter affects my course choice for uni.</p>
              <p>Thus I feel that I should retake my O level English and then sign up for another diploma of my choice. However my mom feels that it's a waste of time to retake the Os, and wants me to take up a Masters instead.</p>
              <p>Which direction should I go??? :(</p>

              <p>If you already have a Bachelor's, then retaking your O Levels is taking two steps back for no obvious benefit.</p>
              <p>I know someone who got her degree in Australia. Currently doing her PhD locally. Seriously. Why are you knocking your Australian degree?</p>
              <p>If you can apply for a Master's, then you should go for that.</p>

              My dear,  care to tell us which Australian Uni  did you attend?  Curtin? Deakin? Edith Cowan? Flinders? If you have already graduated, why  would you want to take ' O' levels again? Or do you mean just taking English again at "O" levels to improve your grade in English?  
              Taking a masters itself  without any clear idea what you intend to do  in terms of  a futurecare er does not make much sense either. Surely you  have some idea of what you 1) would like to do as a career 2) what you  would qualify to do as a career currently   and 3) what you probably would be good at doing in a career. Now 1) , 2)  and 3 )  are probably different.

              <p>yes,its a waste to retake the o levels!unless you are applying for the civil service.so far in all the companies i have been thru,they have never asked for detailed o level results just show either degree or diploma for job thats in relation to!</p>
              <p>if u take o level....why not take  the english exams at the british council which would impress your perspective employer till no end.its held every month and u can take it every month.but most employers dont look at your english...they are more concerned that u can converse with them for job interviews.</p>

              <p>You dont need to re-take O level after you get your degree.</p>
              <p>For marketing, it is not about the cert. It is about the experiences you have.</p>
              <p>I thought marketing is a very general degree which is employable everywhere.</p>
              <p>If you cannot market urself, any cert is of no use for u.</p>

              <p>Take the masters. If you look at the job advertising requirements, those companies that accept foreigners from lesser known university are actually asking for a higher degree to compensate.</p>
              <p>Even if you want to apply for another diploma course, you can use your double major degree. I'm sure they will entertain people like you but on a case by case basis..</p>
