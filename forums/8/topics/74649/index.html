            <div class='col-md body'>My point of view:<br>1.Yes maybe she likes you,but the like may turn out to be infactuation or crush<br>2.She doesnt have time.IF u guys happen 2 get together(B-GF)then you'll demand more(will u??)later u guys will b so tired of waiting for each other to go out and so on<br>3.she MAY feel pressured that you keep asking her out..slowly,,one will b tired of asking..the other would b tired of rejecting<br>4.Since she sounded sad,dont talk to her in that angry tone cos she has the right to reject your offer to go out with her since you're only her friend,not her in anyway closely related to her(husband,parents,etc)<br>5.If you want her to be happy,dont..dont ever sound frustrated/angry when you talk to her..cos she wouldnt feel gd inside and may want to stop being your 'close(??)-friend'<br><br>My advice is when you're feeling angry while talking to her..try to 'act cool' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

No matter how busy she is, she will also try to sneak out to see you.<br>From what I read here, seems like she is afraid of rejecting you. She is probably confused at the moment. Sure she got something important to tell you, but she is looking for an appropriate moment.<br><br>I don't know how crazy you are for this girl. But I can suggest something for you, see if you want to do it or not. Why not you go and see her? I don't mean knocking on her door of course.<br>Like wait for her at her MRT station or bus stop? Like wait for her at her void deck? Like wait for her outside her school? Don't get me wrong okie? I'm not asking you to be a stalker. Just if you do meet her, say something light (Don't go and talk about your   worries/problems/fears) and encourage her. Wish her well for her studies/work....you know what do you lah.<br><br>Whatever happens, control your emotions...remember no quarrels/sadness. Should go well if she still likes you. If she treats you like a stalker and avoids you, you will know the truth if she really wants to meet up with you or not.<br><br>Good luck.</div>

I personally believe something : "You can give a hundred excuses if you don't wanna do something, but it takes only a single reason to do it... " and  " IF the mountain doesn't comes to you, you can go to the mountain..."<br><br>Cheers<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

My guess is that she is seeing someone else, or there are others like you in her life. If she likes you, no matter how busy her schedule she would have made time and met up with you.<br><br>Not to pour cold water or anything like that. But that "sorry gtg blah blah" is very typical of gals when faced with a question she does not like or doesn't want to answer. Quite clear indication of the one-sidedness of it all.
