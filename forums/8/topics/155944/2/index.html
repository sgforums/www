Cups with both your names imprinted on it. i remember marina south last time got shop let you make your own clay figurines? can paint your own colour,  they'll teach teach you to make whatever you want la...quite cheap only.

            <div class='col-md body'>for a nice romantic dinner, i suggest Fosters at Holland V. $100 should be okay for 2 people for one main course, one drink, one dessert. The environment there is dark and romantic.<br><br>Or another place, is Tao's. SG$24.88 for a wonderful set dinner of 7 course dinner! You'll love every dish.. its damn good. Place might be crowded and less romantic, but for the price and food its darn good!<br><br>http://www.taos-restaurant.com/<br><br>If you have money, i really suggest booking a night at Gallery Hotel.. highly recommend the Glazzhaus rooms!<br><br>http://www.galleryhotel.com.sg/<br><br>u can book from this site, cheapest rates online liao!<br><br>http://www.asiarooms.com/singapore/singapore/gallery.html<br><br>It includes breakfast , which was utterly delicious! We stayed for one night.. Very hip setting, great for young couples. I can bet my life on this! I gave it 5 stars... very memorable for us.<br><br>I really hope what worked for us worked for you too! =)<br><br></div>
