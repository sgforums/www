You are making a moral judgement against homosexuality. That is not my intent. I have a few friends who are gay, and while I don't believe in their lifestyle, I don't see what is wrong in their own personal choice regarding their lifestyle options.<br><br>What I do have a problem with is when homosexuality is given a righteous glow both by the media and the intelligentsia, who claim that not only is being gay acceptable, it is to be promoted. Facing reality, homosexuality still draws alot of prejudice in certain quarters, regardless of the matyr like status it appeals to the liberals, and that I think that should be reexamined.</div>

Life is hard enough without adding extra obstacles to your life.</div></blockquote>well, the fact is, if they are gay, would u want them to live their entire life in denial, always feeling like they're trying to be someone they are not?<br><br>the truth is, homosexuality is not the higher moral ground. there is no higher moral ground in sexuality. u are what u are. it is not the lifestyle that is being promoted, but the acceptance of one's sexuality that is being promoted. if this involves campaigning for social change, then so be it. Afterall, the same thing happened for racism, and it took us a very long time to get the racism issue to the state it is today. I'm sure 10-20 years ago, there were parents saying "I would rather not have my son/daughter going out with a white/black/asian/oriental" but now we look back at those people and laugh at how uninformed they were. Why can't we see that some of us are guilty of being uninformed about another similiar issue once again?<br><br>The truth is, sharing such awareness with younger people means they will be able to start thinking about who they are earlier. The less time lost living as someone they are not, the faster they come to realise who they are, the better isn't it? Its not like if they think about it, they automatically are gay. I'd be as glad to hear a kid seriously think about it and discover that he is straight a much as I would a kid discovering he is gay. It doesn't matter what your sexuality is. Its how early u can discover yourself, come to terms with it, and loss less of your life spent being lost.<br><br>It might seem like people are preaching homosexuality to you, but to be honest, don't u think that's silly? Straight people have as much fun as gay people. Why would anyone be attracted to a gay lifestyle if u're not gay? Can u imagine having to get intimate with a gender that u absolutely am not attracted to? I can't. So if u're not attracted to say, the same gender, then u wouldn't live a gay lifestyle. So that leaves the problem of those who do have some attraction to the same gender. What then? Well there must be some degree of homosexuality in that person. How much, is an entirely different matter altogether. But even for many people who self-proclaim to be straight, I do not believe they're 100% straight either. More simply, they just have a bigger preference for the opposite sex.<br><br>Finally, I would like to point out to u that preaching homosexuality to someone with gender confusion is pretty pointless. A gay man is happy to be a male. It has nothing to do with their preference for another male. Gender confusion has more to do with one's personal gender, and preaching homosexuality to a boy who feels he's really a girl trapped inside, is just not going to work very well. Afterall, part of being a homosexual male is to BE male. I can't see a transgendered girl taking that very well.</div>

If people treated being gay as no more of an issue than say, being oriental, then there wouldn't be an extreme gay lobby. Sure there would be some gay cultural showcast, just like we have chinese culture showcasts, but thats part of belonging to a certain culture isn't it?<br><br>the point is, often people who are labelled a bigot, are labelled a bigot not because they don't stand up n sing praises about homosexualty. They're labelled thus because they do not make an effort to understand  the true nature of homosexuality in humans, in nature, and in a social context. They just want to think that anyone who is homosexual is a freak of nature. And yes that would extend to that father who is worried about his son playing with dolls. 1stly, in this case, I would think the father should really be worried about transgenderism in his son, but assuming he is worried his son is gay, I will have to ask: Why?<br><br>is it because he has been socially conditioned to think it is "wrong" to be gay somehow? if thats the case, then he is not making the effort to understand the nature of homosexuality, and yes he is a bigot. Is he just worried about the social discrimination his son would face? this is a harder case to quantify. Wanting to protect one's offspring is a natural thing as well, granted. But u cannot force someone to live a lie just to protect him or her. <span style="color: red;">If u force your child to be straight because u want to protect him from society, then u'll have failed, because your child has still become a victim of society, only execpt that instead of being directly victimized by society, he or she is now victimized by society thru YOU, someone close to them whom they love.</span> Isn't that more hurtful? If a parent were concerned about the social prejudices their child would face, wouldn't it be better for them to stand beside them and support their child thru it all, instead of bending over backwards, and HELPING society ostracise their own kid? How do u think a child feels when the persons closest to them do not understand them, and lends a hand in society's victimization of them?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for the rest of the people who don't like me simply because i fight against discrimination, all i can say is, too bad. just look at u, assuming im gay or whatever just because i speak up against homophobia. OR worse, some people like laoda99 who keep assuming my gender because some people who DON'T KNOW me simply assign me a generic pronoun. brainless, isn't it?<br><br>at least with kivichio, he has relevant and valid points of reasoning that is worth debating and addressing.<br><br>also, i wanna ask, are u one of the 80%?<br><br></div>

My "one shouldn't live a lie" theory applies to everyone, whether they're straight or gay. Why try to be something they're not? what sort of happiness do they hope to gain? The problem is, for some people, acceptance of all sexuality is a trend for them. Its like white people who try to be 'black' just because its cool isn't it?<br><br>bottomline is, if u're straight, be straight. if u're gay, be gay. if u're white, be white, if u're black, be black. thats the way life's meant to be lived.</div>
