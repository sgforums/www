I did pretty well for my O levels but i chose to go to an average JC, and take only 3 A level subjects even though i could have taken 4. Reason? I didnt wanna be around people who mug all they.No offence. Im not saying all people who take 4 A level subjects mug all day, but chances are im just likely to hang around people like that and i dont really want that.<br><br>Another thing is when you do well people always think you mug a lot. Lol they dont know that all you need to do is to not slack off. Whatever the school gives you is really enough if you keep up. Then you have time to play and hang out <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I know because ive been experiencing this for a long time. I already finished my A levels and im serving in NS now. Im not boasting, but im just sharing my experience. When your results are good, teachers want achievements to be recognised. So very often, test and exam results will be put up on notice boards and the whole school can check their rankings. People who appear consistently at the top will automatically be 'famous'.<br><br>And when you are well known, its easier to make friends. You can just say hi to a friend's friend and the next moment you both are friends also. But many of these are prolly just shallow friends.  I don have a bad personality and i have many many friends. Even close ones, i have quite a few. But the thing is not everyone in school will know who you really are. Often, a lot of people will dislike you even if you have a good personality, thats just because they do not know you enough and soemtimes they are envious of your good results. Sometimes they hear rumours that you are proud, arrogant and snobbish but you really arent and only your real friends will know. You will definitely get a lot of attention and there will be people gossiping bout every part of your life. Your looks, your studies, your girlfriend, courses you get into in uni and etc. Whatever 'news' about you, spreads like wildfire. Even the bad ones. I have helped people with their studies when they need help, yet at times other people have said im arrogant. I have heard so many comments about me, that now when my friends tell me they hear some rumours bout me, i really don give a damn anymore. Makes life easier lol.<br><br>Teachers of course pay a lot of attention to you. You are already doing well so they put a lot of hope on you to be a model so that others can look up to you, and aim to achieve just like you. Its just a normal that mentors tend to like mentees that are better. Just like how a boss will like a good employee better.<br><br>Of course there are also people who do not do well yet they get a lot of attention in school as well for their community spirit, leadership, cca achievements and etc.<br><br>I think you should not bother so much about attention. If you want that then just join Singapore Idol. Whats more important is that you make true friends and get yourself an education . You wanna do well in your studies for yourself, not for anyone else. </div></blockquote>My every cells in my body agree with you. It's like me.</div>
