How often ?<br><br>Why the figure is achievable even after SARs ! Basically visitorship include local visitors ! if you basically think of tourist then of course cannot. Did you know the Zoo has been very successful with their friend of the Zoo program, which mean family pay to be friend of the zoo and they get unlimited entry ......! So once Sar over, you can see a lot of family every sunday also go !!!<br><br>Then you get NTUC to do a 1/2 price discount !!! or a special discount for foreign construction worker !!!  One shot you get over 50,000 over people for a event like that !<br><br>The problem is you based on foreign visitors ! while in acutal the people that visited the zoo more is the locals .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1.4 visitors incl foreign, local, members, VIPs, family days/other events participants, complimentary ticket holders etc, as reported in their annual report.<br><br>It's not what they count physically when the peson walks in.  As for the membership, I heard it dropped due to the price increase (suddenly from $85 to $100), removal of most of the membership categories (only left with family categories), removal of most of the benefits including free parking.  It WAS a value for money thing.  But not anymore.  Then only much recently, they decided to put back the Individual category for those with no children.  But the price is, I think $90 (used to be $35).<br><br>I go there a few times a year.  So I know when it is really crowded or not.  If you go today, it will be.  cuz it's the last few days of school holidays and parents only have these few days to go out with kids.  It's been like this every year.  But once school opens, it will become a dead town again, with only a handful visitors each day.  The only time you see crowd will be when school groups come.  But now dunno whether got school groups or not.  Cuz the last I heard, they are removing the School membership as well.  Hope they changed their mind, cuz the zoo is for education.<br></div>
