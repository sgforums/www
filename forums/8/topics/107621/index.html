            <div class='col-md body'>Saigon Tan Son Nhat International Terminal Â– Singapore Changi T2<br><br>Well the holiday was to end! A pity really. But the real test for Singapore Airlines commenced.<br><br>We said an emotional goodbye to our families and went off into the airport terminal. Again, it looked much better than in 1997 and the floor was marbled. We put our bags through the x-ray machine and proceeded to the Singapore Airlines check in desks. I remember that four were open and there was a very elegant Singapore Airlines check in direction sign standing in the concourse which I touched.<br><br>We stood in the queue next to the Raffles and First Class check in desks for flight SQF173 (yes, SQF, I donÂ’t know why. In addition, I noticed the lack of cooperation with VN (SQ/VN 173)). Standing next to the check in area was the Singapore Airlines supervisor. He stood around with a radio and in full Singapore Airlines ground staff uniform. When he looked at me, I smiled politely to see if he would smile back. Vietnamese people generally treat foreigners (mainly white people) much better than anyone else. The supervisor did not smile back! I was infuriated. He must be sacked. I will not stand to be disparaged. Shame on him and he must be ejected from the Singapore Airlines Group payroll. I am unimpressed and he was RUDE.<br><br>Anyway, we approached the check-in desk and gave the woman from TIAGS (Tan Son Nhat International Airport Ground Services) our tickets who said that to England, they would allow 90kg of luggage. Now we weighed everything last night and the three suitcases were 31kg each and two hand luggage at 9kg, one at 7 and one at 6 with a handbag and a camcorder sack. She let the suitcases go through but wouldnÂ’t put the heavy hand luggage on, even after I was nice to her. I stopped smiling at her. She was a cold woman and certainly did NOT represent the service and warmth that Singapore Airlines normally exudes. We walked off with our heavy hand luggage through immigration I think and up to the departures area where we had to pay tax of US$12 per person (no wonder the airport looks nice).<br><br>There are many duty free shops and prices are nothing special. Merci (German) chocolate was US$6 for 600g I think. I was unimpressed but had to buy it anyway. We sat in front of Gate 5 eating our CadburyÂ’s Dairy Milk Fruit and Nut which I purchased for US$0.50. A while later, the Malaysia Airlines flight arrived late and I saw the Singapore Airlines Limited Airbus A313 sitting looking cute.<br><br>Passengers were invited to board and I saw that damn supervisor again. I gave him an evil stare but couldnÂ’t complain as I was afraid that he would make things difficult and make us leave some of our heavy hand luggage behind. Pity. Anyway, the gate had about 10 rows of seating and the first three rows were reserved for the First and Raffles Class passengers, much to the annoyance of some Economy Class passengers, they had to stick two TIAGS women their to stop people.<br><br>Boarding commenced through the L1 door and we were welcomed by the Chief Steward J. I didnÂ’t catch his surname. We proceeded to our seats which were 39 DEF.<br><br>The seats werenÂ’t wider than any other on the SIA fleet and also they werenÂ’t especially ergonomically designed and there was no footrest. They were comfortable nonetheless. Of course, we all know that there are no PTVs on these A310s. However, there is KrisWorld Mainscreen. This is just programs on the movie screen and those little monitors that come down from the ceiling. In addition, this is also a good way for SIA to avoid advertising scams so that they can say that KrisWorld is on board every flight. Anyway, the Singapore Girls were very helpful in pushing luggage into the overhead compartments. I saw one very nice Singapore Girl who was a leading stewardess and had this exotic Arabian feel to her. S?K was always cheerful and willing to help. She was a little thin, maybe even shockingly but still, was a pleasure to observeÂ…helping passengers.<br><br>The departure time of 1650 soon passed and hot towels were handed out by flight steward TBL at 1653. He was quite cheery and happy with a big nice genuine smile. Good for him. At the same time, the captain announced that there is a slight delay because they couldnÂ’t close the cargo door which was not too impressive. Incidentally, the cruising altitude was to be FL340 / 34 000 ft. Flight stewardess HCE handed out the earpieces. She was very quick in doing so but her smile was too small and she was too heavy on the green eye shadow. She also collected up the towels with the not-big-enough smile.<br><br>My dad was unsettled by an unsettling smell of kerosene in the cabin. I duly pressed the crew call button and up came TBL. He explained that itÂ’s normal to smell that and after takeoff it would go away. He was very professional in calming us down (exaggeration) and went away.<br><br>The doors closed and the drop down monitors fell with the safety video commencing. This time, there were Chinese subtitles in the top left hand corner but the video was still poor as ever Â– this really does need replacing. Pushback commenced at 1701:37.<br><br>There wasnÂ’t much to do. I was wishing that I had taken the Asian Wall Street Journal because I saw a picture of a tail of Hong KongÂ’s de facto flag carrier so I wanted to investigate it. Anyway, at 1708, TBL came back and asked if the smell had gone away which it more or less had. I was impressed that he came back and checked up onÂ…my dad.<br><br>The 3TEN lined up on runway 25R and takeoff commenced from 1717:27 to 1718:04 local time Â– a takeoff time of 37 seconds.<br><br>The meal service commenced with flight stewardesses JH and LSL performing the meal and drink operations respectively. I canÂ’t remember the meal choices because there was no menu however JH delivered my meal politely and was warm. LSL was good at serving me my Coca Cola but unfortunately she did not smile Â– this issue must be resolved.<br><br>The main course consisted of three slices of new potato and chicken in some kind of sauce which I havenÂ’t noted. There were also pieces of courgette and yellow paper. The meal was very tasty and was cooked to near perfection. In addition, the chicken portion was very generous.<br><br>For desert, there was a Vietnamese thing called ChÃ¨ probably some desert made with soya. I donÂ’t normally eat it because itÂ’s horrible, but this time I actually found it was nice, in fact, excellent. Full marks for that. There was also bread which was unfortunately crumbly with butter. The water supplied was chilled. It was a fantastic meal.<br><br>Flight steward TBL collected the trays up very nicely and at a good pace. Meanwhile, I called for the Asian Wall Street Journal. 20 seconds elapsed before LSL came and a minute later she came up with the goods. I think the article was something about fuel prices edging up and Asian airlines suffering. However, there was no Singapore Airlines picture so I just put it in the seat pocket and decided to explore the toilet.<br><br>I proceeded to the rear of the plane where I saw TBL trying to shove a cart back into the stowage position for about 30 seconds before he realised that it needed a kick and that worked. It took a while but I entered the toilet. To my dismay I was to be unimpressed. The toilet lacked cosmetics, aftershave, cologne and sanitary towels. Most disappointing. There were toothbrushes and toothpaste tubes however. The toilet is chrome in colour and has some blue flush water sitting in it awaiting the userÂ’s arrival. The flush is relatively quiet and there was no vacuuming as I can remember. However, since the 3TENs and Celestars have been phased out of Singapore AirlinesÂ’ fleet (though more rapidly than everyone had previously thought), the fleet now has toilet commonality which is good.<br><br>Well at 1832, JH collected the earpieces which I didnÂ’t use with a lovely graceful style and smile. The Â‘entertainmentÂ’ was Smooth Jazz TV specially created for Singapore Airlines with an American TV presenter IÂ’ve never heard of. Not my thing really.<br><br>We had to circle for a while because Singapore Changi Airport was busy, hopefully with Singapore Airlines flights. Anyway, the descent was smooth and one could see clearly the lights of Singapore harbour and the magnificent skyscrapers standing tall Â– a symbol of the Lion CityÂ’s strength and determination to become truly the Heart of Asia and more.<br><br>Landing was normal and durated from 1900:31 to 1901:14 Â– a landing roll of 43 seconds. I canÂ’t remember what gate we were at but it was F something or other. We disembarked and were again sent off by the chief steward J.<br><br>What a lovely flight. Baggage trolleys waiting outside the gate, thatÂ’s what I like to see.<br><br>------------------------------------------<br><br>Singapore Changi Airport Â– 1905 Singapore Time<br><br>Singapore Changi Airport. Oh how wonderful it was to be back at the Airtropolis. We proceeded to some area where there were some slumber seats and my parents went to the toilet while I protected our valuable hand luggage. When they came back, I went to this duty-free shop called Â“The Olde Market PlaceÂ” or something like that. It had this English middle-age wooden feel to the place and I saw something shocking. Singapore Airlines batik Pierre Balmain uniforms labelled as Â“Singapore ExclusivesÂ” on sale! I was aghast in shock.<br><br>Anyway, I got my mother to buy one of the flight stewardessÂ’s uniform and they were quite cheap at US$25 or something I think. I wanted to buy an inflatable Merlion (the symbol of Singapore, showing strength and agility and the fierce passion for success) but alas I was to be disappointed, but I did buy a solid statue measuring about 15cm in height. It sits proud on my desk looking at me with its mouth open as I type.<br><br>Anyway, I decided to go exploring in search of Singapore Girls. I walked towards the E gates when I spotted an elusive female inflight supervisor! I was most excited and asked if I could take a picture of her. She kindly obliged but she said that she was looking tired. I told her she wasnÂ’t allowed to look tired and she happily brought in some of her other crew, a leading stewardess in green, two flight stewardesses in blue and a chief stewardess Â– red. They all posed while another lead stewardess who was camera shy took the picture. The photo is awaiting development.<br><br>I still stand by it Â– Singapore is really the worldÂ’s best airport.<br></div>
