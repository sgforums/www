            <div class='col-md body'>From someone who has taken martial arts before.....you can't learn from books and from reading...I have tried it....The reason these studios/dojos/shaolin temples exists is because you need another perosn to teach you...What I learned from books was just what the kicks and punches looked like, but there is so much more than that to it...And there is no such thing a s learning at your own time in the martial arts....It's like military training but not as brutal(but in some ways more)...You learn at your own pace and you won't get anywhere...beleieve me...and you need someone else around to execute your moves one...go ahead and try it in thin air...you might even be able to master it by yourslef but when that perosn is actually in your hands the move becomes something else...and all the special movements you did before with thin air practice will be quite useless....<br><br>Just the same as when you see people fighting kung fu and karate style on tv and movies...but you know that in real life it isn't like that....beleieve me, you won't fight like that when it actually happens...When my sensei told me this I didn't beleiev him until I got into a fight....Wah lau....when it happens you just wack and hope you wack him more than he wacks you....and those moves you learn only work if the guy gives you the movements for you to counteract...but in real life, more often than not, they never puch or kick the way they show you in class or tv/movies....<br><br>hahahah....sorry I know you didn't want to hear this but I had to tell you....I felt it was my responsibility...<br><br>And as a person who was also a former monk,....they make you work physical labour more than anything else...hahahaha..:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is the first time I access this page, cos looking at the title, I thot ShaoLin Boy was trying to sell a website teaching Kungfu on the net, which I thought was not possible, or not practical at all.<br><br>Surprise to find that ShaoLin Boy actually wanted to learn Kungfu on the net... and like what the others said, it won't work really...<br><br>Like Firewire, I've been to school(its a Lion Dancing Club rather) learning Chinese Wushu, and the master actually told us not to think we can fight very well, cos in real life when a group of people want to beat you up, you just try to run and throw everything along the way to block them.<br><br>And if you're confident you can beat them, you still have to use any weapon that you can get hold of, be it a chair, or anything that can hurt the person. Strength is the most important, and Reaction is equally so.<br><br>Well, we really did the "Zha Ma" all the time, and I tell you, its really tiring, and your leg can tremble very badly after 10 mins. In fact I already feel quite stressful doing this for 5 mins.<br><br>Then there is this punching thing while doing Zha Ma... and tell you what, sometimes the master will just stand on his whole weight on our thigh when we do Zha Ma, and we will be considered not good enuf if we fall from his standing. He always try to catch us unprepared also...<br><br>And after 1.5 years of training, I was still doing the basics and also 1 standard set of punching moves before I stopped. Quite lazy during that time. But guidance of a master is really important, becos even in ZhaMa, you can get it wrong also...<br><br>ShaoLin Boy, kungfu is something too deep for modern people to understand and endure. You need a lot of guidance and practice before you can be good.<br><br>What I can say is that Jet Li will have good strength and reaction when fighting agst anyone, but he may not necessarily be a good fighter. Wushu is internationally a display sport rather than contact sport, so those wushu people will hv less actual sparring chances than those contact sport atheletes like kick-boxing, taekwando, etc.<br><br>And when in a real fight, you try to kick your opponents in the groin first before they get yours, it'll reduce them to wriggle in pain on the ground. Theres no rules in real fight, and if they are out for your life, you get theirs first...<br><br>oops... a bit long huh... but just kindof hv a flash back of my memories....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?
