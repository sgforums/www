            <div class='col-md body'>Ok before you respond this is part of ethical questions that have answers. Let's see how ethical and practical minded you are.<br><br>Question 1)<br><br>You are a sniper for you local police. There is a known terrorist that has murdered hundreds of people with bombs and beheadings. He has been cornered in a building and is holding a 75 year old lady hostage. There is no way to shoot him unless shooting through the old lady. If you don't take the shot he will escape. Would you shoot through the old lady? why or why not?<br>(remember you have no other options besides these ones)<br><br>Question 2)<br><br>You are a foreign diplomat that has to negotiate important deals for the name of the United States. Your position is very respected and you have to work out very important issues for the United States. You have met with the king of Iran and are discussing plans to capture terrorists in his nation. The king tells you that it is a custom for every representative of other countries to have personal mistresses in their room to serve him with every need including sex. Take in mind he has the hottest Jessica Alba type chicks and you are a married man. If you say no he might get offended and if you say yes you are cheating on your wife. Would you accept or not accept? are there other reasons you did or did not accept?</div>
