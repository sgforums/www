              <p>Hmm...I believed everyone out there always have to meet up with new/old people in their daily lives. Alot of times we need to socialise with them for work purposes or outside work social purposes.</p>
              <p>Have you ever doubted the people whom you have socialised with? Either on a professional level or on a social level?</p>
              <p>Why do we doubt people if we are supposed to remain on a professional level?</p>
              <p>Why do we even doubt our own friends, loved ones, families when we are supposed to love, trust and have faith in our relationships with them?</p>
              <p>And very often, why do we even doubt ourselves and our abilities and our dreams when we're supposed to achieve and realise them?</p>
              <p>Can we behave in a professional level at all times to everyone we meet and also true to ourselves? </p>
              <p>I believe the world can be a better place for everyone if everyone in their jobs do have any doubts about every person they meet in their jobs.</p>
              <p>Doubting people will only create biased behaviour within yourself and people that you have to come across in your everyday lives.</p>
              <p>And I noticed that many problems arise because of lack of trust, faith, love for ourselves and others if we all have to doubt one another and end up holding onto biased views of ourselves and everyone else.</p>
              <p>Is that changeable or are we all heading towards a certain doom in our future?</p>

              <p>Have you ever doubted the people whom you have socialised with?
                                      Either on a professional level or on a social level?</p>
              <p>Why do we doubt people if we are supposed to remain on a
                                      professional level?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">This depends on the level of relationship you have with them. I would not say i doubt them but how you treat acquaintances and family/best friends would surely be different, no matter how slight it is.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br>Remaining on a professional level implies leaving the personal side of the equation out and this may or may not be due to doubt. Some people may not want to reveal their personal side due to doubt caused by lack of trust in the other person. Some may think it is not necessary to reveal more information than is required to maintain the professional level. Some may see it as no point to do since its just a "professional" relationship. These factors may or may not include doubt as a cause for their actions. It can also be due to the person himself/herself being a private or shy person hence less willing to open up.</span></p>
              <p>Can we behave in a professional level at all
                                      times to everyone we meet and also true to
                                      ourselves?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Analogy: If being genuine and sincere is in the true nature of a person, then the answer is yes. If being arrogant and downright selfish is in the true nature of a person, then the answer is no. <em>(Assuming behaving on a professional level entails certain traits of which being genuine and sincere are one of them)</em></span></p>
              <p>just my 2cents.</p>
