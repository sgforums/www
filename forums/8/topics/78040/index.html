How do we find out if the degree qualifications awarded by these universities are recognised in Singapore?<br><br>The Ministry of Education does not have a list of accredited overseas universities. There is also no central authority in Singapore that assesses or grants recognition for degrees obtained from overseas universities. The reason is that the employer should be the one deciding whether a degree-holder has the qualities desired for the job and the qualification most relevant to his needs. The employer is in the best position to decide how much value he will assign to a personÂ�fs qualification.<br><br>However, in selecting an overseas institution for undergraduate degree studies, it is advisable that students establish whether the institution is a bona fide educational establishment. Such enquiries may be made at the Embassy/High Commission of the country where the university is located.<br><br>Professional degrees such as those in engineering, medicine, law, and accountancy should be those recognised by the respective professional bodies. For example, a person with an engineering degree from an overseas university who intends to seek registration as a professional engineer in Singapore will have to check whether the institution that awards the qualification is recognised by the Professional Engineers Board.<br><br>In the case of overseas universities offering courses here through local agents, the institutions concerned and their agents are responsible for all aspects of the programmes. It is advisable for students interested in enrolling for such courses to find out as much as possible about the programmes from the institutions or agents, before enrolling in them.<br><br>If you need information on acceptance of overseas universities for employment in the Civil Service, click on this link to the Public Service Division, http://www.gov.sg/career/entry2.htm<br><br></div>

If u are not working part-time then go RMIT, if u are working part-time then have to think abt it twice.
