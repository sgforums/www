            <div class='col-md body'>u know what's disgusting about this whole episode,<br><br>it might not be fair for me to say this since i'm not there to feel it... but i hate how journalists crow about how singaporeans exhibited the kampung spirit during this episode.<br><br>for goodness sakes.. if nobody lifted a finger to help, i don't think singaporeans are fit to be called human beings. banding together in times like these is only a natural process... u wanna report about kampung spirit? take an mrt ride  during rush hour and see if there's kampung spirit... kampung spirit in singapore is dead... there are too many selfish idiots out there to have any sort of spirit...<br><br>i know journalists are among us and are reading this.. please tell your colleagues to stop feeling smug about themselves. an 8 year old is dead and possibly raped... what's there to feel good about??<br><br></div>

I was standing behind him, god I was trying so hard not to burst out laughing, my facial expression was like damn weird trying to keep my mouth closed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
