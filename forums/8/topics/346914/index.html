              <p>i typed this in another forum , but maybe we can discuss about it more here , Speak out your mind ! I dont need people to agree with me .</p>
              <p><strong>I wanted to give a one sentence reply to a certain topic at a certain forum , but it turn out to be a long reply , things in life is nv in order , so is the style i type .</strong></p>
              <p>One of the many things that im not happy about sngapore is the sporting scene.<br> <br> we dont realise that We spend money on a foreginer to come and
              represent us for something, Yet we dont get the result , so why not use
              the money and invest in our locally born youths and also get good
              coaches(you can get a foreign talent to do this) , this method takes
              time but who cares , I know i dont see any results now.<br> <br> In my OWN OPINION , i think the whole idea &amp; meaning of sports has
              been manipulated in singapore !!! To me a sporting event is to present
              a representative of the community, A sporting event should bring a
              'community' together .... BUT YOU AINT GETTING this in singapore cos
              majority of the people that is representing us , dont even come from
              our community nor were born into or mixed around among the community
              people , so how can you be proud of this ????<br> <br> The people of singapore should start opening their eyes and really look
              into the politics of singapore n the world to realise , we are in
              trouble and so will our children when they come into this world ,
              Singapore is like a Huge corporation and we are the general workers of
              this corporation , banks earns the money ...etc Im a bank , you come to
              me and take a loan , i dont have the money so i take the money someone
              else put in the bank and pass it to you , you return me the money in
              interest . . . The banks dont have the money . . . Debt is the no.1
              factor that is making the world go round , without debt there will be
              no money , without money there will not be no government, without
              goverments we human are forced to lift our level of smartness and
              idealism, Technology is the one that saves us , they makes our life
              easier , not the government.<br> <br> A 1st world country with a 3rd world mindset..... This country grow too
              fast in a very short period of time and in the process lots of things
              got left out during the rise , there are still lots of things that are
              unbalanced in singapore ....<br> <br> <br> You might say to yourself , **** who cares im having a good time now ,
              but you dont realise that you are suppose to be having more fun n
              happiness then you have now.<br> <br> singapore can be a better place with happy citizens , if only the big
              corparation wasnt here , we can defaintly survive , they will be more
              local shops and companys with its own people contribution to the
              society and providing the things we need , <br> <br> One topic that many people in the world dont realize is that we dont
              need oil , there are lots of clean energy that we can use and not
              survive on oil , But why doesnt this happen , cos oil is handled by
              corporations and corporations , control the government , the government
              controls the media , to prevent us from knowing what are our
              alternatives. <br> <br> Maybe we should take a look at the unemployment percentage of locally
              born residents in since independence to see wether having big
              corparations and 'FT' really helped us.... I dont know about the
              unemployment % of singapore citizens but it will defianly be
              interesting to have a look , to see wether it really helped us or not.<br> <br> <br> ONE WAY YOU GUYS CAN HELP YOUR FELLOW CITIZENS IS TO BUY THINGS FROM
              LOCAL SHOPS , AND TRY YOUR best not to take loans ... You want a HD Tv
              , save the money and buy it , Dont take loan and get yourself into debt
              .<br> <br> REMEMBER to SHOP LOCALLY n NOT FROM International company n try to buy
              brands that are local!!!! This is the only way we can help each other
              for this period of time , untill our hero rides into town and saves us
              all.<br> <br> cheers people , i hope im not blabbering and you guys understand what im trying to drive.</p>

              <p>One of the inventions that we humans created was the internet , the internet is the only thing that cant be controlled , that is why the goverments fear the internet ...
