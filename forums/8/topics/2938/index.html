            <div class='col-md body'><br>Johnny was in the playground with his friend Jimmy, when he noticed the brand new shiny watch Jimmy was wearing.<br><br>"Did you get that for your birthday?" he asked.<br><br>"Nope," Jimmy replied.<br><br>"Well did you get it for Christmas then?" Johnny asked.<br><br>"Nope."<br><br>"You didn't steal it, did you?"<br><br>"No," said Jimmy. "I went into Mum and Dad's bedroom the other night when they were on the job. Dad gave me his watch to get rid of me."<br><br>Johnny was extremely impressed with this idea, and extremely jealous of Jimmy's<br>new watch. He vowed to get one for himself. That night he waited outside his parents room until he heard the unmistakable noises of lovemaking. Johnny swung the door wide open and boldly strode into the bedroom. His father, caught in mid stroke, turned and asked him angrily; "What do you want now?"<br><br>"I wanna watch," Johnny replied.<br><br>"Well, stand in the corner and keep quiet then," said his father returning to the job at hand.<br><br>----------------------------<br>Could be this easy ?<br></div>

Sometimes when they feel high making love in the kitchen? Or in the living room.<br><br>And do you know why couples make love in diffrent locations of their house? It is suppose to give them more excitement and this can actually help them to regain their love for one another. Especially after a few yrs of hardwork @ office etc.etc.<br>haha... think about this:<br>It is 12am. Little Mary can't sleep.<br>She remembered about the carton of milk Mummy bought when they were @ the shopping mall earlier that day, so she got up and walked to the kitchen, dragging her dear "Teddy" and "Goldilocks" with her.<br>Suddenly, she heard some groans, "Mum? Dad?" and saw a light in the kitchen. She crept to the kitchen and saw her dad and mum in some weird positions, it was horrifying! "Mum and dad seems to be in pain and they didnt stop!" Mary stopped for a moment and started crying....<br><br>Dang<br>Bad right?<br>Sometimes this depends on luck too ya know?<br><br>------------------<br>Death is Forever<br>I am Dead<br>therefore, i am Forever</div>
