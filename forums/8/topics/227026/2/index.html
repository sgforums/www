            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by da-cheese-freakk:<br><strong>Haha, I just wrote this huge post, but I didnt sign in. So I lost all of it. [b]<br>Basically, what do you guys think of the Singapore Education System?</strong><br>What do you think of GEP?<br>Of streaming?<br>Of PSLE?[/b]</blockquote>Streaming and special programmes (e.g. GEP) are highly necessary in any successful education system. Aside from catering to the individual learning abilities of the students, it inculcates in them the mindset that the System is undergirded by meritocracy; you get good grades, you get your pay-off. They also give incentive to students to work hard, a clear target to work towards. Examinations, as dreadful as they always seem, serve as an effective gauge of how much knowledge has been imparted, how successful the process of teaching and learning has been.<br><br>Nowadays we are moving towards a more holistic approach in schools -- athletes are presented with awards in recognition of their sporting abilities, students with exemplary leadership are similarly rewarded and proficient students of the arts who show exceptional talent also receive some sort of glorification -- all these while detractors are still claiming that this "performance-based system" wrongly conditions students to believe that a person's value is solely based on academic adeptness. I believe that we are on the right track, i.e. nurturing and appreciating the various talents of our students while still placing significant emphasis on the importance of grades and ensuring effective streaming. The sort of highly differentiated environment in schools may prove too tough for some students to cope with, but ultimately, it makes it much easier for our students (when they grow up) to swallow the fact that the modern world functions on Social Darwinism and that those left behind are as such only because they have chosen to be left behind.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find streaming is needed. But what is taught in primary/secondary is very limited. Those students who do badly aren't slow learners. They just suck big time with books.<br><br>What i wanted to say is, primary/secondary sch only caters to that group of "book students". That is what so bias about s'pore education system. The "non-book students" definitely suffers there.<br><br>It is thus required for the "non-book students" to be more independent. E.g. if they love to play computer games or create website, they'll probably have to sign up external IT courses.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do you notice that they send the best teachers to teach the so called creme de la creme while the "dumb" streams gets teachers who don't really bother?<br><br>Anyways I cannot be arsed, I just took the streaming destiny of education by the neck and wrangled it. I survived past the societal horror of being in the Normal stream. I remember my parents couldn't talk to me for weeks after I got my PSLE results.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Current Singapore Ed System is far too inflexible and short-sighted.<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Our system fails to recognize late bloomers.</span> </strong> I personally feel that too much streaming sidelines too many late bloomers and deprives many of these otherwise bright children of chance to fully develop their talents.  Albert Einstein was one such late bloomer.<br><br>There's also poor emphasis on, and acceptance/understanding of, the Arts in Singapore's schools..<br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Singapore still has no idea what Art is about and it shows in the way they Arts students are still bound by the basic maths requirements whether or not the subject is relevant to the course at all.</span></strong>  Singapore's opened its doors to the Arts Scene, but so far our initiatives have been extremely superficial, and our local arts students lose out. One cannot hope to properly nurture Arts students if there is little support available for these students in the 1st place.  Most Arts students simply go abroad to receive adequate opportunities to develop their talents, instead of wasting it here.. those who cannot afford it, and did not get the opportunity to be discovered, lose out.<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">The current system of streaming also creates unnecessary segregation and a class divide.  You would be continuously told "you just aren't good enough".. and even you knew it wasn't true, you would begin to lose faith in yourself when frequently and purposely denied the rightful opportunities to shine, out of sheer bias.</span></strong>  A normal (A) student, compared with an Express student in the same school can tell you of the biased treatment received at school.  The students of the "better" streams are not the sole perpetrators of this discrimination.. it is even observed by teachers, principals, parents, the government.  There is little or no encouragement or nurture for those of the "lousier" streams.  <strong><span style="color: darkblue;">If you produced a quality of work considered beyond your stream's capacity, you'd be likely to be regarded with much suspicion and hostility, even from your teachers.  </span></strong>Few chlidren climb back up in this situation.<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">People who top such a rigid system usually cannot tolerate failure.  They tend to become arrogant and look down on others.</span></strong>  They would have had been told that they are the best, been given the best, received heaps of praise, and therefore are likely to react poorly to criticism or "feedback".  They would be proud that they have emerged the "fittest".. and believe that those less successful are simply the lazy rejects of society who dug their own graves.  As the living success stories of Singapore's education system, they would have almost full support it and be skeptical of any calls for change.<br><br>A recent, famous product of our "perfect" education system is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wee_Shu_Min_elitism_scandal" rel="nofollow"><strong>Wee Shu Min</strong></a>, who upset many with her elitist comments.. her MP father later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wee_Shu_Min_elitism_scandal" rel="nofollow">added salt to the wound</a> by apologizing for his daughter's tone but not for the contents of her writing.. this created an uproar.<br></div>
