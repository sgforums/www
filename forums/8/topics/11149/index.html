Some girls would not mind if you told her pre-trip that you'll miss her, some girls would avoid you like the plague. It really is up to you to decide what kind of action you want to take. If you choose not to say anything..You might have lost a perfectly good chance.<br><br>For lovesickness, I suggest going out with friends, losing yourself in work, doing things you can do alone and usually have to or like to by do alone so you won't find yourself harping on the fact that you want her there.<br><br>Perhaps you could try dating others as platonically as possible first? This could lead to an even more promising relationship or future with that current person instead of having to wait for her to come back. Besides, you didn't tell us how long she'd be gone. Remember, you and her are devoid of responsibility to each other right now, so what you can do, she can do also. However you cannot hope to avoid her getting involved with someone else just because of your 'saving up' for her. For that is nothing but being plain unreasonable.<br><br>Sorry if I talk too much but I'm bored right now.

If she doesn't know you like her.. that won't stop her from getting attached or falling for some other guy. So if you're not going to do anything about it,<br>then move on and stop moping.<br><br>Make your choice and accept the consequences.<br>Whining is not an option.<br><br>------------------<br>Don't like what I'm saying?
