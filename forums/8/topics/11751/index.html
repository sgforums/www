Your stead decided to go for such a job (say, air stewardess or nite club manager).<br><br>In both instances, the very nature of the job will mean high chance for your stead to mix around and we cant rule out the possibility that it will turn a relationship sour.<br><br>So, will you be supportive or will you warn your stead that if he/she is going ahead, it will not benefit the 2 of you?</div>

But its always easier to say tat i <span style="font-style: italic;"> although we may not have much time together..cos he always flying..and when he comes bac to sg..he needs to rest </span>, but when it reli happens to you and when you cant feel his presence over a prolong period of time, you will definately feel distance towards this r/s.<br><br>He might be a well behaving gentleman now. But when there is a chance for him to get to know other stewardess, things will be different. His feelings feelings for u could fade off and tat could spell the end of a beautiful r/s!!<br></div>
