            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br><br>What do you think are the ideals or values shared by the youth today? Of course, each generation do have their own set of beliefs and ideals, and they choose the way which they live now. It is hard to do comparison.<br><br>I was reading all our threads and noticed that there seemed to be a decadance in our so-called "moral values". I am very inclined to subscribe myself to the school that our ethics are social constructs subjected to the  society at that period of time. Upon some thought I thought of a few things which gave me the impression.<br><br>1)Our way of viewing marriages : there seem to be more tolerance to divorces, cohabitation, being single and no point having children.<br><br>2)The concept of virginity, and I am sure that everyone has read the virginity thread.<br><br>3)The tolerance to anomalies like homosexuality. In the past, it is impossible to allow them to live in the society.<br><br>There are a lot more ideals and beliefs which seem to have changed in this age.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 15 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi prodigal,<br>i find that the all the topic u brought up is very interesting.hehe<br>u are in Uk right if i am not wrong . so after staying oversea for sometimes,what have u observe or have seen that happened to the people around. Since most of the students are staying away from home and what Â£$%Â£"$ thing they do nobody know or care .right .<br>cos i am in UK also lah , and that is what happening over here.<br><br>ok answer to your questions. all the thing i mention is my opinions and again, there's no right or wrong answers to it ..hehe<br><br>&gt;What do you think are the ideals or values &gt;shared by the youth today?<br>nowadays, youngsters(as if i am very old..hahah) have no worry. Since singapore is such a comfortable place to live in .<br>It's no longer like our parent or great grandfater time, where they have to work very very hard and sweat day and night to earn a living .<br>so their mentally is that just stay happy and who care what happen tomorrow.<br><br>&gt;I was reading all our threads and noticed &gt;that there seemed to be a decadance in our &gt;so-called "moral values". I am very inclined &gt;to subscribe myself to the school that our &gt;ethics are social constructs subjected to &gt;the  society at that period of time. Upon &gt;some thought I thought of a few things which &gt;gave me the impression.<br>i do have a question. Which school u have graduated from ?? Certain school teaches u different values , depending on the school motto.<br>u see..<br><br>&gt;1)Our way of viewing marriages : there seem &gt;to be more tolerance to divorces, &gt;cohabitation, being single and no point &gt;having children.<br><br>everybody have the mentally that , u don't know what will happen next or tomorrow. so let give it a try if thing work out Fine. If not , we will split.nobody can control me since tihs is my LIFE.Who is going to be responsible of my life ?<br>So , i will only take care of myself and as long as i am happy.<br><br>&gt;2)The concept of virginity, and I am sure &gt;that everyone has read the virginity thread.<br>everybody make mistakes. i don't know whether my partner will be faithful to me or not.so it is better that i cheat her than she cheat me. So this is what people call SELFISH .<br><br>&gt;3)The tolerance to anomalies like &gt;homosexuality. In the past, it is impossible &gt;to allow them to live in the society.<br>there a word that western society love it so much . and they even built a statue to worrship it..hehehe<br>that is the statue of  of liberty lah ...FREEDOM .<br><br>&gt;There are a lot more ideals and beliefs &gt;which seem to have changed in this age.<br>&gt;What do you think?<br>as our  life is improving, our mentally will change as well.<br>and when u are not worrying about survive ,as your great grand father generation use to be,<br>people will be going after leading a luxury life.<br>And when u are leading such a good life who will be bother about the beliefs. right ..<br><br>okok...bye  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everyone seem to be overseas nowadays huh?<br><br>The majority of the Singapore youths tend to have a rather narrow view of issues in life. They tend to be more interested in local and personal issues. For example, NS guys will talk about NS 24/7. Some people do not seem to realise that the world is so much bigger than that they've been living in. There's a sense of restlessness about youths these days. They are hardly motivated by anything in life and live life on a day to day basis. As you grow older and gain more experience, you realise that you'll have to make things happen instead of waiting for them to occur. There's a much wider diversity of life outside the homes, schools, countries etc. A desire to learn seems sparse too.<br><br>In response to prodigal's thoughts:<br><br>1) relationships:<br><br>Due to the materialisation of our world, everything turned unseemingly cold. Relationships are harder to maintain due to stress, insecurities, temptations, mistrust etc. When problems arise, people nowadays are reluctant to face up to them and solve them. They simply give in. Thus the break down of marriages etc.<br><br>2) Virginity<br><br>I've posted in the virginity thread too, so read that.<br><br>3) Tolerance to anormalies<br><br>Some people say that its due to the world 'opening' up. We do have to acknowledge the fact that all humans are individuals, separate entities. They behave in different ways and that's what makes the world so interesting. However, I do not think that that's the full and only reason. People are more insecure these days. They do not want anyone to see that so they hide their innermost feelings and put on a false front. When they are in the company of people who do not mind the anormalies, they'll behave in that way too i.e. they do not want to 'lose face'.<br><br>All in all, its not the changes that we should be focusing on, but instead, the adaptations that we make in response to those changes that are important.</div>
