Only those cannot make it in the commercial world will go to sign on... So u will know what type of ppl r running the unit, camp etc. Most of them r those cannot make it one, hence with these type of cannot make it personnel do u think its gd to work for them?? Some more, in army, NSF esp the men r force to "RESPECT" n SALUTE to these type of junkies. Do u think they worth our respect n tax payer money. Without the nsf, do these bunch of regulars can run the army?? We r the foundation for these ppl to survive in the army. They nv appreciate us, they muz know tat the posh car they drive, the clothes they wear, the food they eat, the house they live, the children they bring up r all provided by tax payer money, which mean our parents n relatives n love ones hard earned money, in the future our hard earned money also go into these ppl pocket, hope they know wat is the word "APPRECIATION" instead they should respect us not the other way round. Hope any regulars here pls WAKE UP UR IDEA!!!!!!</div>

Try to pull rank on him,try to find fault with him eg his uniform,ask him some crappy questions in a very demeaning way"cb,where u from? Don't know how to greet superior is it?"then ask him to fuck off...</div></blockquote>Poor fellow.But there are a few regulars that I know that will dress-down these scum and let them know what a disgrace they are to the SAF.<br><br>NS is wrongly marketed and overhyped currently.But the premise of learning a skill to defend your family and your home is an honourable one, just that NS is run in a very cocked- up manner.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's a pity our country is so small that we require NS for our military force.<br>In my opinion, not everyone is suitable to be a soldier. Yes you can train anyone to pick up a rifle and fight, but the term "soldier" requires much committment and passion. We all love our country, but not everyone loves it the same way. If I have a choice, I wouldn't do NS, being a solider is not the way I would like to serve my country, there are many other ways I could contribute and even more effective than just NS.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that NS is a complete waste of time for me.No doubt that it is needed to help kids-brained adults to grow and learn what is maturity but we people who are matured should not be dragged down with them.<br><br>Experience is not something money can buy,you have to go through it to feel and fully understand.<br><br>As for the topic question,we male have not choice but just to suck it up and serve NS.Hence to fully maximise your time in NS,do something which you think will be of help to you in the future.Whether it is leadership qualities,first-aid,building up your body......etc.<br><br>Of course,most of the time vocations are not up to us to choose,so you just have to look at things from other perspectives.Basically,whatever vocation that is given to you,just think of ways how you can benefit from it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am going to NS in September. I feel sick of this NS thing because i think it's a waste of 2 years of my life. But then again, i did not even have a choice to begin with. So wtf? Just go in there with a positive mind, finish up the 2 years and F*** off to Aussie to continue my education. But, IF, i say IF, when i am in the working world, and those regulars who f***ed me upside down, happen to work for me, or my friend(s), or whoever i know. I promise, i will make his life even worse than in the army as a lowly recruit.<br><br>The one thing i cannot stand is those regulars thinking they are very high ranked and can bully the recruits. Why? Recruits not given birth by a mother? I understand they are doing their job in commanding their men, but that doesn't give them the excuse to degrade the recruit like he wasn't given birth by a mother! Most regulars are just cowards who do not dare to go in the working world, so just sign on thinking it's a 'metal rice-bowl'. But after their contract finish and they decide to go into the working world. What are they? 40 year olds with no working experience? I just hope, i really do, that whoever make my life hell in the army, will end up taking orders from me next time when i go out to work. So i can make sure he regret what he did to me, or other recruits before.<br><br>Seriously, what army, navy, air-force. You guys really think that if a country decide to attack Sg, Sg can defend itself with its army? Personally i don't think so. For e.g. Just a spit from every citizen from our northen neighbours is enough to drown our country i think. (a joke blown out of proportion LOL)</div>
