            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by blunt_knife:</div><div class="quote_body">I am going to NS in September. I feel sick of this NS thing because i think it's a waste of 2 years of my life. But then again, i did not even have a choice to begin with. So wtf? Just go in there with a positive mind, finish up the 2 years and F*** off to Aussie to continue my education. But, IF, i say IF, when i am in the working world, and those regulars who f***ed me upside down, happen to work for me, or my friend(s), or whoever i know. I promise, i will make his life even worse than in the army as a lowly recruit.<br><br>The one thing i cannot stand is those regulars thinking they are very high ranked and can bully the recruits. Why? Recruits not given birth by a mother? I understand they are doing their job in commanding their men, but that doesn't give them the excuse to degrade the recruit like he wasn't given birth by a mother! Most regulars are just cowards who do not dare to go in the working world, so just sign on thinking it's a 'metal rice-bowl'. But after their contract finish and they decide to go into the working world. What are they? 40 year olds with no working experience? I just hope, i really do, that whoever make my life hell in the army, will end up taking orders from me next time when i go out to work. So i can make sure he regret what he did to me, or other recruits before.<br><br>Seriously, what army, navy, air-force. You guys really think that if a country decide to attack Sg, Sg can defend itself with its army? Personally i don't think so. For e.g. Just a spit from every citizen from our northen neighbours is enough to drown our country i think. (a joke blown out of proportion LOL)</div></blockquote>U havent been to NS unlike us.....But u seem to know about it...keep up....<br><br>To be fair, there are some regulars......who are fair and humanely...But there are some who are downright crap....Sg can defend itself with all its weapnoary and stuff.....but the soldiers who run it may not  be able to.......They dont have the wholeheartedness to do unlike in other countries , they have patriotic dedicated soldiers who dont mind since they consider it a duty..<br><br>But here? Most of them do not want to be soldiers....cant blame them as it is not thier fault...They wan to do great things and have a family, wife to support... some of them (not all) they way they are treated affects them for the rest of their life in a negative manner...it's quite clear cut in male NTU &amp; Nus students...The attitude just follows over after their 2 year stint......when they come for reservist they have that heck care attitude especially those in a rifleman vocation, the most important section of the army- most are non-grads with little or no post secondary education...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think now NS had improved quite sa lot in the way its been run....some of u old brudders here might be talking about the SAF of the 80s which was well, crap.......<br><br>Because now i believe the unit CO is in charge of welfare of his men. Mindef now takes a strict view of unfair or biased treatment in the army...if a servicemen has a valid reason with his complaint, action or warning will be given to those regulars by the CO.....in summary its like the old, tried and tested army philosophy in effect:-<br><br>CO to regular: " I dont care what u do, u go solve the problem and report to me"<br><br>SO the regulars have t play it smart not to have their names tarnished...I believe this is the way to go...<br></div>
