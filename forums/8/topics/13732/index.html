            <div class='col-md body'>Eh fishersprice... First step to become christian is to go to church. One church I know (and is my church) is Bethany Church English Service at 14.00 at Hyatt Hotel (Scott Road).. If you don't have any church yet and if u re interested, u come wif me (though I usually go for Indonesian service one.. coz this church got 2 language services).. I will check this forum until the day after tomorrow in case u re interested (reply this msg) ..</div>

I would rather go through hell to save you, and many others, including Chu Mei-Feng, than to go to Heaven without you. Ain't I compassionate and loving as well? Interested in worshipping me? You can call your whole school to my home, or rather my heaven. My garden(of Eden) probably just can fit all of you, and I can sit on the rooftop(throne) and you all can worship me and sing my praises! opposite got ambassador from some country not sure if flag is egypt or saudi(but still muslim!), you all can go pray and kneel to me and backside face his flags. how nice. 1 stone kill 2 bird! tell me if you interested.<br></div>

He won't died in cross for u right? He doesn't want everyone go to hell, so He descent from heaven to earth just to die so He rules between live and death. Now He will free everyone who believe in Him from death in hell.<br><br>Don't be afraid or shy if anybody shout you "any fulgar words" like some people in this forum because you pronounce your faith. They are not better than you .. but worse, *maybe* they are religionless.. law disobidiencers, and so on.<br><br>Knowing that religion teaches how to do kindness, but someone having no religion ask someone not to have religion.. it is shame of them.. it is just like to suggest people to kill rather to love. And perhaps... because of their faithness.. they cry every night feeling something empty/missing in their heart .. feeling injustice and useless in their lives ... that is just because they don't know how to appreciate "1 chance of live" like you do...<br><br>To All:<br>Not to late to have a religion ... just chose one or any.. but if you choose not to have religion, don't ask somebody not to have... it is like asking your kid to go to have fun everyday instead of school...<br><br>To chokky:<br>Anyone can sacrifice himself by going to hell ... but they will never come back for hell is not their place, nor they created hell, or they are kings/masters on hell. To hell/heaven is a one way ticket...<br>But the One who created the hell already took control over it. Who believe in that One, will not go to hell, for who don't believe on the One, well ... depends on their own faith .. if they dream to go to heaven, oke loh, if they believe they will reincernate.. is also fine loh.. coz it is their faith.. at least I just want to said base on my faith: Heaven is not created by man, and no man can control whether he will go to heaven or not.. only the One who created heaven, hell, earth and everything knows.<br><br>Do not think not to have religion is good coz .. "The biggest sin of man if they don't recognize who created them..." meaning ... people who don't know how to give thanks to their creator.<br></div>

That time man named Jusuf which is one of Israel's son is sent by God so the Israelites won't perish becoz of famine. In egypt, Jusuf become Prime Minister, a second ruler after Pharaoh. Then he provided the meal for the house of Israel that's why u now still can see Israel country.<br>Long after Jusuf, Israel become bigger in number and strong in physics so Egyptians were afraid of Israel. So they put Israelities for slavery. They force Israel to work with minimum food, to build the ancients buildings which you can see until now: Pyramids. So Israelities prayed to God and asked God to deliver them from hand of Egypt.

Even though they become a hypocrite, they sense in their heart that they are sinners, and they feel guilty (because they acknowledge "sin"). Their religion senses prevent them to do sin further (if their senses still working). In order for the senses keep working, believer must worship their God. One of serveral ways of Christianity to worship God is by going to church.<br><br>Benefit of being free thinker:<br>Someone can become hypocrite as free as they want. They can do good and justice thingy, but in their heart, they don't agree why must they do good things if they can cheat... for more money or more power perhaps??<br>They dun want to acknowledge what is sin, maybe simply becoz they are afraid by its fruit which is hell? So they also won't acknowledge hell too, as well as heaven and God! They realized that there is nothing to be responsible on with their action, except if their action were known by public... as what in their minds: public also believe what public saw or heard, and don't believe what which can be seen/heard.. which is also free thinker's base idea.<br><br>The funnies case if a free thinker admit that he/she have religion...</div>

And the family torture the daughter. Nobody oso dun bother about the daughter safety. Then, the daughter pleaded and asked you to carry her wif you. Then you asked his parent to let her go. In reverse, the parents want to kill both you and her daughter... AND ... later you found out that you are PRIME MINISTER, all POLICEMEN are under your command. You have told the parents to let go the daughter with many punishment.. but the harder you try, the worsen the torture to the daughter. What will you do?<br><br>And .. what will you do if you are GOD which created between the EGYPT and ISRAEL? GOD want ISRAEL free from slavery and worship only GOD. Should EGYPT which is GOD's creation disobey? If you have 2 dogs, and one dog always bite another dog. Don't you have "RIGHT" to seperate them so the other won't be killed? Or you will let them as it is... The tortured dog always crying on your feet leh?? still can tahan?? Israel is not dog leh??<br></strong><br><br>[This message has been edited by LexZEUS (edited 22 February 2002).]</div>
