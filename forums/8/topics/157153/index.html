            <div class='col-md body'>It was a truly amazing experience which touched me to the core after my visit to Tuba island, near Langkawi in Malaysia. The moment I stepped foot on this little rustic island, home to 4000 local natives and fishermen, peace descended on me and I felt the stress, tension, noise of the city fell away...<br><br>I was greeted by the curious and friendly smiles and waves of the people as I hopped onto the motorbike - the key form of transport on the island - I would later find out that there are only sixteen cars on this 20 square kilometre island...Thick lush greenery dotted the horizon, and rich padi fields stretched out and beyond - cows, and goats were king of the road - they gazed at me, unfazed as I made my way the traffic of animals...water buffaloes lolled around in the mud and padi fields, happily soaking in the sun, with the wind rushing in my ears and the sun streaming on my face, all my troubles melted away...<br><br>The beach front chalet was basic but comfortable - I was struck again by the ringing silence and surrounding peace. When it was high tide, the fishes swam right up to the chalet, and they were soon feeding from my hands...<br><br>The highlight of my trip had to be the island trip, where I was treated to a scrumptious BBQ seafood lunch on one of the private beaches...fresh fish, crabs, prawns, satay - as they say "the way to the heart is through the stomach" - that must have been the moment when I fell hard in love with Tuba and its neighbouring islands, and has stayed that way since <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> the perfect ending to a day filled with idyllic bumming on the beach all to myself, a visit to the caves - was the beautiful sunset that graced the skies as the boat made its way gently back to shore....<br><br>I love Tuba, the beautiful people, and the everlasting peace - to think that rustic and remote islands around the world are fast becoming extinct, I'm so happy to have discovered a place like Tuba - I hope it will remain untouched for many generations to come!<br><br>In case anyone is interested, here is some information on Tuba island:<br><br><a href="http://www.langkawismartours.com/island.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.langkawismartours.com/island.htm</a><br></div>
