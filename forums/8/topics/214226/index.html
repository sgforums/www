Any woman who looks half-reasonable can hit potential suitors with the classic double-whammy of stellar expectations plus a seriously bad attitude.<br><br>Datukmike explains the problem:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"The financial centre is full of some seriously attractive women. The only problem is they are looking for extremely heavy wallets and stock or property portfolios."</span><br><br>Generally the Singapore women are not that good to be with. They either think they are Western and talk with fake whiney Yankee accents and pretend to be over-the-top outgoing and bubbly - any trip out involving at least one jewellery shop - or they have the personality of a slug. Mind you, both groups still shag the same so you make your choice based on affordability and what annoys you least.<br><br>Farang girls can be equally irritating but at least they don't ask for diamonds before they put out. Six Bacardi Breezers and a couple of lewd suggestions are usually all it takes.<br><br>Greedy Eastern materialism combined with a bad Western attitude makes Singapore girls singularly unappealing to men and this could ultimately spell disaster for the small island nation. The average Singaporean woman produces just 1.26 offspring during her lifetime - far less than is required to maintain a stable population.<br><br>There is, however, a ray of hope for Singapore's lonely men:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Any sensible bloke just finds himself a Malaysian Chinese, preferably from Penang or Ipoh - they are not too materialistic, great fun, and are still slim. I am biased of course since I am married to one."</span><br><br>Datukmike isn't the only Singapore resident to arrive at the same conclusion - as reported by The Sunday Times.<br><br>Increasing numbers of Singaporean men are marrying foreign women who are viewed as more demure and accommodating, a report said yesterday. Malaysians currently form the bulk of the foreign brides but Vietnamese and Chinese are gaining ground. Men queried by The Sunday Times said they want a woman who will put family and husband first, instead of demanding condominiums, cars and credit cards. Figures showed 6,520 males and permanent residents married foreign woman last year, a quarter of all marriages - dpa.<br><br>The feminists will, no doubt, accuse these men of exploiting foreign women but, when you're looking to start a family, the last thing you need is a wife who is greedy, materialistic and selfish.<br><br>It would be easy to write Singapore off as a special case but the birth rate has fallen to similarly unsustainable levels in most European countries for precisely the same reasons.<br><br>Unless more foreign brides are found to fill the gap, it won't be long before Western civilisation disappears up it's own arse.<br><br></div>

(Much like Singapore itself, where the theory is far more attractive than the real thing.) But Singaporeans have taken the worst of all worlds, and created a uniquely charmless national character that is all their own.<br><br>The experience of being married to one of the island automatons was so bad that the idea of suicide seriously crossed my mind on literally dozens of occasions.<br><br>The day of our divorce - the happiest day of my life so far - coincided with her birthday. To this day, I make sure to send her a big bunch of roses every year on this most auspicious of anniversaries.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This time, the comments are by a Singaporean (in the same website, above)<br>by moniker of aniyaseo, Oct 6...<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Take it from the horse's mouth. I'm Singaporean and married to a Thai wife. I stopped dating Singapore women some 6 years before I got married, and for good reasons.<br><br>The biggest problem with Singapore women is in their deluded mindset. They always think that they are better, and hence deserve better - which is of course light years from the truth on both counts. They're a sorely misguided bunch who expect endless chivalry and pampering, but at the same time they overzealously assert themselves as men's equals, or worse, superiors.<br><br>Singapore women like to put down Singapore men who marry foreign Asian women as being intimidated by an equal. That's a laugh. In my 6 years abstinence from Singapore girls, I was dating the perceived superior farang girls before I met my Thai wife. My wife is more feisty and fiercely independent than any Singapore girl I know, and yet she's also one of the most beautiful, sexy and loving women living in Singapore. If there's anyone who's intimidated, its the Singapore women who have lost their feminine charm and edge.<br><br></div>

Every girls and guys are different. They have different expectations and thinking. All have their good points and their flaws.<br><br>It all boils down to their mindset. And well.. not all Singaporean women are that materialistic. What's important for them is they should put families first before their career. Realize that the role of the woman is to be a helper to the man, who is the leader, the one who takes charge in the family, unless the man is a weakling or an indecisive idiot. If he is so, then I think there's every right for a woman to rise up and take charge herself. If man aren't strong enough in taking charge and making important decisions in life, how would one expect a lady to respect and submit to that man? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
