Any woman who looks half-reasonable can hit potential suitors with the classic double-whammy of stellar expectations plus a seriously bad attitude.<br><br>Datukmike explains the problem:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"The financial centre is full of some seriously attractive women. The only problem is they are looking for extremely heavy wallets and stock or property portfolios."</span><br><br>Generally the Singapore women are not that good to be with. They either think they are Western and talk with fake whiney Yankee accents and pretend to be over-the-top outgoing and bubbly - any trip out involving at least one jewellery shop - or they have the personality of a slug. Mind you, both groups still shag the same so you make your choice based on affordability and what annoys you least.<br><br>Farang girls can be equally irritating but at least they don't ask for diamonds before they put out. Six Bacardi Breezers and a couple of lewd suggestions are usually all it takes.<br><br>Greedy Eastern materialism combined with a bad Western attitude makes Singapore girls singularly unappealing to men and this could ultimately spell disaster for the small island nation. The average Singaporean woman produces just 1.26 offspring during her lifetime - far less than is required to maintain a stable population.<br><br>There is, however, a ray of hope for Singapore's lonely men:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Any sensible bloke just finds himself a Malaysian Chinese, preferably from Penang or Ipoh - they are not too materialistic, great fun, and are still slim. I am biased of course since I am married to one."</span><br><br>Datukmike isn't the only Singapore resident to arrive at the same conclusion - as reported by The Sunday Times.<br><br>Increasing numbers of Singaporean men are marrying foreign women who are viewed as more demure and accommodating, a report said yesterday. Malaysians currently form the bulk of the foreign brides but Vietnamese and Chinese are gaining ground. Men queried by The Sunday Times said they want a woman who will put family and husband first, instead of demanding condominiums, cars and credit cards. Figures showed 6,520 males and permanent residents married foreign woman last year, a quarter of all marriages - dpa.<br><br>The feminists will, no doubt, accuse these men of exploiting foreign women but, when you're looking to start a family, the last thing you need is a wife who is greedy, materialistic and selfish.<br><br>It would be easy to write Singapore off as a special case but the birth rate has fallen to similarly unsustainable levels in most European countries for precisely the same reasons.<br><br>Unless more foreign brides are found to fill the gap, it won't be long before Western civilisation disappears up it's own arse.<br><br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Wah rao please, it's like that everywhere in the world. Woman... when love is not involved, they go for the one with the most cash. Man... when love is not involved, they go for the best physical attributes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I shall quote one reply:<br><br>'...Every place I've ever been, women look for, among other things, the guys with fat wallets.
