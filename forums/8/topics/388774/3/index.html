              <p>so auntie thought Sg guys are shy and gutless...</p>
              <p>why is there a need to talk to such Sg gals when u dun want to? there is a law for it? is there such an obligation? vice versa, such Sg gals thought too highly of themselves and dreamt they are holding a pot of gold with their corkansians and almost nakedly they are nothing but "unlicensed prostitutes"....</p>
              <p>it is only because we know these Sg gals too well....we rather get on with our life and our career than to waste time on hypocrites..</p>

              <p>To know girls, you must be very thick skin.</p>
              <p>Walk up and speak the truth you want to know her.</p>
              <p>Then it is her turn whether she wants to know you.</p>
              <p>Anyway, girls also hope to be approached by guys too.</p>
              <p>One problem with Asian Girls, especially Singapore Chinese Girls are usually they are shy by nature and even if they have liking for you , they tend to act the opposite manner and many guys don't know how to turn around the whole game to make the girl or whole group of girls to feel at ease with you.</p>
