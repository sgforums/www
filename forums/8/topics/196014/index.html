            <div class='col-md body'>I live in a condominium in one of those low rise blocks...now recently there's this guy who looks about 40-50 wearing a singlet and shorts and slippers and is nearly bald and he lives in the high rise block. He makes a lot of noise shouting everywhere, whistling loudly to nobody, fights with cleaners, empties rubbish chutes onto the block, steals the old newspapers which others want to collect to sell, dirties the lift by spray painting and throwing condoms in it and throwing dung in it and reported to the guards somebody else did it.<br><br>Well he is said to live with one of his relatives who is rich...and now the whole block is kinda scared of him and some rather take the stairs. They tried calling police but they said since it's a private estate they are unable to take action, and that the guy hasn't done anything that serious for them to have a reason to take him away.<br><br>Just last night my neighbour was hungry and wanted to walk to Rail Mall and so he did with me and another friend...so when we passed the block he saw the guy and he was whistling at about 23:45 and then he started following us talking extremely loudly on a handphone...at that time i didn't know who he was because all of the above was what my parents told me...so we actually didn't care about him.<br><br>However as we walked out of the estate he kept following us...and when we crossed the road he did so too...and he sounded like some gangster so we decided to take a cab away from him. He even tried to chase the cab by running on the road. We could hear him shouting the plate number into his phone..<br><br>Well so later my neighbour's friend called his mother to fetch us back and so we asked her and she said she had known about this for a while...she said the guy was mad or something.<br><br>But my father didn't think so. well he reckons that the guy was too bored, and decided to cause some trouble. He said that because the guy didn't look like a madman, and he did stuff that didn't enable the police to arrest him...<br><br>so if the condominium wanted to get rid of him, how could they do it?</div>
