              <p>doing charity transcends all boundaries. the laptop only costs USD$199, and it helps to change the world. isn't it a worthy investment? :)</p>
              <p>just read the website to know more, and even if you all do not purchase and donate the laptop, it will help to create more awareness. :)</p>

              <p>Personally, I feel that you don't need a laptop to be empowered and have a proper mean to education. How did we learn in the past when there was no laptops? It is thru books, teachers, your own self etc.. maybe we should donate books instead. :) Hmm, i presume in developing countries they do not have access to internet as well, so what good can a laptop do when most, if not all, knowledge can be gained from internet now?? Anyway this project was started like 3 or 4 years ago, last time it was code name as hundred dollar laptop if i din remember wrongly.</p>

              <p>Errr.. so Africa you mean the tribe there got power points meh? Then how they charge their laptop leh? Solar power?</p>
              <p>Then ah.. the laptop got wireless... but in the first place the tribe/village got WLAN network meh??!!</p>
              <p>And instead of giving them laptops, why not do it the tested and proven way - ie through proper schools and curriculum? In the first place, the kids will know how to use the laptop meh? And if they are being taught by people to use the laptop.. why can't the same people teach the curriculum instead of teaching them how to use the laptop only? I think for USD 199, you can hire like quite a few teachers in africa which will benefit more children, rather than paying for ONE lousy laptop?</p>

              <p>Oh so please help me answer the following doubts about the OLPC project. From the OLPC wiki, they did mention that the target age of OLPC is 6-12. Heck, if singapore school children do not need laptops for them to achieve proper education, why do the african children need laptops? Imagine a class of 20 african children x USD 199 = USD 3980. How many african teachers' combined salary is equivalent to that? How many more students can the african teachers educate as compared to 20 laptops used by 20 privileged african children?</p>
              <p>By the way, UMPC is a business move by laptop companies, they produce it  because it is profitable. We are having nice classy UMPC because people are willing to pay for them and buy them.</p>
