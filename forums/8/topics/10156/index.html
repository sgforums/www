            <div class='col-md body'>In life, it's a matter of what you choose to believe.<br>Nowadays, 6 out of 10 marriages failed. But do you choose to believe that you are among the 4, or the 6? ?<br><br>#CASE 1<br>Getting married is like going to a restaurant with friends.You order what you want, then when you see what the other fellow has, you wish you had ordered that.<br><br>#CASE 2<br>At the cocktail party, one woman said to another, "Aren't you wearing your wedding ring on the wrong finger??" The other replied, "Yes, I am. I married the wrong man."<br><br>#CASE 3<br>Man is incomplete until he is married. Then he is really finished.<br><br>#CASE 4<br>Marriage is an institution in which a man losses his bachelor's degree and the woman gets her master's.<br><br>#CASE 5<br>A little boy asked his father, "Daddy, how much does it cost to get married??" And the father replied, "I don't know son, I'm still paying for it."<br><br>#CASE 6<br>Young son : "Is it true, Dad, I heard that in some parts of Africa, a man doesn't know his wife until he marries her?" Dad : "That happens in most countries son."<br><br>#CASE 7<br>Then there was a man who said, "I never knew what real happiness was until I got married, and then it was too late."<br><br>#CASE 8<br>A happy marriage is a matter of give and take; the husband gives and the wife takes<br><br>#CASE 9<br>When a newly married man looks happy, we know why. But when a ten-year married man looks happy, we wonder why.<br><br>#CASE 10<br>Married life is very frustrating. In the first year of marriage, the man speaks and the woman listens. In the second year, the woman speaks and the man listens. In the third year, they both speak and the neighbours listen.<br><br>#CASE 11<br>After a quarrel, a wife said to her husband, "You know, I was a fool when I married you." And the husband replied, "Yes, dear, but I was in love and didn't notice it."<br><br>#CASE 12<br>A man inserted an 'ad' in the classifieds : "Wife wanted".The next day, he received hundreds letters. They all said the same thing "You can have mine."<br><br>#CASE 13<br>When a man opens the door of his car for his wife, you can be sure of one thing : either the car is new or his wife.<br><br>#CASE 14<br>A woman was telling her friend : "It is I who made my husband a millionaire." "And what was he before you married him?" the friend asked. The woman replied, "A multi-millionaire."<br><br>------------------<br><strong>NOTHING'S GONNA CHANGE MY LOVE FOR YOU<br>YOU OUGHT TO KNOW BY NOW HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU<br>ONE THING YOU CAN BE SURE OF<br>I'LL NEVER ASK FOR MORE THAN YOUR LOVE </strong></div>
