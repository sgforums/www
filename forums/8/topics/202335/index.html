            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>This is rather embarrassing.I'm a tertiary student and of late(the last 2 weeks) have been experiencing extreme bladder problem. I have to go to the toilet before bus trips, and I can't seem to hold it for more then 20mins. However, sometimes when I give in to my urges, and rush to a toilet, I only pee alittle.<br><br>It seems that I can't hold back my bladder.Any suggestions is greatly apperciated. And also, can someone tell me what cause it to happen? As I'm fine most of the time at home. However, sometimes i sorta feel that my bladder is like rapidly filling up even though I've just peed less then a second ago.<br><br>Please Help</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I mean seriously, personally I think its pyschological.Coz ususally, before I had this problem, it is my habit to pee before i take the long bus ride to school. But now it became sorta like a run-away bladder problem. Its really embarrassing, but thankfully my gf is understanding to my situation. She told me that it might be kidney problem, which is really freaking me out. Btw, the doctor made an appointment again next Mon. The doc. also did suspect that it might be stones.But if it really is stones, why is it that I only feel the urge when I'm on the bus or when I'm out?Is it because I'm moving etc.?</div>

Do a whole body MRI scan and see whether you problem right now gets worse and worse, Affecting ones lifestyle is a bad sign.<br><br>On the other hand, it may simply be lack of exercises on your ---- do some exercises starting with hold the pee for 20secs and relax and do again for bout 5 rounds.<br><br>Above is all my suggestions.
