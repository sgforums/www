            <div class='col-md body'>How to judge a ebay seller.<br><br>1) Look at the seller sales record - at least over 40 sales.<br><br>2) Check his transaction - look at the buyers.<br>Check where they are from .... your case look ok , got buyer from germany...also and other countries , not from taiwan only. that is good.<br><br>3) check his previous sales - check how the bidding goes - You will see if this is an honest seller . Why, if you keep seening a few same bidder that comes in to jack up the price .... than better be careful - as he may be using a few ids to jack up his price, if you bid. Then you better be prepare to pay more for it.<br><br>4) Look at his good listing. Why .... the moment you put up things for sales on ebay .... unless there is a special promotion offer free listing...., the seller would have to incurred money to list on ebay already... If this seller have a good size of items listed that mean he has already committed money into ebay .... which mean make no sense of him running off with your item, as it will be like paying $100 to try to cheat you out of $300.</div>
