            <div class='col-md body'>It just happened to me yet again yesterday <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I had to go to my uni. To go there need to take mrt then bus.<br>I left a bit late from my house but there was still ample chances of me making it to school in time.<br><br>First signs of Murphy's law: I JUST missed the mrt and the next one was peculiarly after 10 min (not something u see during rush hours).<br><br>Then when changing train at Jurong East, I again just missed the change over train!! No worries eh? The next train came in 2 min =) But stayed at platform with doors open for 10 min.. :/<br><br>Finally when I reached the bus interchange I JUST missed my bus!!<br><br>Eventually after getting in the bus, half way thru I noticed that the bus was stopping at every damned bus stop!! (in peak hours usually it doesn't as its too crowded and 99% of crowd is going to the school)<br><br>To add on to that, it was getting stuck at EVERY traffic light!!<br><br>Finally when i reached school and wanted to get down at the bus stop, I looked for the "Bus-Stop" button to press.....<br><br>And I couldn't find any button within reach. Usually there are at least 10 to 15 getting down at that bus stop so I didn't gan-cheong and press the button. Wait happily till last minute :/<br><br>So I eventually decided to ask people to press button for me. To press the nearest one I had to go thru 3 people, and by the time it was pressed we had passed the bus stop!!!!!!!!!!!!! #$@$%@#$<br><br>Eventually after getting down at next bus stop I hurriedly WALKED BACK to my destination where my friend was supposed to be waiting. Only upon reaching my destination I got a call, from my friend, that she will be another 10 min late............
