            <div class='col-md body'>Let me attempt to answer some of the questions (obviously posed by a very angry individual).<br><br>1) Singaporean males with criminal records are NOT exempted from NS. Just go ask around and you will see that this is true. There is however, a very small group of people who happen to fall into a category called the "incorrigibles". These are people, as suggested by the name, who are beyond any hope. They repeatedly get into trouble (being in NS increases the chances). Training them is a total waste of resources and the nation is better off without them. You can "qualify" to be one and exempt yourself from NS if you have a "colourful" history.<br><br>2) Mindef prob did not implement the concept of Total Defence earlier because they didn't have incredible geniuses like you to come up with the idea. (might as wel ask why Mankind did not land on the Moon earlier...duh)  Also, the success of a campaign cannot be measured unless one can compare the results of having the campaign with the results if the campaign wasn't launched. What I am saying is, without the courtesy campaign, Singapore might have become a worse place. In this sense, shouldn't the campaign should be a success? Last point about this: it doesn't mean that the government should give up just cuz the likelihood of success of a certain campaign is low. They should just try their best to do what is right. The writer seems to think he is smarter than the Harvard or Oxbridge graduates. He seems to think he is blessed with prescience. National Education is especially impt to a small, vulnerable nation with such diverse roots. Being surrounded by larger nations with largely different religions and mores as well as having an increasingly materialistic generation indulging in pop culture do not help either. NE is merely a tool to help ensure the continuance of our nation.<br><br>3) Perhaps a reason why an A level or poly student has to serve 2.5 years of NS instead of 2 years (in the case of their relatively lower educated counterparts) is because the higher or longer one stays in education, the more subsidy one receives from the government. Unaware to the writer, a person actually receives a significant amount of education subsidy for every year of education he receives. It therefore becomes "fair" that those who receive more should also give more. Another more practical reason is because assuming these more highly educated people are going into unis, they will have a few months to bum  around before the uni terms start between july and sept. lastly, the demand for services of this group of soldiers is higher relative to supply. Having longer NS liability is aimed at easing the supply shortage.<br><br>4) The escalating crime rate for female adolescents is due to many reasons and having them serve NS is not the solution to the problem. Perhaps the best solution to the problem would be through proper education.<br><br>5) Obviously a method of calculating the cost of a professional army would be by looking at their pay. An NS corporal is paid something like 300+ a month as opposed to 1000+ for a Regular. I think common sense (which sad to say, isn't all that common as exhibited by the writer) will tell you that a professional army is going to increase the cost manifold.<br><br>6) is it the fault of the government if the young do not take NS seriously when they ought to? Should NS be demolished, or be called some dumb name just cuz many serve it unwillingly? Imagine who's the first to be blamed should sg be attacked one day and there is no credible defence force to deter this?<br><br>7) Where do you think the increase in allowance is going to come from? Lemme give you a clue...it's T_xes. Isn't it a zero sum game in the end? This is a classic case of a myopic fool who is incapable of taking a more macro view on things. It is almost analagous to the idiot who rejoices when firms get into a price war...failing to realise that the final surviving firms of the price war will eventually jack up the prices once they gain control of the market and the victims are not just the small firms, but also the consumers in the end.</div>
