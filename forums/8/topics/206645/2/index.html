The shares soon came off their highs and closed at 11.40 dollars, still up 1.8 dollars, or 18.8 percent from the previous day.<br><br>However, analysts said the loss-making Singapore company faces an uphill battle to get its business back on track after investing heavily in the last two years to challenge Apple's dominance in the MP3 music player market.<br><br>"Their cost structure is still too high, they are still losing money," said Claudio Checchia, a regional research manager with International Data Corp.<br><br>"They still have to go a long way to improving their own cost structure and trying to get sales high," he told AFP.<br><br>Jonathan Ng, a technology analyst with CIMB brokerage, said the settlement has cleared the uncertainty of a possible long legal battle.<br><br>"However, the settlement does not change our negative view on its core businesses. Demand for its audio products have been waning, and competition for the MP3 player market has intensified.<br><br>"We still cannot find any new 'killer' products from Creative that could help revive strong earnings recovery in the near term."<br><br>Ng however raised his fair value for Creative by 1.85 dollars to 10.50 dollars per share and upgraded the brokerage's rating on the stock to a "trading buy" due to the windfall from the settlement.<br><br>He also increased his year-to-June 2007 net profit estimate for Creative to 99.40 million US dollars from a previous forecast for loss of 600,000 US dollars.<br><br>Under the deal Apple will pay Creative 100 million dollars for a license to use the technology and would be able to recover some of the money if Creative licensed the patent to others, according to the companies.<br><br>Creative would also begin marketing its own line of iPod accessories as part of Apple's "Made for iPod" program.<br><br>Creative chairman and chief executive Sim Wong Hoo said in a statement the settlement with Apple "opened up significant new opportunities" for his company.<br><br>The firm's participation in the "made for iPod" program should provide market opportunities for Creative's speaker systems, headphones and the future family of X-Fi audio enhancement products, Sim said.<br><br>"It is definitely going to bolster the fact that Creative does have superior technology... It shows that it is a technology company, just that Apple has more superior marketing," said DBS Vickers analyst Don See said, noting that the Singapore firm was strong in headphones and speaker systems design.<br><br>The deal ended a legal battle that began earlier this month after Creative was awarded what it referred to as a "Zen patent" on technology used to select and sort songs in its Zen MP3 player.<br><br>In May, Creative filed a lawsuit and a patent complaint in the United States against Apple aimed at halting the import and sale of the allegedly infringing Apple iPod and iPod Nano products in the giant US market.<br><br>Creative has paid dearly in its unsuccessful bid to challenge Apple in the MP3 player market as the Singapore outfit slipped into the red for the year to June with a loss of 118.2 million US dollars.<br><br>The company gained global fame for its SoundBlaster card that allowed personal computers to be used as home entertainment units but its follow-up products have struggled to match the success of the sound cards.</div>
