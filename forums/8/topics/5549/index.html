            <div class='col-md body'>Reading through the forum, I must admit that I am shocked, though I needn't be. What's this obsession with big boobs , a pretty face and long legs? Even the self-proclaimed SNAGs who write that their requirements aren't high,write that" for looks, anything is ok as long as they are pretty" ????<br>Are looks really so important? What about the character behind the faces? Not-so-attractive girls tend to be much nicer in nature but noone ever bothers to find out because they are distracted by the "chio bus"<br>I won't be surprised if many guys on this site are left in the dust, unable to find a gf, hence the pathetic posts like " ways to know if a girl likes you"  and "why do girls prefer ah bengs to nice guys"<br>Please! Stop whining and lower your expectations. There are only a few "dropdead gorgeous babes" to go round and guys must realise that they can't all have one each.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that the whole idea of physical attraction is on everyones mind.  So is character, but we don't go out and automatically spot people out for their characters/personalities.  When u are anywhere, what u see first is the looks.  It is important as it is the only thing u will ever know about anyone until u talk to them.  I think that it's pretty obvious that noone is going to go out an dsay to themselves, "I think I'll go and talk to her becasue she isn't so pretty, hence her personality must be good."....It just doesn't make sense.  I think that if the average joe talks to the average girl, it is probably because she is less threatening than ,say someone who is really preety with legs all the way to her neck.  Anywhere we are, we will always look at beauty in whatever form it may be.  It is our initial impression.  Girls will look at good looking guys and guys will look at pretty girls.  It's natural.  I would like to be so bold to say that I think that average girls and less-than-average girls usually don't make many friends outside unless it's from associations from friends and such.  They usually have their own circle of friends already that they meet people from.  It's not that they just automatically get picked up or guys approach them.<br><br>Likewise for guys.  It's the excat same thing.<br><br>In a perfect world, it wouldn't be like this, but it isn't perfect...unfortunately.:-p<br><br>Let me just ask u this.  I would like to think that if a person were anywhere, and they could choose to go and talk to a not so good looking girl or guy or go and talk to a better looking guy or girl, he or she would choose to talk to the better looking one.  That is unless u already have this impression that all pretty girls and boys must be screwed up in character.  If u think like that, then it basically means ur being just as shallow as the person who's only going for looks.  U cast a bias against the more attractive person and hence has no chance with u...and vice-versa.<br><br>In the end, it's ur choice.  But truthfully speaking, most people would rather be talking to the better looking person.  How do we know that they are fucked up.  We don't really.  Maybe they are just as nice and we lose that chance.  In the end, u end up with a not so good looking guy or girl when u had the chance to end up with a better looking one who is just as nice.  Of course this is the ideal way of thinking about it, but I think that u get the gist of it.<br><br>A would also like to say that I am contradicting myslef here as I've been blasting good looking people the last few days...I might have inadvertently answered some questions that were posed by me and a few others earlier about why girls and guys only go for looks.  Becasue u never know.  Again, I seem to have left the not so good looking guys in a sadder position, which wasn't my intent..but somehow it lead to it...<br><br>...DOH!!!!<br><br>This conversation can go round and round and end up back right where we started from...Brain Drain  duhhhhh......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok....now one of my papers is over and I am up and running and can counteract all the "accusations" I supposedly read about on this forum. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To answer Aphrodite:<br><br>Firstly, I'd wish to clarify that any guy who proclaims he is a SNAG is OBVIOUSLY egotistical, because I feel that this is a girl's way of labelling a guy, and anyhow no one can know himself well enough to proclaim to the world that he is an SNAG. Therefore, I stress that i do NOT say that I am SNAG or anything close to it, all I am doing is describing my thoughts, feelings and emotions and letting others decide for themselves. Thank you.<br><br>Second issue is on the supposed "Girl with a pretty face" theory. So if you've read one of my posts you'll realise that I have expectations about my ideal girl, but hey who doesn't ? Ask around and you'd find guys with longer lists (in the physical department) and also girls with even LONGER lists for their ideal guy.<br><br>My point is: After mixing around in the University for 2.5 years, I've come to realise that some not-so-pretty girls have good characters too. Believe me when I say that I have considered most girls who were my friends even though they may not be the best-lookers. I would assess their character and attitudes and see if there is any possibility of us getting together. If I want to find out more, I would just ask her out for lunch at a nearby canteen in school.....hey after all we're just friends right ?<br><br>To carry on, most of the time I feel that the girl is not my type, either for reasons of religion, commitment to relationship (some Uni girls obviously put studies and career in front of getting a bf), attitude to a guy like me and various other reasons. If so, then usually I will carry on being friends with her and nothing goes further.<br><br>Believe me I have "chased" many girls whom I thought would make a nice gf and that we could get along and they are NOT as chio or cute or pretty as I described in my requirements (this has been verified by male and female parties who have seen my targets)....only to be rejected time and again for I don't know what reasons.<br><br>Therefore, the bottom line is: I realise that girls can have a heart of gold yet not look good and I can appreciate that too, but it's just that I have not been lucky so far. Don't assume that every guy goes for the nearest babe in school (frankly I avoid those for GF because of the stigma attached that they can get any guy they want, so why should they even CONSIDER me)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheers !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Aphrodite,<br><br>You hit the nail on the spot... As firewire said, would you talk to a guy who is more attractive or the one next to him?? I know I would... it is the sad fact of life and all there is. Since young, society has "stereotpyed" that bad guys are ugly and the good ones are the knights in shiny armour... same for the opposite sex. Happens that in our childhood, this system has more or less sinked into our most impressionable young minds. And hence, when we grow up, we stick to "conventions". Sad fact, but that's what happens. I agree that it is most superficial to do something like that, but can you bring yourself to do otherwise?? My friend and I had this thing for this topic, we tried just talking to any random person on the streets (at least in school) but it turns out that there will always be an inclination to go for "beauty" or at least presentation. What can I say? I personally have tried not to go for looks, but most certainly have not succeeded nor have I failed hopelessly. I have met my share of pretty girls, I suppose some just give me the bumps because of the vaccuum between the ears, but othersI have enjoyed talking to. I must say that all the girl friends I know are worth the friendship, some are really gorgeous, some are not.. but I don't really care, because after a while their nice characters meld into their looks making them beautiful. The bottom line is that looks and presentation are the key to interaction. I'm sure you would want to start a conversation with a slob and preference would be made over a better looking person. Maybe I seem shallow proclaiming myself and so on, but its my 2 cents. Thank you for reading.<br><br>the hole that leaks air</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to share a thought with everyone here.  I am a nice guy, but I will never profess to be perfect.  My "perfection" or niceness ends here....<br><br>Sometimes, almost always, if I get to know a girl who is not very good looking(really slack), I will usually be quite ok with it.  No problems unless they have fucked up characters...and don't believe that ugly people can be fucked up cause they can be....<br><br>The porblem arises when , if for some reason i feel that they are falling for me, I tend to take the quickest exit out the back door.  It does have to do with how they look...really lame I know...<br><br>If it was a pretty girl and I didn't really like her in that way but she liked me, i would be a lot more ok with it.<br><br>There's no excuse for this.  I usually can explain things to death, but not this.  Shallow as shallow can get.  And I'm sure I've hurt their feelings quite badly also because I can remember it used to be me in their shoes.  ....Could any one explain this. I can't.  We already know that it's really lame, pathetic, shallow, etc..., but what do y'all feel about it.<br><br>Just don't get me wrong and think that I automatically don't like or befriend ugly or less than average people.  It's just when this situation hits home....why why why!!!!??????????????????<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, very basically males are hormonally driven creatures, putting it down to a base level, guys at times do treat female partners like throphies, I mean how many guys have never ever passed that simple remark like "I wonder what's that DDG (drop dead goregous) babe doing with a toad like him?"<br><br>I too was onced obsessed with the ideal of having a DDG gal, in fact I would prefer her to be able to look great in a two piece swimsuit and perform brain surgery at the same time.<br><br>However, cos of the practically of the limited number of goregous female neurosurgeons around and the ernomous demand for them, I guess I would have to start settling for less......<br><br>But at the end of the day, one conclusion that I can make is that I want a female that can excite my mind rather than just my loins.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i thk this goes both ways, both guys and gers are naturally attracted to looks first. i agree w firewire in tt physical appearance is usually the only thg you can see and judge in a person when you first meet him/her. it's only after you guys have spoken to each other, gotten to know each other, etc., tt you can finally know who tt person truly is.<br>one might not approach a ger/guy he/she meets on the st if the "OOD" isnt gd-looking, but tt doesnt mean tt he/she wld refuse the not-so-gdlooking ger/guy as a fren. often, one's SO comes frm the circle of frens ard them, after they have gotten to know each other, and when this happens, looks dont play as impt a role as it wld on the first meeting.<br>if you profess to be unmoved by good looks, tt you arent attracted to "yandaokias" and tt hugo boss model, sorry, but i wld label you hypocritical. everyone's attracted to beauty, in humans and objs ard, the only dif is whether you'll admit tt attraction, and how you deal with it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We are like this, We will be like this, We want to be like this... Guess thats part of nature and being in a realistic world today, I think this disease of "looks 1st then character" is pretty normal among men and women in Singapore or even in this world. But i guess its the same be it male or female. Reason why males are usually the target boards is because of the nature of this majority. We probably show it in a different and more open way but im sure females too will be attracted to looks first..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why does everyone loves a newborn child? Why does so many girls fall heads over heels for Ricky Martin or Leornado di Caprio? Why do you prefer a brand new BMW coupe over an '83 junk-yard quality car, even if the car still packs a kick when you step on its accelerator?<br><br>I think there's this study that was done and they found that people are attracted to symmetry. Meaning if the face is symmetrical, then, people will think it's attractive. So, take a look in the mirror and see if you're symmetrical. If not, then you just think of yourself as being unique, or as I like to put it - extra-ordinary  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Perhaps those who are interested can go find some photos of Hollywood stars and try to create symmetrical faces with some photo editor. Try it ! it is quite fun.<br><br>Btw, we are all asymmetrical with only few exceptions. One exception is those suffering from Downs Syndrome.<br><br></div>
