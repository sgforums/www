To this day, all eight occupants of that building are alive and well while others living some distance away continue to die of the radiation effects of that frightful holocaust. Over the years some two hundred scientists have examined these eight survivors, trying to discover what could have spared them from incineration or the lethal storm of radiation. Speaking on television in the United Sates, the German Jesuit, Father Hubert Shiffner, gave the startling answer. Â“In that house, we were living the message of Fatima.Â” He was, of course, referring to the apparition that occurred to three young shepherd children in Fatima, Portugal on July 13, 1917. His words seemed to underline Sister LuciaÂ’s statement in 1977, Â“Our Lady will protect all her dear ones.Â”             </div></blockquote>I smell bullshit.</div>

When itÂ’s time to die that people start to ponder because of the fear of the unknown. Freedom of religion is also honored in some prisons. Death row inmates are allowed one last chance to "get right with God" before their death sentences are carried out. ItÂ’s up to the inmate to choose - to receive his last rite or to spit on the priest.<br><br>Disbelievers always ask for proof but religion is based on belief. Faith is not the same as facts.<br><br>To proof the non- existence of a higher power, try this challenge yourself. Go sign a pact with the devil in return for any favour you want. See if thereÂ’s any change in your life. No harm will come to you if thereÂ’s really no God, good or bad.<br><br>It's only a test but I won't do it because I believe. </div></blockquote>First statement, of course it is not to be emulated, and the cause of the acts? Blind faith in religions. Remember the cause is more important than the effect.<br><br>Second point, again i ask back the same question, how do you define god when there is countless theory about god? What makes your God the "real" one, because it is the same everywhere. So are you saying that the purpose of religion is to reassurance about life after death and it has no practical function beside that?<br><br>For me, i don't follow religion dogma and neither am i atheist. However if you ask me to evaluate myself, i would say i am a spiritually healthy person and that is not to be mix with religion. Religion and Spiritually are often confused by the masses. Spirituality is your own conscience and connection with life and the universe in general, you can call it God or anything you like.<br><br>Third, it is critical for all of us to judge using our head and thinking , not blind faith. Just because you fear something, it is not a wise thing to randomly clutch on to something you do not understand or do not work actually. Religion works because it provide psychologically comfort about death, like your parents comforting you when you have nightmares as a child, it's the same theory at work.<br><br>Of course faith is not the same as proof. Faith is believe without questioning or rational logic. Proof is evidence and analysis. Thank God then we are judge in courts with proof and not faith or the legal system will be in chaos. And thankfully, most of us choose to use proof when approached by conmens and not faith.<br><br>Last , do not confuse non religion with non supernatural. Remember religion is a set of morale codes followed with mystical stories of a higher figure. Supernatural however can refer to things like fate, destiny, nature and the universe.<br><br>So clear up defintion of higher power, religion and supernatural forces first otherwise you are running in circles. So just like you, i won't try to temp fate or evil spirits.<br><br>Remember the phrase "If you teach a man to fish, he can fish everyday on his own". In life, everything you learn is never dead set, you are to reapply it and evolve on it to form your own style, everything is only a beginning guide...<br></div>
