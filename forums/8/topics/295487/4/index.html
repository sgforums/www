It is your conduct and karma that determines which realm you will be borned into, not which deity you believe in.<br><br>From a Buddhist worldview, you can be a Christian but if you are a moral person and performs a lot of good deeds, you will create positive karma and this will come to fruition when you are reborned in a higher realm (eg. Deva realm). Conversely, a 'staunch' joss-stick Buddhist who has no compunction about killing and robbing will still reap the consequence of his actions.<br><br>The relationship between the Buddha and Buddhist is one of teacher-student or doctor-patient, not master-slave or creator-createe. The Buddha does not 'command' or 'judge' us. Buddhists only follow Buddha's teachings to liberate themselves of the cycle of continuous birth and rebirth.</div>

Blind faith in religions. Remember the cause is more important than the effect.<br><br>Second point, again i ask back the same question, how do you define god when there is countless theory about god? What makes your God the "real" one, because it is the same everywhere. So are you saying that the purpose of religion is to reassurance about life after death and it has no practical function beside that?<br><br>For me, i don't follow religion dogma and neither am i atheist. However if you ask me to evaluate myself, i would say i am a spiritually healthy person and that is not to be mix with religion. Religion and Spiritually are often confused by the masses. Spirituality is your own conscience and connection with life and the universe in general, you can call it God or anything you like.<br><br>Third, it is critical for all of us to judge using our head and thinking , not blind faith. Just because you fear something, it is not a wise thing to randomly clutch on to something you do not understand or do not work actually. Religion works because it provide psychologically comfort about death, like your parents comforting you when you have nightmares as a child, it's the same theory at work.<br><br>Of course faith is not the same as proof. Faith is believe without questioning or rational logic. Proof is evidence and analysis. Thank God then we are judge in courts with proof and not faith or the legal system will be in chaos. And thankfully, most of us choose to use proof when approached by conmens and not faith.<br><br>Last , do not confuse non religion with non supernatural. Remember religion is a set of morale codes followed with mystical stories of a higher figure. Supernatural however can refer to things like fate, destiny, nature and the universe.<br><br>So clear up defintion of higher power, religion and supernatural forces first otherwise you are running in circles. So just like you, i won't try to temp fate or evil spirits.<br><br>Remember the phrase "If you teach a man to fish, he can fish everyday on his own".
