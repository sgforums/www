To this day, all eight occupants of that building are alive and well while others living some distance away continue to die of the radiation effects of that frightful holocaust. Over the years some two hundred scientists have examined these eight survivors, trying to discover what could have spared them from incineration or the lethal storm of radiation. Speaking on television in the United Sates, the German Jesuit, Father Hubert Shiffner, gave the startling answer. Â“In that house, we were living the message of Fatima.Â” He was, of course, referring to the apparition that occurred to three young shepherd children in Fatima, Portugal on July 13, 1917. His words seemed to underline Sister LuciaÂ’s statement in 1977, Â“Our Lady will protect all her dear ones.Â”             </div></blockquote><span style="color: brown;">DID GOD KNOW ABOUT THE BOMBING BEFORE HAND ?<br>DID GOD KNOW THAT MANY INNOCENTS WERE GOING TO DIE IF NOTHING DONE TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING?<br><br>BEGGAR MANY THINGS NO UNDERSTAND SO BEGGAR ASK.<br><br>IF BEGGAR QNS NOT APPROPRIATE THEN PLS DELETE.<br><br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is going to be long post, but i should post it anyway...<br><br>In the first place, everyone claims their God is the real deal, so if you choose one, of course just like everyone u think u are believing in the right one, but does that means if u worship the wrong one, u are gonna be worse off than a free thinker? who knows?<br><br>In the end, all religion are unprovable and alot of claims, you can never prove it is real or fake because it's always set many years ago and subject to supernatural forces that overrule any rational logic, how do you prove something like that?<br><br>What i find funny is the word religion tolerance. For me, the defintion is as long as i don't physically attack another person because of this, it is done. After all, all religion are saying yours is not real, mine is real. so you can never say religion tolerance means not verbally attacking others because guess what, it's already done and started by the religions doctrines themselves.<br><br>Why do i believe it is not necessary to tolerate religion too much? Because religion has cause many humans lives to be lost and stupid things done in religion. Religion wars, people organizing mass sucide so they can go heaven and i think u get the point.<br><br>And people who are in religions are always convinced that they are on the right path, partly because they so badly want to believe in it for various reasons. Looking long term, how do you know your path is the right one compare to the many religions out there? So they always say to non believers you are lost and blah blah, for the sake of IMO to console themselves or else they really start doubting themselves and that is not good for them emotionally or mentally. Short term they can only see the religions books and the other believers and that is pretty much what shape their beliefs.<br><br>If you walk into a place, and there is only two believer there worshiping every time, you will believe that religion? So it's a case of the blind leading the blind, the more people there are, the more people are convinced.<br><br>So next question you ask is why religion was created, simple, for money and power originally, i'm talking about power over people minds and money from donations and selling of the books, the bible has sold more than harry potter so that makes the bible industry a billion dollar business believe it or not.<br><br>Do we have a responsibility for our further generations of humans, to be more careful with this religion thing? Of course, that is the foundations of our society, science and knowledge, does religion belong under that, not really, for something to be classified as knowledge, it has to work right?<br><br>So Has anybody proven that believers of any religion are in heaven or whatever place they are suppose to be, no? Has God appear in any form before mass human eyes? Has God really protect us from disasters like world war 2 and terrorists? Ironic, terrorists main driving force is religion, so that's another thing that is costing us billions of dollars in security admin and training, and of course the threat to people life.<br><br>So do you still think that religion has worked?<br><br>Your title is "Behold the power of our Lord!" , i leave the rest for you to ponder...</div>
