I liked the song entitled "Baby I am your man" which was in an album which he dedicated to his second wife, whom he divorced recently. His songs were really good and I know that I liked a song called "Lang Zi" and it fits me very well...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Glad that there are also people who like Wan Fang. Just to correct patie, Wan Fang's first album is "Shi Jian reng ran ji xu zai zhou" something like that lah... inside the first album is the SBC TV Series "Mi Li Ye" direct translation means "spooky night" theme song.<br><br>Buy hv to recommend one song inside her first album, which is "ban xiu" meaning "Half a sleeve"... it remains as one of my favourite song. I hv the CD also...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for a whole album, I must say that "Wo Ji De Ni Yan Li De Yi Lian" is one of the best album I ever owned(together with those Wang Jie's of course!). Some recommendation inside includes "Gui Hua Niang" which was also sang by Zhang Yu when he had his own album, and "Wo Yuan Yi" which Wan Fang sang out very well the feeling of a girl accepting a marriage proposal. Note that this is a different song fm Faye's "Wo Yuan Yi".<br><br>Dream FM, I dunno about MP3s of Fei Yu Qing, but you can get his old songs at a shop call "Fei Ying" at Beach Road United Artiste Cinema Building. Its on level 2, and they sell many old chinese CDs.<br><br>Rinoa, will email you. Thanks a lot!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Actually, I forgot 2 female singers whom I also like, but didn't buy much of their albums: Pan Mei Cheng and Qi Yu(Qi Qin's elder sister). They are very good in my opinion, esp Qi Yu... she is out of the mould of normal pop singers, and her vocal can kill you...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanx for correcting me abt WAn Fang.  I started to notice her when she sang tht song.<br>Anyway, talking abt Zhangyu, i got his first album.  Zou Ru You feng.  that 's his first album and later i broguht his 2nd and third alubm too.  i do have some of his jing xuan also.  I wonder if anyone remember a program from 100.3 last time...tht was 8 years back i think when they intro those "leng men" songs..i even wrote to them and they wrote back and tell me where i can get those CDs. During tht time, there's no Tower record or HMV.<br>Fei ying used to be located at Bishan Central ..This shop is the first official shop recognised by FM100.3 to sell import Taiwan CDs.<br>Still remmeber i brought my FAN REN album from taiwan import too. Sadly they disband already...<br>One artist worth mentioning is Li Ya ming. I managed to get his cassette from a friend in TAIWAN and i like it alot.  Anyone still remmeber zhang xiao wen.  She wrote many songs b4 and i brought her jing xuan.  Quite a good one.<br><br>I saw qi yu when i went to Qi qin concert.  i respect her alot as she has a veru high vocal and i got a very old english alubm of her. Still like her "gan Lan Shu"..so nice...<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth of comments : -)<br><br>[This message has been edited by patie (edited 09 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WEll, anywya, it's wang jie and not huang jie...  Well, i agreed tht some chinese songs are getting commercialise noe..but like tao zhe...and Huang shu jun..i still feel tht they retained their artistic favour in their songs... Some other good composesr like Guo Zi, Zhang Hong Liang, Liang Wen Fu, Huang Yun Ling are still write artistic songs... Hope u have the chance to listen to their songs..<br><br>Well, i don't think Wang jie is a passing fashion...he has been around for ten years and he has been popular for abt 4 to 5 yr b4 things start to slow down him...I don't think u call tht passing fashion rite?<br><br>Okie just my 2 cents worth of feeling...<br><br>[This message has been edited by patie (edited 11 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just flipped thru' my old albums, and found that I gave some wrong info up there about Wan Fang. Her "Ban Xiu" song is found in her second album - "Fang Xin". Just to correct the info.<br><br>Patie, I'm not sure you literally mean Zhang Yu's first album, but his first album is "Yong Xin Liang Ku", not "Zou Lu You Feng". I guess this is not even his second... dun really take note of him, but I like the Lyrics his wife writes. BTW, his wife is "Shi Yi Lang".

            <div class='col-md body'>Well bochup:<br><br>Chang Yu's first album is entitled "Walking with air (Chou Loo You Feng), and we have him singing two of the famous hits by Fan Ren (a group which I liked) which is "What should I do to let you remain here." and Wan Fang's "Cai Xin"... I heard of Chang Yu thru a friend who searched high and low for this album in Taiwan, before the 2nd album which shot him to fame....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prodigal , u r right..the first ablum is Zou Lu You Feng... I got it when he first came out with tht album.. It's quite easy to get it noe..  yong Xin Liang Ku is the second album.. Quite like Zou Lu you feng.  Talking abt hoe he makes his decision to go into the music scene rather than the financial world. FYI, he studied business in the university. I have nearly all Fan Ren alubms and i like them alot..their first album is Du Juan Niao de huang hun.  those are all taiwan import.. Anywa, i got their final album too.. Nan xiong Nan Di. Anywa, Zhangyu and Fan Ren are good friend.  For those who don't knoe, FAn ren is a duo group.  One of the member is Yuan Wei ren.  He is the one who wrote the FAye wong's Zhi mi Bu Hui.  He came out with his own alubm recently..<br><br>I wonder if anyone remmeber Ling Mong.. I think she is Zhangyu's shi mei..didn't hear from  her anymore.....<br><br>[This message has been edited by patie (edited 11 February 2000).]</div>
