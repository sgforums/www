From young, i have been flipping through magazines, watching Tv...and i know which agency the model is from. My friends ever accompanied me to modelling agencies.

What is life anyway?<br><br>churra:<br>take heart.<br><br>i am searching too - and i guess so is everybody. What you are searching 4 in my opinion, is like what rebellyon has mentioned - a higher purpose for your life.<br><br>A significance for your life - a meaning for your existence. Plus like i said - love. Nobody can survive long without love. I mean, psychologically/emotionally/spiritually, you will wither and die inside. Perhaps not physically - but still very "real"-ly - a very horrible death.<br><br>i used to think that i had found the answer in "religion" - but even then - now - i am not so sure. well i'm glad tetrutetrumon<br>has found some (?? all?) purpose in religion - but sorry man - not me... not me anymore... i guess sometimes u can just get so frustrated/fed up by the way things are in the world around u - sigh...<br><br>here's an interesting poem that i wrote myself some time ago. i wont say that it's the best - or even begin to attempt to praise it - but one thing i know - when i composed it, i just felt that it expressd very well this desire within all of us to search for love - which is why i decide to put it here anyway - since it so expresses my desire so perfectly - and what i have to say.... hope u guys can all enjoy this poem.<br><br>Why I Search for Love<br>---------------------<br><br>Bec. now then<br>my wondering heart<br><br>would have found<br>a resting place.<br><br>No Longer<br>would i search<br><br>and look<br>for a purpose.<br><br>For i would have found<br>my purpose<br><br>My life<br><br>would be significant<br><br>my purpose in life<br>the reason why i'm here<br>would be to make her happy<br>to make somebody happy<br>to make ~her~ happy...<br><br>i exist -<br>and live -<br>and breath -<br>and eat -<br>because for her.<br><br>I am no longer alone now -<br>i have found my love.<br><br>and love -<br>my love<br>has finally found<br><br>me.</div>

Remember that we pass this way only  once.<br>Bottomline :<br>Time don't wait. If you think you might have found the  right one, treasure him/her. Don't let he/she go away.
