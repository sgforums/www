Maybe the time for the coach to train their teamwork is not enuff. Can see they can't coordinate well from their failed set pieces. Fleming Nielsen shud try to think of more creative set pieces and call on the national teams to try often.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>I think the S-league is a failure. Got too many foreigners playing the impt posts, like striker. Need more locals to fill those spot to haf a greater choice of strikers for the national team. And instead of spending the money oif the S-league, we shud actually use the money to train the experience of the national team, for eg take them abroad and play wif different teams around the world. We can well choose the players from school teams and train them up. I noe there are quite a lot of good players in schools, including those from the rugby teams and track, cuz they haf the fit fit type of background that is required, and they wil often play more since they haf the stamina advantage over others, giving them more opportunity to really train. I think the Govt shud start to look into schs, including the PE classes to determine potentials  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Thomas Edison definition of genius :<br>"1% inspiration, 99% perspiration"</div>
