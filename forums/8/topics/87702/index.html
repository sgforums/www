            <div class='col-md body'>Hi.<br><br>I've heard a lot about direct marketing and the growing beauty/cosmetic/weight loss/health supplments merchandise that is being pushed to every corner of Singapore. Seems like nobody is spared from it.<br><br>I've no problem with direct marketing, doing business or making money. I'm more troubled by the merchandise being promoted and sold. The problem I feel is that because Perhaps companies selling these products have not asserted or claimed that their products are "scientifically proven" or that they're magical pills that prevent diseases, but I feel that more or less they're bordering on it. Don't get me wrong -- I've nothing against these health care/supplement product companies and this is just my personal opinion.<br><br>Recently, my parents attended one such outlet and there the sales representative introduced their products, which I feel is normal and perfectly all right. Then my parents were told to dip and coat their hands in some unknown liquid and then place their hands on some device to get a reading. Of course, there's some kind of scoring point scale that says if you're below 1000, you'll get serious health problems; below 2000, you're at high risk of health problems; below 3000, you're normal and anything above 3000, you're healthy etc.<br><br>I'm not questioning the reliability of the result but how does the device works in the first place? What's the scientific principle behind it?<br><br>Being educated in some basic biology and sciences, looking at the products, their ingredients sound fanciful but otherwise, I'm not in a position to comment whether these products are really useful or not. But one thing that triggers off my suspicion is that some practices and devices that claim to provide an accurate health diagnostic appear to be dubious to certain extents. First of all, assuming that if such technology exists,  why are doctors still relying on blood/urine test, measuring blood pressure, taking biopsy samples, scope, MRI scans and X-rays etc.? And those techniques/technologies just mentioned are the real scientifically proven ones.  WIth reference to what my parents experienced, how is it possible that such a simple test is able to gauge so accurately a person's state of health, where qualified doctors have to rely on a number of tests and different techniques and devices?<br><br>Also, the basic idea I'm holding is this: everyone's bodies and medical conditions are different and thus how much nutrients and benefits each of us obtain from consuming health supplments is different. So I'm afraid many ignorant consumers are just paying for expensive urine, just like what gorging on vitamin pills produces.<br><br>The more I think of it, the more I think of these companies as snake-oil peddlars selling "koyok" not proven by science that they work and they're effective. Yes, these products are expensive but more importantly whether they really work or not is the main thing. If things are expensive but they really bring benefits or improvements to health, then it is still worthwhile to pay. If they don't, well, more likely they're profiting from consumers' ignorance and hiding behind slick marketing.<br><br>The main problem is that such products need not be certified or tested by the Ministry of Health and/or the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA), so anybody can come up with a formula/product that claims to improve your health and keep diseases at bay.<br><br>So I hope to get you guys opinions and experience on these beauty, cosmetic/weight loss/health supplment products. How reliable are they? Are they really effective? You may say, why don't you just call up these companies and ask about their products? Of course, asking the salesmen or calling their sale office is a waste of time and effort. Definitely, they'll say their products is "scientifcally proven" and all that. What I want to hear is neutral third party comments. Perhaps some authority on medical science or qualified doctors would be interested to answer this as well.</div>
