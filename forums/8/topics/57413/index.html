            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Test</strong><br><br>Three men who were lost in the forest were captured by<br>cannibals. The cannibal king told the prisoners that they could<br>live if they pass a trial. The first step of the trial was to go<br>to the forest and get ten pieces of the same kind of fruit. So<br>all three men went separate ways to gather fruits.<br><br>The first one came back and said to the king, "I brought ten<br>apples." The king then explained the trial to him. "You have to<br>shove the fruits up your butt without any expression on your<br>face or you'll be eaten."<br><br>The first apple went in... but on the second one he winced out<br>in pain, so he was killed.<br><br>The second one arrived and showed the king ten berries. When the<br>king explained the trial to him he thought to himself that this<br>should be easy. 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8... and on the<br>ninth berry he burst out in laughter and was killed.<br><br>The first guy and the second guy met in heaven. The first one<br>asked, "Why did you laugh, you almost got away with it?" The<br>second one replied, "I couldn't help it, I saw the third guy<br>coming with pineapples."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Who Died the Worst Death?</strong><br><br>Three men stand before St. Peter awaiting admission into Heaven.<br>However, St. Peter has been informed that Heaven will only admit<br>33% of applicants today. The admissions standard: Who died the<br>worst death? So, St. Peter takes each of the three men aside in<br>turn and asks them about how they died.<br><br>First man: "I'd been suspecting for a long time that my wife was<br>cheating on me. I decided to come home early from work one<br>afternoon and check to see if I could catch her in the act. When<br>I got back to my apartment, I heard the water running. My wife<br>was in the shower. I looked everywhere for the guy, but couldn't<br>find anyone or any trace that he had been there. The last place<br>I looked was out on the balcony.<br><br>I found the bastard hanging from the edge, trying to get back<br>in! So I started jumping up and down on his hands, and he<br>yelled, but he didn't fall. So I ran inside and got a hammer,<br>and crushed his fingers with it until he fell twenty-five floors<br>screaming in agony. But the fall didn't kill the asshole. He<br>landed in some bushes! So I dragged the refirgerator from the<br>kitchen (it weighed about a ton), pulled it to the balcony, and<br>hurled it over the edge. It landed right on the guy and killed<br>him. But then I felt so horrible about what I had done, I went<br>back into the bedroom and shot myself."<br><br>St. Peter nodded slowly as the man recounted the story. Then,<br>telling the first man to wait, he took the second aside.<br><br>Second man: "I lived on the twenty-seventh floor of this<br>apartment building. I had just purchased this book on morning<br>exercises and was practicing them on my balcony, enjoying the<br>sunshine, when I lost my balance and fell off the edge. Luckily,<br>I only fell about two floors before grabbing another balcony and<br>holding on for dear life. I was trying to pull myself up when<br>this guy came running onto what must have been his balcony and<br>started jumping up and down on my hands. I screamed in pain, but<br>he seemed really irate. When he finally stopped, I tried to pull<br>myself up again, but he came out with a hammer and smashed my<br>fingers to a pulp! I fell, and I thought I was dead, but I<br>landed in some bushes. I couldn't believe my second stroke of<br>luck, but it didn't last. The last thing I saw was this enormous<br>refrigerator falling from the building down on top of me and<br>crushing me."<br><br>St. Peter comforted the man, who seemed to have several broken<br>bones. Then he told him to wait, and turned to the third man.<br><br>Third man: "Picture this. You're hiding, naked, in a<br>refrigerator..."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>My son's more successful than yours.</strong><br><br>Four men got together to play golf one sunny morning. As they<br>were heading out to the course, one of them was detained by a<br>phone call.<br><br>The other three were discussing their children while walking to<br>the first tee.<br><br>"My son," said one proudly, "has made quite a name for himself<br>in the home building industry. He began as a carpenter, but now<br>owns his own design and construction firm. He's so successful,<br>in fact in the last year he was able to give a good friend a<br>brand new home as a gift."<br><br>The second man, not to be outdone, boasts how his son began his<br>career as a car salesman, but now owns a multi-line dealership.<br>"He's so successful, in fact, in the last six months he gave a<br>friend two brand new cars as a gift."<br><br>The third man brags that his son has worked his way up through a<br>stock brokerage firm, and has become so successful that in the<br>last few weeks has given a good friend a large stock portfolio<br>as a gift.<br><br>As the fourth man arrives at the tee box, the three smugly tell<br>him that they have been discussing how successful their progeny<br>are, and ask what line of work his son is in.<br><br>"To tell the truth, I'm not very pleased how my son has turned<br>out," he replies. "For fifteen years, he's been a hairdresser,<br>and I've just recently discovered he's gay."<br><br>As the other three recoil in horror, he continues, "but on the<br>bright side, he must be good at what he does, because his last<br>three boyfriends have given him a brand new house, two new cars,<br>and a big stock portfolio."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Dinner with the Girlfriend's Parents</strong><br><br>A girl asks her boyfriend to come over Friday night and have<br>dinner with her parents. Since this is such a big event, the<br>girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner, she would<br>like to go out and make love for the first time.<br><br>Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so<br>he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms. The<br>pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy<br>everything there is to know about condoms and sex.<br><br>At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms<br>he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy<br>insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather<br>busy, it being his first time and all.<br><br>That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents house and<br>meets his girlfriend at the door. "Oh, I'm so excited for you to<br>meet my parents, come on in!"<br><br>The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the<br>girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace<br>and bows his head.<br><br>A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his<br>head down.<br><br>10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy.<br><br>Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend<br>leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, "I had no idea you<br>were this religious."<br><br>The boy turns, and whispers back, "I had no idea your father was<br>a pharmacist."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Man With No Arms nor Legs</strong><br><br>There once was a lady who was tired of living with men who were<br>either physically abusive, who ran away from her, or who were<br>horrible in bed. So she put an Ad in the paper, that was asking<br>for a man who:<br><br>1)would treat her nicely<br>2)wouldn't run away from her,<br>3)would be good in bed.<br><br>Three weeks passed, and there was no reply from any man. So she<br>just figured that there wasn't a man alive who could live up to<br>these expectations, so she just gave up. But then, one day she<br>heard the doorbell rang. She answered it, and there on the front<br>porch was a man in a wheel chair who didn't have any arms or<br>legs. The man said "I'm here about the ad you put in the paper.<br>As you can see, I have no arms so I can't beat you, and I have<br>no legs so I can't run away from you."<br><br>The woman replied, "Yes, but are you good in bed?"<br><br>And the man said with a smirk on his face, "How do you think I<br>rang the doorbell?"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Good Dog!</strong><br><br>A butcher is working, and really busy. He notices a dog in his<br>shop and shoos him away. Later, he notices the dog is back<br>again. He walks over to the dog, and notices the dog has a note<br>in his mouth. The butcher takes the note, and it reads, "Can I<br>have 12 sausages and a leg of lamb, please."<br><br>The butcher looks, and lo and behold, in the dog's mouth, there<br>is a ten dollar bill. So the butcher takes the money, puts the<br>sausages and lamb in a bag, and places it in the dog's mouth.<br>The butcher is very impressed, and since it's closing time, he<br>decides to close up shop and follow the dog.<br><br>So, off he goes. The dog is walking down the street and comes to<br>a crossing. The dog puts down the bag, jumps up and presses the<br>crossing button. Then he waits patiently, bag in mouth, for the<br>lights to change. They do, and he walks across the road, with<br>the butcher following. The dog then comes to a bus stop, and<br>starts looking at the timetable. The butcher is in awe at this<br>stage. The dog checks out the times, and sits on one of the<br>seats to wait for the bus. Along comes a bus. The dog walks to<br>the front of the bus, looks at the number, and goes back to his<br>seat. Another bus comes. Again the dog goes and looks at the<br>number, notices it's the right bus, and climbs on. The butcher,<br>by now open-mouthed, follows him onto the bus. The bus travels<br>thru town and out to the suburbs. Eventually the dog gets up,<br>moves to the front of the bus, and standing on his hind legs,<br>pushes the button to stop the bus. The dog gets off, groceries<br>still in his mouth, and the butcher still following. They walk<br>down the road, and the dog approaches a house. He walks up the<br>path, and drops the groceries on the step. Then he walks back<br>down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -whap!-<br>against the door. He goes back down the path, takes another run,<br>and throws himself -whap!- against the door again!<br><br>There's no answer at the door, so the dog goes back down the<br>path, jumps up on a narrow wall, and walks along the perimeter<br>of the garden. He gets to a window, and bangs his head against<br>it several times. He walks back, jumps off the wall, and waits<br>at the door. The butcher watches as a big guy opens the door,<br>and starts laying into the dog, really yelling at him.<br><br>The butcher runs up and stops the guy. "What the heck are you<br>doing? This dog is a genius. He could be on TV, for God's sake!"<br><br>To which the guy responds, "Clever, my ass. This is the second<br>time this week he's forgotten his key!"</div>
