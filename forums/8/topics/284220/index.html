Mafia is also in one way a help to the CID, like recent SAF rifle issue, CID also get information from Mafia about his gf and stay in geyland.<br><br>As long as the mafia do their business in  a peaceful way, respect the CID or anti vice when they do their rounding, they will have no problem with CID.

These are damn rich bosses who used youngsters from drop out school and also those middle ages bad uncles to do the job for them.<br><br>I myself as a gal living there since young have seen so many anti vice activities going on. There are a few rings of organised crime belong to certain areas, it is the understanding of the bosses that hold meeting to divide the lorongs among them. Their objective is to make money, not to kill.<br><br>The CID also understand the situation, but to them as long as they never go too far out of geyland, or mess up the place the CID just keep a close watch on it. Now you tell me, in which countries in this world have no mafia? You will be surprise to know that there are Woman mafia too, they control some of the pros gals for their husband.<br><br>The CID purpose is not to curb the mafia, they know that it will never end, what the CID wants is to have a connection with the mafia to get information on other crimes such as robbery, rape, and other crime committed in Singapore. Mafia is also in one way a help to the CID, like recent SAF rifle issue, CID also get information from Mafia about his gf and stay in geyland.<br><br>As long as the mafia do their business in  a peaceful way, respect the CID or anti vice when they do their rounding, they will have no problem with CID. Police and thief are both side of an equation, without thief, CID also no jobs.<br>UNDERSTAND!<br></div></blockquote>Before you claim that I'm still drinking from my mother or make other demeaning remarks, read up first.<br><br>The term "Mafia" is used to describe an organized crime syndicate with an <strong>Italian</strong> origin. If you need more information on mafia than I can provide, kindly visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia</a><br><br>As for any information pertaining to Singapore's underworld/commercial sex/police force, I do not need you to fill me in.<br><br>I'm not the average easy target, I suggest if you want to take your argument to another level - do more reading up. Else, simply <strong>shut the fu.ck up</strong> to save both of us the trouble.<br><br>Have a good day ahead <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

As if they are buying cats and dog... Prostitudes is just a job, they do have dignity!!! just don't know why they are being treated this manner!!! the people there told them go through injection to make sure they are "safe"... i can't belief it, they have to go through so much pain just for a guy pleasure...

THe reason why it says U.S. and elsewhere is because the ITALIAN mob operates in the U.S. and elsewhere but they're still ITALIAN. Hope I've cleared things up.</div>
