I juz dun understand why they so pretty and end up being protitudes... Really breaks my heart... I also went to lor 23, i saw a crowd in one particular house, i went toward and i found out that, protitudes were being treated like animals putting them in a show case and waiting for customers to pick them!!!! As if they are buying cats and dog... Prostitudes is just a job, they do have dignity!!! just don't know why they are being treated this manner!!! the people there told them go through injection to make sure they are "safe"... i can't belief it, they have to go through so much pain just for a guy pleasure... The least we could do is show some respect to these poor girls not by doing business with them but by appreciating the nature!!!</div></blockquote>Do you know majority of them do this job by choice? Don't be fooled into those sob stories that they were forced into this situation because family got crippled ones, cannot pay medical bills and blah blah blah. Very few nowadays were genuine in their cases but most of them do it because it's the fastest way to make money. Do a few years, pay off the debt they incurred from the pimps, go back to their country origin and open up beauty or hair salons.<br><br>Do I look down on them? No, but in a way 'respect' them for coming up this ingenuity idea to make a fast buck. It takes a lot of guts to sell their bodies. Most of these girls are very smart even though some come from very layback towns but they are not as under expose as you would like to think them to be.</div>

Being empathic and champion of sex workers is admirable, but knowing half-truths isn't. This is not Cambodia; the sex workers aren't forced to do what they are doing.
