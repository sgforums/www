I have, as of last friday (May 5th 2006), concluded my final reports, essays, and examinations.<br><br>3 years I spent in this godforsaken institute, learning absolutely nothing but how to lie, cheat, and ingratiate myself with professors who were arrogant, condescending and absolutely clueless.

Half my life has been sacrificed on the altar of higher education so that I can enter the fast track on the promotion path. I now must look forward to another 25 years of toil, back-breaking labor and constant competition if I want to retire with a Manhattan Apt, a trophy wife, and an exclusive club membership. Then I have a few years to enjoy my reward before I get Alzheimers, or cancer.<br><br>Life is grand don't cha think?<br><br>Cheers to one and all.<br><br>Just ranting.

But I'm really honestly not trying to be insulting or anything, but I'm not sure I have interpreted your words correctly.<br><br>Let me paraphrase and you tell me if I got the gist of it right.<br><br>"You young kid. Everyone can kiss ass, what makes you special. You can't predict your future. You may end up poor because a minister graduated at the same time as you. Being poor but healthy is eternal suffering (???) Welcome to reality you young know-nothing."<br><br>If this is correct, then my response is:<br><br>1) I'm 24 going on 25. Young to some, old enough for others.<br>2) I'm hardly bragging about kissing ass, but rather complaining. Never thought it was something that made me "special."<br>2) True, I can't predict my future, but I can plan for it.<br>3) Yes I may end I up poor, but I fail to see how a minister can affect that.<br>4) Being poor but healthy yet feigning illness is eternal suffering? I don't understand why you made this statement.<br>5) Yes, welcome to reality, thats why I was complaining in the first post.<br><br>Some may have misinterpreted my words to be bragging about my life when I was letting off a little steam and actually  complaining.<br><br>But who wouldn't want to have a little sugar in the future.<br><br>A little luvin never hurt anyone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
