              <p>coz i'm a girl. when faced with guys younger than me, even if they are mature for their age, i cannot overcome the age barrier thingy. i would still feel like a big sister to them naturally. and would try to take care/protect them in my own ways.</p>

              <p>80 % of my past relationships are with girls older then me, the maximum age gap was 4 yrs (i got a feeling i actually attract alot of girls who are older thn me <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png">).</p>
              <p> it really depends on whether you can click with the other party in terms of ur mentality, i hv seen older girls who are actually more childish as well as younger girls who are alot more mature.</p>
              <p>well applesweetgirl, maybe the age barrier does matter to u. or maybe the guy is giving out signals showing tht he feel sort of threathened that you are older then him. i think a relationship cant start without both parties being able to communicate on a same level, as equals. when that happens, the age dont matter at all already.</p>

              <p>---------------------------------</p>
              <p>in a way, that's true.</p>
              <p>it's kind of like a natural instinct for guys to protect girls mah, and for me, if the girl is older, i feel no instinct or need whatsoever to protect her, because she can handle things better than younger girls etc.....and i will also feel that she is "on the same level" as me.</p>
              <p>guys tend to feel more "man" when next to a younger girl because they have this feeling the girl is more vulnerable etc.....hard to explain.</p>
              <p>for me, i see older girls more as friends or at the most fark-buddies....not really gf material even if she is farking pretty.</p>

              <p>[that is so untrue..</p>
              <p>I know most guys my age will prefer older gals then girls our own age.</p>
              <p>TS how old?]</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i'm 21 this year.</p>
              <p>glad to know actually that some guys still appreciate older girls. haha. but i really doubt that such relationships can last? i will worry that the guy...when he grow up...he might not really like that girl anymore...maybe he will think things like, "the girl not so hot liao." or what. hahaha.</p>
              <p>well, anyway, thanks for everyone's replies.</p>
              <p>for me, currently, i don't really like older guys, although i used to like them a lot a lot. it's because i find it hard to be friends with older guys and expect them to hold no motives or intentions. they have all kinds of tricks up their sleeves and i'm just tired to be with them.</p>
              <p>however, younger guys are more innocent in a way and really fun to hang out with. just having fun as friends... don't need to care about whether they have any bad motives or intentions. i used to don't like hanging out with younger guys too because i have the mentality that they are childish. but actually some have really mature thinkings that i am kinda impressed with. and recently i find that my older guy friends sometimes are soooo dots.</p>
              <p>correct me if u think i'm wrong!</p>

              <p>in my experience, the relationship lasts just like any other relationship. in fact...i feel more "real" when im with an older girl, rather than just romancing and entertaining each other.</p>
              <p>we lasted 1.5 yrs and we broke up because she went to UK. looking back, i wont mind staying with her till mid 20s and then get married.</p>
              <p>like i say...its all about the mentality. id go into every relationships with no expectations, and then...it usually will blossom into something beautiful before you know it:D</p>

              <p>I know most guys my age will prefer older gals then girls our own age.</p>

              <p>glad to know actually that some guys still appreciate older girls. haha. but i really doubt that such relationships can last? i will worry that the guy...when he grow up...he might not really like that girl anymore...maybe he will think things like, "the girl not so hot liao." or what. hahaha.</p>

              <p><br>If the love is meant to last.. Being hot or not doesnt matter so the main point here is whether the both party are willing to commit into the r/s to make it work and have confidence and trust in one and other.</p>
