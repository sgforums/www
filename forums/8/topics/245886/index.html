            <div class='col-md body'>Good thing for you, I have the secret of FINGER reading (similar to palmistry, but it's reading the whorl patterns on your fingertip) hosted here on my website :<br><a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/Hilarion/BodySigns/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/Hilarion/BodySigns/index.htm</a><br><br>Learn how to read it, and read the fingertips of your family and friends! But be careful, the responsibility is yours that you do not abuse your knowledge and understanding to hurt or discourage others. So as with all psychic readings, the spiritual responsibility and karma is yours to make sure you guide your client lovingly and helpfully, instead of making them feel like crap or afraid.</div>
