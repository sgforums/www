            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>according to Wikipedia, he's not even inside the cast of any of the rangers or the villians.<br><br>considering that he's 26 years old this year, meaning that 10 years ago when the series is shown, he's just a 16 years old kid. most probably some extra u won't even recognise. kinda strange an extra like him also can make it onto the papers</blockquote>Well, it's probably because he's an extra, that's why he's been driven to murder. Unemployed actors have a lot of angst and can be quite "creative" when it comes to dealing death.<br><br>Besides, I believe that Newspaper accredited him as a former "Power Ranger Star". The media thans to hype up a lot of stories. Sensationalism sells more newpapers. I guess if he was one of the main rangers, there would be another media circus. The media likes to make "heros" of out of muderers. Watch "Natural Born Killers" if you don't believe me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">[/quote]</div>
