            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys, i travel alot... half of my time in a year is spent out of singapore.<br><br>I made my sincere comparision. Hong Kong is a better place to shop and eat compared to singapore. (this also comes from my collegues who also travel a lot)...<br><br>compared to taiwan, hong kong, korea, thailand, malaysia (Asia countries), singapore really has nothing much to offer. That's why i'm worried on singapore's future.<br><br>When I heard that singapore will built casino, i know thi is the life or death bet. let us hope it will work while macau is very much ahead of singapore in casino area.<br><br>I also heard that thailan proposed to build casinos. guys, if the entire regions are  building casinos (e.g. in thailand, cambodia, indonesia-batam)... we all better keep your fingers crossed, expect another downturn economy for the next 10 years in singapore.<br><br>(note: this is part of the reason why property price doesn't go up while hong kong property price already higher than pre-1997 crisis level)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lamo:</div><div class="quote_body">what about night safari?</div></blockquote>It was the first, one and only last time.  But now a few others : in China, Dubai and USA.  When it first started, many countries came to Singapore to hire consultants from Singapore Zoo to help them start their own night animal parks.  Those were the days when Bernard Harrison was the CEO.  He was the guy who spearheaded Night Safari - he's a very clever and charismatic guy.  The zoo let him resign is the zoo's loss.  I dun see the current management come up with anything as creative and innovative.  I can only see them getting more and more expensive.  Eg. Friends of the Zoo single membership was $35 in last year.  Now $60!!  I heard that at one stage there was no free parking after the price increase.</div>
