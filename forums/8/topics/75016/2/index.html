Dead, dead wrong.<br><br>Pre-nuptial agreements are not subject to standard contract law rules on the intention to create legal relations. They are accorded separate and distinct treatment in their own right.<br><br>What bollocks are you spouting, anyway? "Pre nuptial contracts are recognised in courts"? They're recognised in US courts, but this is not the US, this is Singapore. I'd suggest that you check your facts before you make unsubstantiated assertions like that.<br><br><strong>"if you inherit a fortune i dont think you want a girl to marry you thinking that in 5 yrs she will get half of your assets thus its safer to have an agreement <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">"</strong><br><br>Did you really think you were saying something brilliant with this statement, you pathetic, self deluded fool? Of course it's safer to have an agreement, duh! Of course everyone here recognises the utility of pre-nuptial contracts, that's what everyone here has been saying all along. You're the only one here who seems to have missed the entire discussion up to this juncture.<br><br>This point is not what's in dispute.<br><br>The point is not whether pre-nuptial contracts can be a good thing in certain circumstances or not - all of us know they can be. The question is whether such agreements are valid under Singapore law or not. And the established case law and legislation in Singapore indicates that they are not.<br><br>If you really want to cling stubbornly to your belief that pre-nups will be valid and enforceable in Singapore, go ahead and marry a gold-digger and get her to sign a pre-nup. Then, in a few years, please tell us where you're going to be holding your garage sale, to get enough money to meet your alimony payments and divorce settlement.<br><br>In the future, bali_victim, I would seriously suggest that you think carefully before you post on serious issues like this.</div>

A VERY dangerous thing.<br><br>Registering your marriage and signing a pre-nup in another jurisdiction do absolutely nothing to improve your position. We're dealing with Conflict of Laws / Private International Law principles here - and under this set of rules, while ordinary international contracts are normally accorded validity with little difficulty, pre-nups are an exception. They will be denied validity in Singapore on one, or both, of the following grounds: 1) general non-enforceability; and / or 2) being contrary to public interest / public policy.<br><br>As for enforcing your pre-nup in another country, e.g. the U.S.: this would only work if most of your assets were situated in that other country. Any assets you have in Singapore would be subject to the normal 50-50 split mandated by the Women's Charter. If you obtained an order for the enforcement of a pre-nup in a U.S. court, and attempted to enforce that order vis-a-vis assets in Singapore, the Singapore courts wouldn't give you the time of day. You could try moving your assets out of Singapore and into the U.S., but your estranged wife would easily be able to obtain a court order to freeze your Singapore assets and deny you access to them.<br><br>Signing a pre-nup wouldn't even be useful for the purpose of 'evidence', as suggested by a previous poster. 'Evidence' for what? Whatever 'evidence' you think the pre-nup offers would be completely disregarded by the Singapore courts, since under the law, as represented by the Women's Charter, a 50-50 division of assets is mandated regardless of any other factors - regardless of fault or culpability or any prior agreement between the parties. It is a strict division of assets, and even if your estranged wife has been an adulterous whore and guilty as sin, she still gets half of your assets.<br><br>That's right, Singapore law is -that- stupid.<br><br>Ultimately, you cannot rely on the law as a substitute for good judgment. To avoid the unpleasant problems of a divorce, you have to be as sure as you can that you marry the right woman, a woman who isn't a money-grubbing gold-digger. True, that kind of woman is difficult to find in Singapore, but they definitely are out there.<br><br>Marrying the right woman may entail certain substantial sacrifices, like, for example, marrying a not-so-attractive woman who has a good, honest personality, instead of the drop-dead gorgeous chio-bu who's out to squeeze every last dollar she can out of the world and everyone in it. Many men cannot bring themselves to make this basic but important sacrifice, and they pay the price for it for the rest of their lives.<br><br>For crying out loud, guys - make sure you choose the right woman. Be guided by your heart and your head, not by your bloody testosterone. THAT is the best way to protect your hard earned money and assets.</div>
