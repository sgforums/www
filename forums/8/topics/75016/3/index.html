Dead, dead wrong.<br><br>Pre-nuptial agreements are not subject to standard contract law rules on the intention to create legal relations. They are accorded separate and distinct treatment in their own right.<br><br>What bollocks are you spouting, anyway? "Pre nuptial contracts are recognised in courts"? They're recognised in US courts, but this is not the US, this is Singapore. I'd suggest that you check your facts before you make unsubstantiated assertions like that.<br><br>[b]"if you inherit a fortune i dont think you want a girl to marry you thinking that in 5 yrs she will get half of your assets thus its safer to have an agreement <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">"</strong><br><br>Did you really think you were saying something brilliant with this statement, you pathetic, self deluded fool? Of course it's safer to have an agreement, duh! Of course everyone here recognises the utility of pre-nuptial contracts, that's what everyone here has been saying all along. You're the only one here who seems to have missed the entire discussion up to this juncture.<br><br>This point is not what's in dispute.<br><br>The point is not whether pre-nuptial contracts can be a good thing in certain circumstances or not - all of us know they can be. The question is whether such agreements are valid under Singapore law or not. And the established case law and legislation in Singapore indicates that they are not.<br><br>If you really want to cling stubbornly to your belief that pre-nups will be valid and enforceable in Singapore, go ahead and marry a gold-digger and get her to sign a pre-nup. Then, in a few years, please tell us where you're going to be holding your garage sale, to get enough money to meet your alimony payments and divorce settlement.<br><br>In the future, bali_victim, I would seriously suggest that you think carefully before you post on serious issues like this.[/b]</blockquote></div>

All you had was a knowledge of general contract law, you freely admit that you had done no specific research on marriage agreements.<br><br><blockquote><br><strong><br>silly of you to suggest marrying a gold digger<br></strong><br></blockquote>Obviously the mildly challenging concept of sarcasm has been lost on you.

Hmmm.<br><br><blockquote><br><strong><br>anyway i didnt suggest in anyway that i'm a lawyer (need not exercise due deligence in making my comments).... so keep ur nasty comments for your mother<br></strong><br></blockquote>Hmmm? Who suggested in any way that you're a lawyer? I didn't suggest in any way that you're a lawyer. Methinks the gentleman doth protest too much, as the saying goes...<br><br>Whether you are or are not a lawyer, when it comes to serious, potentially life changing issues like this, it would be nice if you did take some care to make sure that your assertions were reasonably accurate. To do otherwise is just downright irresponsible.<br><br>You've been shown to be horribly wrong, so just admit your mistake like a man, for crying out loud, instead of trying to salvage your shattered dignity with your petulant yelping.</div>

What's the point?  You'd still effectively be locking yourself out of the use of your own assets, that's virtually the same as not having those assets. If that's the case, you may as well just let her take 50% upon divorce - at least you can actually use the remaining 50%.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>To handle your third point, the trust fund would be setup to safe guard majority of the assets, hence salaries of the bachelor would be the only one on the line.<br><br></strong></blockquote>Sure, but see my preceding point. After paying out alimony and maintenance from your salary, you might still have enough for basic living expenses. But you would still be effectively locked out of the use of the majority of your hard earned assets. Why bother 'safeguarding' your assets if you can't even use them?<br><br>Unless, of course, you're doing it out of pure principle, and just want to prevent your ex from getting at your assets.<br><br>Oh yes, an additional problem re: the use of trusts which I forgot to mention previously: the beneficiaries of a trust, as long as they are more than 21 years old and are mentally sound, can collectively order that the trust be dismantled and the trust assets automatically transferred to their full legal ownership. So, for example, if you declared a trust in favour of your children, once they all reach 21 years of age, they can collectively apply to the court for a dissolution of the trust, and have the trust assets transferred to their name.<br><br>In that situation, you would of course completely lose access to the trust assets - your kids, or whoever your beneficiaries are, would get them.</div>

The parents would want to give back the assets back to the son. As for the use of the trust, the parents can be instructed by the son as well as setting guidelines on the use of the assets in the trust.<br><br></div>

'Instructing' the parents on the use of the trust does no good, because it's the son who is the trustee and is under the obligation to administer (i.e 'use') the trust, and he has to administer them in the interests of the parents, not himself.<br><br>If you're counting on the parents exercising their right to terminate the trust and take the money back, then in that situation, you completely lose control of the trust assets anyway, because full legal ownership of the assets is transferred to the parents. You can't establish guidelines for the use of the assets then, because once the trust is terminated, all its terms, guidelines etc cease to exist.<br><br>If you want to go about performing this whole rigmarole, you may as well just make an outright gift of the assets to the parents, and wait for them to return it to you in their will. Then you won't have to bother with the intricacies and potential hazards of trusts law.<br><br>If you're NOT counting on the parents to exercise their right to terminate the trust, then you still run into the same problems I mentioned in my previous post.<br><br>And of course, if you're counting on the parents returning the son's assets to him upon their death, don't forget all those assets will be subject to a very heavy inheritance tax - not sure how much this will amount to, but I hear that in Singapore it can be really quite high - 30% ++ of the value of the assets, something like that. So, at the end of the day, you save only something like 10-20% of your asset value if you go by this route rather than agreeing to the standard divorce settlement. And the value of that 10-20% could very well be significantly diminished by inflation, decline in asset value, etc over the 20-30 years in which the parents will hold the assets before transferring them to the son via their will.<br><br>Additionally, all this is premised on the assumption that you can trust the parents to do as the son wants.<br><br>All this is getting rather complicated. Aren't you going to a lot of trouble just to marry some chio bu (who, incidentally, is after your money)? Wouldn't you save yourself a lot of trouble (and money and time) if you just married a woman of good character (who may not be quite so chio)? Is getting a 'hot' wife really worth all this trouble?</div>
