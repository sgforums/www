            <div class='col-md body'>There are two main types of these "marriage contracts": prenuptial agreements, which are entered into before the marriage and antenuptial agreements which are entered into after the actual wedding. The advantages to these types of agreements are many. In divorce cases, emotions can run high and people can find themselves guided by emotion rather than reason. Legal fees can rapidly mount when emotions run ramped. If the terms of a settlement are negotiated before the onset of marital difficulties, the fairness of the resolution can more accurately be weighed and parties will likely save thousands of dollars in legal fees.<br><br>If you are considering entering into a prenuptial agreement with your fiancÃ©, you should first be apprized of your rights and responsibilities under the laws of your state. Because parties are free to enter into contracts, parties can, and routinely do, provide for a resolution of relevant issues in a manner different from what a Court would order in the event of a divorce. A discussion of your stateÂ’s laws, however, will help you gage the fairness of the agreementÂ’s terms.<br><br>Most attorneys consider it an ethical conflict to represent both parties to a prenuptial agreement. Regardless of this fact, you and your fiancÃ© should each retain your own attorneys. Your individual attorneys will be able to separately counsel you regarding the terms of the agreement and ensure that your legal rights are protected in the eventual contract.<br><br>Settlement negotiations take time. Before the agreement can even be drafted, it will be necessary to reach an agreement on all of its terms and provisions. Because of the delays which may occur in reaching an agreement on the terms and actually signing the prenuptial agreement, you must allow sufficient time to complete this process. Waiting until the eve of your wedding to begin the process will only increase the pressure which you are under and create the possibility that the agreement cannot be completed in time. A document with such long term ramifications should never be rushed. It is crucial that you be assured of the fairness of your prenuptial agreement and understand all of its terms and provisions before it is signed.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wuming78:</div><div class="quote_body">does anyone still do that?!</div></blockquote>Prenuptial agreements have been as common in the celebrity world as divorces. Here are some examples:<br><br>* Heather Mills offered to sign a prenuptial agreement with new husband Paul McCartney, but the former Beatle turned down the offer, according to published reports.<br><br>* Actress Joan Collins and fiancÃ© Percy Gibson signed a premarital agreement.<br><br>* Actor Michael Douglas and actress Catherine Zeta-Jones signed a prenup.<br><br>* San Francisco Giants slugger Barry Bonds and his first wife, Sun, signed a premarital agreement, but she didn't have an attorney when she signed. That caused trouble for her when they divorced.<br><br>The California Supreme Court eventually ruled that prenuptial agreements are valid even if only one party had a lawyer.<br><br>For Ashworth and Auton, drawing up a prenuptial agreement is an acknowledgment that although they love each other, they also realize that there are no guarantees.<br><br>"Your judgment is very clouded when you're in love and you're getting married and everything is so wonderful," Ashworth said.<br><br>The prenuptial agreement brings a "practicality and realism to what is a real idealistic kind of state," she said.<br><br>"You want to count on everything (lasting) forever, but there are things that happen and change, and you can't count on all that," Ashworth said.<br><br>She also sees her premarital agreement as demonstrating that her marriage is about much more than money, because it lays out how the couple's finances will be handled and distributed.<br><br>"Barney wanted me to know that it's not about money, and it has nothing to do with that," Ashworth said. "It really is kind of a nice declaration that, 'I'm in it for you and I don't care about your stuff.'"<br><br>Auton said he had "no problem whatsoever" about signing a prenuptial agreement.<br><br>"The personal aspect never entered into it," said Auton, a salesman. "I look at it from a business standpoint, and to me, marriage is an agreement just like in any agreement in business.<br><br>"If you both have assets, whether they're even or uneven - if you've worked really hard to get to that point and something goes sour down the road, you don't want to lose those things you worked so hard for."<br><br>He said neither he nor Ashworth "expects to exercise our prenuptial."<br><br>"Yes, we're both madly in love with one another, but when you take your heart out of it, you have to put your head into it," Auton said. "You just can't feel slighted or take it personally."<br><br>That level of comfort with a premarital agreement has a lot to do with whether it's crafted properly, experts say.<br><br>Experts advise being honest and forthright when talking to your beloved about a premarital agreement.<br><br>"The whole idea of a premarital agreement is to decide what the two of you think is right and fair while you love each other, not after you hate each other," said Ashworth's lawyer, Janet Brumley, a partner at Verner &amp; Brumley in Dallas.<br><br>"You are simply realistic that the marriage will end either through the death of one party or divorce, and that you want to settle the outcome of either."<br><br>However, don't spring a premarital agreement on your beloved on the day of the wedding.<br><br>"It needs to be done far ahead of the wedding or they can be challenged that they're under fraud or duress," Lynch said. "The closer you get to the wedding, the easier to prove that."<br><br>One way to make sure that both parties' interests are represented is for each person to hire an attorney, experts say.<br><br>"If you both have your own attorney, it's very hard, in the event of a divorce, to say there was coercion on either party's side," said Courtney Knowles, spokesman for the Equality in Marriage Institute in New York, a nonprofit group that promotes marriage as a partnership of equals.<br><br>It's crucial that there be a full disclosure of all assets, liabilities, income and expectations of gifts and inheritances.<br><br>Specify the status of gifts, inheritances and trusts each spouse receives or benefits from, whether before or after marriage.<br><br>Texas is a "community property" state, which means that each spouse owns an unspecified, undivided interest in assets.<br><br>Under Texas law, anything that one spouse receives by gifts or inheritance during marriage remains that spouse's separate property.<br><br>However, the income generated by separate property is community property.<br><br>For example, if one spouse inherits stock, the stock itself is separate property, but the dividends are community property.<br><br>"In Texas, the presumption is that all assets owned by a married couple on the date of divorce are community property," Brumley said.<br><br>"You can rebut that presumption by 'tracing' or by showing that you owned the asset before marriage or you got it during your marriage by gift, bequest or inheritance."<br><br>Tracing is a method of proving that an asset came from separate property and therefore is separate property.<br><br>For example, if one spouse inherits a valuable vase, sells the vase and uses the proceeds to buy a dining room table, the dining room table is separate property.<br><br>A premarital agreement should describe how premarital debts will be paid. It is especially important to discuss debts, Knowles said.<br><br>"As a partner entering marriage, it's crucial that you know what your joint debt is," he said. "There's a chance you might be responsible for that."<br><br>Decide who will own your home in the event of death or divorce and clarify what will happen to each type of property, whether jointly or individually owned, such as real estate, artwork and jewelry.<br><br>Don't be greedy.<br><br>"Pigs get fat, but hogs get slaughtered," Brumley said.<br><br>Courts are more likely to strictly enforce a premarital agreement that seems fair than they are a premarital agreement that gives one party an overwhelming advantage over the other, she said.<br><br>Be prepared for give and take.<br><br>"This is not a contest to try and win control," Brumley said.<br><br>"You love the person with whom you are negotiating and want to do right by him or her<br>or you shouldn't be contemplating marriage," she said. "Don't get caught up in who's getting their way."<br><br><a href="http://www.dailyemerald.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2003/01/17/3e26fc95ab31f" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailyemerald.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2003/01/17/3e26fc95ab31f</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you get divorce, you will fell (grade 1) pain because of your hard earn money and property but it is too late.<br><br>No point talking like HERO<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by franzx:</div><div class="quote_body">Sorry to prick your bubble but Prenup etc do not hold up in Singapore courts.  They are not recognised in law.  So you can sign away but it means nothing and nothing in the agreement is binding whatsoever.<br><br>So in that case, why poison the new marriage with something like this when it has absolutely no legal effect?  On the other hand, if , the girl or guy is willing to sign the prenum and bec of that you think that your property is safe then if I were you, danger signs should be sounding cos, if he or she knows that its not binding... then err why is he or she signing??? just so as to get you to tie the knot???<br><br>If so then you will stand to lose more than you had anticipated at the end of the day!!<br><br>A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.</div></blockquote></div>
