            <div class='col-md body'>This rather interesting link came up on the forum sidebar with this thread: <a href="http://programcritique.com/subcategories/InvestmentOpp/RobertKiyosaki.html?Name=Robert%20Kiyosaki" rel="nofollow">http://programcritique.com/subcategories/InvestmentOpp/RobertKiyosaki.html?Name=Robert%20Kiyosaki</a><br><br>I agree with the author that going for Kiyosaki's seminars is overkill - I expect that all Kiyosaki has to say can be found in his books.<br><br>Taken in the wrong spirit, Kiyosaki's books can of course be a big disappointment.  If you're looking for a game plan of how to get rich quick, don't waste your time reading his books.<br><br>However, he does have a knack for laying out some home truths about money, and those are useful for those who have never conceived of money as anything other than what you get in return for a day's work.  Rich Dad, Poor Dad serves as a useful reader for those who are at the stage of asking, "How, exactly, does money work?".<br><br>Take the basics that he lays out, try to apply them to situations that you experience, and those books can be useful.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree he is a successful marketer able to string together a tale or story and market that concept out to the masses, people like to be associated with visionaries it makes them feel good abt themselves.<br><br>Thats why real estate and especially MLM seminars are so popular because there is a feel good factor to it. To pump you up and make you feel good so you can go out and con somebody to bring back with you to feel good together.<br><br>Robert Kiosaki maybe in his earlier years he invested a lot and probably paid a lot of tution fees along the way in the form of his investment failures thats part and parcel of any investor thats why he is so knowledgable but nobody can be perfect in investments and no investment is 100% guarntee.<br><br>And for any most people once they reach certain age the appetite for risk drops especially if you don't want to see your hard earned $$$ thru many years of savings and investing gone before you do...so giving seminars is a good way to earn a living.<br><br>At least with this new occupation he saves face when his golf friends asks him what he does these days, he can say he is a seminar guru and not a bum living out his days staying at home watching TV.</div>

Good say.<br><br>I believed it is inspiring, but it's not just a few books that you can turn your whole life into what he mentioned.  The whole life is not revolved only in what he said. There are alot more and really alot to learn.<br><br>Though he has a couple of inspiring books, but if you read more, he is just releasing books to sell. Even in his seminars, it's just selling his own books/games and his associates's. His intial intention is no longer around as he has once said when he first released " Rich Dad Poor Dad"... To bring awareness to normal people of their thinking. He did that with " Rich Dad Poor Dad" and " Cashflow Quadrant", then he concentrated in releasing books that people will want to read.<br><br>In addition, he only release 'manual' these 2 years, as people kept asking him for steps and manuals to be successful. So 'successful stories' is published... but do you go and follow whatever have been done?<br><br>I don't think so.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Some can no longer be done, as the golden time is over, some are still able to in overseas. Do you have an eye for what's going to happen?<br><br>People shall not just treat his books as a standard basic of whatever other people or experienced people gave. I remembered reading a book saying if a person just read a series of collection from the same author and keep thinking he will be like the authors or have a wonderful life after that, then he's damn wrong. Coz people sometimes published books or teach because of flame or money. If you want to be like what he wrote, then read wider range and from different authors, learn from experiences and people who are willing to teach.<br><br>It's not to learn ropes, it's more than that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a house is a liability when you have mortgage .<br>it is an asset when you fully own it.<br><br>a car is a depreciating asset unless you select wisely- like those with vintage cars.<br>However if you are a mechanic - a car is an asset in which you use to fix and sell off at a cost price.<br><br>credit is a liability , however USA likes to see people using credit and having credit reports because it is a capitalistic system in which they want to know if you can pay off in time what you owe and if they can make a quick buck out of you.<br><br>Kiyosaki says cash rich is not that good to banks - true since they love your payment of THEIR interest rates. Really , to me , cash rich and asset rich are the ones the banks want to get into dear costly debts. That is why banks love asking young professionals if they want credit cards.  Kiyosaki took a huge gamble in his books and it paid off for him - how many of us want to taste failure first ? not many.<br><br>The truly filthy rich own stocks ( paid in by their money) , own assets ( paid in full) and control businesses in which they have minimal liability ( thanks to their million dollar retainer lawyers.<br><br>So if you ask me what kind of book you can use to get rich. Robert L. Hersley's book "All the math you need to get rich" is the best book I ever used.  I use his book to calculate how much repayments I must make to finish off my mortgage in 5-10 years. The book doesn't tell you how to get rich - it just gives you the mathematics of the banks in simple and concise language. Just how to be debt free rich with abit of assets ( not million dollar rich)<br><br>He preaches (but minorly) that it is better to have cash flow and paid off assets ( without being in debt), opposite of what kiyosaki says really.</div>

Or if you are willing to share the house with someone else.<br><br>And if you have enough $$ to pay in full, those $$ are probably better spend elsewhere. Last I checked, rental income is only around 3% of property price.<br><br>Currently, there might even be a problem to find a tenant.</div>
