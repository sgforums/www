            <div class='col-md body'>This guy, I know him for a while.<br><br>He is those sort that cannot start any conversation with any friend without some form of aggravation on other parties part..<br><br>No one is Allowed to grumble at him or anything.  Even in a friendly manner.<br><br>I had merely send him a testimonial on friendster with a "Some friend he is, never even borther to catch up with a Hi! Humpfft humpfft..."<br><br>Ga Na SAI!<br><br>But truth be said, he really is quite a jackazz in real life.  And him saying what he says.  And me knowing his past. And the fact that his response is most likely to try to tell me to keep quiet if his current squeeze were to question me and ask me about his past and lousy personality.<br><br>He abuses better when others didnt know him.  I know his tactic.  He goes around isolating a person, then he treats her badly, and then he blames it on her and make her feel bad and reliant on him.<br><br>And when eventually the female realises the trick and learn to talk to people, that guy will undoubtedly be dumped again.  And he will go around to blame other people.</div>
