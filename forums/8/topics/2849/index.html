            <div class='col-md body'>Well guys, sometimes in life you'll come to this question, whether to live my life so that my family and friends will be happy for me. I'm not happy! Or? what most important to me is that I'm happy.<br>Sometimes you may feel that its ur life and no one should tell you how to live it but sometimes you are hurting them unconsiciously.

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me state my position first: I am a selfish person.<br><br>This being the case, naturally I would place emphasis on my happiness above other things. After all, its my life.<br><br>But of course, our state of happiness depends not only on ourselves, but also on the surroundings around us. I mean we cannot claim to be truly happy if we are successful and our family and friends are suffering around us. This is even more so if their burden was a result of our actions.<br><br>I guess when I make a decision that involves my own "happiness" as well as that of others, I would have to place myself as the centre of focus and consider the rest as "factors" before reaching my decision.<br><br>This is because when we make such decisions, whatever the outcome is, we have to LIVE with it. Thus, if reasoning and gut feeling tells you that you can, by all means carry on, even if it means hurting others around you.<br><br>Its somthing like whether the ends justify the means. But I think its more of a question of how much of our conscience we are willing to betray for happiness.<br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Fireice :<br><br>I disagree with you, one may not be happy but can still help others to be happy. I belong to this kind of people..

            <div class='col-md body'>To Daze :<br><br>You are responsible for your own life. Nothing can help you. I understand your feeling, sometimes you feel helpless, you feel bad and you feel depressed, but at the end of the day, you must bear that and move with your life. Let me tell you that everyone is suffering, and it is up to you to do things to stop the suffering of others as well as yourself... When you finish your whines, move on with your life, maybe you don't want it, but it is the only way out since all others fail...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
