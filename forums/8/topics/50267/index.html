            <div class='col-md body'>what level are u pursuing this question at?<br><br>most would just think the Bowring treaty... but its more than that. Bowring treaty gave the Brits an edge in Siam, but Mongkut wasn't stupid... its been said to death that once the brits get a foothold, its usually a matter of time before they mow over u and trample u to bits... unless u do something to counter their influence...<br><br>Mongkut isn't stupid... after Bowring, he gave similar terms to all other European powers that cared to ask for it... the French, the Americans (which he loved cos they sold him arms) and the Hanseatic League (don't ask where... its not important).<br><br>the names of these treaties aren't important. Bowring is the main one. the terms are all similar to the Bowring. Most notable term is MFN status. means almost the same thing as today... basically tax breaks, low tariffs, rights to buy/own land, diplomatic representation <strong>extraterritoriality</strong>... last one VERY important. no European wanted to be under Siamese laws at that time so an ang moh who commits a crime in Siam had to be tried by his representative in Siam... either ambassador or consul.<br><br>and oh yeah... he tried to play them off against each other... most notable: anglo-french rivalry... France was expanding in Indo -China at this time... getting dangerously close to Siam... near Laos and Cambodia... British were expanding in Burma, which was right next to British India... so they met in the middle in Siam.<br><br>Siam became a buffer between them cos both the French and the Brits didn't want to kill each other. in short, Siam existed because it was expedient to leave it along, not because Mongkut was smart or shrewd.<br><br>think about it... Burma was ruled by King Mindon at the same time... Burma became a colony despite Mindon being almost as smart and forward looking as Mongkut. in fact, Mongkut took the idea of standardising the currency from Mindon, who implemented it in Burma earlier. why? geopolitics and all that crap... it always depends on more than one factors and their interactions.<br><br>Norodom was not that bad a king in Cambodia... Cambodia was also a Siamese vassal state... his story was much more interesting... the French really gave him a hard time... don't think u care to know... not directly relavant.<br><br>i could go on and on but its better if u ask a more specific question. lots of very interesting stuff happening in the region during that time... very dirty stuff...<br><br>france and britain civilised the region? ha... don't make me laugh...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>duh? it was never colonised in the first place! so what's there to be free from?<br><br>some would argue that Siam was in fact semi-colonised though... if u looked around in Mongkut's court in those days, got a lot of "foreign talents" also lor... serving as advisers. though they were paid by Siam lah so technically were employees of the Siamese gov't (if u called it a gov't... it was a mess...)<br><br>they were independent on the surface lah, but underneath, u were never sure who was really running the show... ang moh influence doesn't have to be official to be overbearing...<br></div>
