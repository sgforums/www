            <div class='col-md body'>Do you guys think that it's unethical to produce embryos only for the sole purpose of obtaining stem cells.<br><br>For the uninitiated, cells that have not received any instructions are called stem cells. What can stem cells do for us? Since a stem cell is an unspecialised cell, scientists may be able to prompt them into becoming whatever type of cell that is needed. These cells may be used to replace damaged or sick cells in a patient with an injury or a degenerative illness.<br><br>In a controversial method, stem cells are taken from an aborted fetus, with the signed consent of mothers who had previously decided to terminate her pregnancy. This practice has drawn savage fire from pro-life activists, including the Catholic Church, which recently urged the American government to halt research into stem cells.<br><br>Stem cells studies, however, may hold the key to curing baffling diseases like AlzheimerÂ’s and ParkinsonÂ’s.<br>This is part of the latest techniques of science known as tissue engineering.<br><br>In a stunning experiment, researchers in the University of Boston recently grew a human ear on the back of a mouse. Scientists fashioned a precision mold out of biodegradable polymer, seeded it with human cartilage cells, and tucked it beneath the skin of the mouse bred without an immune system (to prevent tissue rejection). A perfectly formed human ear developed and was removed without any harm to the mouse.<br>Tissue engineering paves the way for a new brand of medicine. With the aid of stem cells, any type of organ can be fashioned, stored, and then taken out when it is needed for a medical emergency. Even individual cells damaged by diseases like cancer or AIDS can be fixed easily.<br><br>So what do you guys think? Should religious sensitivities be placed above the consideration for improving the quality of lives?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's very insightful. I agree with you that the answer depends very much on what you believe. However, it is not true that all "ape-to-man" believers are supporters of cloning and stem-cell research.<br><br>Glorified ape or descendant of Adam, all life is well, life, and there is something rather repulsive about cultivating embryos for harvesting stem cells. And yet, the whole science of it has the potential to solve most of humanity's health problems.<br><br>Well, just my thoughts on it.</div>

Cloning technology improves the human body in survival against virus and diseases. Cloning helps the impotent to have children.
