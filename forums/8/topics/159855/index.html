One personality bought the ticket with 40 dollars in my wallet. The other personality only reserved a 40 dollar ticket.<br><br>I cannot remember where I put the ticket because the personality I am in only reserved it. Hence, I have the impression I had the ticket but could not remember details such as the seat number. But because I already bought a ticket, it would seem that I lost 40 dollars.<br><br>All that is left is to wait for the next switch in personality so that I can take out my ticket to watch the play.</div>
