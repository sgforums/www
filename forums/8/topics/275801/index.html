            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: darkblue;">The Haunting</span></span><br><br>Ten years ago, when I was 19, I met a girl (Lyn) at a job placement agency, and quickly became friends. Lyn lived with another girl at the time and continued to complain about her roommate and ended up leaving and coming to stay with me and my family. After a few weeks, we decided to get a place of our own, and quickly found a nice basement apartment. Lyn was into the occult, nothing major just tarot cards, burning candles, etc, which never bothered me.<br><br>About a month after we moved in, the landlord (Susan) came down to the basement one afternoon to do laundry and the three of us somehow got onto the topic of ghosts. Susan mentioned she thought the place was haunted by her deceased mother among others, but the thought of ghosts never really bothered me, maybe due to a slight disbelief.<br><br>Two weeks later at around 12am, Lyn came into my room and woke me up. "There are ghosts in this place and they don't like you very much, so I would watch myself if I were you" is what she said to me at the foot of my bed, then left. Slightly disturbed and confused by this strange announcement, I got and went into her room to find her fast asleep. At first I though maybe she was pretending to be asleep and it was a prank, or maybe I was crazy and imagined I heard her saying that, but the next morning when confronted she claimed she didn't remember saying that so I wrote it off as a weird dream.<br><br>Then about 3 weeks later, the two of us were watching TV at night before bed. I had to get up for work at 5am so I decided to go to bed early. Something woke me up at about 2am, not a person but "something" snapped me out of my sleep and I awoke to an overwhelming uneasy feeling of not being alone. I felt the need to get out of my bedroom, so I got up and went to the bathroom, but still uneasy, and not comfortable enough to return to bed, went into the living room to watch TV. About 10-15 minutes later, the living room suddenly got very cold and I felt a rush of wind passing my cheek, in my ear, like a window was open but all windows and doors were closed as it was the middle of winter. Then I began hearing an almost chattering or whispering in my ear and the whispering continued and was circling around me, almost taunting me. I was hearing voices but nothing was there and it got louder and kept circling around me. I started to panic. I kept saying stop unaware of what was happening to me, but scared to death! Was I hallucinating?<br><br>I was so scared I did the only thing I could think of, I prayed to god, and not being a religious person by any means I prayed something fierce. "Please god make it stop, I'm scared. Please make it stop!" when all of a sudden everything stopped. The chattering/whispering in my ears and all around me, the rushing of wind, whatever was causing this just suddenly stopped just as mysteriously as it begun and after it stopped, I had this sudden overwhelming sense of relief and I was actually able to get up and go to bed and fall asleep like what I just experienced never happened.<br><br>I woke up at 5am, rushed to get ready for work and rushed out of the apartment, relieved to be out of there and I ended up staying at my boyfriends, friends, parents place during the coming weeks, too scared to sleep in the apartment, and eventually ended up moved back home.<br><br>I still to this day can't explain what happened to me!<br><br></div>
