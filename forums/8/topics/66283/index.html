Well, he mite have been a little pushy I'm sure, but I doubt the gal is completely innocent (not tat she asked for it either).<br><br>Just happens he probably tried too hard to 'slime' his way out of it (prob with advice from his lawyer) and ended up coming across as dodgy and inconsistent while the gal merely maintained wat happened and displayed her anguish which won the sympathy of the judge.<br><br>Looks like we all have to be real careful about these type of 'casual' encounters....<br><br><img src="http://www.emoteeglobes.com/website/KaoAni/Weepsy-Kao-Ani1.gif"> <a href="http://www.emoteeglobes.com" rel="nofollow">www.emoteeglobes.com</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the woman is not totally blameless in this case. Shanker is of course guilty but so is the woman who should take some blame for getting herself drunk and agree to the company of strangers or company of juz befriended guy.<br><br>Above is my point of view.</div>

Why? If today I killed a man. A similar case happened 10yrs ago, same motive, some situation and same method used in committing the crime.

This maintains consistency in the eyes of the law.<br><br>Another point to note is that if the verdict wld to be diff fr. 10 yrs ago, however, given the same court case, so why izzit diff?

Simply put to explain my thoughts: If a gal was to dress too sexily and that created some "reaction" in a guy, thus, he committed a crime by raping or molesting her. What is the rationale? She was at fault for doing wearing what she did? Or did he not curb and restrain what he shldnt?</div>
