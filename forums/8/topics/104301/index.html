            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, anyone have tried exercising, dieting, going to slimming centres, or taking slimming pills but it didn't work out??<br><br>I'm trying out a weight management program for 3 weeks and I find that I have slimmed a little....they have fitness consultants to measure your body fats and assess your health. Then the consultant will then work out a simple plan for you to follow on wat food to take....it's those normal food that we can get outside like bee hoon soup, ban mian etc, don't need to follow a strict plan whereby it's difficult to get the food or you have to prepare from home...<br><br>I'm glad this is working out for me....Quite impressive i must say...so i tot just share this piece of good news.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Gym or just pure jogging? I have not heard of people put on weight after jogging except for 2 circumstances: 1) Over eat after jogging. 2) Extreme slow jog will increase muscle build up.<br><br>Muscle is heavier than FAT, that is a fact.
