I got the same info as my friend.  They only have 1 product for slimming.  So ex!!!  I think it's $470 or something for 1 month's supply.  Definitely not $240.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>Even $240 is still on the high side.  Somemore, the staff said it's not a meal replacement.  Supposed to take 1 after breakfast.  On top of that, the staff I spoke to doesn't even know what product the company is selling.  She kept having to refer to her superior.  If the product is selling well, there will be lotsa phone call enquiries what.  She should be familiar with answering by now.<br><br>Anyway, that company is only famous for skin care.  Slimming wise, I have my doubts.<br><br>If really want to go for a slimming plan without exercising..... meal replacement is the best.  You have to eat anyway.<br><br>I used to take Cambridge Diet and Herbalife.  Both works.  Saved my time, cuz I don't have to cook or buy food.  Save money also.  You see 1 month supply of Cambridge Diet is only $120.  The money that you spend on lunch around your workplace is definitely more than $60 (assuming you take breakfast at home).  So, by saving you $60 a month on normal meals, you are actually only paying about $60 for the product itself.  As for dinner, you can still take normal meals.  Same for Herbalife.  I have yet to try Xando meal replacement, which I heard also good.<br><br>Sorry lah.  Auntie here likes to calculate to the nearest cent.  Coslab thingy is far too expensive.  Even as a spendthrift myself, I don't want to spend on their slimming product.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Honeybunz:</div><div class="quote_body">I just called also.  I got the same info as my friend.  They only have 1 product for slimming.  So ex!!!  I think it's $470 or something for 1 month's supply.  Definitely not $240.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>Even $240 is still on the high side.  Somemore, the staff said it's not a meal replacement.  Supposed to take 1 after breakfast.  On top of that, the staff I spoke to doesn't even know what product the company is selling.  She kept having to refer to her superior.  If the product is selling well, there will be lotsa phone call enquiries what.  She should be familiar with answering by now.<br><br>Anyway, that company is only famous for skin care.  Slimming wise, I have my doubts.<br><br>If really want to go for a slimming plan without exercising..... meal replacement is the best.  You have to eat anyway.<br><br>I used to take Cambridge Diet and Herbalife.  Both works.  Saved my time, cuz I don't have to cook or buy food.  Save money also.  You see 1 month supply of Cambridge Diet is only $120.  The money that you spend on lunch around your workplace is definitely more than $60 (assuming you take breakfast at home).  So, by saving you $60 a month on normal meals, you are actually only paying about $60 for the product itself.  As for dinner, you can still take normal meals.  Same for Herbalife.  I have yet to try Xando meal replacement, which I heard also good.<br><br>Sorry lah.  Auntie here likes to calculate to the nearest cent.  Coslab thingy is far too expensive.  Even as a spendthrift myself, I don't want to spend on their slimming product.</div></blockquote>My earlier posts already mentioned I bought the whole package of 5 products for 3 months. I checked back my receipt, the product you mentioned is Slimmer's Choice. True, this is not the meal replacement. the meal replacement I am taking is call PhytoMeal which is 30pckts/$240. Not wrong...we got a miscommunication here... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>And the number you called I tink is to the beauty &amp; facial salons....so they are not sure. I bought my package from the agent himself...the weight management package is only out in the market not long nia....but anyway...i'm just as satisfied as you are with the products you tried.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
