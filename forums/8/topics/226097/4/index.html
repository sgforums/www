He even challenged me, "which school are you from?  what address?"<br><br>I was so bloody outraged that I just stood there for the entire journey scold him in machine-gun english.. I took down his bus number, his name, then when I reached my stop I said "Uncle! My stop liao, U gonna gimme back my pass anot!"  He finally relented and returned the pass to me muttering weakly, "next time change photo ah!"<br><br>There was this ang moh sitting in front, he watched the whole thing silently..
