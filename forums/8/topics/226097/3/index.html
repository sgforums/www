            <div class='col-md body'>So what did you do? Did you get down the bus eventually? Personally, if i were you, I would have made a din in the bus. Please lor, the bus driver is supposed to drive a bus, not to haunt the passengers and make false accusations that they are cheating, etc etc. If you are right, you MUST fight for your own rights, if not, those haughty bus drivers will become more and more arrogant, thinking that they can bully more people. In addition, you will get the upper hand because the break time of those bus drivers are at stake and they have some explanation to do should they not arrive in the bus terminating point on time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Boarded the bus, paid 45 cents. Then bus Driver KPKB with me. Accuse me that i am not student. Screw him! Don in sch U with school badge and school bag, but accuse me that i am not a student. F*** him! fine paid 1 dollar and let the case rest.<br><br>Todae, at newton MRT, ard 7 15, i boarded 162 and tap my EZ link. Was tierd , so sat at the back. However, bus driver came out and single me out and asked me to show him ym ez link. Since he was polite, perhaps i never tap properly, my mistake? nvm, show lor. Then he said, " WHOS that in the photo displayed in the ez link?" Stunned! Told him that is me. Still dun believe. liew fine show him my IC.<br><br>Just when i though it was just misunderstanding, he said this ez link is for small boys.... didn't SBS told us that we could extend our ez link card from P6 to JC 2?<br>Isn't this obvious? born in 1988 yet was accused of faking my age.. F*** him.<br>I said politely, " Erm... sbs said we could extend our ez link since we r still schooling. Even if i am not in JC, poly students are still considered stuents mah right?" Still dun believe.<br><br>In the end, he opened the door and told me to leave the bus.. F*** him! everyone stared at me as if i was a terrorist..

SBS253M, SBS304A and SBS520S unless spare bus takeover or cameo bus<br>cameo bus means... a bus frm other svc takeover another svc instead of its usual svc... e.g SBS167D frm 154 as usual can maybe be used to serve 181 if maybe 304A frm 181 is on maintenance on that day... but another bus must replace 167D</div>
