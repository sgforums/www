            <div class='col-md body'><strong>I realised that when I interviewed for some candidates. I was told to select and interview them.</strong><br><br>IMHO of having worked for 6 years, I think for some jobs that are very technical in nature, I would think the interview should involve the fellow engineers in the relevant department. Afterall how is the HR going to know what is the job scope involving besides the typical written in black and white in company guidelines etc etc.....<br><br>In reality the job scope may juz varies and who to know more about it then the people doing it day in day out? HR only know the high level picture of the post job scope. An ideal setting is engineers from relevant department interview the candidate and get a feel that he/she can fit and work with them. THEN HR step in to negotiate the pay packet, benefits etc with the candidate.<br><br>I know of some companies that interview in such ways like PSA, Creative Tech etc. And I believe this is a better strategy than juz letting the HR have a full rein of the recruitment process solely. Let each department contribute their best skills at stuff they are good at.</div>
