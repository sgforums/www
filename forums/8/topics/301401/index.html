My desired course is <strong><a href="http://www.lasalle.edu.sg/cgi-bin/WebObjects/LASALLE.woa/wa/page?pid=44" rel="nofollow">Bachelor of Arts (Hons) Graphic Design</a></strong><br>The intake is August 2008 this year, and application deadline is April 30 2008. So it is coming soon.... so i have to get ready<br><br>My main questions will be regarding to building a portfolio. I'm not so sure how should i present it.... kinda headache.<br><br>In the La Salle site, it states 'submit 10 pieces of original work and a sketchbook......... (i intend to submit 15-20 if i want to submit photographs)<br><br><strong>Here are my questions! :</strong><br>- What preferred size of paper should I use? A3 is ok, how about A4? those normal printing paper.. When i do illustration then i just print them out in A4 paper and then put into my files?<br><br>- Submission of art pieces.<br>Im thinking of submitting a range of art works like portrait, digital illustration stuffs, photographs.................<br>How bout sketches? Is it appropriate? as in considered as 1 art piece (not in the sketchbook)  I have alot of portrait sketches.. well not sketches actually, but more distinct.. black and grey<br><br>Also, can i submit brochures/postcards/etc that i designed? Haha.. im just not sure what are the 'appropriate' ones to submit.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think its better to be in A3 size.<br><br>You should just dig up all ur previous work and slot them up nicely in ur folio.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually whatever format most appropriate and advantageous in showing your work. Just package them nicely. That's most important than the scale of things. If you thing is a small design no point to blow up to A1 also right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Err... what is your course in poly? Your post sounds like you don't know how to present a high qualtiy portfolio, or is inexperienced at such.<br><br>Anyway, answering the post:<br><br>A3 is the recommended way to go. Get a lot of A2 black paper if you are aiming for high quality, classy look. 'Mount' your illustrations into the center of the black paper, before filing into an A2 pocket file.<br><br>A3 or A4 size, be sure to use high quality, heavy paper. If light can shine through the paper, its out. (this is especially important if you are mounting it onto black paper as mentioned above. The black paper can change colors and tones on the front paper)<br><br>If you are going to present your works in portrait, everything should be in portrait then. All landscape work should be scaled accordingly to fit in a portrait page. Same vice versa.<br><br>Sketches are perfectly fine as it can show off your fundamental understandings, but you should not present them as single works unless they are refined, superb works. It is usually recommended to composite them nicely onto one or more page.<br><br>Commercial works you've done are allowed IF they are not bound by contract.  Just be sure that they are high quality, non-folded works, the last thing you want your reviewer to complain about are crease lines.

Thats why some questions might sound silly. For your info, im doin unrelated stuff in poly.... IT diploma  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  (what a waste of time and money)<br>But im really keen in this, as in the course im applying.. I've been wanting to do this. Thats why i dont want to mess things up for the portfolio part  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Thanks for the guidelines!<br><br>Anyway, for this:<br><strong>If you are going to present your works in portrait, everything should be in portrait then.</strong><br>Dont really understand this part? You mean if i were to submit portrait, all 10 pieces of work submitted must be in portrait form?<br><br>I think the sketches I will just bring my sketchbook along, as for those sketches in A4 size paper (piece by piece), should i bring them along too? And sort of place them in a A4 size clear file or somethin, but will not considered them as single work to be submitted<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm in LaSalle doing foundations, handling freelance jobs and had a good job in a small Graphics/Advertising Firm. (Quit due to school)<br><br>Don't worry too much about what to put your portfolio. Whatever you've got, put them in. Most importantly, have a variety, a range, a series, or all even. It's the presentation that really stands out. (If there is) And the amount of 'bullsh!t' you're willing to come up with. In this industry, it's that way, like it or not.<br><br>As someone mentioned. If you're going to have a really nice, neat portfolio. If the first work is presented in portrait, keep it consistent. Or, better still, be yourself, bring your sketchbooks and present.<br><br>When I submitted my portfolio, for foundations. I had some of my works, my old sketches, paintings, models, digital images and even illustrations in it. They said 10. I gave em 35.<br><br>You say you're keen. I hope so. Cause it's not so easy doing graphics/advertising. Either way, even if you take up Graphics as a major, you'll still be posted/hired by some Ad firm.<br><br>One more thing, apart from all the mumbo jumbo in the folio. Remember to at least show a few different works using different programs. To show your experience and skills with them. Since you plan to take Graphics. Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign is a must. Other illustration programs would be a bonus. Though I'm not sure about Freehand. Most companies still use them.<br><br>And, if you do get into LaSalle, please don't become one of them.
