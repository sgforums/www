            <div class='col-md body'>wah...talking abt this pyramid selling makes me really sick.actually,my frend approached me a few weeks back with the opportunity of a money-making offer.i asked further wat type of job was it...but he refused to reveal anything,giving the reason that he's not too sure yet n do not wish to confuse me.i was curious n therefore,i went down to their office at Paya Lebar.<br><br>Damned...it was some kind of Pyramid selling in disguise n guess wat? the co. wants me to buy their distributor rights for $500.n i have to bring in 3 other friends so that i can create my own empire.Wat a lousy trick...i think i was stupid enuff to go there to listen to their bullshit talk.Even though this "Pyramid" thing has been around for few years,i think they have somehow re-created to something else.therefore,i'm trying to let ppl know that pls be careful abt this money-making opportunites.I was thinking...If there is really a good money-making opportunity,would ur friends be so good enuff to let u involve in it?<br><br>As someone once said,"Men are selfish". Hehe...n u noe what's the funniest thing the Manager over there told me? He asked me whether i like money or not n also asked me whether i have any 3 friends who like money?<br>what a good question...the despicable scheme really attacks ur "GREED" weakest point.<br><br>Anyone would like to share ur experience regarding this thing?<br>in fact,i'm quite angry with my fren for this Super-Good reccommendation.<br><br>------------------<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. You can make money by just recruiting people, as long as they are working hard below you.

            <div class='col-md body'>Pyramid selling is illegal and rightly so as the bubble will explode ultimately leaving those last in holding the bomb. If you think it is pyramid, report to police so people don't get hurt.<br><br>Since 2001 June, MLM is made legal through changes in the Pyramid Act . Legitimate MLM companies after submitting their marketing strategies and adhering to stringent controls and approved by goverment  were made legal. Usually these legitimate companies will be a member of Direct Selling Association Singapore. So one can make checks to see if they are legal or not.<br><br>Unlike pyramid selling, MLM marketeers do move products and products are also priced to be acceptable by the market they are targetting at. The law prohibits coercion and hard selling. The law also provides 100% money back gaurantee if products are returned up to 60 days from date of purchase to protect consumers.<br><br>There are now thousands of S'poreans involved in MLM and most of them are making a few hundred dollars to a couple of thousands if they are hard working enough. It is hard work, you can ask those who are active. A small percentage who has business plans and are organisation builders do make tens of thousands per month. But be forewarned, they are only a handful.<br><br>Therefore to do well in this business, it is important to learn from those who has made it and just duplicate what they do. The rest are merely selling and recruiting people to sell for them. Well, to me its like selling something and appoint distributors to sell for them, that is like what traditional companies are doing except that these people can do so without high capital and high risk in starting a company in the traditional way. Isn't that a safer way to do business? Especially, it also gives the unemployed and retreched people a livelihood to make a living. That then is a gracious society.<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a></div>

Usually, MLM companies do not advertise and the savings they made are paid to distributors on top of their profit mark ups. How do I know the legal stuff? Because I was invited to join one and I did all the checks.<br><br>If I were to join a company, I will check its credibility, that is, is the company strong and won't collapse?  Is it succesful in other parts of the world? If it is, that means their system works and consumers demands are there isn't it? On this basis would I then join. Furthermore, every company will have distributors that are doing very well and distributors that are merely surviving, so the person I joined with must be very successful, so he can teach me how to succeed. If my friend who is merely surviving although he is from a strong company, I won't join him because he will only know how to teach me to be merely surviving right?<br><br>So, if someone tells you u can make $$$$$, tell him to show you his paycheck. If he can do that, then you join him.

What they sell are consumable items like skin care, health products ....etc<br><br>Why, because people use these products everyday and when finished, repeat orders again. In other words, you get a customer for life therefore can keep price down as if I only earn a dollar from you, I will earn a dollar next month and next month..... That means prices can be kept low.<br><br>Now, that NOP thingy you talking about, how many times do one buy a crystal or massage machines. So they don't have repeat orders and thus they sell high. These companies are usually the small ones and will not be safe ones to join as, will they still be in business tomorrow when they have no repeat customers because price is high and no repeat orders?<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by blurblop (edited 30 May 2002).]</div>

If you think it is pyramid, report to police so people don't get hurt.<br><br>Since 2001 June, MLM is made legal through changes in the Pyramid Act . Legitimate MLM companies after submitting their marketing strategies and adhering to stringent controls and approved by goverment  were made legal. Usually these legitimate companies will be a member of Direct Selling Association Singapore. So one can make checks to see if they are legal or not.<br><br>Unlike pyramid selling, MLM marketeers do move products and products are also priced to be acceptable by the market they are targetting at. The law prohibits coercion and hard selling. The law also provides 100% money back gaurantee if products are returned up to 60 days from date of purchase to protect consumers.<br><br>There are now thousands of S'poreans involved in MLM and most of them are making a few hundred dollars to a couple of thousands if they are hard working enough. It is hard work, you can ask those who are active. A small percentage who has business plans and are organisation builders do make tens of thousands per month. But be forewarned, they are only a handful.<br><br>Therefore to do well in this business, it is important to learn from those who has made it and just duplicate what they do. The rest are merely selling and recruiting people to sell for them. Well, to me its like selling something and appoint distributors to sell for them, that is like what traditional companies are doing except that these people can do so without high capital and high risk in starting a company in the traditional way.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just recently joined this forum and saw all these comments on such SLM/MLM companies.<br><br>In any case these firms are all legal as the products they sell are of some value and use. Definitely NOT like the traditional pyramid selling of gold coins and funny useless items.<br><br>We should have no doubt of such products offered by such companies. If the products sucks they should perish in hell. But obviously they are of some use. Moreover, they will be shut down and sued if their products are really of no use.<br><br>The overpricing of goods should also be forgiven as products in the normal traditional retail markets are all overpriced too? NIKE shoes are 200 bucks only because of all the advertising, overhead costs and so on. Furthermore, health is such an intangible issue that money shouldnÂ’t be in the topic. There is a new relatively new MLM in Singapore that I suspect will be growing big. They are selling Â‘makanÂ’able  health foods made from their trademark Inidine which sells for 1400 bucks per 3 mths pack. EXPENSIVE YES~!<br>But what if they really prevent you from having some funny diseases which you canÂ’t even see yourself having?<br><br>So what is really in question?? (meanwhile please also check out this site <a href="http://www.vandruff.com/mlm.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vandruff.com/mlm.html</a>  )<br><br>I do believe that it is not the products causing so much displeasure from ppl all around.<br>It is the STYLE or the STRATEGY by which the sales person markets the products. From the Van Druff article, it is mentioned that Â“Anyone who has any experience with an MLM has strong feelings, either for or against, and this is the problem. Polarization runs deep.Â” People either go for it or hate it. Very hard to have a middle-land. Friendship comes into stake. For MLMers, friends become potential customers and business partners.<br>Everything around then evolved into substance of business.<br><br>What in the first place attracted MLMers? The concept of money making of course! What do a person know about a product initially? The GREED factor has come into play. Perhaps MLM makes the society into a more materialistic one? What will happen to friends all around? Perhaps the idea of MLM manifests more clearly the GREEDY side of human?<br><br>Of course some advocates of MLM say that they are into the business of sharing. Sharing of potent health products which have not been scientifically proven because somehow due to coincidence (or is it?) these products all belong to the umbrella of alternative health. ThereÂ’s not much evidence and documentation for alternative health. But there are certainly cases of evidence, passed down by word of mouth and through personal experiences. Hence, after enticed by the greed factor, MLMers suddenly realize how much they can do to help people around them by using their products. But the initial motivational factor is already in question.<br>The effect is self enforcing: you pay a high price for the product believing that it will work and it works! Placebo effect perhaps? Coupled with alternative healing methods? It just works. Hence, MLMers involved in Health products will be more motivated to SHARE these products which works well on them!<br><br>The products are good. But one question remains, which nobody can answer. Will the quality of the product remain? Everybody else in a certain MLM will be interested only in receiving and selling the product to earn their commission and to convince more people that their health can be improved. Who is there to check on the quality of the product? Who will probe and who can prove that these products works and will remain working down the generations? Or does it not matter since if people believed strongly in something it will work for them? It becomes rather like a religion. Except that this one works initially on the consumer paying a price inducing them to believe in it. Nobody has the ability to say whether these products work well or should be condemned at all unless if something really went wrong like the SLIM10 pills. If nothing goes wrong, they can remain in the market until the market saturates(also read up on market saturation in the Van  Druff article). Meanwhile, the MLMers will just thrive on personal experiences and stories which only people in the business will believe. ItÂ’s either you join to believe or refuse to believe totally in MLM.<br><br>So the conclusion isÂ… you shouldnÂ’t be blaming the MLM companies if  you are looking for someone to blame for all the irritating calls from your friends around you. It is the Network Strategy itself! And from what I see, it will fast become a trend. One thing I fear is that it brings out a greedy side of ppl. It is a job which can earnÂ… no doubtÂ… if you enroll in such a scheme and actively take part in it. But youÂ’ll slowly see your life changing. YouÂ’ll feel successful (especially with all the motivational talks and lectures to keep you confident and zesty).You may also end up happy because of the money and Â‘successÂ’. But only you yourself can define SUCCESS.<br>It doesnÂ’t seem to be a 9-5 job in MLM business.<br><br>(I refused a couple of times to take up MLM. I almost did, which was exactly out of greed. I now rather take up a 9-5 job and keep all my relationships with friends THE WAY THEY ARE! Oh one more point, I hate to work for ppl knowing that I make more money for them by working harder for myself!!!!! Oh.. one LAST thing, since those products really Â‘workÂ’, I am trying out alternative products of similar functions. Much cheaper anyway though maybe they are not of full capabilities hahahahhaah!!!)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yea...i was approached by my friend too.... I went for their so-called "discussion-talk" and the way they describe things were so tempting...on how money can be earned even if I dont make a single sale, provided that those ppl under me are making sales. The earlier i join the less saturated the market is and i can be one of the pioneers and therefore get more chances to earn more money. And if i hit a certain amt of sales i get to have a car...a choice of either a mercades or BWM...paid for by the company. They even pasted a monthly pay check of some guy on the cabinet....which was ard $19000. All these by selling some kind of MAGNETIC MATTRESS which costs abt $1000+. You dont have to buy the mattress to be able to join them but they give you this crap saying that if you buy the mattress yourself, you will have product confidence and in the future while making a sale you would sell with conviction. And by buying that mattress I would also be bringing health to myself.<br>I was really tempted by the way how much money could be earned but had not much confidence on the product itself. Didnt really believe that it will work out. One of my friend bought the mattress and right now it is lying somewhere in her house.</div>

Coerced into attending a few MLM talks and was totally turned off except for this one time when I was almost convinced. Those people who conned me into attending those talks without telling me straight up what the talks were about, had already lost my trust and part of my friendship. They were pretty sneaky.<br><br>From a positive angle, I do admire the MLM marketing strategy of some groups, expecially those with a so-call clear and strong business plan (some groups that distribute for NSE, i.e. Nuskin and Pharmnex etc). However, even thought the idea is good, people corrupt it during execution. I hate the fact that they can't be straight up when inviting people to the talk and that they exploit the human greed for the "betterment" of themselves. As you have said, the underlying motivation for them to promote such skin care and health products is greed for more money. I believe very few would have used those products if they were not agents themselves.<br><br>Personally, I do subscribe to the idea of financial freedom and "early retirement". But I wouldn't be satisfied to achieve those simply by engaging in the current mode of MLM. Firstly, I have this feeling that I would have to exploit and lost some of my pals if I were to join this MLM bandwagon. Secondly, I have no beliefs in the products that they are currently promoting out there.<br><br>Personally, I think there is definitely more to life than "making a lot of money". Thus, don't jump into the bandwagon simply because someone convinced you that you can get rich and retire quickly. Ask yourself if you would be happy simply by being the middleman in the product distribution? Sounds pretty boring right? I don't think I can derive much pleasure from such a job. Even though I'm making peanuts right now, I can truly say I really enjoy some aspects of my work. I wish to achieve financial independence through what I have learned and experience from my current meaningful work. Can't say the same if I were engage in product distribution or psyching "mentally weak and lost" soul to join my distribution network...</div>

Greed alone will make the MLMers fail. As greed sooner or later will be exposed and everyone can see it. Friends will start avoiding them and they will end up with no organisation and customers because no one will trust them.<br><br>On the otherside of the equation, if you believe in your products and have a genuine concern to share the products because you really beieve it is good, then that is sincereity. With this mindset, won't it be nice that you can help people live healthier and yet earn an income?<br><br>As for the retrenched and unemployed, isn't this an opportunity for them to make some income until they find a job?  The other alternative for them is to worry when is their next meal. That is if they still want one when they are successful.<br><br>As I said earlier, not all will succeed. Most just earn a couple of hundreds and the very hard working earns a few thousands. A small percentage earn huge income. I know some of them personally. The effort you put in determines the outcome of your success. So I am not advocating money can drop from the sky. That will not happen.
