My bulk of SUCCESS is defined by work that I like and family and friends around me.<br><br>Please enlighten me... anyone??? </div></blockquote>I know how you feel, I felt the same when I started. You know what I found?<br><br>This is my own business. That means I am a businessman. You will agree that most if not all businesses start of with the premises of creating profit and wealth. Is that greed? If it is, we shoudn't be working for bosses cos they are greedy and by working for them, we are ammasing more $$$ to feed his greed, don't you agree?<br><br>Your arguments on contrbution to economy is perfectly sound, so I'll leave the discussion at that.<br><br>Also, if you have read my earlier postings, most people only make a few hundred and some a few thousands per month. Your effort determines your paycheck. It is hard work to earn in the thousands category. A few do become millionaires. For the rest, why deprive them of an income especially in this bad times?<br><br>That is same with any business and companies. Most will just languish or make some decent income. A few businesses will turn big time, many will be gone in a few years, won't they?<br><br>As for friends, if they are not interested in the business, so be it. If they want to become your customers, that will be great. As long as you do not misrepresent and are indeed doing work such as selling and looking for distributors but do not pester, why should you lose friends if you are making an honest living?<br><br>I look at it this way, just because I am earning a living trying to sell a product to a friend, or thinks he can make a good partner therefore inviting him to be my distributor and if he is not interested, fine. We can still be friends can't we? But if he stopped being my friend just because I thought of him to do a business or buying my product to make my living, then perhaps, he is not my friend in the first place. For if he is really my friend, he would at least give me an ear and if not suitable, can simply decline. Or if he does not want to listen to what I've got to say, then say so and that is fine too.That's what friends are supposed to be, encouraging one another isn't it?<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by blurblop (edited 31 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by -^WinG^-:</div><div class="quote_body">Yea...i was approached by my friend too.... I went for their so-called "discussion-talk" and the way they describe things were so tempting...on how money can be earned even if I dont make a single sale, provided that those ppl under me are making sales. The earlier i join the less saturated the market is and i can be one of the pioneers and therefore get more chances to earn more money. And if i hit a certain amt of sales i get to have a car...a choice of either a mercades or BWM...paid for by the company. They even pasted a monthly pay check of some guy on the cabinet....which was ard $19000. All these by selling some kind of MAGNETIC MATTRESS which costs abt $1000+. You dont have to buy the mattress to be able to join them but they give you this crap saying that if you buy the mattress yourself, you will have product confidence and in the future while making a sale you would sell with conviction. And by buying that mattress I would also be bringing health to myself.<br>I was really tempted by the way how much money could be earned but had not much confidence on the product itself. Didnt really believe that it will work out. One of my friend bought the mattress and right now it is lying somewhere in her house.</div></blockquote>I bet you are referring to ASAYO company right?<br><br></div>
