            <div class='col-md body'>Course: Modern American History<br><br>Topic: The Watergate Crisis<br><br>Outcomes: Political Systems, Understandings and Attitudes<br><br>Teacher Background:<br><br>Students should recognize that following World War II, the office of the American presidency gained power. The Watergate crisis called attention to how this power could be abused. An examination of this crisis also clearly defines the concept of separation of power and guarantee of a free press. Students should develop an appreciation for the democratic processes and justice that have increased in the U.S. Constitution. The description of the Watergate crisis should include an analysis of the following:<br><br>The crimes the Nixon administration committed as well as the specific laws the President himself violated<br>Justification of the Presidential pardon issued by Gerald Ford<br>Review laws passed to curtail Presidential power after the Watergate crisis<br><br>Description of Sample Activities:<br><br>1. Students should review the impeachment process as outlined in the Constitution.<br><br>2. Have students construct a Watergate time line that depicts how the events unfolded.<br><br>3. Divide the class into research groups and have each group investigate testimony before Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Practices. Have students construct an abbreviated reenactment of the hearings. (Using the file)<br><br>4. Review the case of  United States vs. Nixon (1974). Using the jigsaw strategy, break students into four groups and have each group answer one of the following questions:<br><br>a. Under what circumstances might executive privilege have been properly asserted?<br>b. Why did the President feel justified in his claim of executive privilege?<br>c. What rights did the Court see as being in opposition to other presidential claims?<br>d. Did the President violate the rights of the individuals whose conversations he taped? If so, what rights were violated and how?<br>Then have various groups share their answers.<br><br>Thoughtful Application:<br><br>After reviewing the events in the Watergate Crisis students should debate and discuss the following:<br><br>What crimes did the Nixon Administration commit and how did Nixon himself violate the law?<br>How serious were these violations of the law in your opinion?<br>What might be the long-term consequences of the Watergate crisis?<br>Do you agree with President Ford's decision to pardon Nixon? Why or why not?<br>What punishment do you think Nixon deserves?<br>Evaluate the Presidency of Nixon, citing both his accomplishments and his shortcomings.<br>o List several laws that Congress passed after Watergate in an attempt to curb Presidential power.<br>a Analyze some of the effects of Watergate on Americans' trust of their government.<br><br>Resources:<br><br>American Odyssey, Ch. 21, Sec. 3<br>American Odyssey. Supreme Court Case Study #11, pages 30-32<br><br></div>
