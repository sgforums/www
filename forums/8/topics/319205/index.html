              <p>Q1: How can media such as news, radio, movie has impact on violence in youth ?</p>
              <p>I think all kinds of media can somehow hace impact on youth Violence. For example, some movies contain violance and sexual content, and our youths may learn the wrong things if they don't know to differentshade the right and wrong in these types of movies. For the radio, the problem only lies with the channels which plays modern Engligh songs which may contain words of vulgar. Our newspapers and TV news programmes are controlled by the government so there no problem with the news. I don't know weather the internet is classified as the media by you, but I must say that the internet is the most serious type of media that has impact on youth violence. In the internet, you can find all kinds of information, people and there are many things that you can do. In the internet, you can also find information telling you to fight. This is where they are thought the wrong values.</p>
              <p>Q2: What are some ways that this problem can be solved?</p>
              <p>I think the only way to solve this problem is to instill the right values in our teenagers. Also, we need to control the media to teach them the right values. However, I feel that some teenagers are violent because they do not have a purpose in life. What we need to let them have is a purpose in life. I also think there is another reason contributing to teenage violence, which is because our teenagers are under too much preasure from their studies. Preasure from their studies may give them a hot temper and therefore become violence. Of all, I think we should let them have more exposure to whatever is happening outside. Bring them out of the house or classroom. Let them look at what is happening outside, and make sure they spend their time fruithfully outside by observing, instead of throwing them with worksheets As a teenager myself, I always take every opptunity to observe anything I can, from buses to trains, and how things are managed, whenever I am outside the house. This will possibly let them find their purpose in life. For me, I will want to improve our transport system when I grow up. Somehow, youth violence is related to the culture nowadays. Take a ride on a feeder service on a typical weekday afternoon and you will get what I mean. You will see students playing loud music on their handphones and talking loudly as well. And look at our adults to compare how they behave. Some of our violent youths may have learnt violence from all these. For me, I do not. I am mature enough to type in proper English. While some are not mature enough to do so. We must train them to be mature enough. We should kick their habits of talking loudly and typing in improper English. I can also infer that our youths are inmature from their childishness. Its all related.</p>
              <p>Weather you agree with what I say, I encourage you to share you views on this problem.</p>

              <p>The world is not violent, it is the pples who live in it that are violent, in media, you watch and deal with pples, therefore there tends to be violences. The impact on the youth very much depend on how they interpret such violences and who are guiding them. With the help of a senior person such as their parents, teachers, mentors or lectureres explaining the reason behind such violences, the bad of violences and the deadly result of it, the youth shall understand better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, without such guidances, youths among themselve may hold different perceptions on violences, some taking it as fun and that cruelty and violences is the way is a norm in the society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To solve the problem, as i said earlier, violences is alway there, no way run, adults must therefore be able to explain and let the youth appreciate the existing of bad in violences so that they can avoid it and even if there are expose to it, at least they know the bad impacts of it. And it is also critical for youth to expose to violences in their life with constant guidances, if not they learn nothing and remain childlike thinking even at adult stage (by then the mindset is damn fixed)</p>
