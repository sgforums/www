            <div class='col-md body'>The education standard is not high compared to UK,US Canada, and even some(although few) Australian colleges.  Its the unnecessary vigrous streaming dictating a student's future locally, and too many people competing for too few places.  This is aggravated when the local education system is customized for the country's industrial needs, churning out speciic numbers of professionals in each industry.  While its probably good for the country's economic well-being, it is detrimental to academic functions.<br><br>Note that a Uni of a lower standard does not necessarily mean its easy to get admitted.  The admission criteria for a small school of a lower standard is usually higher than that of a bigger school.<br><br>Please don't use "the rest of ASEAN" as comparison.  If Singapore wants to claim its education system as "world-class" when local degrees are not even internationally-recognised, then benchmark against internationally-recognized institutions.<br>It is ridiculous to compare our standard of living with Japan/US (to show that its not really that expensive to stay in Singapore), and THEN compare our wage-levels with countries like Indonesia (to show that Singaporeans are "rich").<br><br>[This message has been edited by delerium (edited 03 January 2002).]</div>

This is to ensure that those who are admitted have covered the fundamentals in their diploma courses to meet the requirement of the university programs.

            <div class='col-md body'>Poly vs. JC.<br><br>Poly is considered as tertiary education while JC is not.  A primary objective of the poly path is to prepare one for a career, not further studies.  That is why where jobs are concerned, poly students have an edge.<br>But that does not mean poly students are superior academically.<br>There is no way to compare A levels results and poly results.  An 'A' levels diploma is internationally recognized while a poly diploma is not, although a poly diploma has an advantage in the industry.<br>On the other hand, the strength of the poly path is also its weakness.  Study materials are often cut and trimmed for the poly student's specific specialization.  This is not good for a student with further education as a primary objective.  In contrast, an A level student may be much stronger in foundation.<br>As an example, try comparing the standard of math between a poly engineering student and a jc student who took F maths, or maybe even just C.  Again, compare a typical poly student majoring in business with a JC student who took C Maths.<br></div>

My advice is go for oversea degree to take as short as possible the time to obtain your degree instead of wasting 1 more years in any field that you are taking in local uni.<br>Time is money. Esp for guys, don't forget you still need to waste your time for NS.

            <div class='col-md body'>Apparently, you are equating stress-level and difficulty to get into a local tertiary institution with "standard", while I am referring to the overall quality and performance of students who undergone the education system.  From my point of view, difficulty to score in an exam does not necessarily imply a student's capability, although it is an extremely convenient but flawed way to gauge one's performance.<br><br>I would disagree that "people like to employ poly grads because they know that the grads will be able to work a Grad's work with a lower salary".  A poly grad can never replace a Univ grad where work of specific skills are concerned.  Most of the time, poly grads assist the univ grad in a small part of the overall project, of which the univ grad put his focus on, instead of the smaller details.  Its similar to the difference between an engineer and a technician.  Perhaps that was not what you meant, and granted that, I would say that a poly grad is able to do part of what a univ grad can do, and with less skills involved in the nature of work, a lower cost is naturally incurred by the employer.  But since we are comparing A level students with Poly students here, and not poly grads vs. univ grads, poly grads, unlike A level grads, who have undergone tertiary education that prepares them for a career would of course have the advantage where the industry is concerned.  AÂ’ level students are prepared for univ studies, and are not trained in skills needed in any specific industry.<br><br>As IÂ’ve mentioned, it is inappropriate to compare the results of a Poly student to that of a JC student.  An A-grade for one may mean nothing to another, while a C in oneÂ’s subject may be superior to anotherÂ’s B.  Furthermore, poly students go through a modular system, unlike AÂ’ level students sitting for a major cumulative exam.  Generally, JC takes in the best of the OÂ’ levels crop, and the best compete against the best.  Under these conditions, a higher difficulty in scoring is inevitable.  Of course, there are exceptions where one eligible for JC chooses the Poly route, but where OÂ’ level results is concerned, JC students are generally considered as cream of the crop.<br><br>Needless to say, Univ syllabus is mainly a continuation of JC syllabus.  What is already covered in JC will mostly not be covered again in Univ.  What will be done at most is merely a brief revision.  Which is more difficult?  To learn and absorb something you have never seen before, or to do a review of something which you have previously learnt before, even though you have only earned a C or D grade?<br><br># of overseas students is again, irrelevant to the standard of education, unless you mean difficulty in getting an Â‘AÂ’ grade.  It merely introduces more competition and the international students here generally outperform the local students.  Even if you get an overall Â‘CÂ’ grade in a top school, you can still be superior and perform better than another student getting As in a 3rd rated school.  ThatÂ’s what I mean by standard of education.<br><br>Â“Â…and the best thing is that when we have graduated from overseas uni..the government never fail to make it a point to tell us that singapore is where we belong and that it is our 'mission' to come back to singapore to work and contribute to her economyÂ…Â”<br><br>I donÂ’t see how this is relevant to the main topic, but the above is a policy more relevant to the countryÂ’s economy, rather than academic.  And need I say that Singapore is only interested in its economic growth, ruthlessly passing judgment and categorizing students according to its own industrial needs, rather than focus on the studentÂ’s personal and academic development?  In fact, IÂ’m not even surprised when most of our very own Â“local talentsÂ” overseas decide not to come back.  Even as an employee, you get more respect and room for improvement overseas.  Why be a 2nd-class citizen here when you can get better treatment as a 2nd-class citizen overseas?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Doom, i understand your dismay over the educational system in singapore. But your dismay i think is only restricted to certain practical faculties like engineering or accounting business related field and not applicable to those more academic related faculties e.g. Science, Art, NIE etc etc.<br><br>I was a JC student making the way up to engineer fac in the University. And i really think our JC stuff are mostly useless compared to what those poly student had learned and hence i had the same feeling as you why poly student are restricted when you can see lots of JC students as well as foreigner making their way into those faculty. Those who perform are mostly poly grad who have more practical knowledge than us. So personally, if you are into engineering path, poly education will be a stronger foundation. However unless you become MPs, guess you can't change how our "wonderful" educational system in singapore work cos it's mostly controlled.<br><br>And guess that's why lots of students choose the JC path to at least step into the University front door only to be stepped down by those cream (foreigner + poly grad).<br><br>One advice, since the local university don accept you, go for oversea degree which take shorter time and somemore it can defer NS. You had wasted 2.5 years to lag you somemore. Why waste time struggling in local uni for 1 extra years?</div>

They are classified as 1st class citizen by the government no matter how cock-up they are. Mind your word lar, you only a 2nd class citizen.

            <div class='col-md body'>You like many others are quick to ascertain the superiority of nus and ntu without giving any leeway for the yet to be established 4th uni to prove otherwise.A false mirage is already created even before it starts churning out grads so all i'm asking is for evaluation of these grads before passing such unsubstantiated judgements.<br><br>Prejudice or not,these are far from the motives of the government for setting up the 4U.One foremost reason would be to accommodate these poly grads so that an overseas education would be redundant and it would help these grads save the money meant for an education elsewhere.<br>Secondly,but most fundamental,poly grads can further their education to study materials on par with the rest of the unis.Simple as that.<br>Thirdly,more grads would do well for singapore's economy in the near future.It's purely national interest too.<br><br>Many ppl have been led astray by thinking that the 4U is here to do away with prejudice.4U is here to open new local doors previously unattainable by poly grads.It equalises the ground on academic qualifications.Out there on the playing field would be out of 4U's concern.It is not here to compete with the other unis on standing.<br>You all like to pose the usual "two job candidates" analogy so let me contribute one of my own too.Would you rather see a poly-grad compete with an nus-uni student or would you rather see a poly-uni student compete with an nus-uni student?The government is tring to provide more grounds of fair competition and i know that prejudice can never be done any with.But is there any harm in stepping up standards rather than to leave things as they are now?<br></div>

Poly grad will have a stronger foundation. JC student had to work harder like shit just to catch up with them with most Eng knowledge. E.g. C programming which is the most essential, JC student started knowing nothing of it at all.<br>Electronic subject, JC student know only Op-amp and they thought they are king. The only JC subject that offer an advantage is F-Math but then Poly grad have their Engineering<br>Math.<br><br>Let me depict a few cases, B4 University, i have a bright senior in JC who indulged himself alot with electronic stuff but in the end, when i entered U, i saw him struggling and retaking most of his engineering subject. In class, i can only see mostly foreigner student or sometime poly grad doing their assignment and asking the lecturer questions. What about those JC student?

Personally this is what i think. The govt is not interested in how individuals like us feel. We are just tools to them to maintain the economical statistics of singapore. When the local talent pool cannot meet the statistic, they turn to foreign talents. Then they notice more and more local graduate going oversea. Well, some might ask why should they care about this phenomenon anyway, they can get in more foreign talent in to replace them and hence branding them 1st class. However, suddently, they notice that our local population is diminishing and hence they started to worry. Shortage of cheap labour for NS become a serious problem for them too cos which foreign talent will ever commit themselve to get citizenship? Who among them would be so stupid to volunteer for NS? Now they want local to stay in singapore.<br><br>So the main idea is think of yourself as tools to help our father to keep singapore prosperous and stop complaining unless you have mean to work and survive oversea. that's my points.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Kyo23:</div><div class="quote_body"> I agreed. Personally this is what i think. The govt is not interested in how individuals like us feel. We are just tools to them to maintain the economical statistics of singapore. When the local talent pool cannot meet the statistic, they turn to foreign talents. Then they notice more and more local graduate going oversea. Well, some might ask why should they care about this phenomenon anyway, they can get in more foreign talent in to replace them and hence branding them 1st class. However, suddently, they notice that our local population is diminishing and hence they started to worry. Shortage of cheap labour for NS become a serious problem for them too cos which foreign talent will ever commit themselve to get citizenship? Who among them would be so stupid to volunteer for NS? Now they want local to stay in singapore.<br><br>So the main idea is think of yourself as tools to help our father to keep singapore prosperous and stop complaining unless you have mean to work and survive oversea. that's my points.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>Precisly ...one of the things that i would like to grumble out from this is that...hope the governemt will realise one day that there are no lack of local talents in singapore...and there is not really a great need to have so much dependance in foreign talents...i may be missing the mains points abt getting foreign talents here..but if our own country is going to feed and have great dependence on outsiders..where are we going to stand??</div>

We are standing at the reserve ground to be called when the country need us but to be neglected at normal time. We stand as the once named "Reservist Personnel" which is now being change name to NSmen. That's where we stand supposingly looking proud  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> . At least you got a place to stand in singapore without being totally replaced by foreign talent, not bad right?
