            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe the reason you have not seen any hot-blooded Singaporean males is because there are none left ? I am not kidding....<br><br>I would say Westerners tend to be more big-sized, hunky and altogether more "hot-blooded" as you call it. I would suggest going down to Boat Quay if you really want to see some hot-blooded males.<br><br>All the best for your search !<br><br>[This message has been edited by musicwhiz (edited 24-10-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay so maybe hot-blooded was rather misleading.<br><br>As every open-minded, sensible person has said, girls need not have the sterotypical long hair, 36-24-36 figure to be deemed attractive. Likewise for males. And frankly, the big-sized, hunky thing dosen't really do much for me. But of course, one woman's meat is another one's poison.<br><br>S'porean men are on equal or greater footing with Western males in terms of attractiveness. And definitely more intelligent. OK, so that's subjective. But I just think so.<br><br>All we're lacking is confidence. The average Westerner's confidence is definitely higher than our kind. Maybe we shld thicken our skin a little, not get so discouraged when we're shot down and Voila!<br><br>It's not as easy as that, but I think it helps.<br><br>S'porean women are not stupid. At least those who are a worth a damn. A bad line from a white guy is still a bad line.<br><br>Fine, so I've gone off tangent on the looks bit. But I think we've moved on to why Western males are perceived as more attractive.<br><br>(Feeling pretty disturbed talking about being male in the first person.)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Also, I think that it is more than just the percieved looks of the westerners...A lot of ASians, not just Singaporeans (ie, Thai, Filipino, etc..) are attracted to western men.  A lot of time it's this idea that Western men have more clout than local men.  But...I think that it drives a bit deeper than that.  It is also this perception that they are more "exotic", if I may use the word.  They're different from what's around.  The whole idea of meeting a guy from a different culture and engaging in that person's culture is intoxicating to a lot of people.<br><br>Like I said, it doesn't just apply to Sinagporean women.  It happens the world over.  I mean, why is it that everyone loves Japanese things and lifestyles so much.  It falls into the same idea.   Granted, many women, and some men do go for the $$$(ka-ching!!) part.<br><br>I read somewhere (many times actually), that a lot of women here find the local men quite immature compared to their western counterparts.  Maybe someone would like to clarify this.  True or not?  Or just a misconception.<br><br>Western Men aren't all empty in the membrane.:-)  or else they wouldn't be here in the first place.  It's just that when they get here, they have have this urge to live out this fantasy of conquering the asian female.  I'll tell u why.<br><br>During my sociaology lessons in U (States), we touched upon the subject of which race men and women were more attracted to.  They actually did a survey in the States about this.  It was a long time ago so I can't remember the details well, but it goes like this:<br><br>1. Black males:  Majority prefer asian women to their own race or any other race due to the percieved exotic quality that is the stigma of the asian woman.<br><br>2. White males:  Majority prefer Asian females for exactly the same reason as above.<br><br>3. Asian males: Overwhelming majority would prefer to stick to their own race for exactly that reason...stick to their own race...Asian values?<br><br>4. Mexican/Spanish males: yep, u guessed it.  Asian girls, but not as high a percentage as the first three.<br><br>Westerners (not all mind u) have this perception that asian women are submissive and all that crap :-P  Don't we wish.<br>It is probably due to the hollywood portrayal of the japanese Geisha that stuck the poor asian women with this curse.<br><br>As a result (on the admittance of many expats), xpats here like to live out this fantasy that they grew up believing.  It's the exact same kind of perception we have that Western men have bigger cocks than asian ones...but then again that one is true..so wrong example, but u get what I mean.  And it definately doesn't make them better than us in any way.  They do have other qualities that the Singaporean men can have but aren't willing to accept.  They are more open-minded and worldly than a lot of local men.  They also have more world experience because they grew up in societies which aren't insulated.  For thos who understand, experience grows from ...well, experiencing things.  Basically, there's not much to experience in terms of life experiences here.  That's why the majority of guy talk is centered around NS here.<br><br>I think that it's also wrong to say that Singaporean men are smarter than their western counterparts.  They may be more studious.  There is no doubt about that.  Hands down, Singaporeans are more studious.  It's how they actually use what they know that makes the difference.  I feel that westerners are more willing to make use of what little or (many) things they do know to achieve something.  There's a feeling of fear and apprehension for a lot of local guys to do the same thing.  Society is to blame...gov also, and a bit of that asian value holds them back in a way.<br><br>Ok, I hope that it wasn't too biased for anyone in particular.  Let me just close by saying that you can't really fairly compare people.  If we were to list down everything good and bad, we would probably get the same amount for both sides.  In the end, ...What is your preference.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since Firewire has contributed so much to the richness of the forum, I'd just like to take this opportunity to thank him for his openness and willingness to contribute his ideas....<br><br>Anyway, just wanna ask something (to him and rest of the world)....<br><br>Since Firewire claims that Asian women are the hot property of most other races in the world, then where does that leave the males then ? Any idea about what females think is the most interesting race in terms of men ?<br><br>The way I see it is as such:<br><br>SINGAPOREAN men like Asian women and foreign women (because of the Hollywood syndrome) but to settle down it should preferably be an Asian woman.<br><br>SINGAPOREAN women prefer western men because of the aforementioned reasons...case closed..<br><br>FOREIGN women probably don't see much in local guys because of our narrow-mindedness, closedness and inability to experience more and articulate ourselves better (maybe because of our political structure and upbringing ? I am not sure)<br><br>FOREIGN men like Asian women (submissive image) and also their own counterparts the FOREIGN women, as also mentioned in Firewire's "article".....<br><br>Therefore, concluding this little discussion, this would indicate that....SINGAPOREAN men basically have nothing going for them at all !<br><br>Would someone like to clarify this position for me please ? (You may like to add in the element of the SPG - Sarong Party Girl in your reply....)<br><br>Cheers !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry about that, I meant to put in the womens lustings also, but I seem to have forgotten.  It's my screen.  Stupid 17 " isn't supposed to go to such a high resolution(1280 X 1024), so the refresh rate is really low.  It's killin' me brain cells cap'tn (siad lin the same manner as the guy from engineering in the original star trek series).<br><br>Anyway here's the really depressing thing.  Before I write it, I'd like to say that even though this study is confirmed by many universities in the states, we shouldn't feel too bad about it...man, little consolation right. :-p<br><br>This was a nationwide survey, so it would be quite accurate.  I don't know about asia but I would have to assume that it would be the same here as there.<br><br>1. Black women: Overwhelming majority would rather stick to their own race.  For reasons that I would have to generalise.  they are usually far bigger and taller than any other race of men except their own or white men.<br><br>2. White women: their preferences are split between their own race and black men.  With the majority prefferring their own race.<br><br>3. Other minority women(Spanish,etc...): Would prefer black men or either stick to theri own race.<br><br>4. Asian women: (this is the one we've been waiting for people)-By in large, a good number of asian females prefer black guys in the States. Some still stick to their own racial groups.<br><br>Why do black guys favor so well most of the categorie?  When we did this study, the conclussion was that it was all based on perceptions built around certain races by ...whover or whatever medium.<br>Black men are seen as bigger, stronger, faster, more athletic, more macho, thus more handsome than any race.  the facts are slear in this case though.  By in large, most black males are really ..big.  no argument and a lot look like they were built from granite.  U just need to look at the number of black males playing sports and u'll see what I mean.  Black people are a minority, but why are there so many who are so good at sports?<br><br>All in all though, Musicwhiz is correct in his assumptions.  ASian women do prefer caucasians because of any number of reasons.  In the West, the Blacks and whites are being chased after.  In ASia, a lot of asian women like white men.<br><br>Asian men scored very low because of the way asian men are percieved.  Whether it's right or wrong is up to u to decide, but this is the perception...and I would have to say, some of it is true.<br><br>Asian men are seen as being very possessive of their spouses.  Once they get them, the wife totally must be submissive for his every whim.  They don't allow their spouses to go anywhere or do anything without their say so. Doesn't sound very nice does it?<br><br>asian men are too conservative and lack the open-mindedness to accept new ideas or situations.  they're seen as always using values from thousands of years ago and trying to apply it in the same way in todays world.<br><br>Asian men are seen as domineering, money-hungry, profeesionals who care little about how the family is raised and such.  He takes very little participation in the upbringing of his children and loves and devoteds his time to his work and friends.<br><br>Asian men are seen as insensitive louts who care little about what women think or feel.  They are usually very cold to their wives.  Wives are seen as property...the list goes on.<br><br>The Big thing is that Asian men are seen as selfish in bed also.  They care only about their own happiness.  Basically the women are just their to serve his penile pleasures.<br>Definately asain men will have a mistress and prone to cheating.  A lot are seen as abusive also.<br><br>Now, These are extreme views right.  I list them to give everyone a better idea of all the different perceptions of the asian male.  Now, we know that we aren't all like that.  Even the ones that are aren't so extreme, but this is the strength of perceptions.  It's a very powerful thing that attaches itself to all unfortunate asian men and just doesn't let go.<br><br>that's not to say that other males aren't like this also, but for some strange reason, it's noticed on a situation by situation basis.  The same way most people see that India is a romatic place to bring your loved ones.   It's....strange y'know.<br><br>It's a crushing blow to our men..I know because I feel it's self-esteem shattering.  It shattered me before and it still shatters me to read the figures.  but thank God that a great deal of women still want to stay within their own race or else there will be 2 billion single asian men walking aimlessly around their version of Sim Lim looking for pirated XXX CDs...<br><br>aw c'mon u guys, u know what I'm talking about.:-)  Don't<br><br>...or else we'll end up with a race of gay asian men.  Oh God!!!<br><br>I'm sure u women must be tickled silly...:-)<br><br>I hope all u guys out there don't take this survey to heart.  After all it was done 5 or 10 years ago....not much help though, is it?<br><br>P.S.-<br>I don't mean to, and I hope that I don't stir up any racial tensions here. I for one am against racism and would hate for people to take what I have written as an objective piece based on a study and turn it into firewood for racial bashing.  I hope we can restrain ourselves and keep things civil for the sake of everyone else.  Thanks for understanding....<br></div>
