Now no one fight with them, so they torture us with the show again cos they also know they got no good shows to fill in the gap.<br><br>And what talking you about Singapore no news? Ya I agree S'pore is a small country but other world news ley? I used to be spoilt for choice between Ch8 news and ch U news cos they have different interesting stuff and methods of broadcasting. Last time, even if both channels got the same news, they would do it up in different interesting manners. Now cheebye the news are exact duplicates. AND WHAT TOKING YOU "<span style="font-style: italic;">last time Ch U news many clips are the same</span>"?! YOU WILL LEND YOUR PRODUCTS TO YOUR RIVALS ONE AH? Please la the clips of ch8 and ch U were NOT THE SAME then!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>New variety progs in April? What? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ?<br>The fastest relief to those already-farked-up ch8 variety shows is to telecast popular taiwanese varieties like "Shi Zi Lu Kou" and "Guess Guess Guess". But what did mediacock do? Chopped them! And where are the nice Ch U varieties like "Star-struck" and "Street Wise", just to name a few? Axed!! And please la - Mediacock please chase the "Liang Family" out. The Huan Le Dian Feng only accentuate, or misappropriately represents how low-class we Singaporeans are. Mark Lee best host? Ya right just use that as a gauge for our TV standards. And that Sharon Aw - I think she is a has-been and had maxed out her peak long time ago. Just look at how jialat she is now in some nonsense variety with that Chen Tai Ming and the other dunno-who. You want to talk about Ch8 varieties? Please don as they are the worst!!! PUI !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>And one thing: Whether monopoly or not, or whether Ch U is economically unviable or not has no bearing on the quality of the programs that we should see. As the monopoly, Mediacock has all the more reasons and responsibility to provide Singaporeans with high-quality programs.<br><br>Show me stuff, and I shall retract my words. But as of right now, Mediacock sucks like mad and its artistes, except for a few, a low-class BIG TIME! And my poor English-illiterate mum is still watching "Wheel of Fortune" at 7pm.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have to admit Mediacopr shows kinda suck. The local sitcoms are made due to lower cost. There are not much quality shows at all. Their so called blockbuster movies are a mere repetition of the same show mths ago. I mean now they r showing lost world, how many times have they shown that? Even when singapore played in the semifinal of the tiger cup, it was showing delayed!!! instead of a live!!! An international channel was showing it live. Our home country is playing and not shown live,  how stupid is that? CH 8 is no better. The local sitcoms storyline is highly predictable. Can't they produce shows that make users want to watch for the sake of watching? I mean most ppl watch such sitcoms is becos they have no other shows to watch, not that they r gd watsoever.</div>
