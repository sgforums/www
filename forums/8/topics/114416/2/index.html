            <div class='col-md body'>Why mediacock dramas suck?<br><br>!stly, its not that s'pore has no gd artists... seriously i think actors all over are the same. TVB frequently make highly entertaining serial by using all the second, third rate actors--- eg. Virtues of Harmony<br>There are a no of seriously decent actors... eg. Hong Huifang, Zheng Geping, Zhu Houren, Xiang Yun. But except maybe 4 Huang wenyong or xiangyun, most of the veterans are reduced to some ka-leh-fei roles.<br><br>2ndly, i think the theme songs of local serial sucks. when was the last time anyone remembered a memorable song of local drama??? Holland V, Double happiness or the one showing now?<br>Hardly anyone rite? The recent theme songs are characteristically weird &amp; forgettable.<br>Though TVB has lots of artists who can sing decently, eg Gallen Lo, Flora Chan, they still "outsourced" many theme songs to professional like Jacky Cheung, Hacken Lee &amp; Eason Chan. Many serial theme songs are fav in KTV too...<br>I still remembered the recently ended show with Zoe Tay as a gangster.... the theme song was so bad (think she sang it), i switched channel upon hearing it..<br>Are they supporting talents?? Even then, can always outsourced the songs to the likes of Stephanie Sun, Kit chan or Cai Chunjia rite?? they gotta accept the fact that most of their Ah ge Ah Jie can't sing for nuts.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you all have been working for quite some time such rivalry and tactics are part and parcel of the working world. Think of all ways and means to push your competitor out of the market. And in some time the strategy they used actually has an impact on their paying customers. For this case, it is obvious but because of the few players in market, we customers can hardly complain too.<br><br>Turn to SCV? Hahahha.... maybe the battle among them will benefit Starhub most? Note Starhub also quite smart company an exclusive broadcasting deal with the sports channel actually deter other competitor entering their turf.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've suscribed to SCV for the last 5 years so the collapse of channel u and the poor quality of mediacorpse doesn't really bother me at all, there's far better quality programmes on cable(I love tvb dramas on channel 55) anyway(at a fee, of course) and the flexible schedules allow to me catch a programme later in the day or week if I miss it the first time. Only about 5 to 10 percent of my TV time is spent watching local channels(and that was mostly the channel u variety shows)</div>
