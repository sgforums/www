            <div class='col-md body'>I wish to bring to the attention of all Zoe Tay's fans, the other side of her character. She is not as charming and friendly as you all see. In fact as a small time TV actress she acted as if she is a big movie star. Why did I said this? Well when she first started as an actress of TCS she acted so snobbish that many fans of hers gave up supporting her. She was asked to pick a postcard from a lucky draw in a TV show and to read out the winner's name. She picked a card but refused to read the name (which happened to be written in English). She said that she cannot read English. How could she do that! She studied English as a first language in school so how could she be so proud that she refused to read in English. She thought that being a Chinese speaking actress she should not read English.<br>This incident has been in my mind till today and I will not have any respect for her until she explain why was she so snobbish, being only a TV actress. I watched the programme with my non Chinese friends and I felt so embarrassed by her action.<br>A lesson for her to learn is to be humble even though you are famous. Just look at Fann Wong. See how far has she gone. To Hollywood in fact. And you Zoe Tay, is still looking for new offers.<br>I hope that someday I will have the opportunity to approach her and ask her personally this question. If you are reading this mail,Mdm Zoe perhaps you may wish to answer me, or maybe you cant read English too.<br><br>From Bob Teoh</div>

And even a bigger joke to think it's a great discovery. And for that you're making a big topic to laugh at Zoe Tay. You're so childish. Your hatred for her is unfounded for. You're pretty sick, childish and you're awfully just another "I hate Zoe Tay because she makes Fann weak" type of TV fan. Grow up. Only teenagers will really do those type of "My idol is number 1 in the world" and "I'll always support you" crap.<br><br>If you think she's an eyesore, just don't look at her and don't watch her drama series. Don't be an insolent brat and whine about it. You seriously haven't got enough sense in you, do you? Wake up. Stop your nonsense. If you think that's funny, I think you're sick.<br><br>Last words: Grow UP and stop acting like a boar.</div>
