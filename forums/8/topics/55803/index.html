            <div class='col-md body'>The following story is just a fiction created for entertaining purpose only, do not take it too seriously.<br><br>Â“Hi, my name is Beng, Seah Lan Beng.Â”<br><br>Â“Hi, my name is Meng, Chee Hong Meng.Â”<br><br>Most of you will wonder, is there any secret agent like James Bond in Singapore. Well, wonder no more, for my partner and me is here to clear your doubt. You can really consider us the Singapore version of 007, but things are not what you had expected. Hey, get a grip, we have a very much different culture, you canÂ’t expect us to be a gentlemen and save the world at the same time. Sometime doing the right thing is not doing the right thing, donÂ’t understand nevermind, I also donÂ’t understand too. Got that from the movie SWAT and thought it is kind of cool to use Chim words to confuse other and made them look stupid even your own self also donÂ’t know what that is all about. DonÂ’t waste any more time lah! Let our story begin. It begin after our BMT lor, when we were posted to our mother unit to receive our ACT. The location is highly classified, I can tell you where is it, but I will have to kill you after that. But I can still tell you that we always Ta Bao the most famous Lasi Lemak for lunch and see a lot of Half Carrot during the weekend.<br><br>SGT Chua: Â“Cao Privates! DonÂ’t think you can climb over my head just because I look cute to you. You are here to suffer, you are here to serve you country, you are here to take all the shit from me. BMT had made a man out of a boy, now ACT will made a superman out of a man. You can call me Sergent or you can call me Snake, but you can never address me by my surname, because my surname is reserve for my kaki and you will never be my kaki in your whole god damn miserable life.Â”<br><br>Yes, that is our Sergent Snake, he think that he play Metal Gear Solid made him tough enough to be call Snake, but what really made him a Snake is because he always eat snake. He is our superior for the next one and a half year of our miserable NS life, and he is right about not able to be his kaki because the highest rank we ever get is CPL only. So let skip another three months our misery and proceed on to our glamourous life of secret agent men.<br><br>Â“Wah Meng! Where got people ride TZR nowadays? You see even people like me start riding NSR already ah.Â”<br><br>Â“Wah Liew! Ah Huey always want this want that and I always have to pay for it, I am a ladies man mah, you think I so rich meh? If I got the money, I buy one Aprilla liao.Â”<br><br>Â“I really pity you ah! Look at me, happy happy only then go and look for my Ah Lian, not happy only, kick her one side and Bo Hiew ah. Frankly speaking hor, if I got the money, I will go an buy one Civil ah, got rooftop is always better mah.Â”<br><br>Â“DonÂ’t talk so much lah, Chua activate us back this bloody Sunday for what, I am suppose to go JB and enjoy myself you know?Â”<br><br>Â“I also donÂ’t know leh, but the storeman told be something about another bomb threat at Changi Airport.Â”<br><br>Â“Wah Liew! How many time we went there already? Everytime also cannot find any shit, waste my bloody Sunday ah.Â”<br><br>Â“Hey, you two maggots! Still stand there talk cock for what, get ready to move out.Â”<br><br>Â“Yes, Sergent!Â”<br><br>To be continued Â…<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
