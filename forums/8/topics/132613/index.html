The Public Service Commission (PSC) has investigated the issue and Mr Chua Cheng Zhan has given us his explanation.<br><br>PSC does not condone the making of racist comments by its scholars. It views this matter seriously and has issued a letter of reprimand to Mr Chua. We note that Mr Chua has taken full responsibility for the comments made on his personal blog and has apologised publicly for his insensitive remarks.<br><br>We would like to take this opportunity to remind all PSC scholars to conduct themselves in a manner becoming of holders of a PSC scholarship at all times.<br><br>Choo Lee See (Mrs)<br>Director, Public Service<br>Commission Secretariat<br>For Secretary,<br>Public Service Commission</div>
