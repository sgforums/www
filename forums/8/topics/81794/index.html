            <div class='col-md body'>Religions often promises people a good life after death. For example for Christians after they die they go to heaven to be with their God. But have those religious people ever thought for a moment. People fight wars mostly for freedom and death is often see as a form of relief a path to freedom at last. But if there is really God/Allah or whatever higher beings people believe in, after that according to their respective beliefs won't they be living under the govern of those higher beings? If that is so is true freedom being realised? Isn't it better to be a wandering ghost floating around carefreely with no restrictions and boundaries?<br><br>And for those very religious people, for example my mother is a Christian and she sees God as the most powerful being just like many other Christians and if I am not wrong the Muslims sees Allah as the most powerful being. Have they ever wondered if these powerful beings do exist, who created them and who created the even more powerful higher beings that created theirs? If we look at it these way, the Gods don't really seem as powerful anymore.<br><br>For me I don't know what I believe in. Sometimes, I prefer to think that the so called Big Bang did happen eons ago but if that is so who or what created the Big Bang? Other times, I prefer to think that everything is a cycle. Perphaps we can look this way, we'll start from our time.<br><br>From what we know many years ago dinosaurs roamed the lands but what came before dinosaurs? And if dinosaurs are overgrowned lizards could they have evolved from the small lizards we see now and then in our house? There is no reason for them to evolve to become weaker?<br><br>Take this example:<br><br>Technology becomes more and more advanced and pests like flies, lizard, mosquitoes, rodents, etc. are being wiped out more and more so they evolve to counter technology and because of that they wipe out the human race and because without humans to grow food and stuff they all starve to death after sometime and micro-organism and bacterias that contained human DNA evolved again and the human race are borned again...<br><br>Perphaps this cycle might be going on and on for all we know.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

For example the blood, the meat the dinosaur eaten or maybe the bones lying around.</div>
