            <div class='col-md body'>Living in Vancouver, Canada for a few years, I could perhaps tell you something about the place. Canada's goverment is very generous to its citizens. If you are out of job, they will give you money to support yourself. Vancouver is also alot like asia, because of the hongkong and taiwan population. There is a town, Richmond,the chinese population is so great there that canadaian are the "visitors".<br>Canada is also voted one of the best places to live. They give you free Medi care. The average life expectancy is like 85 years old for gals, and 82 for guys. (somehting like that) the people here are very friendly also.  The recerational facilities is also great.. skiing, boating, ectect... cars are also cheap here. When I went to settle in US, i found it different. The palce was dirty, and there was quite alot of rasism. the people arn't too friendly either. I can't tell you about UK cause the last time i been there was when i was 3!!! hehe.. hope this helps   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Forget to add... Vancouver rains alot, so... if you are the type that hates the rain,err<br>but vancouver has mild winter, so no need to be afraid!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Sianz man!!!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Sianz Guy (edited 03-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm studying in Australia, which isn't one of your choices, but do let me say something of my experience in staying in a western country.<br><br>Australia seems on the surface to be able to cater well for people from all races, but somehow, in my field however, I feel that the best places will not be taken by non whites. To achieve something here you need to be good ( as usual) and it helps if you are white. Thats my perception. I'll welcome other views.<br><br>Also, I feel that its very difficult for an Asian (I assume you are Asian) to get along at a deeper level with locals. The exceptions are Asians born here. They seem to have no problem getting along with other local. I don't think its racism acting here, rather, just our very different backgrounds, like humour, language, things we find interesting, values etc. They are by no means unfriendly. They are VERY friendly, most of them. Its just that after some time you would long to be able to call someone your good friend rather than remain as people-you-know.<br><br>Personally I think it would be pointless to migrate somewhere just to hide in the local chinatown. If you want, I really encourage you to get to know the locals. I think thats part of migrating to another country.<br><br>I'm a pessimist. If you are looking for somewhere you want to belong, then I think you probably won't find it. Your kids will though. But if you just want a pleasant environment to retire and spend your fortune in, then there are lots of places.</div>

Pls if anyone can tell me anything....<br><br>Another side issue(asking for a fren lah...), what is the cost of studying Psychology in Aust, US, Canada and UK? My fren wud like to know... I guess you'll have to include the course fee and the living cost also... and any hidden cost?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there Bochap... i'm new here and i couldn't resist answering u're question u have on UK. i'm on my first year here in UK and i dunt have too much of a good impression. The place here is not too bad (except for the freaking weather!!) but i can't say the same for people here. i have lived in Australia b4 and i think is one of the greatest country to live in around. People down under are really nice and warm ....really make u feel welcomed even as a fellow citizen(in my opinion) ..... but here in UK, the color of u're skin really makes a huge difference esp if u have to find employment. I guess they can't really accept the fact dat their former colonial servants are looking for the same jobs as they are in the same country! I dunt think the other countries mentioned are as bad as wat is going on here. Not sure if Luf would agree wif me?? As wat Luf said is true...there is this feeling of 2nd class citizen... and always will be i feel!S'pore is still the best...its our homeland after all. These are just my personal opinions Bochap.......cheers mate!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being in Vancouver is like not being in Canada at all, with so many HKers who drive you crazy and the grass at Hastings. And the freaking rain, I dun mind the rain in SIngapore, but the rain in Vancouver + the 0-10Â°C...<br><br>That is why I got sick of Vancouver and move to somewhere more "Canadian", Dawson Creek, with less opportunity to meet Asians, you have to be with locals. But warn you, be prepared to face -40Â°C weather. This is not a place for the weather-freaks in Vancouver. Snow gets as high as yourself.<br><br>I have been in Dawson Creek for 15 years now, but I never regretted my decision to leave Vancouver.<br><br>Anyway, Medicare is not totally free, you have to pay $36 per month. And I find it quite useless as I only used it twice.<br><br>If you are thinking of migrating, get $$$ first. Not only $$$, have the skills, it is hard to find jobs here. Despite the antidiscrimation laws, ppl can still go pass the nook and cranny of the laws to hire locals than foreigners.<br><br>Oh yes, get ready to have around 30-60% of your pay swiped by the government. Unlike, Singapore, you dun get back what you contributed. With the baby-boomers retiring, get ready to have huge chunk of your pay swiped too.<br><br>GST is 7%, and in BC, there would be another 7% "GST" called PST. So it is 14%. Some other parts of canada charges from 7% to 22%.<br><br>Moreover, it's hard for you to get "cheap solutions", e.g. pirated cds, etc.<br><br>Expect yourself doing most of the home repairs, a plumber having to come to your place just to fixed a minor leak cost me $150.<br><br>Other then that, you will realize that this is somewhat a real democracy. Oh well, you pay more tax, so you get more democracy. hehe.<br><br>Why do you want to migrate? Not happy with home is it? Come here and stay here, you will miss what's back home.<br><br>Well, I go back to Singapore every 1-2 years, because I can't stand being home-sick.</div>

Moreover, they dun give much.<br><br>oh yes, you can only get what you have paid in Employment Insurance.<br><br>so that's that... it is not so GREAT after all.<br><br>but people are generally friendlier and more considerate in comparision to other countries in the "South".<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, just to post my 2 cents worth of thoughts....earlier on in April, i spent a month on Toronto, Canada visiting friends and just touring ard....no offence to pple living there but that place has NO identity of its own.......it's like a mini Taiwan mini HK mini Vietnam everywhere!~!~!it's like.....7 out of 10 people walking on the streets are Asian....and it's gonna get worse cos from what i read in the newspapers recently....Canada is easing immigration for Asians......oh well....i think Canada for study is alil too far...although it is much cheaper than US....and the standards are much higher than that of Australia....no doubt it has a peaceful environment....<br>but Canada being so close to Alaska is a killer during winter and early spring....<br>to me...TOronto's like a retirement city....no nightlife.(unless u count the karaoke joints)......like if i ask u what u think of when i mention Toronto....er...nothing rite...???<br>oh well....<br>no offences to Toronto-ites</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Suzi,<br><br>well.. it seems to be the "culture" of ppl here to stay at home at night.<br>but Toronto could not be boring man, it is the biggest city in Canada and you expect it to be boring?<br><br>I think i know why.. maybe your frens din want to bring you to places that are happening enuff. Since their perception of happening places would mean dangerous places. No offence.<br><br>Having no identity of itself is one reason I left metropolitan areas like TOronto and Vancouver. I am currently in a more "canadian" environment. it is only then i realise what a true canadian lifestyle means -- slacking. Haha ah well, somehow the laid-back lifestyle would prevent me from getting heart-attacks. hehe<br><br>next time, try to explore canada if you have a month to boot. really, you will really enjoy the sights of Canada. dun take aeroplane of course, try their trains and buses. that's where you get the scenery.<br><br>till then.<br><br>bochup.. you know how to do the Â° already?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't like that leh. The standard in Australia is not that bad right? I wouldn't know. This is the only place I have studied outside Singapore. As far as tertiary institutions go, its pretty good in New South Wales. But I accept the fact that some place specialize in some areas, like MIT in US.<br><br>Like I said earlier, if you want to migrate just to hide among your own people, I don't see the point. Thats what you are seeing in a lot of overseas countries at the moment. Even in Sydney, when you go to the suburbs near Universities, all you see are Indonesians, HKers, Malaysians, Taiwanese. The "locals" stay in other suburbs. If you go to the more rural places you get a higher percentage of native Australians as well as the AngloSaxon Australians. Majority of migrants tend to cluster around the larger cities I think.<br><br>I suppose there is nothing wrong with that. Its a comfort thing. In larger countries like, any other country other than Singapore, you'll get concentrations of different races in certain areas.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is no racism in Canada?  BULLSHIT!  If there are racisms in US, UK, Singapore and everywhere in the world, Canada is no exception.  So don't give me that bullshit stories that Canadians are friendly and they are no racists.<br><br>I have been living here in Vancouver Canada for almost entire part of my life - been through high school, university and am have been working for the past five years.  So, again, don't tell me that bullshit there is no racism.<br><br>In places like Kelowna where Rinoa lives and Dawson Creek were Ponder lives, there are few colour people.  So there are less racism.  If you live Toronto and Vancouver long enough like me, you know racism does exist in Canada.  If you have been reading enough newspapers or dealing with those white people, racism is there.  What's the big fuss about those Chinese people smuggled here from China?  Those white people have been complaining and said they should be sent back to China.  Why?  Just because they are yellow skins and don't speak English?  A few years ago, a Russian family was ordered deported by Immigration Canada.  Those white people were protesting saying they should stay.  Why?  Just because they are white skins, blond hair and blue eyes.  That's not racism; tell me what the fuck is that?<br><br>I fucking hate the media for painting a bad picture about Asian immigrants.  If one person commits a crimes and is of Asian descent, it will make it to the headline on the newspaper and sound as if all Asian immigrants are criminals.  And it goes on and say how Canada immigration policy should change.  For the past few years, many of the immigrants are of Asian descents; and obviously, those white people felt threatend and have been protesting to the Canadian government to tightened its immigration policy (changes include English speaking iimigrants only).  Fuck! That's not racism, then what the fuck is that?<br><br>I have experience it myself and saw it myself.  I have seen Chinese people getting bullied because they don't speak English.  Fucking pissed me off!  I have stood up for my own race at one time at a parking lot where this Chinese lady was bullied by this white person.  I almost got into a fight with that person, but mostly were verbal exchange. He called me a chink first and I called him a white trash.  I am dissapointed that no Chinese would come and saying soemthing back to that fucking asshole.<br><br>So if you don't like Singapore that much, you are not fit to call yourself a Singaporean.  What a shame that Singaporeans are looking down at their country.  Just because you can't protest on the street and can't chew gum, that's not democratic.  Did you see what happen to those protesters at the WTO demonstartion in Seattle.  They got kicked and pepper sprayed; and you call that democratic.  BULLSHIT!<br><br>Also, for those that can't stand Hong Kongers and must move to Dawson Creek a more white area, then you must be one of those Chinese that would not stand up for your own race if you ever see one of your race got bullied.<br>How do you expect us Asians to be strong if we are not united?  Think about it!<br><br>That's all for now!</div>
