            <div class='col-md body'>Posting this fm home... sick today, so staying at home...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Money&amp;Power, cool it man... everybody hv priority, and if yours is being patriotic to your own country, thats your own free will and nobody will meddle with your affair.<br><br>For me, my priority is freedom, and I certainly do not see either my country(Malaysia) or your country(S'pore) giving me that! And yes, u got my nationality wrong... no problem though, I dun see too much diff between the 2 countries...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And talking about standing up for fellow asians, I believe I will do it, even though I've not met with such situations before... but then we hv to see who is wrong also lah! Like last time when I stayed with my uncle in Sydney, he used to tell me that many of the vietnamese there are trouble makers(not becos they like it, but becos they couldn't find job... guess its another part of racism...), thus quite dangerous at night in their area.<br><br>You know why I prefer freedom to security? In those places where there are freedom, you can stand up and blast the govt when you feel that they did wrong, and in these freaking SEA countries, try that and I probably won't see you tomorrow... And you probably did not know how strict the systems are in these countries since you've lived almost your entire life in Canada. Come to think of it, since you do not like that place, why are you still living there anyway? Are u a singaporean?<br><br>Anyway, I think many singaporeans can't relate themselves to the country more due to history and culture, or rather the lack of it... and the govt do not really take care to cut down the cost on necessities like medical cost, housing cost, etc... and when your people can't afford things in the country, they start thinking is the country(or govt) really taking care of its people? And in future, you'll see that most people who are in s'pore are more or less very affluent, cos they can afford it, and those who cannot afford it will probably try to move out... then whats the talk about loyalty when you can't even afford to stay in your own country?<br><br>Â°C  haha... got it! thanks ponders for the detailed help, and hui-neng for suggesting to use numberpad. Tell you whats the problem... as I was using a laptop in the office, the numberpad was not easily accessible, thus always using numberings in normal keyboard.<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>It does not matter where I come from. I am not a Singaporean.  I stayed here because if one day I say to the Singaporean or Malaysian government, "I would like to immigrate to your country, would you accept me?" They would answer with a No!<br><br>Ok you can stand on the street and shout your lungs out that the government sucks, does it change a thing?  No! It's like me sitting here here venting to you that we Asians are discriminated against by these people, does it change the whole situation? No!<br><br>Ya! You think that the western govenrment are taking care of its people? Whoever tell you those things or wahtever sources you read are bullshits.  It's all our tax money that get incorporates into all these stuff.  There are no free stuff in the world.  The Canadian government has been wasting billions billions of dollars on shits that do not benefit us.  We are taxed to death in Canada.  Are they cutting costs?  You tell me!  So there are no such things as free medicare and the Canadian governement is damn fucking uselss and broke to fix the fucking screwed up finance of the country.  Ther are no such thing as low cost housing in Canada.  You see street people who sleep on the street and beg for money.  You call this taking care of its people?  BULLSHIT!<br><br>Are they much more affluent than us?  So many locals here have not even been in a new car in entire their lives. The avarage age of cars in Canada is 7.8 years old.  This can't be an indication that the westerners are well off than a typical Asian living in countries like Singapore.<br><br>Worst yet, so much of the tax dollars have been wasted on those fucking lazy bums who are constantly on welfare.  If you open up the classified ads in the newspapers, there are jobs everywhere.  FREE LUNCH!  Fuck that! Like Lee Kwan Yew said, no free lunch!  That's one of the reasons why Singapore is one of global power house and its taxes are lower than those in most western countries.<br><br>So it is not affordable to stay in Singapore, then it must be affordable to stay in Canada then. BULLSHIT! A case in point, my Singaporean friend family used to have a house in Singapore.  After moving to Vancouver, they realized the houses here are so damn expensive that they have to rent. And none of their family members are driving new cars -- all of their cars they drive are more ten years old.  Are they better off moving here?  You tell me!  Don't talk to me about loyalty!<br><br>In countries like Canada and the US, the gaps between the rich and the poor are getting biger and bigger.  So you tell me that this problem only exist in Singapore?  You think people in western countries get afford the whole world?<br><br>The point is that the grass everywhere are the same. No such as thing as greener grass here!  And the shits everywhere smell the same! Meaning, the shits of westerners do not smell better than the Asians'.<br><br></div>

I do NOT like the controlled feeling in SEA countries and you do not like many things in Canada.

I dunno the cost of a house, but in S'pore, in the least prime area, to get a HDB flat of 90sqm, u probably got to pay around S$150K... what the cost of a 90sqm house in Canada? U probably dun find a hse so small in Canada huh...?  and remember, I said least prime area... it can hardly be cheaper than S$150K.<br><br>I really liked to know your nationality... mind to tell me?

            <div class='col-md body'>Money and Power:<br><br>Before I start let me just say that I'm asking the following questions sincerely, because I don't know the answer. I'm not trying to blast people from other races or help any politicians. I'll also say up front that I am a Singaporean Chinese.<br><br>Having studied in Australia for some years, the problems that creep up here are really very similar to that in Canada, assuming that you are using that as a reference. Recently as well, they are having the same problems with illegal immigrants coming via boats, and people are saying the authorities should deport them straight away instead of wasting time giving them shelter, medical  help, etc etc. The thing is, I would say I have to agree because they ARE illegal. You can't expect people to land in your country like that and you allow them to stay permenantly. I know if someone came to my home like that I would kick them out. The point of deporting them ASAP is to dispense with the need to house them long term and create the problem of messy legal issues. Many other people like that have been able to use Australia tax payers money to sue the government because they were held too long "without reason", although I'm not sure of the outcome. The bottom line is, lots of money has to be spent, and sad to say, that is a finite resource. If I were Australian I would want them to have humane treatment, but not have my hand bitten like that.<br><br>Other examples include the famed political party that stirred up a lot of racial issues recently. One of the things they wanted to implement was compulsory english speaking ability for immigrants. Now, I'm asking this seriously: why is that a bad idea? Take it that I'm too dumb to think of an answer. I'd appreciate some explanation on why that would not be good.<br><br>You also mentioned social security given to lazy bums. That just emphasizes the point about money, even though I would like to see that it doesn't play a part in social problems, has to be factored in.<br><br>So, basically what I'm trying to say is:<br><br>1) Some of the reasons that the politicians or newspaper give might be valid, some might not. Its not a simple thing to decide upon, and I don't have the answer. I just would like your opinion. I would be guilty of thinking that I have the right method of tackling the problem, and its easy to sound politically correct, but I know I can be wrong. When you are bombarded with pseudo correct answers from newspapers and other publications, it makes it even harder to see whats really happening.<br><br>2) Sure there is racism. Just talking about it won't work, but I'm trying to find some sound arguments so I can speak up when I can.<br><br>I realize that Money and Power just cooled down, so I'll just say againthat I'm asking these questions seriously, not just to blast anyone. I would be REALLY interested in anyones real opinion.<br><br>I have also other things to ask, but I'll see how this goes first.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I won't get into too deep about the issue with people smuggled in here.   If those people smuggled here were whites, and similarly they are using the taxpayers' money  for shelters, legal expenses, I don't think it would cause such a fuss.  It's just because they were Chinese. People were using those "using tax payers' money" as a great excuse for them to be sent back.  Remember the Russian family that I talking about.  They don't speak a word of English, and they are using taxpayers' money while they were here, and people protest to the government saying they should stay and not deported.  Even the newspaper said if they were not blond hair and blue eyes, would they receive so much sympathy from the public.  If this isn't an issue with race, maybe you can tell me what make it so diiferent from those Chinese. I don't care if people came here illegally or legally, because most of those people that came here will eventually contribute back to the country by taking up jobs that no locals would want to take.<br><br>Many years ago, many of the immigrants were from different parts of Europe that do not speak English.  You don't see the public asking the government to make English a must criteria before immigrants can come in.  Only in recent years that Asians were the dominant immigrants, and obvioulsly not all are fluent in English.  And all of a sudden, you see the public asking the government to make it as a compulsory.  Why was it not asked before to make English as a compulsory language when many of the immigrants were whites that do not speak English?<br><br>Cars here are cheaper, no doubt.  You don't have to tell me how much they cost in Singapore and Malaysia.  I know!  However, they never seem to be affordable.  By the time a large chunk of your paycheques go to the government, you do not have much left over.  You can buy a Mercedes here for C$38,000 or S$36,000.  It's cheap by comparison, sure, and you should come here and see how many of those cars are on the street.  Hardly ever.  If you don't believe me, you should come here and take a look that most cars here are old.  You still get ten over years old car on the road.  Why?  Not only income tax you have to pay, you have to pay property taxes, provincial sales tax, good and services tax, and all other taxes will leave you with only 37-40 cents left in your pocket for every dollar you make.<br><br>I got to go!  Come back later!<br></div>

THings are more expensive in the east.<br><br>basically... you are looking at about CAD $1800-3000 per month, everything included.<br>This $1200 range depends on your lifestyle and uni you are going to.<br><br>It's whether you want to live alone (more expensive), or sharing with somebody. Type of food you eat, whether you want to cook for yourself or "dabao" everyday.<br><br>The biggest portion of the cost is usually the rent and Tuition fees. Rent is anywhere from $250 to $850. Cheap means old house, less facilities, pay your own utilities. Expensive means the opposite, but mostly you still have to pay you own utilities.<br><br>Tuition fees depends on the Uni. Lets focus on the 2 unis in Vancouver. One charges around $250 per credit hour (SFU). The other charges around $410 (UBC). This is international student tuition (locals pay around $75). A student is considered full time upon taking 12-15 credit hours per semester.<br><br>Movies $5-10 (depending on theatre and day)<br>Bus $75-150 per month (unlimited)<br>Groceries at least $100/mth<br>Petrol $0.60/ltr (average but rising fast)<br>Telephone $25/mth<br>Cable $35<br>Insurance $36<br>Internet $10-50<br>Electricity $40 (year-round average expect up to $100 during winter)<br>Water (hmm not too sure, but it is flat rate)<br><br>Girlfriend (depending on how happy you want her to be)  heheheheeheh<br><br>well. that's about it...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Toronto is a nice place to live in. You'll enjoy it in here. I didn't really bother to read the past few messages about racism. But having lived here for 3 yrs, I find them extremely friendly people. The group of people you mix with is critical of course.<br>Anyways Toronto is the place to be in, business hub of Canada. Great hockey team and rising basketball team. Beautiful history. You'll enjoy Toronto.<br><br>------------------<br>PIKA PIKA</div>
