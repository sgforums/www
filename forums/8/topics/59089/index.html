            <div class='col-md body'>After that recent turmoil surrounding Rio Ferdinand's fiasco(geez, he forgotten to take test? wtf?)... came latest news that Owen will not be match fit for England's cruncher against Turkey. Likely who will lead England's assault against the Turks is anybody's guess.<br><br>The New Paper says Rooney and Beattie. I likened this suggestion too. Beattie is clever on the knock-downs and use well on his aerial prowess. Rooney is not a out and out striker but his pace and technique can cause mayhem in the Turk's quarters. The only concern abt Rooney is his temperament but I'll say let his feet do the talking!<br><br>The other contenders are (sadly lacking any true out &amp; out center-forwards) Heskey &amp; Vassell. Sorely need the predatory instincts of Alan Shearer.<br><br>Who do you ppl think who should partner who?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's right, they have to win this one else they have to pull it off at the playoffs and that's not very wise to do.<br><br>Ferdinand has made a mistake but was punished even before the charges against him are made. So the English FA is in the wrong end too. But then again, like what X-men said, boycotting the game is not the end of the story. As professionals donning the National jersey, they should put behind the fiasco and rallied together to win this one.<br><br>With all the distractions, the omission of the two impt players &amp; a difficult opposition... England has loads to pull this one thru. If they do so with positive results... it'll set a positive tone about their Euro campaign.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
