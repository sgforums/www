            <div class='col-md body'>I think singapore's problem of greying population is due to government fault and mistake in planning. Just when they thought they can get more than 25% foreigner into singapore as substitute for shortage of labour force in singapore to boost the economic, they din consider the problem that this virtual increase in population will bring. First of all is the overcrowding, then the increase in standard of living, increased price of daily necessities. all this make it hard for local citizen to breath. everyone had to work very hard to keep up with the pace of urbanisation. Gradually everyone become workaholic, result orientated and materialistic. Where got the time to settle down and start a family.<br><br>Furthermore, the government had not considered the educational gap that keep widening between the sexes in singapore. The number of female graduate outnumbered the male. More and more woman become superior to man. how come? Some say that's because of NS if you read Today paper 15 Mar. NSmen lost their educational zeal after NS and where got the drive to attain high educational level? i guess the thinking of male after NS is that they are getting old for learning. Brain starting to rust after all the tekan, foot drill, tought training etc in the army camp. i was once in that stage, it take some time for me to revert back to study mode. Some of my friends cannot make it. they can no longer memorize and understand what the book is trying to teach them. Most of wat is learned is forgotten. anyone else agree?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's common sense to save up enough money to hopefully last you till your old age and i agree that not ALL the laws the government made has been "best for the country". But think about it.. had it not been for most of the laws, Singapore wouldn't have been what she is today. If other countries can praise our country and for example how clean (due to all those laws that help keep singapore clean such as your $500 fines)she is, shouldn't we as Singaporeans be proud?<br>What's the point of voting for your ministers,etc if you keep doubting them? Tell you what.. forget about all your medisafe and CPF as they are only government policies... there must be something doubtful about it.... right??<br>What about our education system.. ooh gosh.. it's under the ministry of education.. oso under the government... hmm.. i guess i should doubt them too ....<br>I guess HDB's are unsafe.. afterall they are government housing right? Better doubt it.<br></div>
