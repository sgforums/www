            <div class='col-md body'>This was quoted :<br><br>LKY has already said so on many occasions-:<br><br>The place of a woman is in the kitchen.<br>Now that you let the woman out of the kitchen, you are opening<br>PANDORA's box.<br>So many women has higher degrees at the Masters and PhDs'<br>level that very few men can match up to.<br>They are not keen to marry men with " O " or " A " levels.<br>Besides, the males serve extra years in the National Service and that virtually<br>exhausted their energy for looking for a mate.<br>So that is why we have the "singlehood" problem.<br>Unfortunately, LKY knows the problem but does not have the solution.<br>Something was done through "social engineering" to try to rectify this trend<br>but to no avail.<br><br>Personally i think in overall, the standard of living in singapore is getting high. The more educated lots tend to produce less offspring. Pple either have no time and too busy with work or simply cannot find a suitable partner. Furthermore, there's the gap between both sex in education level. the males have to waste extra years for serving NS. They become way behind the female in term of establishment. Some might argue back and stress the importance of the extra years for serving NS. however, they never did any survey to ask the guys whether they gain or lose more through the extra years in NS. With the extra years incurred, guy graduated later in term of age, at 25+ some might still continue further their study while the rest will join the work force to earn a living and start saving up to settle down in the future. however, at such a late starting point of their working career, they have to strive hard to catch up with the girl's standard. Furthermore, everything is expensive in singapore. Huge loan had to be obtained to get married early. Who would want to incur such loan? Tentatively, most choose to settle down late and give less offspring due to the great burden of having child in singapore. These are personal opinion.

            <div class='col-md body'>there's a hard question posted above. Well, personally i still think the problem all started with the high standard of living in singapore where everything is so expensive to own e.g flat, car etc etc.<br>any educated lady in singapore holding a Phd would want to marry a Bus driver in such a world? of course this is the extreme case. However, even for a couple who is thinking of marrying each other would have to think twice in singapore under the financial constraint. They have to get ready their CPF at least to buy a flat which cost like a bomb compared to neighbouring country. you can forget about the owning a car if you cannot even afford to pay off the COE which is non existence in other country.<br>The unrealistically high standards of sg women and the extremely low standards demonstrated by sg men may partly be due to the education race between both sex with the male lagging behind partly due to extra commitment like NS as i pointed out b4.<br><br>------------------<br>Simon<br>aka Kyo</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>These were extracted :<br>--------------------------------------------<br>SINGAPORE'S rapidly growing population, now through the four million threshold, faced the problem of a rising "sink" factor -- single income, no kids, officials warned Friday.<br>A huge influx of foreigners who now make up one in four people in Singapore boosted the population, according to new statistics which highlight the city-state's concerns over falling fertility rates and a greying population.<br><br>One in three Singaporeans in their early 30s is single, up from one in four 10 years ago.<br><br>"We expected the prevalence of singles to be the same or slightly higher, but we didn't expect this magnitude," chief statistician Paul Cheung told reporters.<br><br>In recent months the Singapore government has unveiled a raft of measures to generate a baby boom as the birth rate fell below 1.5 children per woman, well down on the 2.1 figure deemed necessary to replace the population.<br><br>Sweeteners have ranged from monetary incentives to have more than one child to flexible work hours so couples can spend more time together.<br><br>There is also a plan to build more university hotels, to encourage students to interact with the opposite sex.<br><br>But academics were sceptical about the success of such policies in halting a trend towards a burgeoning number of elderly with no family support network.<br><br>"Singlehood is a function of modernisation and urbanisation. And there is nothing much that government can do to arrest this," political scientist Ho Khai Leong told the Straits Times newspaper.<br><br>Statistics released on August 31 put the Singapore population at 4,017,733, up almost one million on the 3,047,132 head count of 10 years ago.<br><br>The non-resident population more than doubled over that period to 18.8 percent of the population.<br><br>There was also a sharp jump in the number of permanent residents, leaving Singapore citizens to account for less than 75 percent of the population.<br><br>In his recent National Day address, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong described the high number of unmarried women and the small families of those who are married as "grave problems," and said Singapore needed to prop up its talent pool with foreigners.<br><br>Sociologist Paulin Straughan argued that if the young remain unmarried "they may be able to prepare financially for the day they have to check into a home, but for Singapore to continue we have to have a next generation to develop the society."<br><br>From the above article, we can see we have only left with less than 75% singaporean in singapore currently and this is still going downhill. Sooner or later, singapore will be covered by mostly foreign worker and elderly with no family to support them.<br>--------------------------------------------<br>Yes, the government cannot "promote romance" but what i think the government should do is to provide more incentive for local pple in workplace and other domestic area and stop getting in foreign worker as substitute. Singapore got crowded bcos of them. Incentive like highly subsidised HDB housing price for singaporean so that our people won't be pressurised by the home loan etc etc and have no worry in settling down to generate our next generation. The government is either not wise enuff to recognise the root of the problem or they simply don't want to do for some financial reason. So the result for the future of singapore is that it will no longer be a home to singaporean but just a working place for foreigner to come and earn some good buck back home. Wise foreigner will retain their PR status cos if you ask yourself if you are a foreigner working in singapore. Would you buy A flat or A car in singapore or a condo or many cars in malaysia or india?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by the Bear:</div><div class="quote_body">i think the "low birth rate" thing is nuts... why in God's name do they want more people in Singapore? we have supposedly 3.5 million now and everywhere is like giant moshpits... and they want 5 million?<br><br>maybe the ministers and brainiac administrators should stop being driven around in their huge cars and take public transport for a couple of months and see where the hell they are going to squeeze another 40% worth of people into the already overcrowded trains and buses...<br><br>maybe we should have more single people...<br><br>still sickens me that they think they can "promote romance".. look what happened to the Courtesy Campaign <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div></blockquote>------------------<br>Simon<br>aka Kyo</div>
