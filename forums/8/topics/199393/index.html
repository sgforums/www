            <div class='col-md body'>So what is the purpose of life. with safety, prolonging life, obtaining sex, intimacy and gaining knowledge in mind, you simply spend your life and it all ends with death.<br><br>In some cases, death can be prevented. Whether it is by time traveling or aging preventing, if it is achieved, it would be best. You have to thus plan to achieve this aim.<br><br>Putting aside the issue of death, we look at life itself. It is simply the summation of everyday of our life. a point to be noted in life is suffering. Everybody has some differences in their life encounters. Some are lucky, some are not. This is because human body is exposed to pain when it is injured. There, in accidents, crimes or misfortunes, some people will live with excruciating pain.<br><br>It is a bad thing that pain and sufferings exists but we have to accept it. that is the way life is characterized.<br><br>Putting aside the issue of suffering, we come to see how we should spend our life during normal period of our life. A common advice is to have a wide variety of interest in life and form good relationships with people. This will ensure that you have make full use of your life. forming good relationship and wide interest in different activities has to be learnt. That is why I have emphasized on the importance of knowledge. Its application in life is unlimited.<br><br>For work, it is primarily used for earning a living and saving for retirement. Whenever your money is used up, you have to come out of retirement and work again. The correct attitude towards work is to treat it like a hobby. Communicating with boss, planning with your colleague and writing proposals are all a kind of pastimes. Because people are sometimes nervous in their work, they fail to notice that work is also a form of hobby.<br><br>We must not work all the time because the nature of work is very narrow because it will always be based on some company aim. Outside work is a more interesting place called life and the whole world. Work on your life in this world because it is the biggest and thus most interesting work it is going to be.<br><br>Life is made up of parts. The twenty minutes spent on a chess game, the half an hour you spent in the park are what life is about. Do things that are pleasurable to your body. Remember that pleasure can come in all size and shapes. It may be the pleasure of cuddling your girlfriend, the pleasure of learning new language or the just simply enjoying a funny show. Again, these things have to be learnt, studied and researched.<br><br>life is also reality. And in reality, there is war, sickness, death, torture, gangsters and accidents. Sometimes, these things happen to you or your family and the only solution is to accept it. in Buddhism, it teaches us to not to react with fear and nervous towards these bad things because they are facts of life. one phrase sums it all, Â“in the middle of the storm you sits and observe and run if you need to.Â”<br><br>Our suffering also comes from our wrong personality and attitudes. Human is born to be erroneous and inefficient. Therefore, we should carve out a piece of our time from work, play and family for ourselves. Only when you have become a great person will your work, playing and family can also be great too. All of us have many rooms for improvement and we have been leaving them in the closets for so long that we never dare to open it.<br><br>Lastly, life events is transient. You spent time laughing with your friends yesterday but as you sit alone in your room, you could not go back to happy moment again. Some people may thus dread life because things are transient in life. they want permanent things and are lazy having to work for happiness. Again, I know that it is bad that we could not stop time in fun times but we must not be disappointed by it. again, acceptance is the key.<br><br>Also, life needs to be planned from now all the way to the day you die. All life insurance always talk about the financial management in your entire life to death so it also true for other aspects of your life like your goals, relationships, yourself and your activities. Because it is so big, it is a very large plan indeed and it is revised regularly. What you do today, and in the coming few weeks is connected to your whole life, so donÂ’t just lived each day as it comes.<br><br>With all the above advices, you live, you live happily, knowing that you can control some things and not others. However, if bad things befall, which it can only to you and you only if you are unlucky enough, you have to accept it and just live as best as your situation allows you to. Death will pick you up one day unless, you found a way to skip past it.<br><br>There is most likely to have no god, no heaven and afterlife. If you believe and spend your time doing things to achieve it, suit you. decide for yourself think for yourself. for me, I have no found any concrete evidence for these few things so I shall just focus all my energy on life itself.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
