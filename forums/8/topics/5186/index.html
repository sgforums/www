Now, it's frowned upon for people to have sex or start a family at a really young age. But back at my parents time, it was quite normal, even encouraged. Somehow, people believed in having lots of children and that the earlier you start the better.<br><br>I know this sounds like a crazy thaing to do for a 18 year old. But her children all turned out okie. All four of us went to Uni. And we're relatively normal.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the issue is still "Should teenagers have sex?" rather than "Should we have sex outside marriage?".<br><br>No matter what, even if you're married, having kids when you're 18 and below is really tough. My parents struggled very hard in their early years even though things are OK now. And to their credit, they worked hard to keep everything together. Not every story turns out like this though. Personally, I won't choose the same path as my mum.<br><br>BTW, it's still an offence for an older woman to have sex with an underaged guy. Do you remember the case of a 34 year old US teacher who had sex with her 13 year old student? She became pregnant with his child and was brought to court. It was big news some time back.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On the legal side of things, the matter which we have to deal with is 'consent'.<br>If the girl is above 16, then she has a right under the law to consent to sexual intercourse. 16 is the age of consent and 18, the age of refusal.<br>So it really doesn't matter if the guy is under 16. And having sex with 16 year olds comes under the category of 'statutory rape'.So even if she says 'yes' it cuts no ice with the judge.<br>One more thing: defence. You can always argue that the girl deceived you into thinking that she was above 16. And having sex with a minor under the influence of alcohol never is a mitigating factor. Same as hitting a guy when you're drunk...no excuse.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Who is this Alvin_K guy?  I wonder if he is the same guy that I knew as a friend a long time ago.  The reason that I ask is that he is so much like my friend whose is name is also Alvin K_ _; that is, talking rocks (girls wearing strapeless bras to attracts guys) and asking weired question like this one.</div>
