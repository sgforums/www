It is primarily meant to be a Reference Library, not a Lending Library. This means that the collection inside is of reference quality, and should not be lent out in the first place.<br><br>In a way this library caters to the more "serious" crowd, people who genuinely need information. Thats why the Lending Section is in the Basement. This seperates the more casual and "loud" crowd from thronging the Reference Section.<br><br>The reason why NLB went with such a library is because the old Stamford Road Library is simply not big enough to cater to all the books that NLB wishes to put up for reference. At that time, they had a lot of good books and no place to shelve them, in the end most were placed at the closed stacks at Changi. This is not a recent development, the physical shortcomings of the old Stamford building surfaced many years ago.</div>

I want to borrow a few books. All were stored in warehouse and i had to 'reserve' them ( costing me SGD1.55)<br><br>they should remove the white elephant books and put more books for people to browse through and gain knowledge.<br><br>note: i'm not saying that it's not good to display in public but i think the location is damn wrong.. putting it in musuem will be better place.</div>
