            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : More than a thousand people complained last year to the Consumers Association (CASE) about receiving unsolicited sales calls from companies.<br><br>Telemarketers used hard sell tactics to promote their products and irate customers do not understand how these companies obtained their personal particulars.<br><br>CASE says it received 1,032 complaints last year about nuisance calls from telemarketers.<br><br>From January to April this year, it has received around a hundred.<br><br>The usual tactic: consumers say they are told they have won a prize, and then the hard sell starts as callers push their products.<br><br>Many do not understand how callers get their details.<br><br>"Now there are a lot of listings being circulated, with names and mobile number. I supposed they must have bought it over the Internet or other sources and then made the calls," one person speculated.<br><br>"I've got friends who actually work in there kind of places. They say you can actually buy (the details) from events or something," another said.<br><br>One person who received a call from a telemarketer said, "They told me I could get a prize but when I went down, it wasn't the case. So I won't trust them again."<br><br>Channel NewsAsia's news team contacted one such company, which claimed it obtained the information from other companies that held lucky draws; consumers had put in their contact details on coupons.<br><br>Most consumers think such practices should be stopped.<br><br>"This is a business ethics issue. You shouldn't pass on or sell such information to others," said one consumer.<br><br>"Unless a law is passed to prevent such breaches in privacy, otherwise it would be difficult to fix the problem; it's so common," said a second person.<br><br>CASE legal executive Tan Jeh Yaw explained, "There is no specific law at this present moment which restricts such personal information from being given to another unauthorised person."<br><br>So all CASE can do is to give a verbal warning to such companies, and advise consumers not to put too many personal details on lucky draw coupons. - CNA<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also rec'd this kind of calls lately.<br><br>There was this guy who (like the example given above) called me and said that I won the lucky.  Last time Asian Travel Club tried this on me already.  So I asked the guy which lucky draw was that, since I have not been taking part in any of them lately.  He said "Oh it's the previous one previous one."<br><br>Then asked me to collect my prize in town.  The name of the company was something like Empire Cruise (can't really recall).  So I told him that I won't be going, cuz I work far far away from town and always work late.  I also told him that it's because I work so far away, I have not been to town for shopping for the past few months.  So I dunno how he could get my number from lucky draw.<br><br>The guy paiseh.  Dare not pester anymore.<br>But I would say this guy was good, in the way he talked.  He would talk in English and then mix a bit of mandarin.  This usually helps in making him sound sincere.  So I believe he would manage to convince many other people that he called.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i received a call saying that i won a lucky draw and ask me go down to their company to collect present, they called my hp and asked for my mom. I thought it was weird till my friend told me that the hp company may give my info to such companies, which make sense cos my hp is under my mom's name. The best part is when my mom ask them which lucky draw it was, they say its the Jurong area lucky draw.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Starting from...do you like pets? do you have any pets? what kind of pets you have? why do you choose to get that pet? tell me more about your pet? do you also buy this product for your pet? have you had your lunch/dinner? how was your lunch/dinner? what time do you normally get off work? where do you work? how is your workplace? where do you live? do you have a husband/wife/bf/gf? how do you know him/her? how do I contact you after your working hours? okie...want to come out later on after work for dinner? Ask them things like that that are not concern whatever products that they are selling but more into what you want to know about your caller.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>I think after you bombard them with all these queries, they will all definitely feel intimidated or freaked out. But of course...you also need to ignore their questions or just give them a short reply and make sure they answer your questions.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Hmm...too bad for them...but I don't like get nuisance sales calls as well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
