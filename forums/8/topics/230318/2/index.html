Today's the first day, and it already seems to me that i'm making the wrong choice by going to college. I've made up in my mind my future job prospects but it seems irrelevent to be in college studying(or mugging) <strong>for subjects that are not useful(for now it seems) for my future.</strong><br><br>I would also like to go to a U, but it seems harder for poly students to enter. For such a scenario, is it better to mug hard for 2 more years just to enter the U, or go for poly choosing the course that is required for my future job and pray hard that i'll be able to enter the U after my poly?</blockquote>Like what you said the future you see now, those subjects may seems useless, but who can be 100% sure of their future. Take it as a learning experience. Learning more doesn't kill right? Anyway for poly, you have to have outstanding grade to advance easily to U and there's no 100% sure you'll get outstanding grade to advance to U. Project are marked by lecturers mostly bias to those more well known or done something outstanding before.<br><br>Take it from me, i'm a poly grad. Why waste 3 years when u can advance after 2 years of JC?</div>

But the thing i'm worried about is not being able to get into uni with poor A' lvl results, or not being able to get into my desired course in uni. So maybe getting into poly and take up what i'm interested in may be a better choice? or is it?<br>But no one can be sure of the future..</div>
