            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>Foil latecomers - switch to buffet</strong><br><br>By <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PHILIP LEE</span><br><br>COUPLES who declare in their wedding dinner invitation cards that food will be served promptly at 7.30pm know in their hearts this is not going to happen.<br><br>They do not have the guts to do it.<br><br>My bet is this: At 7.30pm, only about half the banquet hall will be filled.<br><br>The hosts would worry that to start dinner without waiting for latecomers might sour the mood of the laggards when they saunter in to see deep-fried chicken or steamed sea bass turning cold on their tables.<br><br>This worry is somewhat ironical. The hosts forget that those who took the trouble to be punctual and have been sitting idly are not exactly in a good mood either.<br><br>So who deserves consideration, the time-conscious souls or the late-comers?<br><br>But really, I donÂ’t see the wedded couple using one of the happiest moments of their lives to teach some guests the folly of tardiness in such a visible way.<br><br>They would worry that the latecomers might think they are being made to lose face in public.<br><br>Which is a reason why this lateness at wedding dinners, a chronic problem the Singapore Kindness Movement is now trying to solve, will be with us for a very long time.<br><br>Those who arrive late must have earlier surmised that since most will be late anyway, why should they be early. They might have been punctual once and found out this did not pay.<br><br>Then, the early ones, twiddling their thumbs waiting and waiting, will vow not to be punctual the next time.<br><br>So the vicious circle is perpetuated.<br><br>Which is why I admire the optimism of the man spearheading the kindness movement, Mr Noel Hon,<br><br>for his unflagging belief that Singaporean diners will one day correct this lapse.<br><br>Mr Hon says there has been some improvement since his punctuality drive started seven years ago. I remember there was another punctuality campaign, started by former MP Ho Kah Leong years earlier Â– and it did not work too well.<br><br>Still, I wish Mr Hon good luck. He needs it.<br><br>All of this, really, brings me to this point: Why have such expensive letÂ’s-all-start-together dinners at all?<br><br>If the purpose is to celebrate the union of two young people as husband and wife, and to mark the linking of two families, in the presence of kith and kin, then such sit-down dinners are not the most ideal.<br><br>First, communication and the getting-to-know-you element are limited around a table of 10 people.<br><br>The formality of the occasion stiffens free and easy mingling.<br><br>We should take a look at the way the Malays here celebrate a wedding. There is a period of about three hours during which dinner is served to guests who arrive at different times.<br><br>The food, usually served to many groups, each comprising four people, will feature five or six tasty dishes per group. Once the team of four finishes, they get up and another group of four comes in. The dining takes about half an hour per group.<br><br>The rest of the time is for social chats, meeting people and posing for photographs with the wedded couple.<br><br>This is what a real celebration should be.<br><br>But Singaporeans, mostly Chinese, who prefer expensive hotels for their dinners, complete with live music, dry ice smoke, torch-bearing waiters and waitresses, usually do this for reasons of face and reputation.<br><br>For newly-weds, most of whom are in their 20s and early 30s, such opulent feasting drains them of their hard-earned savings.<br><br>Their friends also feel the pinch in giving hongbaos which are no small change these days.<br><br>The young guests usually find the majority of the guests to be older people Â– friends and relatives of the families of the newly-weds.<br><br>Some young people I spoke to said they would prefer to have a wedding party with their friends Â– dancing, drinking and some finger food Â– and hold a small dinner with the family members from both sides.<br><br>But as we all know, especially among many Chinese communities, and Indians, too, I am told, this is unlikely to happen. Most parents would have none of it. Many regard such marriages as their big moment, too, not just that of their sons or daughters.<br><br>So perhaps, there can be a compromise Â– hold a buffet dinner at a five-star hotel. It is cheaper, more informal, and still has that touch of class some parents set great store by.<br><br>Most of all, the hosts need not chew their fingernails over latecomers.<br><br>And Mr Hon might find no need to spend so much energy trying to cajole diners to be on time.</blockquote></div>

Too early for dinner.<br><br>Since everyone will turn up at 8pm+. Why not print the invitation cards to say the dinner start at 8:30pm and fabulous cocktail reception awaits for early arrivers from 7:30pm (French wine with escargot snack or calamari. If not sushi also can for the weak stomachs)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  and cut down on the number of dishes and pump the cost into the pre-dinner cocktail reception!<br><br>That will will solve the problem.</div>
