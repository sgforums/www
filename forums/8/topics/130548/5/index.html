            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Weirdo80:</div><div class="quote_body">Why are you not reading the entire post? Are all pro-PAP people selective readers, just like their government? I said give them COMFORTABLE salaries, but not outrageous ones.<br><br>Sheesh! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If you think PAP leaders are scrutinised, then you haven't even seen American or Australian politics. Who dares scruntinise the PAP for fear of being brought to court?<br><br>Also, I would like documentary proof that the MPs work almost 24/7. Hey, I'm a computer programmer, I work like hell and sacrifice my time with family too. I have master degrees from the same unis that the MPs went to. Am I also going to get over a million bucks?!</div></blockquote>I actually DID READ the entire post. The term "comfortable" is relative. Yup, there is no denying that the salary is high. What then really is comfortable base on? Market standard of a mid-level manager, or perhaps a director of a company?<br>I would not even challenge your claim that you have a master degree and work as a computer programmer. So why not take the opportunity to make more money by joining the PAP as an MP? Sorry this is not an invitation, 'cos I do not belong to the party, lest I am misunderstood.<br><br><strong>What's a documentary proof</strong>??? Like a documentary programme on CNN or National Geographic? Oh, you mean DOCUMENTED proof....<br>Don't think they punch clocks if that's what you are referring to. So has it been that all PAP MPs are clean? Of course not... a couple were fired!<br><br>Of course if YOU had read the entire post, you'd realise that I have stated that I am NOT pro-LKY, or for that matter, PAP. So likewise all ANTI PAP people are also very selective on what they read or quote. Don't you agree? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Note my earlier statement that THERE IS NO PERFECT GOVERNMENT. The people have chosen to criticise the government, some criticism are correct while others are just simply bias. A reality check question: all those who criticise LKY and PAP, do you have anything nice to say about them? If the answer is no, we can conclude the dislike is totally emotive and subjective.<br><br>The issue on comparative argument on different styles of government is: writers keep talking about the grass being greener on the other side and laud about how real democracy is in a faraway country. Truth is, there is really NO TRUE DEMOCRACY as there is NO TRUE COMMUNISM either. You can get peeved right here in Singapore as much as people living in the Queens, New York on the US government.<br><br>Anyone thinks that they can make a difference by b-itching about life in a faceless forum is in an extremely delusional state.<br>1. PAP doesn't care<br>2. It's a NATO style commentory - NO ACTION, TALK ONLY. It might inflate one's ego, but that all it does, make a balloon out of someone.<br><br>So, when the sun sets, no point.... and please don't call ever call me pro-PAP.<br>I only give credit where credit is due.<br></div>
