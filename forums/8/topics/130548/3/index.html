Two different things, but you are entitled to your opinion. </blockquote>I feel sad for you.. you are in self-denial..<br><br><blockquote>Well seems that lots of people have already voiced their opinion even though things did not get their way.... it is still not a wayang. Did you ever think that things will forever go in your way just because you said it? Did any senior members of your families said no to you? Was it a wayang too? </blockquote>The stage was set, the play was on, but do you think the audience can choose the scene? comeon, its just a wayang show.. it makes it look good, makes you feel good.. but end of the day, they don't really care about your opinion.. *wake up*<br><br><blockquote>The purpose of not granting the right for demonstration is so that it will not serve as a precedence for demonstration to take place. So you think that by tearing down buildings and overturning cars is a good solution?<br></blockquote>Are you saying other countries likes demonstration? given a choice, nobody likes a demonstration.. but its necessary if the need arises so as to bring out the attention for them to see.. but even that remains hard in singapore.. we are deny the voice as a singaporean, we are not given our rights..<br><br>You people can say whatever you want, but the PAP will do whatever they want!!<br><br><blockquote>No lah... I can always go across the causeway and make these "illegal" purchases.... some of these books are written by obviously anti-LKY people. Of course I agree that the banning is a little paranoia, but I don't think we are so sheltered, after all, hasn't the government been encouraging us to go overseas. I do that, go overseas, I mean, regularly..... and I can tell you first hand that some of these comments and "opinions" are really ridiculous. </blockquote>You refused to answer my question.. instead, twisting and turning just like what PAP are used to.. NOW.. why are those books being BANNED in singapore if some of the contents are indeed ridiculous?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>Eh?? why are you still out here so free. Not in IMH??? Last I heard, impeaching a US president is also quite difficult.... When's the last time someone wants to hold the Singapore government accountable and got identified, arrested made bankrupt etc. Those that got these treatment made statements that they CANNOT prove or found to be FALSE. </blockquote>Tang liang hong and Dr Chee challenged the PAP to have an open debate over some issue on television but was rejected..<br><br>They(PAP) have lost their courage to boast that they are prepared to argue with their opponents publicly on any issue.. WHY the sudden changed of tune?</div>

Say a few ppl apply for leave for the demonstration from a company, how much productive hours lost is that. As well, the government is likely to have the police there for crowd control which comes from who? Us the tax-payers.<br><br>Good for the people? I guess that is very subjective on how this is debated. If you talk about people who are potential gamblers, I agree, that is for the good of them, but for an Intergrated resort for the economy, then the demonstration is a total waste of time. Yes, I am pro-casino.<br><br>Maybe you can suggest how do we improve the economy so that the rich &amp; poor gap will not widen. Singapore is really running out of ideas I have to say. Dubai is fighting with us for the lucrative aviation industry and is attracting alot of investors. Malaysia is also restructuring to be more competitive, Thailand..... let's see how many things in Singapore are imported from Thailand and they are competiting with us to be a regional medical hub.<br><br>The thing about visions is that you don't get instant results. I agree that although the pay is increasing in certain sectors,  it is not increasing fast enough for the whole country to fill the effect. Well, it may be more diplomatic if they took a pay cut of course, that is a point I do agree with you.<br><br>It is getting more and more competitive here in Singapore. Very soon we may have to work overseas like what the Germans are doing now with their economy in the pits currently.<br><br>And stop calling me dear.</div>
