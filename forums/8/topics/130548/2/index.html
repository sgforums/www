            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think that you should compare the President to the Prime Minister. Each post demands different qualities. The President have to be friendly and be accessible to all levels of society while the Prime Minister have to make tough, unpopular decisions. I would have to say though that SM Goh Chok Tong did better in balancing these 2 qualities.<br><br>As for democracy, well, our opposition sucked in the first place. Even in a more equitable election, I hope they lose cause they suck more than the PAP. Anyway, take a look at the US, the so-called advocate of democracy. There was so much controversy about the use of the voting machines. The debate was not so much about policies but about insulting each other's character. It's about who has the better image consultant. And the millions of dollars spent on campaigns. So only the rich can win? True democracy? Bah, it's a myth. That's why it's called politics. Realistic democracy is about who is better at playing the political game than who is better for the country. If the opposition can't even handle the PAP, what makes you think they can handle international politics with countries that are even more unreasonable?</div>

Did you ever think that things will forever go in your way just because you said it? Did any senior members of your families said no to you?

Even if one of them works in 7-11, someone will accuse them of cronyism. So maybe their exam scores were also kelonged. Have you been to Indonesia?

I can always go across the causeway and make these "illegal" purchases.... some of these books are written by obviously anti-LKY people. Of course I agree that the banning is a little paranoia, but I don't think we are so sheltered, after all, hasn't the government been encouraging us to go overseas. I do that, go overseas, I mean, regularly..... and I can tell you first hand that some of these comments and "opinions" are really ridiculous.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by caramon:</div><div class="quote_body">In a democracy, people can hold their govt accountable for their actions, but the moment you do that in singapore, you will be identify, arrest without a trial, make a bankrupt or worse, sent you to IMH for observation..<br></div></blockquote>Eh?? why are you still out here so free. Not in IMH??? Last I heard, impeaching a US president is also quite difficult.... When's the last time someone wants to hold the Singapore government accountable and got identified, arrested made bankrupt etc. Those that got these treatment made statements that they CANNOT prove or found to be FALSE.</div>
