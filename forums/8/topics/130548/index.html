What is the purpose of all these?<br><br>The lawsuits can hit any contesting candidate, depending on who the sniper wants, and occurs in the last few elections - and few people are willing to stand for GE contests which explains the massive walkovers.<br><br>The unfair rules, the defamation lawsuits, the biased public media reporting, the little exposure given to opposition in printed and broadcast media, the restrictions on opposition rallies, denial of police permits for campaigning, the sudden changes to electoral boundaries, etc, works in favor of the ruling party and resulting in landslide wins for them.<br><br>There is also the Elections Commission whose members are appointed by the SG government dominated by the PAP, and they are the only authority to audit the elections process. How honest are they? Lastly, in the event that opposition candidates managed to win a few seats, they can be expelled via lawsuits and disqualified from Parliament.<br><br>The opposition parties made no headway in the last 10 years. More citizens are unable to vote due to walkovers. The voices of the people had been silenced, their woes unrepresented, and their interests neglected, their hard earned savings taken away - by a Parliament which is supposed to represent them, but didn't.<br><br>The present elections system is no longer a means for the people to choose their own govt, which even without the citizens casting a single vote, the ruling PAP party will have enough walkovers to form the next government.<br><br></div>
