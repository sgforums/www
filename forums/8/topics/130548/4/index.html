I acknowledge that there are others. My point is, LKY has done a lot, which does not carry the implication that others didn't.<br><br>He, by nature, is not a very likable person.

As long as these people has the required qualification and capability, let them be judged by that, not the family tree. End of the day, looking at the SEA region, any individual, regardless of how capable he is, as long as he is connected to a powerful person, he will NEVER be free from criticism. Is this a fair judgement to be placed on one, just because of his connections?<br><br>LKY is human. He is entitled to his shortcomings, just like you and I. Why pronounce judgement on what he is, why not what he has done? Sure he screwed up some, but also scored big time on others.<br><br>On the issue of banned books, we are not the only country with some unexplained skeletons in our closet.<br>Note this link <a href="http://digital.library.upenn.edu/books/banned-books.html" rel="nofollow">http://digital.library.upenn.edu/books/banned-books.html</a>.

            <div class='col-md body'>PM Lee, since becoming PM, has called for people to speak up, to have diverse views, to 'think out of the box' and even to dare to dream.. This call is laudable..<br><br>However, it is just that - a call..<br><br>Nothing concrete has been done to effect such views being aired.. Instead, we have seen recent examples of people being 'put in their place' for having just such views which the PM is encouraging..<br><br>Jamie Han was cast in a bad light in all our media.. One newspaper here even had a headline "Why So Rude?" - referring to Jamie Han.. One NMP was 'reported' to the speaker of parliament for using 'unparliamentary words'.. And now we have blogger Chen who is threatened with legal action for speaking up his mind..<br><br>Without any substantial changes to our defamation laws, civil servants will be tempted to use legal actions against those whom they consider to have defamed them or their institutions..<br><br>All this will result in people who will continue to be silenced.. And talk of building up a civil society will come to naught..<br><br>So, if PM Lee is really serious about allowing diverse views, he should start at the heart of the problem which makes people reluctant to speak up - the defamation laws in Singapore..<br><br>Threatening to sue a blogger is silly.. And it goes against what the PM himself has called for..<br><br>It is time for PM Lee to show every Singaporean that he is really serious about wanting people to speak up and speak honestly..<br><br>Change the defamation laws..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Singapore Prime MinisterÂ’s salary, as given in the Straits Times report on the Parliament proceedings in July 2000, is S$1,994,000 per year..<br><br>In addition, the SingaporeÂ’s Ministers awarded themselves 3.25 months bonus last year, not including the 13th month..<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s PM for yr 2000 salary was $1.994 x 3.25 = S$2.534 million = US$1.4699 million..<br>(Even if we exclude the 13th month)<br><br>Dictatorship and Autocracy in Singapore<br><br>By Tian Jie<br>The Epoch Times<br>May 03, 2005<br><br>It is very difficult for people who have never lived in Singapore to imagine and understand the nature of its dictatorship and autocracy. On the surface, it looks like Singapore has a democratic system and that people are granted the right to chose and vote. However, in actuality, it is a country with complete dictatorship and autocracy.<br><br>For a long period of time Singapore has been ruled by one political party. Currently among the 94 congressmen, there are only two elected members from opposition parties, so opposition parties do not have any opportunity to challenge the ruling party. Due to strict monitoring and threat by the government, most people dare not to or are even scared to be in touch with any of the opposition parties.<br><br>They are not willing to openly support the opposition parties. Therefore the opposition parties, in the political system of Singapore, are actually just an ornament for the outside world. It is a coat of democracy covering up its nature. The small number of people who dare to step forward and challenge the government, especially those who join the opposition parties to participate in the election, will simply be brought to court in the name for Â“slandering the systemÂ” because of some minor public speeches or immaterial articles they wrote.<br><br>The judicial system of Singapore basically obeys the government. Cases related to challenging the government or the political leaders rarely have any prospect of winning.<br><br>Members of the opposition parties, if sued, can predict that they will definitely lose their lawsuits under the judicial system controlled by the government. However, these unfortunate people, knowing clearly that they will not win, have to defend their cases again and again in court.<br><br>In addition to paying expensive legal fees for the lawsuits, they also need to face a huge penalty fee in the end. The lengthy legal procedures have turned most of them bankrupt. In one of the elections in the 90s, a famous lawyer joined one of the opposition parties, the Â‘Workers PartyÂ’, to participate in the election. But his public speech in an election gathering was taken out of context.<br><br>He was sued by many members of the ruling party. That lawyer, in order to escape from the political persecution, left Singapore and settled down in Australia.<br><br>In the one or two districts of the opposition parties, people living there can feel the pressure and boundaries. For example, the development of civil construction, education and even transportation is all under control of the districts of the ruling party. This is equivalent to silent revenge and suppression.<br><br>Due to these reasons, several former districts of the opposition parties were forced to vote for the candidates of the ruling party in the election. It is therefore more and more difficult for the opposition parties to maintain their foundations.<br><br>Singapore used to be totally against communism. Since late 1980s, it established a diplomatic relationship with China and has become closer and closer to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It now completely follows the CCP, seeks benefits from the CCP and conducts acts that are in the interest of the CCP. It is not hard to understand why the government of Singapore, disregarding its own image, has committed an evil deed by bringing two innocent Falun Gong practitioners to court and heavily punishing them for letting tourists and policemen know the truth of Falun Gong.<br><br>There are two major media organizations in Singapore. One is a newspaper organization, controlling all the newspapers in Singapore; and the other is a television organization, controlling most of the TV stations. Although the two groups are run independently on the surface, they are actually heavily influenced by the government.<br><br>It is rare to hear the voice of the opposition parties in local media. The opinions from the opposition parties are always put in the least obvious and the hidden places. It is rare to see or to hear dissatisfaction or negative comments toward government policies or leaders. In addition, the media in Singapore is heavily influenced by the CCP.<br><br>Accordingly, The Singapore United Times is the only overseas paper that is present in Mainland China. Even papers that are heavily influenced by the CCP, such as The Xing Pao Daily and The Ming Daily of Hong Kong and The World Daily of Taiwan, can not compare with it. In this situation, The Singapore United has to completely conform to the CCP. Any news that the CCP does not like cannot be published.<br><br>There is absolutely no news of the CCPÂ’s brutal persecution toward members of the democratic movements, Christians and Falun Gong members. A friend of mine told me once that he met one of the editors. He found out that the Chinese Embassy provides articles to The Singapore United on a regular basis.<br><br>The Singapore United is obliged to publish these articles and is forbidden to publish other articles, otherwise the paper would be banned in Mainland China. Once in a while, if the paper published some articles by mistake that the Chinese Embassy did not want to see published, the ambassadors would be furious. They would threaten the paper and then entice them with material benefits.<br><br>I did not plan to write this story but in the end decided to do so since I could not bear to see that these evil deeds committed by the Singapore government go uncovered.<br><br></div>

If there is no popular uprising, the government will just continue on their totalitarian ways and Singapore will not make any political progress.</div></blockquote>you're rite dude...but the salary part i'll have to disagree wif u...yea if u need a high salary to prevent a official from straying to corruption as a choice to earn more money then it's pretty stupid but look on the other side of the coin:<br>there's no certainty in life and i don tink anyone can take a politican's promise of being corruption-free be4,during and after his term of office for granted...so maybe tat's the reason y for the outrageously high salaries they're earning... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
