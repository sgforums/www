              <p>So a week ago I got a call from NYSS telling me that I have won a complimentary facial from a contest I took part in The Straits Times aeons ago. Of course I was thrilled lah and I remembered the girl saying over the phone that it is COMPLIMENTARY....and I booked a date.</p>
              <p>I came on time and when I entered the place, some Chinese lady was arguing with one of the  people there on dunno what cause they were talking in Mandarin all the way....great, I guess for a first impression of the place, anyway  I registered and they asked me to go and have my lunch first, and I was like WTH? I rushed from my ops(Im a NSF) to get here and spent almost $25 on taxi fare so that I won't be late and they had the cheek to delay me....wah damned umprofessional leh.</p>
              <p>An hour later I came back and they brought me to the "consultation room". I saw a calculator on top of a table and I knew that they are going to hardsell me. But the truth is, I was kind of interested in their packages since I have an acne problem and I would consider signing up in the future after the complimentary treatment. However I was in for a shock when the consultant said that I have to pay for a facial and whatever that was free is the consultation. Wait a minute, I did not feel that I was being consulted. All I had was her telling how bad my skin was, which I had known all along, obviously, and that was like only 1/4 of the time. The rest were just her blabbering away about the packages and she tried to con me by doing this dunno treatment that removes acne scars on my face for $4000! Of course I had to reject cause definitely I couldn't pay that amount....siao! Then she tried to sell me this package which costs $1680 for 10 treatments after discount. I told her I didn't have enough money, then she asked me how much can I pay... I said $100. Then she told me to pay $100 and pay $300 the next day, which she said that I can pay the rest by installments, but I made excuses that I'm broke and that I can pay only on the 10th of next month, and she had no problems with that. Seriously I just wanted to storm out but I wanted my facial so I verbally agreed with her and paid the $100. Eh, wait....$107 after GST.</p>
              <p>I've never been to a facial before, so I can't really review how good it was. But the sucky part was when she squeezed the life out of my zits and i felt like she injected something to it. But frankly speaking, overall I was quite impressed with the treatment lah; the whole time I made plans for my finances in the future since I'm gonna part with lots of cash from my payroll.
              After the treatment was over I signed the paper and she asked me what time the next day I will be coming over to bring the $300. Somehow I felt that I was being "legally exthorted". Ironically my next appointment is two weeks away. So seriously, what's the rush? I just said somewhere in the afternoon and left the place.</p>
              <p>Now half a day later after more thinking I regretted signing up for the package. But the truth is I do have some spare cash but that's reserved for other use. Ok so some may argue that that the "other use" includes facial but I think that money is better used for other stuff than just for removing stuff from the skin surface. 
              I bet NYSS are like having a party right now cause I'm like the 2,503,287th customer they thought they have conned. I use the word thought because I'm so not going to pay the remaining $300, and neither will I turn up for the next treatment, after reading bad reviews of the place from various forums.
              But then ah, will I get sued or anything?</p>

The rest were just her blabbering away about the packages and she tried to con me by doing this dunno treatment that removes acne scars on my face for $4000! Of course I had to reject cause definitely I couldn't pay that amount....siao! Then she tried to sell me this package which costs $1680 for 10 treatments after discount. I told her I didn't have enough money, then she asked me how much can I pay... I said $100. Then she told me to pay $100 and pay $300 the next day, which she said that I can pay the rest by installments, but I made excuses that I'm broke and that I can pay only on the 10th of next month, and she had no problems with that. Seriously I just wanted to storm out but I wanted my facial so I verbally agreed with her and paid the $100. Eh, wait....$107 after GST.</p>
              <p>I've never been to a facial before, so I can't really review how good it was. But the sucky part was when she squeezed the life out of my zits and i felt like she injected something to it. But frankly speaking, overall I was quite impressed with the treatment lah; the whole time I made plans for my finances in the future since I'm gonna part with lots of cash from my payroll. After the treatment was over I signed the paper and she asked me what time the next day I will be coming over to bring the $300. Somehow I felt that I was being "legally exthorted". Ironically my next appointment is two weeks away. So seriously, what's the rush? I just said somewhere in the afternoon and left the place.</p>
              <p>Now half a day later after more thinking I regretted signing up for the package. But the truth is I do have some spare cash but that's reserved for other use. Ok so some may argue that that the "other use" includes facial but I think that money is better used for other stuff than just for removing stuff from the skin surface. I bet NYSS are like having a party right now cause I'm like the 2,503,287th customer they thought they have conned. I use the word thought because I'm so not going to pay the remaining $300, and neither will I turn up for the next treatment, after reading bad reviews of the place from various forums. But then ah, will I get sued or anything?</p>

              <p>zzz... Why you never read the contract properly??? And verbal agreement??? Come on...</p>
              <p>I myself is a customer of New York and they treated me quite nicely...</p>
              <p>1st of all, they got limited resources, 5-6 customer at a time if I'm not mistaken... So, rule no. 1, call a head for an appointment... even their complimentary ones require an appointment if you don't want to get into unexpected waits...</p>
              <p>I went for their complimentary facial last year and yes afterwards they did try to pull me into one of their packages... But I am interested in one of their packages coz I also had acne problems...</p>
              <p>They went over with me the contract saying I only have to pay $500 in installment for a 10 session  facial... RULE NO.2 READ THE CONTRACT!!! I did not only take their word for it, I read the contract from page 1 to page 3 and everything was in order... I only had to make a $20 diposit and can come back when ever I got the money and time...</p>
              <p>6 MONTHS LATER when I got my own money, I went there for my 1st facial... It was great, they treated me very nicely... But they did squeeze out the black heads which were painful but no pain no gain...</p>
              <p>So, over view (1) make an appointment a head, (2) Read the contract, (3) know your rights...</p>
              <p>I give New york 4/5...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, it really works... 2 sessions and I see good improvement...</p>
