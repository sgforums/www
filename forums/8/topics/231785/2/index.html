Less heckling by strange folks.<br><br>And Veron, if you are planning on staging performance.I do have some other contacts.<br><br>Fren of mine was involved in a dance performance last year or so. It didnt do too well.<br><br>And him, I know from internet few years back, intro to dance studiio and he eventually joins other dance studios and then graduated to performances.<br><br>You might want to know how his team did it.<br><br>Best to contact me thru emails or messengers on this one.<br><br>And ermmm.....comtemporary dance? I noticed that Phuket, Thailand were I was at last year, dont have a decent dance school. Not even ballet for the children.  Was encouraged by folks to do business and set one up there.  You might want to consider a business opportunity there?  I felt that Singapore is kinda saturated.</div>
