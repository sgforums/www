              On 2 Sep 2012 (Sun) at about 1215hrs, I arrived at Starhub Services Centre located at Nex. I queue up at the reception counter. I was attended by a pleasant staff. I told her I wanted to terminate my subcription to Starhub TV. I was given a queue number and thereafter I was directed to the waiting area. After 45 minutes of waiting, my number was called and I was attended by another young and pleasant looking staff at counter 13. I told her I was there to terminate my subscription to Starhub TV and  to return the equipment. She took about 10 minutes to process the documentation.
              I was given a copy of acknowledgement before I left.
              
              On 6 Sep 2012 (Thu), I received a bill from Starhub directing me to make payment for my subscription to Starhub TV from 1 Sep 2012 to 30 Sep 2012.
              
              I was told that my subscription to Starhub TV has not been terminated when I called Starhub on 7 Sep 2012.
              
              Do you have similar unpleasant encounters with Starhub?
              
              What can Starhub do to gain my confidence in their services?

              <p>How is that an unpleasant encounter?</p>
              <p>You went in september to terminate your subscription for the month of september, expecting not to be billed for the month of september?</p>
              <p>Did you read the terms and conditions for your subscription? Your termination of the subscription might not be immediate, and could only take effect the following month, in october.</p>
              <p>Did anyone promise you immediate subscription termination in writing?</p>

              Thanks for sharing.
              
              But is it logical and reasonable for Starhub to take one month to process the termination of subscription?

              Starhub is very efficient. It takes them less than 3 working days to process and install when we apply for Starhub TV subscription.
              
              Should I not expect the same standard when I terminate the subscription?

              <p><br>Technically, yes.</p>
              <p>Hmmm, how to explain, abit hard to explain on writing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, Most termination will take a few working day to process. Thus when they generate ur invoice, the termination might not have been processed yet.</p>
              <p>In cases like this, if people accidently paid or anything, in the next bill next month, the amount will be corrected accordingly from 1sep to the day you ternimated. Any surplus you paid will be used to offset the bill month (if you have other services with starhub as well). If no other services, you shld receive a negetive bill next month.</p>
              <p>If you did not pay this month and wait till the next, the next month bill (Due amount) will deduct according.</p>
              <p>Not only telcos, but most institutes like banks, hospital also function the same way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HOWEVER! this is starhub we're talking abt so ensure that your line has already been termiated. get names of whoever who confirmed with you. Besides u have the signed copy of the termination form, so no worries.</p>

              <p>did you return the equipment at the same time when you terminate?  if you have realised, starhub are still using manual paper submission..(while M1/singtel are doing electronic submission)  they fill in all the details in those yellow/pink/green/blue copy papers.... so once the CSO fill it in, they will put it one side, maybe few days later then send to HQ for processing... and HQ might take another few days to process.....  so there is some time lapse..</p>
              <p>for registration of new Starhub tv contract, it is simple, cos they just activate that so call "TV sim card" and you can use already. but for their back end, you wont know when they key into their system to update your account..... some time you even get to use FOC for 2 months which happen to my father in law case..... he subscribed to new starhub tv and got set top box.. but two months no bill come at all... then the following come one bill for that particular month only.. so basically gotten two months free subscription.</p>
              <p>you can dun pay the bill for this month.. wait for next month for them to credit back the subscription charges and pay for the balance (i.e for 1/9 and 2/9)... do check on the credit amount.</p>

              Thank you for shaing your invaluable views.
              
              We should manage our expectation of the service providers. It is perfectly alright for customers to wait for 45 minutes. But to others, they expect the service providers to cut down on the customer waiting time. It is all about perception and expectation of individual customer. The customers are not always right. Service providers need not bother about customers feedback or relook into their daily standard operating procedure as long as it is reasonable, logical and defensible.
