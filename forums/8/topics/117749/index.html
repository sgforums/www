            <div class='col-md body'>panzersinc, u should consider yourself lucky cos even though she knew u fancy her, she still chooses to maintain her friendship.Now how many girls do that?.The minute they hear u propose, most of them boot like rabbits.Trust me, i have been in that situation before<br><br>Now the most logical course for u take is to maintain your friendship with her.Let her go out with many guys as she can, experience the up and downs of life and mature as a person while u wait.Eventually she may change her mind about u.The key here is put in effort to maintain the current relationship u have wif her.If u start thinking about having her as your girlfrend and your focus changes to this objective, u may end up screwing up the whole thing.If by any chance, she gets a bf , u can still be good friends with her and be close to her.Seriously speaking this situation is much better than she "disappearing" from your life altogether.Keep her close.The thought that she's with you will inspire u in life.Trust me.Think about it and post a reply.<br><br>Besides it will be more useful if u can state the age of both of u..are u are in your teens or twenties? If u are in your thirties, i am sure u might not have posted here in the first place as u should be by now well versed in handling life</div>

She is cool and really treats me as a very good friend. I share a lot with her. Since the first time she rejected me, i really put a lot of effort to maintain the friendship..whcih i truly cherish.<br><br>you are right. asi had also said, this type of thing is really unpredictable.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there...I know its hard to be rejected by a gal whom you had strong feelings and inclination towards. But the fact that she doesn't "choose" you makes it rather clear that you both aren't supposed to be together. Sure, you two still can remain as friends and meet up casually at times. But what I feel is that the story has ended, sadly.<br><br>So, what to do now? First things first, stay strong and move on. I know like what others said that there will always be someone better out there for you, but even I may be skeptical towards that opinion, I think it may still be true.<br><br>Don't be too put off by the fact that she has rejected you. Whatever happened, good or bad, are already in the past tense. Be strong and wise up, kid!</div>
