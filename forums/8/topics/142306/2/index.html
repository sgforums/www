And they do pastor full-time  they're going to need money for their everyday lives.  They choose to be (or work towards) being a pastor like you or I choose a career or job.  Would you like to get paid peanuts for your job?  AFterall you "volunteered".  And pastors aren't monks who are not supposed to own anything.<br><br>Churches or their organisation have a set budget for the salary of a pastor or any other worker in the church.<br><br>For those who don't know, (most mainstream) churches don't ask people to donate money or give out of the "goodness of their hearts".  Members give what they feel they should give or what God impress in their hearts to give.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Joshua1975:</div><div class="quote_body">other charities and religious organisations kena after NKF?<br><br>other charities... why worried if what they do are all upright???<br><br>religious organisations... it the GOD name they playing with, i dun care.</div></blockquote>Well, for those who donate to those charities, they did give the money for a specific reason.  And they want that money used for the reason it was donated.  It's also fraud to ask for money and not provide the 'service/product' you promised for the money.<br></div>

Branzz was out of line there.  I mean he wouldn't like if any of us went over to his place and started criticing what he spent his money on.  It's like walking over to a guy driving a Jaguar and telling him he was overly exorbitant and should have spent less money on a Toyota Corolla.<br><br>For all we know the church could have gotten a pretty good deal on the "special" add-on/modification.  It would have been better (value for money) to get the special thing than to have the basic stuff.  And it was well within their budget.</div>
