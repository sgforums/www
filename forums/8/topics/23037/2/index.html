She falls for him. He gets her to steal jewellery from her mother. Then he dumps her.<br><br>The lovesick girl later kills herself.<br><br>That was the tragedy of Teo Chu Ling's short life. The 18-year-old polytechnic student killed herself last December.<br><br>Yesterday, the youth she stole for, Tay Wee Kiat, 24, was sentenced to two and a half years' jail for instigating her to steal, and for receiving stolen goods.<br><br>His sentence was harsher than usual for such offences because this was not his first brush with the law.<br><br>Three years ago, he served nine months behind bars after outraging a woman's modesty.<br><br>The unemployed man hobbled into the court on crutches because of a motorcycle accident injury.<br><br>He maintained a stony expression throughout the proceedings yesterday.<br><br>His lawyer, Mr Teo Chek Siew, told the court: 'Desperation drove him to commit the offence.'<br><br>He added that even though Tay's girlfriend lent him money, it was not enough for the loan sharks on his tail.<br><br>But Deputy Public Prosecutor Edwin San said Tay had taken advantage of the dead girl's feelings and made her steal from her own mother.<br><br>The first-year Nanyang Polytechnic student, died on Dec 11 last year.<br><br>She had plunged from her family's ninth-floor HDB flat in Ang Mo Kio.<br><br>She had been dating Tay, an odd-job labourer and dropout from the Institute of Technical Education, since July last year.<br><br>When loan sharks started hounding him for the debts he had run up gambling, he turned to her for help.<br><br>The girl almost emptied her savings account of $6,000, pawned her own jewellery and borrowed money from her friends for him.<br><br>When he asked about her mother's gold jewellery, she stole it for him.<br><br>And when he pawned the items, worth $1,055, she even acted as his guarantor.<br><br>Then she stopped hearing from him.<br><br>On Dec 8, she poured out her love for him in her diary, writing in Chinese: 'Why has he stopped calling? I cannot understand.'<br><br>Three days later, she had still had no word from him, and her mother had found out about the missing jewellery.<br><br>Sobbing, Teo showed her mother the pawnshop receipts.<br><br>She also told her about her boyfriend's problems, and said 'sorry' several times.<br><br>She killed herself soon after.<br><br>Tay turned up at her wake, and her parents made him write a 'confession' of what had happened between him and the girl.<br><br>He took four hours to write a seven-page statement which he read aloud.<br><br>In it, he explained that he had incurred gambling debts and how the girl had helped him.<br><br>The dead girl's parents handed the letter over to the police.<br></div></blockquote>Really pity that gal who sacrificed herself so much for love and in the end, kenna played out by that scumbag !<br>Really hope her soul rest in peace.......<br>Think that guy in his cell should do some soul searching and turn over a new leaf when he is out, and be a responsible and respectable citizen.<br>All of us have flaws and we are not perfect, but since punishment already meted out in this case, let's just hope he repents and mend his ways, and always remember someone once died because of his wrongdoing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
