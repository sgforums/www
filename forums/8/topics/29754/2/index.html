How do I know? because I live in canada and i've been all over the usa loh! USA and Canada NOTHING compared to s'pore lah! People here always racist and stereotype  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Bad place to live in... You think s'pore is boring? Usa and canada are worse! After 9 o clock dark outside... no one wants to go out.. especially girls. bad to go outside dark at night. in s'pore it's perfectly safe! you want freedom? freedom not good loh! freedom of speech.. look at usa. so many bad people. you don't see s'poreans swearing in music and other things lah. cannot walk 2 blocks in new york without seeing graffiti and bad words written all over the wall! s'pore may be small, but s'pore life is MUCH BETTER than ANYONE else in the world. Affordable housing, clean environment, good government, safe city! Also fun too lah! Only visited singapore once... i loved it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> wish i could go back... would trade anything to live in singapore <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> wasting my life over here *sigh*.. maybe i'll come to singapore when i finish school. USA and Canada are not fun either! only fun if you are into drugs and smoking and illegal things! if you move to usa it will also be hard to find job.. many people racist against asians  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> nothing to do in canada/usa... always same... nothing to do! i want to live in singapore <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>By the way i'm new to the forums... nice to meet you all!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>You have a point there!  Well, the grass is always greener on the other pasture.  We are all influenced by all the good American movies and TV programmes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>However, there are nice and safe places in USA also.  Most of us only think about CA, NYC and all the big cities.  Crime rates in big cities are usually high.  I stayed in a woo loo town in Kansas before.  Safe and peaceful.  Ever went out at night to do a bit of shoppings and errands.  People there were super nice as the pace there was slow and relaxing.  That was one of the happiest moment of my life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>It is also true that there are more racism in USA than in Singapore.  In here, it is common to see Malays calling Chinese "Cheena" (a very insulting way of calling Chinese) and Chinese call Malays lazy and stupid.  But no physical conflicts.  In USA and many ang mo place, asians and even the black (not sure what is the proper way of calling them) experienced unfriendly treatment.  I have ever seen white men hitting a black person and telling him to go back to Africa.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>When I first arrived in Minneapolis, I was with a few other chinese singaporeans.  When we got our passport stamped at the custom, some of my friends (who kenna one stupid bitch racist custom officer) were detained for no reasons (but actually because they are chinese race).  We almost missed our connecting flights because of that.  I regret not writing to the respective departments to lodge a major complain against this stupid bitch.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
