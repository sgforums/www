              my hair is destroyed. Very Very bad customer service and poor rebonding skills by WXXXX (Shaw Branch)
                  
                  
                  last week,i went to do fringe rebonding at Actpoint. I had never done rebonding there before but i put my trust in W she seemed to know her stuff and seemed experienced the other time i went to do hair treatment. Wrong decision which i heartfully regret.
                  Well, every few months i have to do fringe rebonding cos abit natural curl. So far,no problems (except at D'Image where they fried my hair using what i suspect was relaxer cream-read my other post)
                  SO i do alot of treatments so hair still ok.. UNTIL i gave the wrong stylist authority to rebond my hair.
                  To cut long story short, my fringe and sides are fried!Burnt!
                  I called her and told her what my hair had turned into. Her response? My hair was already dry to start with. EXcuse me??
                  My hair is treated to treatments frequently to 'prepare' for chemical works and it was in 'ready'condition before she did my hair! Even dry wun be chao Da like this right??? And she said she used Shishedo wor! Shishedo on ok-ok condition hair how cab be fried unless stylist poorly skilled??
                  Back to topic, So on the phone she told me'''''''' Come to the salon, i do FREE treatment for you, you just pay for theshampoo/dry. EXCUSE ME? I still must pay??
                  Nvever mind, i told her ok.
                  Today before i go down the salon, i called to double confirm W is there.
                  She was. Know what she told me on the phone? '' YOU MUST REMEBER TO BRING YOUR discount voucher for your treatment har'' HELLOOOO??? Yesterday she said free??? I reminded her on what she told me the other day when i called.
                  Her response? ''You only did fringe rebonding, so now we cannot give you whole head free treatment''
                  My temper was rising at this point so i retorted that SHE/THEY destroyed my hair and yet still want to calculate until so zun????
                  Ok, she sensed my blood was boiling so she replied that she will give the treatment F.O.C
                  Guess what her colleague next to her told her? ''Dun give lah Dun give lah.
                  Blood reached boiling level. End up i never go. They so unwilling to compensate, i scared they will use inferior products instead of the proposed Redken which i dun really like anyway.
                  Dammit. Really sucks. The boss seemed like a nice person. Wonder why he allow such staff to work for him.
                  Never ever again will i go to Actpoint and i will tell all my friends to ban Wxxxx if they do go there. Terrible skills,poor interpersonal skills (poor W and her plump co-worker.
                  BAD!

              <p>you are right.let me tell you 2 incident last week before my rebonding disaster.I passed by a Korean salon (as in,really truly Korean with all Koreans stylists inside) and popped my head in to enquire about rebonding. They did a check on my hair and plucked some strands out and did a few time-consuming tests to see which rebond solution was suitable for my hair.You could sense they were really in love with their job and truly cared about your care. End up i did not do as it was very very expensive.But real impressed with the Korean's passion towards their craft. other salon  wun bother with testing, got money earn can already.</p>
              <p>Scenario 2:</p>
              <p>I went to another Korean salon to do treatment. Well, not full fleged korean salon as i only saw 1 korean stylist and he did my hair.Same thing,passionate about their work and very very merticulous. Thumbs up!</p>

              <p><br>They are pretty good in colouring.   I went there for hair cut, really find them cmi.    1st time cut my fringe slanting when it is not supposed to be.   2nd time, the hairstylist only cut the shape of my hair at the back instead of the whole hair.     OMG!</p>
              <p>There are other salons which provide bad service.    Shall tell u later.</p>
