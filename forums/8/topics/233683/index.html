            <div class='col-md body'>Years ago, a farmer owned land along the Atlantic seacoast.<br><br>He constantly advertised for hired hands. Most people were<br><br>reluctant to work on farms along the Atlantic . They dreaded the<br><br>awful storms that raged across the Atlantic , wreaking havoc on the buildings and crops.<br><br>As the farmer interviewed applicants for the job, he received a steady stream of refusals.<br><br>Finally, a short, thin man, well past middle age, approached<br><br>the farmer.<br><br>"Are you a good farm hand?" the farmer asked him.<br><br>"Well, I can sleep when the wind blows," answered the little man.<br><br>Although puzzled by this answer, the farmer, desperate for help , hired him.<br><br>The little man worked well around the farm, busy from<br><br>dawn to dusk,  and the farmer felt satisfied with the man's work.<br><br>Then one night the wind howled loudly in from offshore.<br><br>Jumping out of bed, the farmer grabbed a lantern and rushed<br><br>next door to the hired hand's sleeping quarters. He shook the<br><br>little man and yelled, "Get up!  A storm is coming ! Tie things down before they blow away!"<br><br>The little man rolled over in bed and said firmly, "No sir. I told you, I can sleep when the wind blows."<br><br>Enraged by the response, the farmer was tempted to fire him on the spot.<br><br>Instead, he hurried outside to prepare for the storm.<br><br>To his amazement, he discovered that all of the haystacks had<br><br>been covered with tarpaulins. The cows were in the barn, the chickens<br><br>were in the coops, and the doors were barred.<br><br>The shutters were tightly secured.  Everything was tied down.<br><br>Nothing could blow away. The farmer then understood what his<br><br>hired hand meant, so he returned to his bed to also sleep while<br><br>the wind blew.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: green;"><strong>The Morale Of This Story ?</strong></span></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When you're prepared, spiritually, mentally, and physically,<br><br>you have nothing to fear. Can you sleep when the<br><br>wind blows through your life?<br><br>The hired hand in the story was able to sleep because he<br><br>had secured the farm against the storm.<br><br>We secure ourselves against the storms of life by<br><br>grounding ourselves in the Word of God.<br><br>We don't need to understand, we just need to hold<br><br>His hand to have peace in the middle of storms.</span><br><br>-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x<br><br><span style="color: red;">A friend of mine shared this with me today,<br><br>and I enjoyed it so much, that I wanted to share it to you.<br><br>I hope you enjoy your day and you sleep well.</span><br><br></div>
