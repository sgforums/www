Hacking comes when human wants to abuse the system, so you can say it's partly their fault for letting the negatives outweighing their positives. Technology has brought us to greater heights and without them, we won't be enjoying our aircon or computers. why do you have to look at the darker side of technology? heck, why not go to great lengths and say that cigars, oily foods or even gambling (no technology is involve here) do even more harm to humans? Without technology,we will be still living in the dark ages of ethiopia.Btw,it's not 'outdo', it's 'upgrade'.<br><br>Oh yeah, and everything we does would have something to do with technology. afterall, the definition of technology is this: The application of science, especially to industrial or commercial objectives. Even our forefathers have been applying scientific knowledge like building of bicycles, discovering of gravity and even cooking. so you can say that part of technology stems from the olden days already.</div>
