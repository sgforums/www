            <div class='col-md body'>rights of teachers? people prefer to discuss the rights of students here, as seen by the majority of responses here. do u think a teacher's job is easy? dealing with 40 students in a class, and having to put up with all sorts of nonsense from some students. if there's a rule, there's a rule. for instance, if there is such a need for the student to be contactable by her grandma, then she should inform the teacher/school first.<br><br>when i had a good reason for not doing my work and requesting for a deadline extension (my bro was getting married over the weekend), i told my teacher. she was perfectly alright with it. just tell nicely.<br><br>most of us here can't even stand teengers walking around thinking they're kings. think of our poor teachers who have to put up with their nonsense, or their sometimes plain blatant insolence in class. we should cut teenagers some slack as they're still growing and discovering new things about the world as well as their bodies. we should also cut teachers some slack, and recognize their hard work. dun blame them for the faults you see in the education system. they are NOT the policy makers.</div>
