            <div class='col-md body'>Synopses:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">AnJali(1990)<br>A Story of a little disabled child in an apartment neighbourhood that touched the hearts of many. The story dwells on relationships between childrens in an apartment, a mysterious ex convict neighbour who befriends the child to save her life from an old unseen enemy of her father and the dilemma the parents go through to get their disabled child into society. Ratnam proved once again famous when he extracted a brilliance performance from a 2 year old child and how he did that was still a mystery.It is no easy task to depend upon a 2 year baby's acting for a film.But the children were highly impressive,more impressive than the adults.Many tearjerking emotional scenes with moody lighting and atmosphere with high quallity cinematography.</span><br><br>Yes , if u didnt know , the title is "Anjalee" It was a Ratnam film. One of the best and influential directors of India. Saw it more than a decade ago in the arts film circuit. I had seen all his films..A genius storyteller in this film.....This film was studied in the arts institute film dept where i was frame by frame...Here where i reside i am able to receive Singapore TV. Seems like they showing Ratnam film fest on your TV?  The intense lighting and cinematography struck me the most i think and set the appropriate melancholic mood of the story. The flow was perfect and script flawless....Ratnam has infused a strong emotional content in this film primarily aimed at the child/parent audiences. And the way the small kid is charachterized it makes one feel blissed the way it overtakes all the people involved in the society to the one child.<br><br>I got to say the climax was a different context altogether when the ex-convict resident in the apartment block whom they ocstracized comes to their rescue of the helpless family and the disabled child giving some action tense feel to the film for a brief period....The fact that this character was not prominently portrayed, which was Ratnam's approach to give a dark mysterious outlook justifying the character. Only a few sec brief scene was shown when the police apprehended him on charges of manslaughter straight after the fight scene....<br><br></div>
