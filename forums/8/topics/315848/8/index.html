              <p>Read a few pages of this thread before the flaming started.</p>
              <p>I would say that it all boils down to the fact that ladies generally do not like to marry downwards. By this i don't mean monetarily. I would mean education level wise.</p>
              <p>I dun tink females will want a partner that lives off her. Hence, those ladies in the CBD area( i tink most have a diploma at least) would want someone with at least a diploma or above. Since the level of education is highly corelated with one's pay, so it would actually seem that they only go for those with fat wallets.</p>
              <p>So ladies who come from other countries may seem less materialistic coz they don't have a diploma/degree to start off with, and the average singapore men earning a paycheck of 1-2k a month would suffice for her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is my POV. dun flame me please.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If you got a problem with sg gals, talk to your sistas and mothers, or grandmother if she is still alive. Otherwise, shut up!!</p>

              <p>i dont get it. SE asian girls like to say males are chauvanists and mommy boys type.. i really resent that. I love my mum. And i take control of my business.And woman should know where thier place is. Except at home la. haha So what is wrong with it ? I owe it to my mum and dad to a certain degree.. even though i hated thier guts before. But which parent dont want the best for thier sons or/and daughters ?</p>
              <p>Ur wife will spend the rest 30 yrs at least with. while ur mum , maybe another 10 yrs ?</p>
              <p>Asian parents tend to be more loving and caring. The unwritten rule of respect for ur parents and eldars , honour bound  regardless, sacrifices.I am not saying other cultures do not have these , but especially chinese culture, it is more evident. U foster that kind of discipline. If you dont like the culture u live in , then go and look for the other culture u like. It will have cause and effects on how u expose urself to other cultures , or how other cultures with urs. Man .. i am gonna pity the kids. confused. . fudged up.. no sense of belonging. N by the time uknow it , ur kid has moved out at 16yrs old. And exerting his bills of rights with u in the court of law. When u wanna discipline him. Or maybe u wont..</p>
              <p>Anyways.. with sgForums superior database and search functions. I hope in 25 yrs time it will still be here , and i am gonna dig back out all these things and see how right i fair in my hypothesis.</p>
              <p>hell i am even gonna note it in my mailbox.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/arrogant.png" alt="arrogant.png"></p>

              <p>but anyways ah..</p>
              <p>i have a few girl friends , which 1 just rang me few days ago form aussie. Also ang moh bf... started out good.. but then..  he used the word.. 'cabin fever' hahaha.. i didnt know what it was .. i found it quite funny actually , but it wasnt so funny as my friend was crying n swearing. lol.</p>
              <p>I dunno how to say this. But being limited to the understanding of cultures and the reasons behind it always makes us reason with assumptions and stereotyping. We are already living in a modern world. I always believe that we have our culture. no matter what , we are desecendants of the Chinese. there is no doubt about that. we all have our heritage. I also believe in incorporating useful western values.</p>
              <p>Its like business , China man style business vs western style. why not some china man style with some western style ?It was like bringing the notion of globalistation and world approved standards to a china-man styled company.. is not very easy to convince or implement... hell even the food we eat is all fusion this , fusion that.  Some food still taste best the way it was originally created for. but well.. what can i say. lol.</p>
