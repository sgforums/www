              <p>Last Saturday, i went to Murdy Murphy's Irish Bar. Located at the Orchard District.</p>
              <p>There are many westerners there with Singaporean girlfriends &amp; wives. Suddenly, i saw someone in the crowd wearing a round neck T-shirt with some words printed on it lol. The words read out were "Sarong Party Girl, yes you if you're reading it and feeling guilty". The westerners obviously didn't give a flying fu*k about it but he got alot of rude stares from the local chinese women. The best part, he was sitting with westerners who turned out to be his friends. And finally one chinese woman confronted him, but this woman wasn't with any westerner bf or hubby, she was with her group of friends, i guess they were all enraged as well but she stood out to confront him as she didn't want to solicite herself with the local SPGs. He completely ignored her but when his mates decided to make a move to another bar, he went back to the chinese woman and just spat in her face and walked off. Apparently she was shouting but he left in a taxi. I found it surprising. Kinda shocking.</p>

I like the Stout, it just has no bitterness and my german girl is addicted to their St James kiss beverage. I lose to her in drinking, she can easily knock out 5 pints and i will still be struggling on my 3rd lol. Guess it's in her genes. It's really happening during the live soccer matches.</p></div>
