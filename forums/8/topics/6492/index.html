            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm... i'm kinda new here and this is my first post. i always wondered how pple think about this but never had the oppurtunity to talk to alot of pple about it.<br>i am a guy who has gotten into many a failed relationship and my outlook on relationships now is that you must first be good friends before embarking on a relationship. thru experience i know that relationships that thrive on "spark" and "that magical kinda feeling" do not last and most of the time end prematurely. but the gal whom i like thinks so differently... she thinks that gals cannot know the guy too well and that we are risking our frenship of 8 yrs if we go anywhere with the relationship. i argue that if we are still such good frens after 8 yrs then wat is there to be afraid of? but she thinks that it will change things lor...<br><br>what do all of you think? comments? responses?<br><br>------------------<br>Let him that move the world, first move himself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to share with u something i knoe.....<br><br>If u like a gal and u knoe the gal just treat u as friend..it's better not wait too long...the longer she kones u...she won't find u mystery anymore ....and u'll will become good friend....<br>But if u knoee the gal likes u..tht's a different case...Normally gals won;t give up on a guy so fast and will wait for them to make the first move...this i'm quite sure..<br><br>If u think u dare to bet on a 8yrs relationship....Go on...... It might works or it might not.. this u got to depend ob tht gal's mentality.. Some gals are willing to try out and they find tht u got good character..the chance are quite high...<br><br>Let me share with u 2 incidents from the same person....<br>This gal has knoen this guy for 4 yrs b4 the guy make the first move..the gal was touched and went on with him...10yrs down the rd..they ROM and got a flat....something happened and they broke off...During the 10yrs, a guy has been secretly liking this gal friend of mine. Well, they are together after tht and after 2 yrs they are married noe.  BOth the guys tht my gal friend knoes are very normal looking person...Especially the second one...he doesn;y has good look..but got good characters.....<br><br>Hmm..hope this can give u some "inspiration" of wht u are going to do.  The choice is still yours..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NaiveGirl:<br>Hmm... thanks for your opinion. you think like my fren does lor. hmmm... i know that it is more exciting if you do not know a lot about the other person but i have gone into many relationships that were exciting but proved to be short-lived. so i am now looking for stability and i want to marry my next gf. i believe that if things sour in a relationship then we can always go back to what it was... or so i hope.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Patie:<br>thanks for sharing these experiences. i know that this gal will not hesitate to let me know if she likes me lor. she does not now but i told her that i liked her anyway. just to let her know. seize the day right? but i dunno if telling her will change things. hope not. thanks again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
