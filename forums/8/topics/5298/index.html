            <div class='col-md body'>Oks... I just need opinions here.... maybe some might think I'm 'boh liao'... but this is important to me...<br>No.... I'm neither one of them.. so don't get the wrong idea.<br>I guess this is what really happens when 2 or 3 people are in love, and there just can't be any decision made.. that's what I think. This is true, and not made up. all names are fictitious.<br>So, if anyone has any opinion to give these 2 ppl, post your opinions through me, and then maybe life would be easier for them,<br>agree?<br><br>Ernie  	I try not to hate anyone coz it is very sinful &amp; I don't want retribution on my children BUT I'm not an angel. I've seen too many girls/women like you go in &amp; out of HIS life &amp; every time I think I'm almost giving up. It seems like ALL the girls like calling me. You know what, the decision is not mine. If he wants me to go, I will leave...lock, stock &amp; barrel.<br><br>Elmo       C'mon, we both know him.  Would he leave you? You answer that for yourself.  The problem now is that we both love him and we hate each others' guts.  And I guess you must be hating my guts for contacting you.  I don't enjoy this but I think I can rest better knowing that I've not made an enemy.<br><br>Elmo       I did not tell him that I'm going to do what I'm doing now and I don't intend to tell him in the near future.  So pls don't tell him that I've contact you?<br><br>Ernie       why do ALL the girls say the same thing?????????<br><br>Elmo       You mean ALL the girls say the same thing to you?  Just how many girls have you been through with him?<br><br>Ernie       I knew him since 1990. How many do YOU think???????????<br><br>Elmo   	Hey, don't vent your anger at me, ok?  I don't like this situation.  And I wish I hadn't gotten into this in the first place.  How the hell am I suppose to know how many.  Maybe a hundred?  a thousand?  I don't know.  All I know is that he had many...and knowing his bad memory, he<br>can't really recall all of them....<br><br>Ernie       I am not taking it out on you. I understand what it means by "it takes 2 hands to clap". I just wonder WHY someone like yourself would get into a relationship like THIS. If you were an uneducated "ah lian" from the streets I 'd understand. How can your conscience leave you alone knowing that the guy even has a kid (or 2).<br><br>Elmo      I didn't ask you to get pregnant.  I was with him even before you got yourself pregnant.  Why are you pointing fingers at me?  I don't want to drive this discussion to the area of an arguement.  I don't want to start accusing or anything like that.  You're speaking like a married woman who's accusing the husband's lover of breaking up the family.  Am I doing that?  I didn't ask him to leave you.  Never and I can swear by that.  And in the first place, you're not even married to him.<br><br>Ernie       Excuse me but I think I can hear you screaming. FYI having a baby wasn't my idea alone &amp; it wasn't an accident. I think you're reading between the lines too much. I know what I'm in for &amp; like I said before I WILL LEAVE if he so much as hints so. I wouldn't hang on for dear life the guy doesn't give a shit anymore. I am stronger than you think I am.<br><br>Elmo   	Many girls aren't.  So why didn't you leave if you know that he had that many girlfriends alongside with you?  You say you know what you want.  But you can't even be cordial or civil to another human being like me?<br><br>Ernie   	cordial &amp; civil to who?<br><br>Elmo     A homosapien like me?<br><br>Ernie      Oh. You all come under a very special speciel label. Well I guess I am here to stay because he couldn't find anyone else who could take his shit. By the way, he told me at one point that you guys are no longer an item. But then again I always discount his words by 50% &amp; he DOES<br>believe he can have his cake &amp; eat it.<br><br>Elmo      The only official time that we were no longer an "item" was when you got pregnant and I went for an abortion.  That was for a few months.  Then we got back together again.  When else were we not an "item".  We do have our fights and I believe every couple has them.<br><br>Elmo    	Look, what do you want me to do? Leave him for you?  You must be fair.  I didn't ask him to leave you for me.  And neither did I want YOU to be pregnant.  But if the both of you wanted to have the baby so much, (which he wanted me to get pregnant too), I can't do nothing about it.  You look just as educated to me, if you judge education by looks (ref to your compliment about me and the "ah lians").<br><br>Ernie      Ok look I did not at any point ask anyone to leave him. And there is nothing in this world that is fair or not fair. I've learnt that. I did not brand you as ah lian coz I really have spoken to his<br>ah lians b4!  By the way, I think he's ask an average of 1 out of 5 women he knows to have his kid. Get the drift?<br><br>Elmo      really? Then why did you even agree to do it?<br><br>Elmo      And that's the reason why I aborted mine...<br><br>Ernie      I don't blame anyone either coz I know I'm not getting any younger &amp; I want a baby too. I cannot make myself marry a guy I don't care about just so that I could have a child<br><br>Elmo      I totally agree.  I'm really sorry if I caused you any pain.  From the bottom of my heart.  But please try to understand that I have feelings for the guy too.<br><br>Ernie      I'm just wondering why someone with a proper guy would want to throw all that away.<br><br>Elmo      I'm now wondering...all these<br>questions that you're asking me, aren't you doing exactly the same thing as I am too?<br><br>Ernie      Hello are you following???????????? I've come this far &amp; I've done everything under the sun<br>for him, fall short of jumping off the cliff, do you think there'll be some patient love-sick romeo waiting for me out there????????<br><br>Elmo      Are so jaded that you can't see no sunlight anymore?  You said you've stuck by him all these times.  So what made you do it and put up with all the girls including myself?  Now, you're turning around and ask me the same question that could be applied to you.<br><br>Ernie     Can you tell all these while I'm avoiding the lovey-dovey issue?? I've seen him thru so many chapters of his life (our life) &amp; I love him much more than I do myself. I know there isn't a FOREVER but I still try. I'm not out to hurt you that's why I don't want to touch this topic<br><br>Elmo      You don't hurt me by telling me that you love him.  In fact, I have even mentioned previously that we BOTH love him.  Love cannot be measured.  And I have no qualms about you loving him.  Or are you not comfortable with the idea of me loving him?<br><br>Ernie      No one knows what'll happen tomorrow. I do know that if he eventually tells me it's time for me to go, I wouldn't hate him BUT I'll be glad that he has finally found THEE woman to share the rest of his life with.<br><br>Elmo      You sure about that?  I mean not hating him?  I would hate him till I'm in the grave, if I were you.  I'm the extremist...either love or hate...no in between.<br><br>Elmo      I really feel so much better knowing that the walls are diminishing.  I don't expect the walls around us to be gone.  But at least, I don't have to dream about talking to you every night.  It<br>gives me cold feet....<br><br>Ernie      If you have waited all your life for someone to make that ONE big decision, wouldn't you be relieved? No I'm sure I won't hate him but it'll sure hell hurt<br><br>Elmo     	Or do ALL the women tell you that as well?<br><br>Ernie   	I 4got to tell you something I tell all of THEM.  I don't fight over a guy. I believe that if  one can take him away from me than it(he) should rightfully hers<br><br>Elmo     My belief:  If a guys wants to walk, nobody can ever tie him down.  C'est la vie!<br><br>Elmo     Hahaha....that's like 14years down the line....!<br><br>Ernie     I only have this other thing to say - when/if he finally makes up his mind. I'll be happy for him. It could be me, it could be you, it could be anyone else. I don't wish anyone 2b hurt but as it is<br>I've been hurt thru &amp; thru &amp; I think there are no winners. I truly hope there'll be a prince 4u out there (be it him or not) &amp; for me.<br><br>Elmo     pardon me, but you speak as if you're trying to implant this back-up plan for yourself and me.  For me, I don't really care whether he chooses anybody.  Coz from what I know about him, he will  never make that choice.  He'd rather that the situation stays this way.  And he is happy about it,  although I can't say that you are.<br><br>Ernie     Of course I'm not happy.  No there's no back-up plan. I'm just very old-fashioned &amp; I believe that everyone will find someone.  I can't say I don't care if he chooses or not.  I don't like sharing ANYTHING in my life. I'm a tyrant at home &amp; I guess this is retribution.<br><br>Elmo     Who likes to share the one that you love?  But we don't have a choice do we?   Ok.  Let me put it this way.  The guy has 2 kids with you.  Who do you think he'll choose? Isn't it obvious?  Are you  trying to rub salt into the wound here by telling me that "you hope that I'll find my prince charming one day"?<br><br>Ernie      Aiyah pls don't make a pregnant woman get heart attack! I guess you don't know him that well. he can take care of someone for the rest of their life. That is NOT love. He is a very responsible guy.<br><br>[This message has been edited by *duh* (edited 29-11-1999).]</div>
