            <div class='col-md body'><br>Just to say, sometimes I read tings on this site from both men and women.<br>Its a disappointment to see the kind of thinking and attitudes the young people now come to be.<br>So if the guys cannot stand the girls, and the girls cannot stand the guys. I guess its only natural. However, if these people actually reflect their own perspectives and attitudes, then they would realise that perhaps they need to change rather than blame the other party.<br><br>Where upon all the complains. If you ask me, some people choose to be in the wrong crowd. Then come and kick up a fuss, gender bash, make sweeping spikeful statements. This makes the person low class and very ugly inside no matter what nice package outside. If these people make groundless statements in their blog. Its their individual problem. It does not apply to all gender.<br><br>Take for example, there are a couple of members here who are highly irresponsible (go see AA) but it does not imply every guys/girls are that like this. This distinction has to be clear. Some people are not clear and using 1 or 2 example to generalise to the entire population. Not only you are short changing yourself of opportunities to know better people, you have put a mental block on yourself for the worse which is most difficult to get rid of. But alas, I have come to realise some are really young people and probably not reached the maturity (some never will - not an insult but really its true), so if these people choose to view life, matter, issues this way. Then its really their individual problem because lots of guys do get married and have ahappy life with sg girls and have no issues. Lots of sg girls still choose sg men over some moronic ang moh and lived happily ever after.<br><br>PS: Perhaps its not them, its really you, yourself after all...</div>

My father is paying all my brother's debts and my brother is out of work, and lost the custody of his daughter to the woman. I would not be surprise if the woman comes back and ask for more money and use the daughter for excuse. And still my brother blame all sg women that he is unable to attract one and feels they are too materialistic for him. I wonder if he ever took a good look at his own choice.

Even my brother als fall for some taiwan old woman cause she was "sweet" and nice to him when he was paying for all her diamonds. Stupid!!!  Then when she got here, she screw my family so bad. My father is paying all my brother's debts and my brother is out of work, and lost the custody of his daughter to the woman. I would not be surprise if the woman comes back and ask for more money and use the daughter for excuse. And still my brother blame all sg women that he is unable to attract one and feels they are too materialistic for him. I wonder if he ever took a good look at his own choice. But we don't want to point it out to save him face and besides, no point getting him angry cause he will lash out on my parents who live with him lah...<br><br>Yeah foreign girls are nice until they have no more use for local morons. </div></blockquote>"heroes die at the hands of beautiful women." <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
