Besides, the gaudy weird colours and long hair for guys are just a fashion statement..<br><br>point 3 :<br><br>Not romantic..

            <div class='col-md body'>lmao.. are you sure you call those "girls" girls? lets stop and think, what kinda girl wants their boyfriend to look like some japanese shiet poseur, having all that chains stuck out of their shirt pants or whatever you call they're wearing. i feel that those girls that post that either do not have boyfriends, or they simply choose the wrong boys to hang out with. yes some of the boys are assholes but some of the girls are biatches too. if you walk down orchard road nowadays, you can catch a glimpse of these group of people that you want to throw a grenade at. IMO, i think those girls that post in the forums about how bad singapore guys are should accept the fact that they have no other choice than to choose singaporean guys, and if they cant accept the fact, they can turn lesbian for fu cks sake. or if they have the money, they can go seek their knight somewhere else. otherwise, they should appreciate the fact that we as singaporeans are living together, and instead of whining about this and that, why not help change those guys that those girls so claim turn them off. also, to have such opinions about boys only shows 2 things, majority of the guys are becoming assholes or those girls really have been missing out on socialising.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sg guys generally have began to be turned off by sg gals. these are the 3 reasons:<br><br>i)too materialistic. they expect the guys to pay everything for them. his money is her money, her money is her money, he become no money. then you blame him for having no money.<br><br>ii)to be the Prince Charming in their life and being able to sweep them off their feet. please lah, boh her hae mah ho.....worse, when their first guy is not their Prince Charming, she goes to find the second one and it goes on and on and on and on and on and on....<br><br>iii)expect guys to read their minds and know exactly what they want......hallo, you don't say, how we know? humans are not born with mind-reading skill, if have, then the human race will be extinct since the only thing on guys' head is "i want to bed you" and all the gals will run away. hints will not work.....you point to me the sea, how i know you mean you want the whole galaxy?<br><br>in short, expect too much.

Why you would wear anything beyond T-shirts, shorts and sandles is beyond me.  Japan has got a completely different climate and they can mess around with fashion.<br><br>I tend to agree that Japanese fashion is sort of weird and a little faggoty. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
