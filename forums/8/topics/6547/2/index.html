            <div class='col-md body'>hmm. for catholics, here, at least, it's possible to get church wedding even if only one of the couple is a baptized catholic.  For whatever good this sacrament brings.<br><br>Archer, you wrote that the church would be a perfect institution if not for its people.  But the church is the people.  Without them, it's just a building, or an empty institution.<br><br>It's sad that they try to mingle in one's affair, it's not like all the churchgoers are candidates for sainthood.  However if they are more your friends than evangelists they won't be so dead set against it until friendships have to be severed.  And if they are more evengelists than your friends, maybe you should find better friends than them.<br><br>About the scriptures, once Jesus et co. were healing a man on Sabbath day and when the pharisees protested He said: if your cow stumbled in a hole on Sabbath, would you leave it there until the next day or would you get it out of the hole right then?  Rules are made for people, not people for rule.  It's not right that not having the same faith disqualify someone right away from being your partner.</div>

But the church is the people.  Without them, it's just a building, or an empty institution.<br></blockquote>I agree that the church is nothing without humans. unfortunately, it is with humans that the church becomes the mess that it is in. We tend to make things more complicated than it is, adding to it till it becomes unbearable and legalistic.<br><br>let me give an example:<br>we try to interprete the commandments and the bible, then we explain the interepretion and we explain the explaination.<br><br>the end result is we lay upon ourselves the commandments, the supplementry laws, the advice, the guidelines and the unofficial ruling of every bishop, elder, deacon, pastor, lay leader, cell group leader and every counsellor that ever lived in the whole of mankind.<br><br>the scary part is: some of these are actually taken as the gospel truth and obeyed to the letter, just simply because some Cell Group Leader says it. Please!! apply some of the good ol'common sense that has been given to us!<br><br>*sigh*<br><br>from a personal perspective, i think we'll be better off if we lived on a deserted island without the influence of all the laws and ruling by men to decide what "ought to be" instead of "what is written".<br><br>think i shall lay off the church bashing part: a lot of people are probably aiming their bows at me now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>archer</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once upon a time, the country was having severe food shortage because trees were hard to grow.  The people prayed and God heard their prayer so he laid down a rule:  Each man can only eat one fruit per day.<br><br>The rule was written in holy texts and  obeyed by everyone thus it worked well, everyone had their share of fruits.  Over the next many years the people became more and more advanced and now they can grow trees so laden with fruits that these trees bend and their branches touch the ground.<br><br>However, because of God's words many dare not eat the fruits.  Some think that it's a waste to let the fruit rot so they eat them secretly.  Some just eat those fruits and they  are condemned by the pious people for flagrantly disobeying God's own words.<br><br>It's undeniable that many get overly righteous because they are saved.  There's nothing we can do about it; many evangelists get their flock by creating a sense of us-against-the-infidel-world-and-they're-gonna-fry-fry-fry. The answer, I think, lie with yourself whether you are strong enough to withstand the pressure.  Going to church is a meeting with God, first and foremost.  If it's overshadowed by conflicts with churchmates, one might as well pray from home.<br><br>PS: Archer, I had this thought too yesterday, how would I be like if I was born all alone without any pressure from others to influence my growth.  Will I be this me I am now?  What do you think if you've been in your deserted island all your life?  What kind of person would you turn out to be?<br><br>[This message has been edited by MayaJade (edited 13 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm...i personally think it is not very possible for a christian and a non-christian to be together. An active christian will no doubt be involved in fellowship with others every week, but a non-christian will not understand how important fellowship is. They will think that it is just a waste of time. So if their bf/gf goes for fellowship instead of going out with them, they will start being unreasonable, conflicts will start and maybe..end of relationship.</div>

Everything change when I refuse to go to any Sunday service. I broke up with her eventually so as not to let her stuck in between her friends and me. How much of pressure from her Christian friends my ex-gf had to face just because I refuse to go Sunday service. There can be many type of people around. Just hope I can meet some good Christian friend in future.<br><br>As quoted from Archer.<br>"you've met some of the not-so-nice ones: time to meet some of the nice ones."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear God,<br>Please give us clear guidlines in your future writings and revelations so we do not need to argue over topics which are non-impt and yet at the same time, topics we can't do without in our lives. Tell us exactly what u want of us and then, following your way and pleasing you will be so much easier. It is already difficult enuff knowing that there is a devil to tempt us even in clear cut issues. So please do not confuse us further with replies that cannot specifically have a yes or no, can or cannot answer. If u tell us what u want us to do, it will save us a lot of precious time debating, arguing with both others and within ourselves. It will also not make us guilty as I would only want to feel guilty for something wrong I did and not for something no one can say for sure is right or wrong. We are after all humans and unlike u or even near u. So please do not think of us as whiz kids who know all ur wishes and answers. Finally, update ur wishes often enuff as they change from time to time , practices, customs and rituals change from place to place. Your last update was more than 2000 years since. I ask this sincerely. Amen</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>seeking God's directions has to be an active action. you have to seek and then you'll find.<br><br>whatever decisions and actions you do, i'm sure all christians only want it to be pleasing to Him. So how do we please Him? Simple, the keyword is "faith". Without faith it's impossible to please Him. Please Him, not Man.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
