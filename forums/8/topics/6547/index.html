You will encounter more "oh, you know, the bible says.. " and "i know of *so* many christians who insisted on going on with non-christians and they broke up in the end.." than the actual voice of God.<br><br>(some would attempt to point out that God uses people, but somehow i don't think he uses them as doombringers and wet blankets. while i don't expect a "This is God" message spoken in a James Earl Jones voice, i would think that if God brings messages/guidance to his people, he would do it in a more encouraging fashion than those wetblankets. *sigh*)<br><br>just my 2cts worth.<br><br>archer<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be strictly biblical, God did say that we are not to be yoked with unbelievers. I think the main reason being that He knows that we will be led astray. That once coupled, we will be slowly turned away from our faith. I have seen it happen coz that's what happened to my family. My mum was a Christian before she married my dad, and now she worships whatever gods my dad do. However there are also other examples, like me, who became a Christian after meeting my gf.<br>I guess the thing is, you have to be prepared to put in extra work to maintain such a relationship as conflicts and issues are bound to occur. Even among those of the same faith, conflicts will occur. But something I feel dead against is that some churches blantantly reject such a practice. They will go all out to discourage their members from getting attached to non-believers. It smells of invasion of privacy...<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

This is especially so when pressure comes from outside, not inside. I know coz I was there before. My gf's Christian friend actually broke off the friendship with her coz she persisted in staying with me. Wah kao!<br>There are also a lot of things like pressure from church members, pressure from pastors, friends, not possible to get church weddings...etc. They can be resolved, but it's gonna be very, very hard...</div>
