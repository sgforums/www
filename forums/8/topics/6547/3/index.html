            <div class='col-md body'>i for one do not know if God will come down or not, but if u look carefully, if the arguement is about wether GOD will be pleased with inter religious attachments, I think he will be the best one to give the answer. All these things abt faith, dun talk abt God the list goes on. Aren't we just humans making lots of noise and still fighting amongst ourselves? Lets make it this way..............EVERYTHING IS PERMITTED BY GOD UNLESS HE SAID THAT IT WAS UNALLOWED IN THE BIBLE.      instead of EVERYTHING IS NOT PERMITTED BY GOD UNLESS HE ALLOWS IT IN THE BIBLE............. so u see, there u have it . the answer. So unless u find anything that says what u are doing is wrong in the bible, u can do what u want and what u please. 2000 years since and still counting. It seriously needs an update.<br>AND ALEX.......yoohooo....shame on u! u are not evn sure if GOD was a he or she. Chances are nd i'm dead sure, Its a HE. though he/it is a supreme being. so its quite formless again.<br><br>[This message has been edited by the truth (edited 15 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... I think God is neither male nor female leh. He is not a human being. Only humans have sexual differences mah.<br><br>Anyway, if you really seek God for an answer. I'm sure He will give you one in His own way, in His own time. He doesn't necessarily need to appear as a figure or human form or work in a miraculous way. His answer can come in the most ordinary forms.<br><br>Back to the original question. Like what "truth" said, there are no right nor wrong things unless it's stated in the Bible. From Romans 7 &amp; 8, but then the rules (or The Laws) are there so that you know what to do and what not to do. By breaking these rules, it causes you to sin. But this does not make the rules a bad thing, however these rules are meant to be good for us. And sometimes, as humans we only agree that these rules are good for us if we are able to live up to it. And if we really do the things as stated in the rules, it's really not us who want to do it but the sin in us convicting us. It's really a struggle and sometimes we become prisoners to the rules which were meant to set us free. It is our sinful nature that wants to live by the rules. So in the end we end up being slaves to the rules and in our sinful nature slaves to sin.<br><br>But as born-again Christian, Jesus has set us free from the law of sin and death. He has become the sin offering and condemn the sin in sinful man. We are set free, we are alive in Him! We are given life in His Spirit. So we do not LIVE according to the sinful nature but ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT.<br><br>What I have wrote may sound a bit confusing. I'm also not writing to boast of my knowledge. I can't claim that I fully understand the 2 passages yet but this is what I understand so far. But what am I trying to say? Simply if you are a born-again Christian, don't allow yourself to be too retricted to the so called Do's and Don'ts of being a True Christian. LIVE BY THE SPIRIT. If you feel (after much praying and thinking) that your actions and decisions are not in anyway dishonouring God, then do it. BUT pray and seek Him first!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by iamsilly (edited 15 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i donÂ’t think God ever forbade us not to marry non-christians, in the Old Testament, Ruth (non-Jew but a Moabite who were enemies of the Isrealites) married Boaz (whose mom happened to be Rahab, a prostitute in the city of Jericho) was an ancestor of King David &amp; Jesus Christ and dear Abraham even had an Egyptian concubine. actually, looking at ChristÂ’s ancestors makes me feel comforted that His family line is even more dysfunctional &amp; twisted than mine  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. God didnÂ’t come to earth for the privileged &amp; rich but for ordinary people like us, anyway i digress again.<br><br>although Paul later said in 2 Corinthian 6:14, NKJV [Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness?] i think he meant that Christians should do everything in their power to avoid situations that could force them to divide their loyalties &amp; not necessarily restricted to the marriage realm (from the Life Application Bible notes, hee hee ... me not that smart).<br><br>after all, he first advised in 1 Corinthians 7:12-16, NKJV [But to the rest I, not the Lord, say: if any brother has a wife who does not believe, and she is willing to live with him, let him not divorce her. And a woman who has a husband who does not believe, if he is willing to live with her, let her not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy. But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart, let him depart; a brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases. But God has called us to peace. For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?] PaulÂ’s advice was: stick with your spouse, unless if it means that you have to deny God to save your marriage, then itÂ’s better to let your spouse go if they insists on leaving. Sadly the last two sentences have been abused by some who wants out of a marriage.<br><br>personally, i would prefer a fellow Christian as it would make life really easier unless the Christ he believes in is way different from mine, but again sometimes, i donÂ’t know what God is thinking, letting me fall for the most unsuitable guys.<br><br>and i donÂ’t think that the bible needs updating, sure it was written 2000 years ago, but human emotions doesnÂ’t change that much throughout the ages, does it? generation after generation still agonizes over how do we know if he/she is the ONE &amp; only, who loves who, who lusts after who, self-gratification, etc, etc ...</div>

Just imagine what 2000 years and the diversity and differences in countries, rituals and so on will make. it seriously needs an update, however the update might come only in the final coming? when's that supposed to be? soon? and hi collete, u mean God actively instructed u to fall for this guy and that? methinks its the devilhahahah but seriously, no offence though i dun care if u're offended, and lastly, sort out what we can and leave what we can't to God. If u can't figure these out, just sit down and dun do anything. Damn.........even choosing a partner in year 2000 is so difficult........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Colette, I think what you quote from 1 Cor 7 applies to married couples. That is to say when one party gets saved after they are married then in that case they shouldn't divorce. And hor, Abraham's taking of a concubine in Hagar was an act of lacking of faith. He was promised descendants as numerous as the stars yet he didn't trust that promise and tried to get things done in his own strength. And hence, God blessed Isaac blessed more than Ishmael.<br><br>Personally this is what I feel:<br>1) Do not let you relationship with Christian or non-Christians affect your priorites, i.e. you do not put your self-interest above God's purposes .<br>2) Linking from point 1. In situations where there has to be a decision to be made, you do not compromise or dishonour Him in anyway.<br><br>The above points applies if you feel you are firmly rooted in God. But then even the most fervent Christians fall too. In whatever you do don't let your guard down, Mr S.A.Tan strikes when you least expected. I hope new Christians reading this won't take my word for it and start to take my advice as Biblical truth. I'm not encouraging you to go ahead. Do exercise your judgement and hearing from God.<br><br>Just to share a true story, but not a first hand account. There was this Christian guy married to a non-Christian. He remained a faithful servant of God and was actively helping in church. One blooming day, his wife started feel unhappiness in his involvement in church. She suspects him of having an affair with another lady in church. Sparks fly, quarrels ensued. Marriage broke up. Just an example lah. Not trying to point the fault at anyone, it's up to you to interprete.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Lastly, I do not think the Bible needs updating. It's as relevant as it was 2000 years ago. It's God's word ya? It's God-breathed. What God says He does not take back. What He says is eternal truth. It doesn't change. It applies then, it applies now. You just have to put into context.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by iamsilly (edited 16 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi iamsilly,<br><br>true, AbrahamÂ’s taking Hagar as a concubine showed his lack of faith, but isnÂ’t it great that God didnÂ’t punish him for it? God didnÂ’t bless Ishmael less because of this, i would rather think that it was because God already had a plan to bless Isaac more.<br><br>yes, 1 Cor 7:12-16 applies to married couples but i think it can be applied to non-married couples as well. why fall in love with a non-Christian? could it be that itÂ’s GodÂ’s will for the Christian to show the non-Christian the way? similarly, it could well be the devilÂ’s plan to lure the Christian away from God, thus, itÂ’s imperative that the Christian involved in such a situation be totally honest with him/herself &amp; see if he/she is likely to abandon God &amp; follow the non-Christian, if that the case, he/she has the right to make the choice, although in fellow ChristiansÂ’ &amp; GodÂ’s eyes, that would be the wrong choice. it all boils down to whether one loves another human being more or God more.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The bible does give a clear answer pertaining to having an unbelieving partner.  The Revised Standard Version (RSV) yields the most clear-cut translation of 2 Cor 6:14:<br><br>Â“Do not be mismated with unbelievers. For what partnership have righteousness and iniquity? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?Â”<br><br>Clearly, the bible commands us not to marry (mate) with an unbeliever.  Since in the modern context, we enter into a relationship before getting married, and entering into a relationship with an unbeliever is tantamount to taking a route which ends in marriage, or simplifying, preparing to marry an unbeliever.  Obviously, preparation to go against GodÂ’s word can hardly be billed as being permissible.<br><br>For those who think that they can enter into a relationship and then Â“convertÂ” their partners to Christianity (I would call that Â“missionary datingÂ”), a quick trip to 1 Cor 7: 15-16 (NIV) should be able to dissuade them:<br><br>Â“(15) But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so.  A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. (16) How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband?  Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?Â”<br><br>Verse 15 is referring to the conditions under which a divorce is permissible, that is, if the unbelieving party chooses to take this course of action.  The reason offered in verse 16 is that one cannot be certain of the salvation of their partner, even as husband and wife. (Note that this chapter is actually talking about a married couple.  Hence, the salvation of the husband or wife occurred after marriage, and does not contradict with 2 Cor 6:14 which disallows such a marriage in the first place)<br><br>It becomes apparent after a proper study of the above verse that missionary dating will not work, and is only an excuse by which one attempts to circumvent a direct order from God not to be unequally yoked.<br><br>Obviously, love often sneaks in swiftly and hits one hard.  I am not trying to downplay the emotional turmoil and anguish one would experience when struck with cupidÂ’s arrow.  Yet GodÂ’s commands are clear Â– that having an unbeliever as a partner is not permissible.<br><br>On a personal note, I ran into precisely this dilemma years ago where I fell in love with a particular lady.  Unfortunately, though she professes to be a Christian when I first asked (Yes, I checked of course), it turned out later that she had backslidden and have actually stopped attending church for some time.  It was pure agony then I remembered, and I kept asking God to explain the immense weight that hung upon my chest.<br><br>Yet somehow, I held on and continued to trust God.  That was in late 1997; today she attends the same church as me and we have been happily attached for just over half a year now.  Yes, I prayed for her to return to God everyday in between, and yes, I continued to love her throughout.  But no, we never did go on dates.  In fact, I did not even ask God for her to be my girlfriend!  Still, He was able to do far more abundantly beyond all that I can ask of or imagine! [Eph 3:20]<br><br>Yes, the standards are high, but they are not unreasonable  Â“(3) Trust in the LORD with all your heart.  And do not lean on your own understanding. (6) In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.Â”  [Pro 3:5-6 (NASB)].<br><br>Regards,<br>Paul Mah.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Paul,<br><br>fishing for compliments? i think Shiok is asking because you write far too well for an 18 year old guy serving his NS. either that or you deferred serving your NS until you completed your university education.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly, I just feel that the act of including religion into a love equation is really cruel. And christianity and Islamic teachings did exactly that, which I feel is really discriminating agst other religion.<br><br>I did hv frens, 1 Muslim and 1 Christian who went into a relationship. It was torturous for both of them, and in the end they split. It was well expected by everyone, since there were so many conflicts between the 2 religion.<br><br>Believe I can take PaulMah's posting as the standard teaching of Christianity. I know by all means its not definitive to all, but at least the Bible says so...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?
