              <p>nowadays, to set up a simple store selling merchandise. e.g. food, clothes, etc cost around $100k, inclusive of rent, renovation. and depending on your cost of goods, it might cost more if your goods are of high-tech nature e.g. handphones, electronics etc</p>
              <p>after paying for housing, how many people have the cash at hand to invest $100k into starting up a business? and not to forget that  it take time to build up a business base, so an aspiring entreprenuer should expect 3-6 months of continuous loss before making a profit.</p>
              <p>my point here is that now, even if you are willing to face the hardship, it is hard enough even to get the opportunity to be an entreprenuer.</p>
              <p>go and ask a foreign worker about the cost of doing business in their homeland.</p>
              <p>they just need a few hundred to thousand sing dollar, to get their goods and rent a shop space.</p>
              <p>and for M'sian, $50k is enough to <strong>buy </strong> them a shophouse to do business, and they would save on monthly rental fee.</p>
              <p>in S'pore, your 100k is only sufficient to pay off the rental deposit, which would be forfeited if you decided to terminate your business before your rental contract ends.</p>

              <p>The reason Sg has so few independent business starters is due to a few things, imho.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1: High level of education. Being educated at uni and polytech makes you a better employee, but not a better out of the box thinker.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Westerners call the results of education focussed cultures "robots".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People in Hong Kong have also noticed the same problem there. There are very few big movers and shakers in HK now who are not old money. Current generation people just want to get into uni and find jobs, not open the companies which become the boss.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2: The Govt, as a result of it's policies, has clamped down on many things which, as a side effect, make initiative and forward thinking limited.</p>
              <p>For example, by heavy censorship of the type of music and state controlled television, Singapore has a small entertainment industry.  Just compare this to Hong Kong. Just one city, but it's entertainment in music, tv and movies has strong influence all over asia, and reaches out to all the asians in Western countries as well.</p>
              <p>Thus no one can truly venture out and express themselves artistically, because there are limited state sponsored tv jobs, and almost no music or movie jobs. This means there are also few authors, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. One other thing which has been mentioned to me is the fact that the Govt actually steals ideas. I've been told of a couple of examples a few years ago where someone applied to have their company registered to do a certain thing. It was rejected. Soon after, the Govt opens it's own version. I can't confirm this, but......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. The Govt also has it's fingers in too many pies. Through Temasek, it owns, directly or indirectly, over 50% of the economy. How can you compete with a body which makes the laws, which has hundreds of billions of dollars behind it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What do you guys think? Did I miss anything?</p>
