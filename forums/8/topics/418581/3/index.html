              <p>i think the rental is the most important part the government should look into, to encourage entreprenership.</p>
              <p>it is common practice now for landlords to collect 6 months downpayment for store rental. and this rental fee already make up the bulk of the operating expense.</p>
              <p>furthermore, the rental fee per sq foot is also too high to attract enough people to start their own business.</p>

              <p>i think the rental is the most important part the government
              should look into, to encourage entreprenership.</p>
              <p>it is common practice now for landlords to collect 6 months
              downpayment for store rental. and this rental fee already make up
              the bulk of the operating expense.</p>
              <p>furthermore, the rental fee per sq foot is also too high to
              attract enough people to start their own business.</p>
              <p>how would you have any goods to sell if the bulk of your money
              in spent on procuring a shopfront or office?</p>

              <p>Agreed. Maybe govt should give free office or shop space or start a regulation to lower rentals....</p>

              <p>one such "solution" spurn out was to encourage people to start from pushcarts.</p>
              <p>but imo, no one really takes pushcart sales seriously.</p>
              <p>e.g. if you need to buy something, you would tend to go to a more "reputable" shop which has an actual shopfront, than to buy from a pushcart,</p>
              <p>a pushcart is more for the spur-of-the-moment purchases.</p>

              <p>nowadays, to set up a simple store selling merchandise. e.g. food, clothes, etc cost around $100k, inclusive of rent, renovation. and depending on your cost of goods, it might cost more if your goods are of high-tech nature e.g. handphones, electronics etc</p>
              <p>after paying for housing, how many people have the cash at hand to invest $100k into starting up a business? and not to forget that  it take time to build up a business base, so an aspiring entreprenuer should expect 3-6 months of continuous loss before making a profit.</p>
              <p>my point here is that now, even if you are willing to face the hardship, it is hard enough even to get the opportunity to be an entreprenuer.</p>
              <p>go and ask a foreign worker about the cost of doing business in their homeland.</p>
              <p>they just need a few hundred to thousand sing dollar, to get their goods and rent a shop space.</p>
              <p>and for M'sian, $50k is enough to <strong>buy  </strong>them a shophouse to do business, and they would save on monthly rental fee.</p>
              <p>in S'pore, your 100k is only sufficient to pay off the rental deposit, which would be forfeited if you decided to terminate your business before your rental contract ends.</p>

              <p>If declaring the nature of its bizness will affect his

                  profit is sustainable over the long run...it clearly shows that the
                  level of entry into such a bizness is low...and thus not as good as
                  it seem...&gt;&lt;"</p>
              <p>I myself started a trading bizness couple of years back while
                  working at the same time..i remmeber first year turnover was 100k++
                  with 300 - 800k subsequently per annum....although it is only a
                  tiny bizness...i have to say that profit margin of more then 50%
                  definitely make it a very lucrative bizness....&gt;&lt;"</p>
              <p>But never in my life if people ask me what type of bizness do i
