            <div class='col-md body'>Location. Galway, Ireland<br>Date: May 2 2006   Time: 1900<br><br>A mother and father were putting their 2 young children to bed and the mother was sitting in the armchair when she caught a glimpse of something stride past the living room door. She says stride, because the figure was about 6ft tall and had very long legs. Terrified she told her fiancÃ© what she saw. He did not believe her, so she switched places and sat in the other armchair beside the window. A few moments later she turned to speak to her fiancÃ© and as she turned the entity was standing right beside her. Her fiancÃ© did not see it at this time but knew that something was very wrong and that she was not imagining it. Then the father/fiancÃ©e caught a glimpse of the figure while he sat on the sofa by the living room door changing the baby's diaper. They decided that they could not stay in the house and went to her mother's house nearby. She described the being as at least 6ft tall without hair, no facial features were visible although somehow she knew it had facial features, it was naked only there was no actual genitalia and was what she describes as the most ugliest color of yellow she had ever seen. Soon after the incident the couple went abroad to Portugal and she was taken into a Portuguese hospital complaining of feeling extremely weak and with pains all over the body.<br><br>Location. Bragg Creek, Alberta, Canada<br>Date: January 30 2006     Time: 0200A<br><br>A low humming sound and clattering against all the windows of the house awakened two witnesses. They looked outside and saw 20 or more tiny blue lights in the sky. They quickly picked up the video camera and began to film the. The objects were very high in the sky, and moved freely in any direction or hovered together, one on top of the other a few miles apart in the sky. This continued for about an hour. They then noticed the objects getting much larger, as they slowly descended to earth. They claimed they managed to get one or two close up on video but the quality was not the best. The ridge above the house, about 11/2 miles to the north, began to emit a day-like glow. Most of the objects were no longer visible but the humming sound had become almost deafening. Suddenly a strong wind began to rip at the house, out of the north, the light pulsated in the horizon and clouds of smoke appeared to rise up slowly from each light, there were about six lit up areas. One of the witnesses attempted to call somebody on the phone but it was not working, it was making a peculiar buzzing sound. They then both leaned out the window to see better and listen. Soon they heard a very eerie howl, not like any coyote they had ever heard, almost like a siren, but not as perfect. It was followed by a loud blood-curdling deep scream, definitely not human. It filled the entire valley, and what followed was odd for mid winter in Canada, a warm strong breeze came from the north, almost hot, and it smelled like burning plastic, or something similar. The sensor light outside kept coming on and they heard crashing and banging against the house, scratching through the walls on every side. Both witnesses then saw a tall very pale figure that had a human-like shape and glowing eyes, running across the driveway. Petrified, they shut themselves in and listened intently. They looked out the window for a bit longer to see the smoke puff up from the lighted hilltops again, and again saw tiny blue lights like they had seen earlier that shot up, hover briefly and then began getting smaller as they flew higher into the sky, they remained visible for a long time.<br></div>
