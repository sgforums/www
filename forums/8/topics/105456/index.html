            <div class='col-md body'>What you may get when u fly cheap airlines .....<br>Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen. This is your captain (mr chin chye<br>lai) welcoming you on board.....I apologise if I cannot see you...can<br>see nothing from my cockit anyway, lights not working....<br><br>We apologise for the delay in taking off, some minor problem, just<br>replace the engine, new engine cannibalised from the aircraft that<br>decided  to take a swim in the south china sea...<br><br>This is flight 126 from Senaisini to New Delhi. Landing in Delhi is  not<br>guaranteed, but we will end up somewhere in the region. And if luck is<br>on our side, we may even be landing on your village!<br><br>Standards are such  that even the terrorists are afraid to fly with us! It is<br>with pleasure that I announce that starting this year over 50 of our<br>passengers have reached their destination. For the ones that don't quite<br>make it, our staff  have all the requisite experience for consoling the next-<br>of-kin.<br><br>Our  stewardess, Anjali, will be happy to brief you on our out-of-court<br>settlement  policies. If our engines are too noisy for you, on passenger<br>request, we can arrange to turn them off. To make your free fall to earth<br>pleasant and memorable, we serve complimentary samosas and lassi.<br><br>For our not-so-religious  passengers, we are the only airline who can help<br>you find out if there really is  a God. We regret to inform you, that today's<br>in-flight movie ("Hands off  my chutney") will not be shown, as we forgot to<br>record it from the television.<br><br>But for our movie buffs, we will be flying alongside Singapore Airlines,<br>where their movie will be visible from the right side of the cabin window.<br><br>We regret to advise that smoking is prohibited on this flight. Any smoke<br>you see in the cabin is only the early warning system on the engines telling<br>us to slow down. Life jackets are positioned under your seats and free<br>bathing costumes are made available to the Aunties and swimming shorts<br>to  the Uncles.......it is likely that you will need them later.<br><br>Kindly be seated, keep your seat in an upright position for take off  and<br>fasten your belt. For those of you who can't find a seat belt, kindly fasten<br>your own belt to the arm of your seat. For those of you who don't have a<br>seat, do not hesitate to get in touch with our  stewardess,Anjali, who  will<br>explain how to fasten yourself to your suitcase. otherwise suka  lu  lah....<br><br>If I don't see you again, enjoy your flight with Air chinchye. Thank you</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Staff<br><br>Welcome back to the office after the long year-end holiday break of 2003.<br><br>Please be advised that there are new rules and regulations implemented to raise the efficiency of our company in 2004.<br><br>ATTIRE:<br>It is advised that you come to work dressed according to your  salary.<br><br>If we see you wearing Prada sneakers &amp; carrying a Gucci bag we  assume you  are doing well financially and therefore you do not need a raise.<br><br>If you dress poorly, you need to learn to manage your money better, so that  you may buy nicer clothes and therefore you do not need a raise.<br><br>If you dress in-between, you are right where you need to be and therefore you do not need a raise.<br><br>PERSONAL DAYS:<br>Each employee will receive 104 personal days a year. They are called Saturday &amp; Sunday.<br><br>LUNCH BREAK:<br>Skinny people get 30 minutes for lunch as they need to eat more so that they can look healthy. Normal size people get 15 minutes for lunch to get a balanced meal to maintain their average figure. Fat people get 5 minutes for lunch, because that's all the time needed to drink a Slim Fast and take a diet pill.<br><br>SICK DAYS:<br>We will no longer accept a doctor's statement as proof of sickness. If you are able to go to the doctor, you are able to come to work.<br><br>TOILET USE:<br>Entirely too much time is being spent in the toilets. There is now a strict 3-minute time limit in the cubicles. At the end of three minutes, an alarm will sound, the toilet paper roll will retract, the  door will open and a picture will be taken. After your second offence,  your picture will be posted on the company bulletin board under the "Chronic Offenders" category.<br><br>SURGERY:<br>As long as you are an employee here, you need all your organs. You should not consider removing anything. We hired you intact. To have something removed constitutes a breach of employment.<br><br>Thank you for your loyalty to our company. We are here to provide a positive employment experience. Therefore, all questions, comments, concerns, complaints, frustrations, irritations, aggravations, insinuations, allegations, accusations, contemplation, consternation and input should be directed elsewhere.<br><br>Have a nice day,<br><br>THE MANAGEMENT</div>
