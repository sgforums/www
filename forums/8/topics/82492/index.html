            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Last Friday, I attended a concert by China's 12 girls band.<br><br>I really enjoyed the show until I saw two monks getting to leave just before the end of the concert. Are monks allowed to view pop concerts where the performers are twelve gorgeous china chicks. Also they seemed very ill mannered to leave just before the end of the show?<br><br>My take is that they are afraid to be seen by the public as they also came when the lights were dimmed and the show had already started.Those monks really make me rethink my leaning towards buddhism. Money mad priests and monks relishing female performers. I am<br>strengthening my believe in being AGNOSTIC.<br><br>Why aren't monks like these censured. They give the religion a really bad name. When a layman follows a religion, he asks himself these<br>questions:<br><br>1.  Is this a practical religion to follow. Does it make sense. Can it stand close scrutiny and sustained questioning by skeptical minds.<br><br>2.  Can I live up to the religion's expectation of me. Sure doesn't want to be a hypocrite.<br><br>3.  Are those who practices this religion as a professional, ie. such as monks nuns etc. whose example in their conduct of life is something<br>I can emulate. They should set an example of  the kind of high ideals I can achieve if I were to follow their teachings. These two monks who<br>wore saffron robes to a show that is full of attachment because they are watching twelve gorgeous looking China chicks with rebonded hair<br>and sensuous figures sure doesn't set a good example.<br><br>Another bad example in recent days is the function put up by some tibetan buddhists at the vacant lot in Sims Avenue near the Aljunied<br>MRT station. As I walk around, I see it as a "pasar malam" promoting various knick knacks that is supposed to bring wealth and prosperity<br>instead of a function celebrating Buddha's birthday. Everything has a price and the idea probably is that if you buy, you will be prosperous.<br><br>Let me tell you that I am throwing away all the buddhist literature that I have accumulated and instead spending my money on wealth creation self improvement books and books on shares and stock investments. I feel that I have wasted many many hours reading rubbish. If I had spent my time more productively by reading up on investments, I should by now have been laughing all the way to the bank instead of being perplexed, confused and  let down.<br><br>And to hell with conmen and lustful paedophile priests, monks watching beautiful girls under the cover of darkness and pork eating monks who<br>wants to taste meat but at the same time wants to be a higher being than ordinary folks. I tell you, the whole thing stinks.<br><br>Buddha himself, did not specifically dictate (while he was on Earth) that monks should not eat meat or pork. You cannot choose or make "special request" from your givers when you go for alms. Whatever they give you, you eat, as long as it does not contain ten kinds of prohibited meats, for practical reasons as forest practitioners. The Mahayana tradition added the strict adherence to vegetarian food basically because they believe<br>Buddha had taught about this practice in Heavens.<br><br>My view is that whatever you eat, it involves killings. If you think you could avoid killings by eating vegetarian food, then that's delusion at its<br>height.  The moment the farmer plough his land, many worms would be killed. When the farmer wants to protect his crop, he killed the insects that come to feed on his crops. Thus, eating even vegetarian food, is still eating the end result of killings. The clearer mind would recognize that our living is based on other live forms' sarcrifices. Thus, we should treasure this most so to make good use of our human life form to achieve Nirvana and in return, help these live forms that make their sarcrifices to progress as well. Thus, no matter what we eat, we must feel grateful to all those living beings that make their sarcrifices to make our living possible. Chant for them and transfer all merits due to our practices, to them. This is the most fundamental practice.<br><br>According to the strict precepts that monks must adhere to, watching dance or entertainment performances are prohibited. If they are really ordained monks, they have breached the most fundamental eight precepts..<br><br>In any religion, groups or organization, there will always be black sheeps around. Don't give up your long journey just because of few grains of sand in your shoes.<br><br>There will always be, the good, the bad and the ugly in every religion.<br><br>And Who's NEXT!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bill Goldberg, I totally agree with you. Black sheeps will always exist in our society. I would refer them as corrupted individuals. They are everywhere...not only in religions.<br><br>But don't make those black sheeps shaken your faith in your own religion. I believe religion should be individual, what you perceive from a religion itself may not be the same as what others have perceived.<br><br>So hold on to your faith and continue to believe in what you think is righteous in your religion. Afterall, religion is there to make their  believers a better individuals and never to corrupt them.<br><br>I hope you can regain your confidence in your religion and hold on to your faith once again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
