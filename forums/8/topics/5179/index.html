            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, i got this from Sammy Leong's website and maybe it is worth a thought on how media easily give credit to Singapore.<br><br>Do you notice how newspaper would say Singapore-born Vanessa Mae?<br><br>Vanessa Mae is born in Singapore and soon went to UK for her studies and stuff. She is now living there. (I am quite unsure of her nationality, but I think she is a British now since she has to comply with UK's chaperon laws).<br><br>Annabel Chong, although not born in Singapore, received her education in Singapore and went to US after her Os/Poly?.<br><br>So how has being born in Singapore contribute to Vanessa's success?<br><br>ANy words on Annabel??<br>She is the first person to break a "world-record" in some physical activities that I wun say.<br><br>heheh.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sianz Guy, Annabel Chong is the S'porean who sort of break the world record for having sex with the most number of men(more than a hundred... dunno how many...) in I think 1 or 2 hrs or something like dat...<br><br>Ponders, really can't see how Singapore contribute to their success... I say success for Annabel also becos if the society is not agst sex orgy... hers wud be a success in her own field also... i think I hv a new post here rgdg the society...<br><br>S'pore neither hv the creativity nor openess to cultivate either of these 2 rare breed to be associated with them. Unless maybe the traditional strangle on Annabel made her felt so deprive that she decided on such a feat...<br><br>As for Vanessa, I think its more of an inborn talent, isn't it?<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>yup.. i think it could be inborn talent.<br>But if you look at the papers, they made it sound that being born in Singapore is what made Vanessa Mae who she is now.<br><br>Just like the Mount Everest ppl. who turned out to be PRs instead of citizens.<br><br>To save their own faces (politicians'), they phrased the sentence nicely, saying something like this, 'it is singapore who provided them the means to attempt such feats'.<br><br>hmm.. i dun really know Annabel's highest qualification achieved in Singapore, jc/poly/Os. I dun really know.<br><br>There was this interview done, saying she felt very repressed when she go back to Singapore. Pity her parents who know only much later what she have been doing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm if you are talking about 1999 NDP where i happened to be in Sg. I dun think that's Van Mae if i remeber correctly.<br><br>Van Mae is this violinist who is the youngest person ever to do a piece by Bach.<br>I dunno whether I am right, but i remember it as a person who was the youngest to do something.<br><br>She had a Thai father thus explaining the "mae" part.

            <div class='col-md body'>Seow Lee Chin was the one who played "Flight into the millenium" at NDP 99. Vanessa Mae's first album is reali "power", esp the last track, if my memory does not fail me, it should be "red hot"? <strong>if u dun have it, go and get it. </strong><br><br>as for the "infamous" Annabelle Chong, she was from RGS and my alma mater(HCJC). read in a mag that she is a gifted child and was pursuing Law in UK after her "Air" Level. but she was raped there and this marred her life. mayb, this is wat reali depressed her and made her to take up... ermmm u noe...<br><br>being borned in sg contributes to Vanessa's success? nay.. juz like Seow Lee Chin, Vanessa did not pick up her fantastic playing skills locally but abroad.<br><br>the media is onli trying to exaggerate that sgreans can b renowned for their achievements abroad coz it is in a blue moon's time will sg citizens b recognised.( not in the case for Annabelle).<br><br>Annabelle shocked the world coz no Asians had done wat she has done...<br><br>------------------<br>who else but me......<br><br>[This message has been edited by fingers (edited 13-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Isn't it amazing how people take credit for the good stuff and not the bad? Trust the papers to always want to harp about Van Mae being "Singapore born" as if that contributed to the fact that she's now a first-class violin player! And Annabel Chong, well, lets just say that people/institutions assoc with her don't want any credit for it eh? If after breaking the "record" she recieved a Nobel Peace Prize or something, you can bet your ass the whole world will try to take credit for it. Like firewire said, its all govt propoganda, and all govts are guilty of it, so there's not much we can do abt that... ladidaa<br><br>Firewire&gt; I loved the book! But i dunnoe if i want to watch the movie... i just know i'll cry at the part when Boxer dies... yeah my friend and I were quite surprised when we saw the poster, and i'm not surprised that parents brought their children in, the title sounds like some happy "enid blyton" story anyways... I wonder if 1984 is in the making?<br></div>
