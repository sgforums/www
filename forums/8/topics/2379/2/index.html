So, if there are aliens, there will be no religions, therefore no more morals, no more conscience for Man - people can commit various crimes and sex around without feeling guilty..which is why 'UFO'is more than meet the eye.......a despicable hoax to human.....and "they" are trying to lure our attention away from knowing why exactly are we on Earth..<br>I know you guys dont know what I am talking about..<br>but I hope some people here understands me.</div>

They can kill you with a gun (which is a common item in the market) and throw your body in the sea, and the killer could not be captured.<br>Can u Imagine this?<br>And now imagine that if Aliens exist and religion DOES NOT, what will happen to this world?<br><br>Also, many unrighteous acts cannot be brought forward to the police in some reasons or another, example:<br><br>steal money from parents,<br>(many parents dont bring their child to the court)<br><br>framing others verbally<br>(unless you are sued by the victim, you wont go to jail)<br><br>peeping sister bathing<br>(again, will you bring your son to the police if he peeps your daughter bathe?)<br><br>going to whore-house to have sex<br>(this is officially announced as NOT a crime, but why do we feel guilty the first time we have sex with whores?)<br><br>plotting murder strategy,<br>(unless you successfully killed the person,<br>you will not be charged for this)<br><br>committing suicide<br>(it is against the law....but who cares? the person is already dead)<br><br>telling lies to get good-pay jobs<br>(lies.....why do we feel guilty when telling lies? Why do we know that telling lie is a bad thing..?)<br><br>incest<br>(it's not a crime, unless you are sued..but deep in our heart we know it is not right)<br><br>The list is endless to human-crimes which, more often, cannot be brought to justice.<br><br>And in the future when oil runs out and Nuclear Warfare wages across the World, in such a chaotic world, Law itself WILL NOT be able to hold on much longer.<br>And That's why the 'existence' of Aliens will give people a peace of mind to commit crimes without feeling guilty.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 23 November 2001).]</div>
