              <p>hey, i am new to this forum, so anything pls guide me through. thanks.</p>
              <p>okay, being a student in a rather good school in singapore, i cant help it but feel astonished about the inappropriate behavior that teachers display. These behaviors are totally unreasonable and childish in my eyes, from a perspective of a student. therefore, i would like to see how you people feel about this controversial topic. " Because i am a teacher"</p>
              <p>In the school rules, it is stated that, " shirts must be tucked in, no wearing of coloured shoes/ inappropraite footwear, no ankle socks and etc" therefore, these rules, if not abided, students will be punished. but in contrary, what if teacher breaks them. teachers march in the school with ankle socks and coloured shoes, brown hair, striking ear piercings, and shirts untucked. I know that this isnt wrong. But the question is, is it right. things that teachers can do and students cant, are they right? yes, students may argue, but we often find ourselves cornered in an arguement when it comes to their rights. " because i am a teacher." so this is kind of example that we're suppose to look up to? I say no. i say teachers, are like police. police do not have to right to break the law, unless it falls under the section of general exceptions in the penal code. but that doesnt give them the right to kill and etc. therefore, the arguement is now, we, students are suppose to follow the teachers (supposingly role models), and break the school rules? or are we supposed to practice self disclipline, and do not follow the teachers. Though there are of course other means, which is to alter the school rules or perhaps punishing the teachers? they are the teachers of singapore futures. they are the parents of singapore's fruits. and this is what they doing? i don think so, not quite a bit. its been always the students and the pupils. for once, make this the teacher. make it right. if such behavior does not stop, what will it lead to. students would do this in the FUTURE! they would do this because they are what they are! they are what they're taught! students now have this social stigma that is preventing them to excel in school because of what they're facing! this is becoming the key to singapore's failure in nurturing out their successors. </p>
              <p>So, Make it Right. netizens, i am shouting out to all adults, to stand up. for your children in school facing such treatmeant. the abuse of power. god, whats next? corruption of our money? taking disclipine actions which includes coporal punishment? make it right people. make it right adults.</p>

              <p>The way you put things, it's almost as though you're placed in a federal Supermax prison or something. Get real. You are a student. Some of your rights are curtailed for a reason, the foremost being the need to inculcate a sense of discipline within you.</p>
              <p>You can wax lyrical all you want about how discipline curtails creativity, but in the end, we all need it. Even the most creative geniuses of all time needed discipline to pull off their works of art. </p>
              <p>If this is your attitude towards discipline in the education system, then I seriously wonder how you'll fare in the army. Good luck to you.</p>

              <p>hey, i am new to this forum, so anything pls guide me through.
                  thanks.</p>
              <p>okay, being a student in a rather good school in singapore, i
                  cant help it but feel astonished about the inappropriate behavior
                  that teachers display. These behaviors are totally unreasonable and
                  childish in my eyes, from a perspective of a student. therefore, i
                  would like to see how you people feel about this controversial
                  topic. " Because i am a teacher"</p>
              <p>In the school rules, it is stated that, " shirts must be tucked
                  in, no wearing of coloured shoes/ inappropraite footwear, no ankle
                  socks and etc" therefore, these rules, if not abided, students will
                  be punished. but in contrary, what if teacher breaks them. teachers
                  march in the school with ankle socks and coloured shoes, brown
                  hair, striking ear piercings, and shirts untucked. I know that this
                  isnt wrong. But the question is, is it right. things that teachers
                  can do and students cant, are they right? yes, students may argue,
                  but we often find ourselves cornered in an arguement when it comes
                  to their rights. " because i am a teacher." so this is kind of
                  example that we're suppose to look up to? I say no. i say teachers,
                  are like police. police do not have to right to break the law,
                  unless it falls under the section of general exceptions in the
                  penal code. but that doesnt give them the right to kill and etc.
                  therefore, the arguement is now, we, students are suppose to follow
                  the teachers (supposingly role models), and break the school rules?
                  or are we supposed to practice self disclipline, and do not follow
                  the teachers. Though there are of course other means, which is to
                  alter the school rules or perhaps punishing the teachers? they are
                  the teachers of singapore futures. they are the parents of
                  singapore's fruits. and this is what they doing? i don think so,
                  not quite a bit. its been always the students and the pupils. for
                  once, make this the teacher. make it right. if such behavior does
                  not stop, what will it lead to. students would do this in the
                  FUTURE! they would do this because they are what they are! they are
                  what they're taught! students now have this social stigma that is
                  preventing them to excel in school because of what they're facing!
                  this is becoming the key to singapore's failure in nurturing out
                  their successors. </p>
              <p>So, Make it Right. netizens, i am shouting out to all adults, to
                  stand up. for your children in school facing such treatmeant. the
                  abuse of power. god, whats next? corruption of our money? taking
                  disclipine actions which includes coporal punishment? make it right
                  people. make it right adults.</p>

              <p>Looking at management perspective: The teachers' dress codes are taken care by the respective principal and HOD. So you students just have to follow the school rules which take care of you.  </p>
              <p>Looking at fashion and style perspective: You have to dress and look what a school student intend to look. So you can fit the whole image. IT IS STYLE, you know!</p>
              <p>In any case, you can always quit school. </p>

              <p>Sometimes, even if the teacher breaks the rules, it does not mean that you have to as well, despite the fact that they are *role models*.</p>
              <p>A simple example - just because your relative smokes, does it mean you have to follow in his/her example and commit the same mistake as well?</p>
              <p>And Singaporean teachers are far from being role models - which I do not blame them for. Like any other profession, teaching is a job. Granted that teachers very often play a crucial role in sculpting the students' character, it cannot be denied that the parents very often place responsibilities far to heavy for a teacher to handle. A teacher has to look after 20-30 students - as far as I'm concerned, it is already difficult enough to ensure a single child is well brought up.</p>
              <p>I believe that your entire argument revolves around the conclusion that teachers are the mothers/saints that hold the responsibility of inculcating proper values - hence the deduction that "they are
                                      the teachers of singapore futures. they are the parents of
                                      singapore's fruits". That is false.</p>
              <p>I am a student myself, going on to jc1 next year. I completely understand how frustrating it can be when a teacher plays the card of them "being teachers". However, role models are for you to decide; not determined simply because societal standards dictates so. Your role model can be as humble a person as the old man who lives next door, or even your siblings. It should not be a teacher just because the school expects them to be.</p>
              <p>Character wise, I do not expect a saint of a teacher. However, the flaws should not compromise their ability to teach, which is their primary purpose in the education system. Should their inaptitude (character, knowledge of syllabus or otherwise) affect my studies, it would then be valid for the issue to be raised.</p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>

              <p>Strict dress codes in school are pretty idiotic to begin with.</p>
              <p>Always amazes me how an entire country will tell their kids from young on that they are nothing special, just ordinary and they have no creativity.</p>
              <p>Because yes. thats what uniforms do to children if you just let them wear them. They will feel like everyone else, no individuality. </p>
              <p>So later on you just create more people who always need to ask someone for permission to do something, ask for advice, too afraid to stand up for themselfs, makes excuses to why their life is perfect although its not etc. etc.</p>
              <p>Obviously wearing uniforms does not do this by itself... but its a start since it happens in the childhood.</p>
              <p>And the entire: "do this because I am your father" "do this because I am your teacher"..... thats the worst stuff ever.. seriously listen to yourselfs... don't you realize that your only doing this because someone DID THIS TO YOU? You followed some rule when your a child, like wearing uniforms.. so you MAKE your children do the same stuff again and again and you don't even know WHY.. just because someone TOLD YOU to do it a long time ago and you use the EXACT same reasoning someone gave to you when you were young.<br>So your children will do it to someone AGAIN to someone when they are old... you will NEVER progress or grow AT ALL. Sigh k thats a bit off topic but its an even bigger problem, but don't worry.. that problem exists world wide to some extend.</p>
              <p>Man I hope that one day people will wake up.... not just to uniforms, but to everything.</p>
