              <p>Uniform is a form of identity for people to identify who you are and
              your purpose. It would be difficult to differentiate a student from any
              outsider kids if everyone were to be allowed to wear whatever they want
              to school and let outsiders use the school's facilities when they don't belong.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the uniform will make all students equal so those from more well to do and less well to do families will still be relatively equal in school. If they were allowed to dress casually in their own clothes, there will be a pretty clear seperation between poor and rich in schools and that can affect unity as well as other social and life skills students learn in their academic journey.</p>

              <p>Just to add on to dkxc's point:</p>
              <p>The standardised dress code ensures that students are able to concentrate on what they are supposed to do in school, i.e. learn, and not go about chasing the latest trends and suffering from the side effects of materialism.</p>
              <p>As much as meritocracy prevails, there is never a ground zero. Students come from all walks of life, and standardisation of the dress code is an attempt at levelling the playing field.</p>

              <p>uhh.now i get your point.</p>
              <p>well, in the 1st place,it was meant to be a little rude or 'insultive' in your terms, so as to make a bigger impact for him to realise that his ideas were inmature.</p>
              <p>well,maybe the way i spoke was too inpolite. due to my shortcoming for being respectful to elders/teachers , thus i felt a little infuriated when the TS portrayed teachers as bad bad eggs when the actions ( as described by TS) wasn't that bad. hence, the reason for my 'outburst'. haha. in anyway, my message for TS is to be more mature and learn to be respectful, ( also to shake away the pettyness), it'd help him in his future endeavours.</p>
              <p>and lastly, peace to larryteo. no harm sharing ideas, but hope it don't lead to a flaming war.=D</p>

You might think that what you have reason out is correct, however like what latecomerX said, 5 years later you would be thinking why the hell am i thinking this way. I hope you take our views seriously. Rather than asking if what we believe is right, try to think about why we said all those.

              <p>hey, i am new to this forum, so anything pls guide me through. thanks.</p>
              <p>okay, being a student in a rather good school in singapore, i cant help it but feel astonished about the inappropriate behavior that teachers display. These behaviors are totally unreasonable and childish in my eyes, from a perspective of a student. therefore, i would like to see how you people feel about this controversial topic. " Because i am a teacher"</p>
              <p>In the school rules, it is stated that, " shirts must be tucked in, no wearing of coloured shoes/ inappropraite footwear, no ankle socks and etc" therefore, these rules, if not abided, students will be punished. but in contrary, what if teacher breaks them. teachers march in the school with ankle socks and coloured shoes, brown hair, striking ear piercings, and shirts untucked. I know that this isnt wrong. But the question is, is it right. things that teachers can do and students cant, are they right? yes, students may argue, but we often find ourselves cornered in an arguement when it comes to their rights. " because i am a teacher." so this is kind of example that we're suppose to look up to? I say no. i say teachers, are like police. police do not have to right to break the law, unless it falls under the section of general exceptions in the penal code. but that doesnt give them the right to kill and etc. therefore, the arguement is now, we, students are suppose to follow the teachers (supposingly role models), and break the school rules? or are we supposed to practice self disclipline, and do not follow the teachers. Though there are of course other means, which is to alter the school rules or perhaps punishing the teachers? they are the teachers of singapore futures. they are the parents of singapore's fruits. and this is what they doing? i don think so, not quite a bit. its been always the students and the pupils. for once, make this the teacher. make it right. if such behavior does not stop, what will it lead to. students would do this in the FUTURE! they would do this because they are what they are! they are what they're taught! students now have this social stigma that is preventing them to excel in school because of what they're facing! this is becoming the key to singapore's failure in nurturing out their successors.Â </p>
              <p>So, Make it Right. netizens, i am shouting out to all adults, to stand up. for your children in school facing such treatmeant. the abuse of power. god, whats next? corruption of our money? taking disclipine actions which includes coporal punishment? make it right people. make it right adults.</p>

              <p><br>Because as non-adults (i.e. children, teenagers), the authorities around you will be trying to mould you into proper law-abiding citizens and contributor of the economy. Therefore, the rules...to inculcate a sense of discipline, or at least, a good habit. Rules in school are attempts to stop students from straying too far apart from the 'good path'.</p>
              <p>True, as the student slowly grows into adulthood, he/she may learn nothing about discipline or responsibilities and the like.</p>
              <p>But as nobody is going to put excessive effort into teaching an adult manners. As an adult, it is assumed that you know how to behave, or at the very least, understand the consequences of actions you do. They are thus given more freedom in the area of 'less important things' like fashion, while taking up much more responsibility like putting up good performances at work and feeding their family.</p>
              <p>Makes logical sense or not, it's another matter. Society works this way.</p>
              <p>Anyway, as you grow up, you'll realise that there's actually much more important/critical issues in this world than 'why do I have to wear proper uniform and follow the rules?'</p>

              <p>The fundamental flaw of this entire argument is that while students are bound by the uniform dress code, teachers are not.Â  The analogy drawn with the police is therefore false since the student dress code, unlike the penal code, is not universal.</p>
              <p>10 points for effort, zero for cogency.Â  As Thomas Huxley said, there is nothing so tragic as the collision of a beautiful theory with a single inconvenient fact.</p>

              <p>okay, being a student in a rather good school in singapore, i
              cant help it but feel astonished about the inappropriate behavior
              that teachers display. These behaviors are totally unreasonable and

              <p>well,maybe the way i spoke was too inpolite. due to my
              shortcoming for being respectful to elders/teachers , thus i felt a
              little infuriated when the TS portrayed teachers as bad bad eggs
              when the actions ( as described by TS) wasn't that bad. hence, the
              reason for my 'outburst'. haha. in anyway, my message for TS is to
              be more mature and learn to be respectful, ( also to shake away the

              <p><br>Be a good little boy. Always do as your told. Get straight As, get into a good uni (preferable abroad!!), get even more straight As, come back to Singapore and become Â a banker (because that is where the money is!!!!!), make a lot of money and always work, make a family and preferably have a child, grow old and die.</p>
              <p>That would be one way... sound good? That is the path that will happen if you let other people tell you what to do and "mould" you into society. The moment your old and will die soon you will realize that you have wasted your life.</p>
              <p>What you have seen now is a small glimpse of what happens when you see society for what it is. Did you ever wonder why your teacher does not follow dress codes? Why do you think they come to school without their shirt tugged in? What does it say about his character and why do you think he has become this way?Â </p>
              <p>Do you want to become that way?</p>
              <p>The thing is we all have to make a choice.. do we follow what our elders tell us, do we accept the fact that we are in a "rebellious age" and hence we will follow the "good path" soon? Is the "good path" really good?</p>
              <p>Look whatever anyone is saying in here about this is how society works bla bla bla.... your teacher is a perfect example where that will lead.</p>
              <p>The uniform part.. yes you should wear the uniform, but its for different reasons. You will need self discipline later on in life, not because people tell you to do something, but because you need it to push yourself to do the things you like. Since throughout your life you will have narrow minded people constantly telling you that this is they way things should be done.. although they are dead wrong and they are stuck in their own life, in their own relationships, in their own happiness.</p>

              <p>Kid, there are plenty of things that you should be worrying about, and the uniforms you wear or the colour of your teacher's hair should somewhere far, far down the list.

              <p>Uniform is a form of identity for people to identify who you are and your purpose.

              <p><strong>Furthermore, the uniform will make all students equal so those from more well to do and less well to do families will still be relatively equal in school.
