            <div class='col-md body'>thanks for you all posting up all of your arugment on this and that, i appreciate very much and i knew that there will be someone who go into these post will be able to understand what i have been expressing all this time, my bible knowleage is not as high as most of u all but i will try catching up with you all, in the mean time i still have many question and still been looking for someone which have study, thinking, and giving me their points.<br>it may be offencive but some of the people i talk to dun understand what i try telling them because they have really (believe)in this bible and in their mind...the bible is always right. if you are one of them, try to read over my statement if u free... using the mind and heart before you were a christ or even readed the bible before.<br><br>people like meg25, obiwan and yidd from what i see can truely see wat i saying, and yidd i really appreacite your quote on some (errors) of bible.<br><br>people like rubberduckie and fisherspice have study christ and trust me, i have total faith in god, and son of god jesus, i din say god's word are wrong but i did say that what god say to human being.... they may have misunderstood causing doubt in bible.<br><br>for one question, there could be more than one answer, and one answer could led to many question...<br><br>i have say it once, god have truly touch me, and that is the reason which y i have been spending time on him, if not, y should i bother? but what god have say to us, we as  a human, which is not perfect, could have misunderstood him, let alone those evil-doing which may have change any thing possible in the bible.<br><br>1 question, same as last time, i need you to think and no thanks for answer for i have ask too many people and each with different answer so i guess yours is no difference....<br><br>how do god communicate with you? heart and feeling?......is god fair?..... when you create a sin do you ever feel guilty?..... now in the bible i forget what qoute that say man is made supreme to animal is it true?.... does man can eat meat?...... if all the answer is yes.... jus think about this question...<br><br>you walk into a farm, ur fre jus invite you over for a treat, when you enter the farm, you saw a sheep jus born a baby lamb, a new life is born!!! the lamb in no time was trying to walk when suddenly your fre call you into the house for dinner....minutes later ur dinner was serve, it was lamb chop, tasty and well-done, you chat with your fre about old good time and 2 hours later u know u have to leave. once u step outside his house you saw the newborn lamb crying for his mum, .....( his mum was the one which u jus ate ) now do u have any guilty in ur heart or feeling? remember you have jus broke a family, god is fair , do you think he will forgive you, they are also living thing, a object which also need love and caring....if your answer is god's words in the BIBLE qoute that animal are create for man to eat... or even eating meat are being (clense).....  then read all over again my statement on what is happening....<br><br>i have no answer to this question for i was not there when god say his words... but yet i know...god dun jus give us a heart and a brain for nothing.... a heart to feel and a brain to think....<br><br>a example to let u ponder, lets say a movie, based on a TRUE story, black hawk down, it was say that 18 of the delta force was kill and 1000+ enemy die, but did they have the exact information on how each of them die? (leave no man behind) if you believe is true then perhaps they have bought back the body but do they have every detail on their dead case? yet this movie is very good and u believe its true as it has a interesting (plot?).<br>same goes to the bible... people which is human, may have change anything which they perhaps dunno and add in other type of info which they knew it happen but was not there. jus think will do for i have no answer to any one of the question i make..<br><br>i can't prove you that all reglion goes to god yet... but in my heart, i alone and perhaps me , myself and only me knows that all reglion which their ways are in the end lead to god...the one who create everything including me or you. the only one which help me all these years, no matter when i start believe on chirst...or buddlism......, he was always there helping me....<br><br>------------------<br>Understand a man, know the man, think through like the man.... before any answer is given to him.</div>
