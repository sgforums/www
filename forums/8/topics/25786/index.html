It takes a lot of time and effort and sometimes have to follow-up and such.<br><br>But anyway, forgetting a person whom you once love deeply is never easy, it takes years to forget and you need to try <strong>real hard</strong> not to think about him anymore.

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course it's easier to counsel someone else, because you are not the one suffering, unless you've been through it yourself. That's why I won't even say "I understand", because I know I'll not understand how you feel, and so if I say that, I'll be lying to you anyway.<br><br>It's difficult to get over someone so good, but the situation is that your fate with him has ended, paving way for possibly another fate which you may meet another him. At least you did have good times with him, so you are fortunate that when you think back sometimes, there are wonderful memories, so you should treasure them. But keep thinking about it will bring you nowhere, so you can try divert your attention to something else. I don't know what will be good for you though, you should know yourself best.<br><br>You may bemoan you may never meet another guy as good as him ever, but the fact is you are no longer with him, so no matter how much you think, you'll only be living in the past. It's time to move on. You may not know when, but one day you'll just wake up and decide - "I'll start my life all over again."</div>
