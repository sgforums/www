'It'll take another two months after that before all buses are converted to the new system.'<br><br>A satellite tracks where buses are along their routes in relation to bus stops and updates fare stages accordingly.<br><br>All 4,000 bus stops had to be mapped precisely, as well as the routes of about 3,600 SBS and Tibs buses. The system works with the ez-link farecard readers to determine how much to charge for a ride.<br><br>Currently, bus drivers have to update the system manually at each fare stage, which typically consists of two bus stops. If this is not done correctly, wrong fares are charged.<br><br>Mr Prakasam said that about 95 per cent of drivers remember to do so but an automated system, which the LTA has been working on since last year, means they will not have to.<br><br>SBS Transit had said that it would have been 'ideal' to launch it at the same time as ez-link last April, but the LTA said the contactless farecard's basic system needed to be 'stabilised' first.<br><br>Mr Prakasam said several technical issues had to be worked out, both with hardware and software and the system is still acting up at 10 'problematic' bus stops, mostly downtown.<br><br>He said they had also managed to 'wake up' the system before it reached a bus stop so that it could process exits by people tapping their cards while the bus was still travelling.<br><br>He said the December deadline should be achievable. 'Software has a way of embarrassing you,' he qualified. 'So I'm keeping my fingers crossed.'<br><br>The new system is part of a $300 million ez-link contract given to ERG, an Australian company which incurred a loss of about A$200 million (S$238 million) for the year ended June 30, and A$250 million for the previous year.</blockquote>NEXT WILL BE ERP VIA GPS</div>
