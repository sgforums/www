Apparently the system overcharged her or something and the cashier had to scribble something on the receipt in order to refund the overcharged amount to the customer so that her cash total would balance for the day.<br><br>But this woman was totally rude and acting like an animal towards the cashier, who said nothing back for all her abuses. <span style="color: red;"><span class="large">She claimed </span></span>she was a "f-ing English teach at Raffles Girls' Secondary" and her father is in the police. Is this how educated people should act? Is this how a schoolteacher should behave? Is this how a teacher from Singapore's top school should conduct herself? It is such a small issue and did this even justify making a scene over, and one with all the obscenities one can find in the English language?<br><br>I wonder if she can be punished properly. An indian lady could not put up with her language told her to mind her language and reprimanded the security guard for not calling in the police for all the bad vocabulary that the "RGS teacher" was using.
