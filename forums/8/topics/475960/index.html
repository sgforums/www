              hello Jimmy. Just one question. Do you really need to think about this thing while you are still studying? If you ever meet a girl who is a gold digger and she is arrogant towards you...tell her to go to Australia to become an Opal Digger lols.
              
              I think for most females....they want security in their lives. And in Singapore generally, the parents want to see their daughters marry the right man.....good stable job, responsible, kind, loving and lastly a man who can really take care of their daughter and family.

              <p>Yes. I'd think about it. I don't want to date a girl only because I bring her to restaurants to enjoy a Pinot Noir with Ribeye Steak, burning a hole in my pocket. Point is,  security,  blablabla, is just an illusion. True happiness matters the most,  ain't it? </p>

              Happiness? True Happiness? What is that? If taken on exterior basis...that is only temporary. If taken within your own Self....that is quite different...wisemen...call it True Happiness. What you see within and exteriorly is totally two different perspective. You are actually talking about Contentment is it not? And what is your definition of True Happiness?

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok. The topic of yours itself is very general. It applies to all those whose are looking for wealth and success. Its human nature that one would like to strive for happiness in the beginning by pursuing exterior materialism. However, once you have achieved those goals...you find that its not what you really expected. Then you will look for other happiness within the context of happiness without wealth or success. True Happiness doesn't exist. Its an idea of happiness brought down from generation to generation since the beginning of time.

              Hi jimmy interesting topic u hve there. Whilst i understand that some may view it as shallow, my opinion is that there are people that genuinely take pleasure in collecting material wealth. And these people if dissuaded from their path wud be living a lie. I respect their choice. I have met people from less fortunate circumstances who have that mentality and to me its fine. Whilst coming from a good background we may not have that mentality ingrained in ourselves some are not so fortunate. Maslows hierachy of needs. If material wealth is not lackinglacking u move to other needs.... to be gracious eloquent bla bla bla...
              but to someone without that background from young.....
               it has been ingrained since young....
              wealth is everything.

              <p>I'm not sure if I could agree with you about true happiness not existing, but purely an idealogy passed down by generations.<br><br>True happiness is an emotion , strong feeling and affection experienced by oneself towards life. It could be obtained by the simplest thing of life, doing simple tasks such as chatting with your friends or playing basketball , etcetera etcetera. <br><br>Point is, you just classified true happiness as non-existent, something I cannot agree with.<br><br>Then you did a word play, by saying contentment is the keyword to happiness, exteriorly , internally and spiritually.<br><br>Your point of the word play, may I respectfully ask?</p>

              True Happiness - do you mean by being endlessly happy or just a spur of the moment? Or do you mean having fun in happiness. But can you be happy with every moment?
              
              Contentment is the element that you accept of who you are, what you have and you are happy with that.....and be happy with your life...regardless of with or without wealth.

              <p>Another question here for you, hope you don’t mind ok. If a girl
                  you like or you think she likes you or you feel can be your dream
                  girl says to you, “I think we are not meant for each other. You are
                  not rich.” How will you take it?</p>

              <p>Take it like a true boss. <br>Be good friends with her, continue helping her in her life if she encounters any problems whatsoever.<br><br>That's because I truly like her ,even though she thinks that we are not meant for each other, we can still be good friends.<br>Ain't it?</p>

              Ah..you are in love. Is nice to fall in love...but you must also see the reality in life. You must move on with your life too or you will be hurting yourself.

              Look at the creatures and animls round you do you think they are happier than you?
              The answer is yes because you know too much and that is the price for not being happy.

              <p>Lol i think that would be a question of morals not so much gold digging.</p>
              <p>For clarity's sake.... someone might luv to gold dig but would not feel right about hurting his/her partner by being with the father just for the sake of gold.</p>
