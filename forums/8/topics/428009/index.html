              <p>true story:</p>
              <p>long time ago, i was jogging in bishan park....  then suddenly, i saw this quite chio bu sort of seating on the floor, or rather the road cos the jogging track was really a road surface, and she was holding her leg at the calf area</p>
              <p>from a distance i saw this, so immediately i try to act like an professional athelete... i straighten my posture and open my strides and try to look like i have already ran the marathorn, but it was no sweat... i slowed as i approach her and then i smiled and asked "are you ok?" ... she smiled back and say yes.... and then i didnt know what else to say cos' she already said she's ok... that means no problem.... sigh... so i just smiled and open my strides again as i jogged off... after i turn the cornor behind some tall plants, i had to stop and catch my breath... and wondered whether to jog back? i did eventually jogged back to the area where i saw her about 10 min later, but by that time she has already left.... i never saw her again...thinking back, i dont even remember now how she look like.. but i only remembered that she was quite chio... either that or people tend to get better looking after you forget how they look <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>dont talk to a random jogger please. It is annoying for them.
                  And they can tell that u are desperate. They sweat and tired to
                  keep fit and u suddenly appear trying to talk to them? helloooo so
                  awkward. obviously its a desperate act. </p>

              <p>Why do female joggers look attractive to you?</p>
              <p>1) Because they are not wearing much, other than their short shorts, and sport bras?</p>

              <p>i wouldn’t recommend trying to chat up the lady while she is jogging. it can be quite annoying.. maybe when she’s resting. but still. actually its just weird. can you chat them up elsewhere?</p>

              <p>yeah i agree.. i think that if she would have wanted a company or someone to chat with while jogging, she wont be alone la, girls will probably bring along her girl-friends and chat about topics that are would be more interesting to her like shopping and bitching.. or would bring her bf for company ... most of the girls jogging alone rather listen to songs.</p>
              <p>maybe if she is resting she might entertain u abit haha</p>
              <p>i know there are some joggers or cyclists groups around, why dont u try joining them?</p>
