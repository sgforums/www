              <p>yeah i agree.. i think that if she would have wanted a company or someone to chat with while jogging, she wont be alone la, girls will probably bring along her girl-friends and chat about topics that are would be more interesting to her like shopping and bitching.. or would bring her bf for company ... most of the girls jogging alone rather listen to songs.</p>
              <p>maybe if she is resting she might entertain u abit haha</p>
              <p>i know there are some joggers or cyclists groups around, why dont u try joining them?</p>

              <p>Why do female joggers look attractive to you?</p>
              <p>1) Because they are not wearing much, other than their short shorts, and sport bras?</p>
              <p>2) Because they look hot, wet, and sweaty, like they just had sex, and is probably what they'll look like once you're done with them?</p>

              <p><br>it dangerous to listen to music while jogging, many pples do not understand the impact of it, first, the body will not response to the muscle reaction due to concentration on the head on music, secondly, in crossing road or looking out, it can be risk when you are unable to listen to your surrounding as you are travelling faster than normal walking condition.</p>

              <p><br>Not really, like for me, I meditate while jogging, it is a skill few people know and learn, I dun go and bitch about shopping or salon or hairstyle and men, so I prefer to jog alone. Tho I love to jog early in the morning, i still prefer a bit later when the sun is up, cos I worry about wolves. My granny told me last time got gal get raped and murdered while jogging. So I bring my dogs along</p>

              <p>I see....</p>
              <p>If you really jog at 7am.......I admire you.....</p>
              <p>For me I am unable to do any physical activities in the morning.......only in the afternoons...</p>
              <p>I like the afternoon athmosphere.....when it is late afternoon and the sun is gentle and orange-y colour......its very beautiful to look at.....furthermore I cycle to the beach...around 10 minutes or so and I would reach the beach.....then I cycle somemore until its dark....then I cycle back.....Oftentimes I would go with my dog, a chihuahua. I put him in the basket.</p>
              <p>But morning time is also special in its own ways........its still a bit cool......the air temperature is cooler....and also there is a gentle mist.......its good to see too....</p>
