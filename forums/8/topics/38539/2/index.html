"All parties continue to say they want to have a peaceful resolution, but they are not sitting around the table to archive that yet, which is the major difficulty."<br><br>"Such a peaceful resolution can only occur when they start to talk," Strong stressed.<br><br>When asked what information he would pass on to the DPRK officials after his meeting with US officials last week, Strong said he was not a "messenger." But he added that he would convey information to the DPRK officials and friends, as the UN serves both the DPRK and the United States.<br><br>"If I can convey information useful, I'll do so, but not in the sense of messenger," Strong said.<br><br>Strong said on Sunday that the United States is promising to send 40,000 tons of food to the DPRK, as part of its commitment of 100,000 tons of food. The European Union has sent its first shipment of 39,500 tons of food to the DPRK, which helped alleviate the food shortage in the country.<br><br>The nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula has run into a stalemate, as the DPRK demands direct talks with the US, while the latter has tried to resolve it within a multilateral framework.<br><br>N.

They have to look at the matter from the perspective of both or more sides in order to make a decision. Whats is the use of UN if they only choose to see things with respect to the benefit of the influentials?</div></blockquote>they could have brought an army in to stop both sides from fighting. create an autonomous neutral region between the borders of both countries and THEN try to conduct peace talks.<br><br>but it's all too late for that now.</div>

Bush's message in his address to the nation: Give up and get out within 48 hours or face the wrath of the U.S. military.<br><br>The 14-minute speech also is likely to be Bush's last chance to make his case to the American public before war begins. The president seized the moment to make a passionate argument that Saddam's ouster is vital to U.S. and world security. And he offered his most honest assessment yet of the heightened threat to Americans from terrorists bent on retaliation. Yet Bush provided little new substance about the war costs, goals and sacrifices that may lie ahead.<br><br>That's unlikely to worry the 58% of Americans who stand squarely behind the president's war plans, according to a USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll conducted last weekend. But it leaves lingering questions for the 41% of Americans who have not found Bush's arguments convincing enough to back the war and the president.<br><br>Changing those minds, not Saddam's, is important. Indeed, ensuring the deepest possible support of the American people for a cause they understand is a prerequisite for a successful military campaign under the ''Powell Doctrine,'' the sensible rules Secretary of State Colin Powell (news - web sites) developed following his bitter experience as an Army officer in the Vietnam War.<br><br>While all wars spark high emotion and controversy, a public united at the onset of a military venture is more likely to accept the longer commitment, steeper cost and greater sacrifice that wars inevitably entail.<br><br>Traditionally on the eve of battle, pollsters have observed, the public is listening most carefully to what the president has to say. To this attentive audience, Bush presented a powerful, if familiar, case for why Saddam needs to go. The president noted that the Iraqi tyrant has accumulated an arsenal of lethal weapons to dominate the oil-rich Persian Gulf region and support terror groups. ''The danger is clear,'' Bush said. ''Using chemical, biological or, one day, nuclear weapons, obtained with the help of Iraq (news - web sites), the terrorists could . . . kill thousands or hundreds of thousands of innocent people.''<br><br>Bush also spoke persuasively about why force is needed. He cited Saddam's 12 years of defying United Nations (news - web sites) demands to disarm, including the last chance the U.N. gave him in November.<br><br>Left unaddressed were Bush's reasons for ruling out a few more weeks of diplomacy if that would gain valuable support from the world community. Rather, he suggested that giving Saddam more time amounts to dangerous appeasement. Other governments ''share our assessment of the danger, but not our resolve to meet it,'' he said.<br><br>In choosing to act now with a narrower coalition, Bush acknowledged the risk of increased terror attacks on the U.S. and said the government was taking additional steps to protect the country. But he only hinted at the costs and sacrifices that war will require.<br><br>Among the questions unanswered:<br><br>* Have military risks been adequately addressed? Though the U.S. has a vastly superior military with precision weapons, Saddam could unleash chemical and biological weapons and draw U.S. forces into high-risk street fighting in Baghdad. That risks high military and civilian casualties.<br><br>* How will costs be paid? The administration is requesting $80 billion to $100 billion from Congress for the first year. And that's not a one-time payment: A new report from the Council on Foreign Relations expects costs up to $20 billion annually for U.S. occupation forces years after a war. But the U.S. won't have a large coalition as during the 1991 war to help pay the tab.<br><br>* How will war change the region? Bush has sketched a bold blueprint for rebuilding Iraq and creating democratic institutions that could be a catalyst for spreading political freedoms throughout the Middle East. Yet he ignored the problems that war could trigger in the region. Saddam's ouster could spark civil strife among ethnic and religious factions, leading to a wider conflict. Iraqis could balk at an extended U.S. presence and stage a resistance.<br><br>The bottom line: With war likely hours away, Americans still don't know enough about what they're getting into.<br><br>That's not the way to build deep support or change minds. It invites a damaging public backlash if war proves more difficult than confident U.S. generals are predicting.<br><br>Bush spoke of the importance of uniting against Saddam. This is the moment Americans are most likely to do so. But first they need greater candor about the commitments they are being asked to bear.<br><br></div>
