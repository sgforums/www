            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by undecided:</div><div class="quote_body">35 years of independence &amp; you want an Olympic calibre of sportsperson? get real please and even if you throw in the few hundred years back to colonial days, it's difficult to get great sports people in Singapore simply because we're too materialistic and not everyone is willing to give his or her all to the sport, so please don't blame the government for importing talent.<br></div></blockquote>If the government would be willing to spend more money on developing sports talents, we might be able to win a Olympic medal. There are definitely quite a number of talented sportwomen/sportmen around but in Singapore we have to consider our future too. Many sportmen/sportwoman has a decent salary for training hard but take a look at the local scene. Do we have to depend on importing foreigners so win a Olympic medal? Age in a country does not really affect the talents. Out of our 3.8 million(not too sure about the current figure) population, it is not that hard to find a single talented sportman/sportwoman, but I have seen many talented sportmen/sportwomen not willing to put their best into their sports as in Singapore, participating in sport fulltime will not earn you big salary. Are we all too materialistic? No, this is too general. What you earn as a sportman/sportwoman is pathetic.(For most) Not to forget the fact you have to consider when you retire, your only occupation is probably a coach. For a sportwoman, it is much more possible to go fulltime into sports. However, for us, males even if we are really talents, we will still have to go for our degree to secure a better future for ourselves and family if you decided to start one. Living standard is pretty high in Singapore and the Singapore sports council does not offer a package for our sportmen/sportwomen. Do you know in China though they are a still so call Communist country but their sportsmen/sportwoman have a package once they go fulltime. Actually most are trained from young to become future sportsman/sportswoman. They attended sports schools and most who play for the country have a home and sufficient income to support their family. After they retire, they are and will definitely be offered the job of a coach.<br><br><blockquote><strong>so what if she's from China? at least she deigned to represent us, do give ourselves a few more years to get better.<br><br>[This message has been edited by undecided (edited 23 September 2000).]</strong></blockquote>It does matter somehow. National pride.<br>She is not a true Singaporean. She from born here, from young she did not receive training locally. Being in Singapore, generally you should be able to speak our native language, Singlish. Can she?<br>Not that I dislike her but I agree with Axl that it is rather sickening of our newspaper. I do welcome foreigners but the newspaper just make it sick. Even if Singapore do win a gold medal in this year's olympic due to Jin Jun Hong, are you proud of it deep down? I'll only be happy but not proud.<br><br><blockquote><strong>know why we've to import sports talent? because most Singaporeans are not willing to put in their best, because it doesn't pay well enough, because most want a better life and that surely can't be via sports unless you're really great at it, thus most don't train enough or don't have the resources to train well enough.</strong></blockquote>So who's to blame? Do not blame the government for not investing into our sports? Contradictive.<br><br></div>

Shouldn't have big problem trying to overcome coldness, right?<br><br>As for JJH, she displayed fighting spirit (which is characteristic of Singapore's nation building!). No doubt she came from China, where they are known for the torturous training since young. Well, she acquired a strong foundation from her training earlier in life, but she only made it to Olympics Quarterfinals and Semifinals only when she's in Singapore, RIGHT??? What does that shows?

            <div class='col-md body'>One strategy which S'pore can use to win medals using local people is by sending them to events where there's only one other country participating.

Shall we import that China coach?<br><br>Personally, I would rather be proud of JJH than Joselin Yeo (whatever the spelling). Look at Joselin! Swim swim swim, didn't even beat her best time. Is she trying her best? I dun think so... dun blame the weather... I thot she had training overseas? Shouldn't have big problem trying to overcome coldness, right?<br><br>As for JJH, she displayed fighting spirit (which is characteristic of Singapore's nation building!). No doubt she came from China, where they are known for the torturous training since young. Well, she acquired a strong foundation from her training earlier in life, but she only made it to Olympics Quarterfinals and Semifinals only when she's in Singapore, RIGHT??? What does that shows? A lot of things...think yourself.<br><br>If we are going to celebrate only when a true-blue wins an Olympic medal, well, maybe it's going to be a Long Long wait...maybe another 20 years...</div></blockquote>Agreed with Shervon99.<br><br>As for myself no point saying more, when everyone is going in the oposite flow of channel.
