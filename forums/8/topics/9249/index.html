            <div class='col-md body'>I've wanted to post something like this when the Olympic starts. I've been watching the games esp when it comes to the events with our 'best' athletes taking part in.<br><br>Look at our national proud, the best swimmer in the region. Yes, it's Josline Yeo whom I'm talking about. Look at her in the 100m Butterfly, her BEST event.... LAST!!!!! Timing... over 1 minute when the rest in the pool finished below the minute mark. Don't give excuses of brother injuried in accident, water too cold and all the dumb excuses. Singaporean are too pamper to be a real athlete.<br><br>Specially stay at home today to watch "OUR" Jing Jun Hong play, can't help be think that I'm watching to china gals playing even our flag is shown on the TV screen besides her name. If she stays in Singapore since young even though she's born in China, I would very much cheer for her to win something for Singapore BUT she's not. Her foundation is built in China NOT Singapore so what if she won the gold medal. She's not a product of Singapore even if she wears the Singapore colours.<br><br>Even MT Everest is not climbed by PRs from Malaysia. I'm not at all surprised.<br>I can picture this in my mind &lt; African team..... all blacks, American team.....all whites, Japan team...... all nihon jin, Singapore team...... woah!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> UNited nation..&gt;<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporeans are made to be businessmen. However, if we're talking abt Sports and Arts, I think it'll take us another 7852304278 years to develop it.<br><br>Cos our society is as such that u'll need QUALIFICATIONS to go anywhere.
