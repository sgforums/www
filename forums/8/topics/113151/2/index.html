For example, I will proof you one thing:<br><br>"Pu tong hua" or Mandarin, or Guo Yu. is a derived form of chinese language.<br><br>The original is in the form of dialects.<br><br>There are many, teochew, hockchew, hokkien, cantonese, hainanese, and lots more.<br><br>Many of these chinese had inter-married.<br><br>1) In your assumption again, are you going to say that you should learn all the dialects of your fore-fathers?<br><br>Tell me how many chinese out there can speak their dialects well? (and I mean educated-well. as in able to read an article in that dialect.)<br><br>In this case, if one can't even speak his/her grandfather and grandmother's dialects? should the person be ashamed?<br><br>2) In the case of 2 or more dialects that are a result from these inter-marriage.<br>People have taken the route of 'more frequently used' language as preferrencial language. So you might be hockchew, but you could be speaking hokkien and not know of any hockchew at all.<br><br>does that mean they have to re-learn their "original" language in order not to be shamed?<br><br>frankly,<br>I'm not being nasty to your opinion. But I find that  each person has their right to do what they want and not be judged according to the language they (choose) speak.<br>just because a (chinese) person choose not to speak mandarin doesn't mean he/she is shameful.<br><br>and to be honestly direct, these type of comment is very much inclined towards discrimination and race stereotyping.<br><br>IMHO,  I find that written chinese is grossly inefficient when writing or communicating to people of other countries. Especially when I started my line, there's no such thing as a Chinese DOS.<br><br>You take hundreds of keystrokes more to type out a simple document instead of a few.<br><br>Which other language allows you to reach 110 words per minute at the keyboard?<br><br>Definitely not chinese.<br><br></div>
