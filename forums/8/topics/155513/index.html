            <div class='col-md body'>i think my life absolutely sucks. i go to school yet i usually dont  take things seriously until i realise there is a severe time shortage when it's close to the exams. i waste a lot of time rotting at home, sleeping is my forte. another lot of my time is wasted playing online games. i can say i call it quits, thank god! i go for an occasional shopping spree and end up empty handed, eating fast food until i'm visibily fatter than what i was before. school has made me a sad child, i want to have my life, but yet it promises us great furture, isn't it? the dreaded exams are nearing, and it's my death sentence. once it's over, im going to go crazy and enjoy myself. but the question is, what shall i do different to what i said earlier?</div>
