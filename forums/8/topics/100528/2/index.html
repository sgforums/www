If u plan to overclock ur AMD, then i think copper heat sink is essential .<br><br>Besides that, use good power supply for your computer. Those power supply that usually come in a bundle with the casing are normally no good. I could recommend Enlight power supply, expensive but good.<br><br>Lastly, use Al casing.

GET A GOOD POWER SUPPLY. normally those $100 &amp; above power supply with 3 yrs warranty will do. very important if you're using high end cpus and graphic cards since you wouldn't want a cheapo $20 power supply to blow up your $1000 system...</div>
