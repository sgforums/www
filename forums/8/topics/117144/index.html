            <div class='col-md body'>My place here got a lot of SPGs leh.  Some are so young, dress damned sexy....but their angmoh boyfriends so old and bald liow and wear shorts and slippers.  But you see the girls' faces....like damned proud like that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">.  Anyway, thats their own business lah.<br><br>I've got nothing against SPGs, unless they start discriminating against me.  Like there were times when they served the angmoh customers first, or gave them preferential service, etc.  I've experienced this on airplanes (I needn't say which airlines, I think you all know already), and at other places in Singapore.<br><br>Gerry may be short for Geraldine?<br><br></div>
