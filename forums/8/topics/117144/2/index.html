            <div class='col-md body'>Take for example two surfers. Both of them love to surf more than anything in the world, but one of them is better than the other. One of them works part-time in a low paid job, earning just enough to get by on so he can spend as much time surfing as he can. Society scorns him. He is shunned, and considered lazy and worthless, when in reality he is just living his life as he wants to, doing what he loves most.<br><br>The other surfer is just as passionate, however he has had the good fortune to become one of the best at what he does. He has become a professional surfer, travelling around the world winning competitions and money. Society loks favourably on him because he is a 'success', despite the fact that he is very similar to the first surfer.<br><br>This is how the Matrix works. It will tell you <strong>you</strong> must have certain possessions, and you must do certain things, because if you do you will be a 'success' and will be happy and can hold your head high. The Matrix will come at you through your closest friends and loved ones. I do not blame <strong>you</strong> excusers , it is not <strong>you</strong> fault, <strong>you</strong>are not aware of what is really going<br>on.<br><br>As you have seen, society will tell you you must have certain things: the good job, the fast car, the best clothes, and once you have those things you will a success and you can claim your prize; the hot girlfriend.<br>However if you are not deemed 'successful' then you will only have the confidence to go for girls with similar 'low value', which for a woman means her looks. This brainwashing by society means only the men with the success feel qualified to approach the best looking girls.<br><br>But if we look logically at the situation, what are his advantages over you?Is it his car? NO, she can't see his car when he approaches her at the bar. Is it his job? NO, she has no idea how much money is in your bank account when you first approach, unless you walk around talking to girls with a bank statement pinned to your shirt  His only advantage over you is the confidence he has from knowing he is 'worthy' in society's eyes.<br><br>I will say it again.<br><br>His only advantage is his confidence.<br><br>Excuers.<br><br></div>

I have always been very tempted to ask her whether there is a single one in her own race who finds her attractive.  Then she will boast about her happenings with the different ang mohs.  Again I felt like asking her whether there is a single ang moh guy who wants to marry her.  </div></blockquote>Ya.  I pity those people who thinking highly of another race.  it is sad to look down on your very own.  i am very proud and happy that i am a chinese.  i believe there is a reason why there are different races.  we should respect each other and especially our own.</div>
