              <p>Recently,i was shopping with my wife and son.At the supermarket,I witnessed a very distubing scene.</p>
              <p>A little boy,no more than 4 or 5 yrs, ran headlong into an elderly man.As i waited for a response,I got the biggest shock of my life! The boy looked at the man and said"Watch where you are going!" The boy's mother,who was standing nearby,simply  smiled proudly at her son. The look on the elderly man's face was priceless.He was obviously disgusted with outcome but he just walked away.Sadly, those who did not witness the full event gave the poor man such evil glares.</p>
              <p>That incident left me with a bad taste in my mouth and ruined my mood for the rest of the evening.Thankfully,my son of 16 yrs was equally disturbed by the event and that gave me hope.</p>
              <p>My thoughts conclude that if we are not going to be careful about bring up future generations with proper mannerisms,this country is going to have to deal the additional problems that it will bring soon..........."sigh"</p>

              <p>You cannot teach what you do not know.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporeans are decended from the Chinese peasants, and they have rather poor ettiquette, to say the least.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence they pass down their own ways- spitting, black face, selfishness, stinginess, lack of manners.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This can only be overcome by a huge influx of people who have good manners. Otherwise putting posters of the side of buses is useless since one of the things Singaporeans, especially the olderones, do, is ignore that sort of tripe.

              <p><br>on the contrary i see people greeting everyone good morning at work. so this is the excuse to show you are courteous? when retrenchment come everyone still grett everyone gutten tag but at the back working towards everyone's demise hoping they can keep their jobs, by any means possible. so i really do not think they have no manners. just that they only show it like a sheep skin they wear over the body. they show manners only during certain situation. don't think youngsters nowadays are smarter and more sly than one knows. they inherited from their 'busy' parents.</p>

              <p>so far in my life, I have never ever meet a truly kind, courteous, compassionate and understanding singaporean. I think this person never exists. if anyone know such person, pls let me know so that I can go befriend him/her.</p>

              <p>I guess its wishful thinking, bring up the old kampong spirit days.I sure miss those times.Barbecue weekends,neighbourhood excursions,friendly greetings.We seemed to all get along really well back then.Race was never an issue.I had all kinds of races living along my kampong.</p>
              <p>People are unfortunately cautious nowadays due to fear.Fear of being sued for even trying to help others.I believe you guys have a few experiences of your own.Like trying to help someone after an accident.....and getting a letter dayafter for u to appear in court for not administrating the right procedure..LOL</p>
              <p>Being suspicious of good willed people is also kinda growing these days.Thanks to scammers and money hungry people out to make a quick buck from you.</p>
              <p>All together,I believe there are too many points to bring up.Like  with"OneWithTheForce" ,we probably have to accept that unless by force or incentive,we will change.But of course,doing it that way is just absolute wrong as well!</p>
              <p>So i guess...no solution loh.We all should mind our own business and protect only what is ours.How terribly sad!</p>
