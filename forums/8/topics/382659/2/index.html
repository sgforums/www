              All countries have their black sheeps, but i would say singapore has better mannerism generally.
              
              I've got a really close friend getting beaten up for nothing, in Australia. Apparantly because he is a chinese. 
              
              How about malaysians spitting right in front of your foot while u walk, and gives you a non chalant attitute after that?
              
              How about getting "shooed" out of a shop in HK just because i cant speak cantonese well, or coz i'm a tourist?
              
              I've many pleasant and unpleasant experiences from both local and overseas and i'd say, local mannerisms are not that bad             <blockquote>

              <p>As I said before, this isnt about racism (plenty of that iin Singapore and other countries) and you havent mentioned any behaviour of Singaporeans which is better than Westerners.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm going to list a few and let's see how Singaporeans match up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Opening doors for people behind you:</p>
              <p>Aust/US- Yes</p>
              <p>SG/China- No</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Saying thank you to the person keeping the door open for you:</p>
              <p>Aust/US- Yes</p>
              <p>SG/China- rarely/No</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. You queue in a long line and a new counter opens. Do you let the person in front of you go first to the new counter because they have been waiting longer?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Aust/US- Yes</p>
              <p>SG/China- No/No.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Picking your nose, ears and feet in public:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Aust/US: No/No.</p>
              <p>SG/China- Yes but less often now/ Yes</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Staring at others with a black face in public:</p>
              <p>Aust/US- Rarely</p>
              <p>SG/China:  Yes/Yes</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6. You have a large trolley full of groceries and are next in line at the pay counter, when someone lines up behind you and you see they only have a few items. Do you offer to let them go ahead of you out of courtesy?</p>
              <p>Aust/US- Yes</p>
              <p>SG/China- No/No.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>7. You see a stranger with a bag of groceries suddenly drop it and items fall out everywhere. Do you help them pick them back up?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Aust/US- Yes</p>
              <p>SG/China- Maybe/No.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>8. You see a queue to whatever it is you want to get to eg taxi. Do you jump queue and walk to the front?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Aust/US- No</p>
              <p>SG/China- No/Yes</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>9. You're driving trying to merge and the car in the main lane lets you in. Do you wave thank you to the car that let you in?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Aust/US- Very often.</p>
              <p>SG/China- Very rarely/No.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>10. If the cars' positions were reversed, would you have even let the car merge in in front of you in the first place?</p>
              <p>Aust/US- Very often.</p>
              <p>SG/China- Sometimes/No.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As you can see, Western countries are miles ahead in public common courtesy, and Singapore is only just ahead of China.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Basically it's because Singapore's Chinese are descended from Mainland Chinese, so the behaviour is basically the same. Singapore has only been wealthy for 25 years, so the number of educated and more polite people hasnt reached sufficient number to influence the older Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>We've already been influenced by lots of western culture.I don't see it as having a positive effect on us.Our kids are getting quite rowdy because of that.</p>

              <p>Singaporeans are decended from the Chinese peasants, and they have rather poor ettiquette, to say the least.</p>

              <p>This can only be overcome by a huge influx of people who have good manners. Otherwise putting posters of the side of buses is useless since one of the things Singaporeans, especially the olderones, do, is ignore that sort of tripe. Besides, what's the point of telling people to behave better, without some incentive, instruction, or fear of punishment?</p>

              <p>I hate to agree with you, but this statement seem to make a whole lot of sense after reading it.</p>
              <p>I think the overall conclusion is: It's not easy to educate people on courtesy and etique if it is not started from young.</p>

              <p><br>Never ah... As long as I help the gas company to increase the orders for owners by distributing the discount voucher to them so as to let them know. I won't find it tough though. But I am sad on what some of the owners did on 'my' papers. Furthermore, even if they don't want the paper after that, they should have just thrown it at their own rubbish bin, instead of just polluting the earth.</p>
              <p>The reasons why they throw anyhow is either lazy to see the contents or they do not order it the in the first place as they had order from the other company. In average, I have to encounter 5 to 7 of these units which just simply don't know the awareness of 'litter-free' campaign.</p>
              <p>So, if you want to work smoothly, you have to see other people's faces regardless of what occupation you are in. You have to deal them personally instead of just complaining in order to save your job.</p>
              <p>For my job, as long as the owners order the gas, my job has done.</p>

              <p>In the past, if people do wrong things, they will be caned by your parents without any hesitation. After that, they won't dare to repeat the same mistakes again.</p>
              <p>Now, if they do wrong things, their parents would tell you nicely not to repeat the same mistakes again instead of just scolding harshly.</p>
              <p>Thus, this will give the oppournties for them to repeat the same mistakes again. So, treating them harshly can know the seriousness of making the mistakes. You can hate your parents for now for what they have done to you. But after you grow up, you find out that their learning points to you is correct.</p>
              <p>Did their parents sad after beating them up? A big yes, obviously. As if they fail to do so, their children will make the same mistakes again and again.</p>

              <p>Recently,i was shopping with my wife and son.At the supermarket,I witnessed a very distubing scene.</p>
              <p>A little boy,no more than 4 or 5 yrs, ran headlong into an elderly man.As i waited for a response,I got the biggest shock of my life! The boy looked at the man and said"Watch where you are going!" The boy's mother,who was standing nearby,simply  smiled proudly at her son. The look on the elderly man's face was priceless.He was obviously disgusted with outcome but he just walked away.Sadly, those who did not witness the full event gave the poor man such evil glares.</p>
              <p>That incident left me with a bad taste in my mouth and ruined my mood for the rest of the evening.Thankfully,my son of 16 yrs was equally disturbed by the event and that gave me hope.</p>
              <p>My thoughts conclude that if we are not going to be careful about bring up future generations with proper mannerisms,this country is going to have to deal the additional problems that it will bring soon..........."sigh"</p>

              <p>Hi, I can relate to your feelings too.</p>
              <p>Often I was also involved in such similar situations (as that elderly man) whereby I'm not at fault but the person thinks it's my fault.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, I wonder what happened to the logic and common sense of the majority crowd.... are they unable to see that they're the one at fault (instead of behaving in such rude manner)?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>6. You have a large trolley full of groceries and are next in
              line at the pay counter, when someone lines up behind you and you
              see they only have a few items. Do you offer to let them go ahead
              of you out of courtesy?</p>
              <p>Aust/US- Yes</p>
              <p>SG/China- No/No.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>7. You see a stranger with a bag of groceries suddenly drop it
              and items fall out everywhere. Do you help them pick them back
              up?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Aust/US- Yes</p>
              <p>SG/China- Maybe/No.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>8. You see a queue to whatever it is you want to get to eg taxi.
              Do you jump queue and walk to the front?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Aust/US- No</p>
              <p>SG/China- No/Yes</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>9. You're driving trying to merge and the car in the main lane
              lets you in. Do you wave thank you to the car that let you in?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Aust/US- Very often.</p>
              <p>SG/China- Very rarely/No.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>10. If the cars' positions were reversed, would you have even
              let the car merge in in front of you in the first place?</p>
              <p>Aust/US- Very often.</p>
              <p>SG/China- Sometimes/No.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As you can see, Western countries are miles ahead in public
              common courtesy, and Singapore is only just ahead of China.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Basically it's because Singapore's Chinese are descended from
              Mainland Chinese, so the behaviour is basically the same. Singapore
              has only been wealthy for 25 years, so the number of educated and
              more polite people hasnt reached sufficient number to influence the
              older Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>Such acts of simple courtesy is rarely observed in full view especially when in public - I'm still sticking to the fact that Singaporeans are just too shy to make a difference. It would be weird to stand out in a crowd, for good reasons even, in our society.</p>
              <p>Courtesy and appropriate mannerism is something that has to be taught from a young age, and by observing the kids that run about in the playground screaming "retard retard", it really makes me wonder how far parents have succeeded.</p>
              <p>Teenagers as well. Pop over to the STOMP section, and the current situation will automatically reveal itself.</p>
              <p>Singapore's economic growth has greatly overshot social growth, and the difference has yet to be bridged. Perhaps that is why the discrepancies of mannerism appear when you compare mannerisms of Asians and Westerners.</p>
