            <div class='col-md body'>Personally I think girls with long straight hair look better than those with wavy or curly hair. It gives them a more pleasant look. It also makes one feel like touching their hair. Hehe.. Maybe that's why shampoo advertisements always look for girls with long straight hair. :Ãž<br><br>------------------<br>Half the work and twice the fun!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have just done my hair re-bonding during cny season. (Want to be swee swee when going to pai nian mah)<br><br>I never regret going for rebonding but what I regret is I never choose a good salon. In fact I have done my rebonding twice in this salon because the 1st time the effects are not that good and it was back to my usual wavy hair just a few days time. Luckily, the salon is willing to "compensate" by redoing it foc for the 2nd time.<br><br>My friend has done in year 2000 xmas time and her effects still as good so I advise those girls or guys who are interested in rebonding, find out about the salon's reputation and the chemicals they used before attempting it. If not, you spend a bomb trying to make yourself look great but disappointed with the effects.<br><br>Now my hair is v v v dry and has alot of split ends so need to maintain it really well..hai~<br><br>------------------<br>It's my life....<br>It's now or never...</div>
