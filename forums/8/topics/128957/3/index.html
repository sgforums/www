Anyway nothing surprising as ladies nowadays r setting their expectation on their future spouse way too high. Dun set ur expectation too high on a spore guy, those who can earn so much only consists of a small % or son of rich parent tat live off a silver golden spoon. i believe u r still very young, when u get old ur above requirements will start to reduce... believe me. Anyway good luck on ur search for ur golden tortoise...</div>
