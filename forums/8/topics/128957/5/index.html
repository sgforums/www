            <div class='col-md body'>like what a forummer mentioned its more important to have a healthy debt equity ratio.<br><br>it does not matter how much u earn or how much u spend. a healthy ratio is usually 60% expense and 40% savings. savings could be in the form of insurance, investments, fd or plain old deposits.<br><br>looking at the thread starter friend...with a 4k income and a car and house loan coming up, heres what his breakdown would most likely be like:-<br><br>Salary: 3200 (after cpf)<br>Car Loan: 800<br>Car Exp: 250<br>Bills: 150 (HP, Tel, Internet)<br>House Loan: CPF<br>Entertainment: 300<br>Food: 300 (based on $5 per meal over 30 days)<br>Left:- $1550<br><br>He should have slightly more then $1200 per month unless he has more expenses.
