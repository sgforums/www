He is not exactly very rich.. for that kinda admiration.<br><br>Some of my girl friends then commented that its not so easy to find a guy who earns that income and has so much savings and property at his age. Is that true?  Thought his savings is not that much?<br><br>comments pls..</div></blockquote>The income level at 29 is so, so... he is not doing badly should reach his level of income.<br><br>As for savings there are various factors.... his overall savings level is not really that high... i think i got more savings at his age....also maybe his parents don't need him to support and actually help him save when he was young so that he got a head start......<br><br>there are a lot of factors to consider.....</div>
