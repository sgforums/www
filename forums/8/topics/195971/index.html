            <div class='col-md body'>I was a at certain coffeeshop late at night. We requested for the menu and order a few drinks and food from there. The drinks by the way went stated black and white $1.50<br><br>So when its time to leave, we ask for the bill. The guy came to us and calculated the bill. Total is 10 dollar plus. I was curious. How come so much. So i ask him how much is my drink. He say 2 dollar. I ask how much is my friend drink. He also say 2 dollar. I pointed out in the menu it clearly stated $1.50 oni. he laugh it off and say Oh that was the old menu. We have increased the price so far.<br><br>My frens were LL and going to pay amount. But at times i have the tendancy to fight for things that were clearly in wrong. $1 is not much but it really goes against my principle.<br><br>So i inform him by doing that it is not fair to the customer. U never once did inform us of the price increase nor update the price on the menu. How could you anihow charge us the price. He mentioned that the price increase happen very long liao. I reply that is not the case, it is the fairness i stressed. If i put one prata with egg in the menu for 1 dollar but when the bill cames i inform u have to pay 5 dollar coz it is the old menu will it be fair to u.<br><br>So he ask me what i want. I infrom him, look i m not angry at you but this is not fair to us. Why dun you get ur boss here. After the whole repeated conversation with the boss, i inform the boss so how, can we stick to the 1.50 price. He say cannot. I tell him i m not going to pay the extra money at all even though it is oni 1 dollar.<br><br>My frens were like Suan Le pattern. The boss suddenly got fed up and inform his henchman, give them 1.50 then, then proceed to tear away the menu in front of us. Today i give u 1.50, tmr u come is 2 dollar. BLAH<br><br>My frens were trying to pacify the boss but i tell them, hey we are not in wrong ok, why should we apologise to them.<br><br>Aniway i also inform my fren that he better not go to the same coffeeshop again coz i m sure they maybe will add some extra incredients in the food or whatsoever. But thats the place when he often went to watch soccer as it is less crowded. Maybe i did , did him a wrong by robbing his favourite haunt.<br><br>In singapore, many people dont speak up, as if they did so, they are labelled as enemy of the state. Should i be a Yes man and go on with my life peacefully even though u noe certain things/policy/regulations or whatsoever is wrong but u will get into this belief that this is life, or should i cont to stick to my beliefs and do the right things.<br><br>If i see a man being cornered by several punks, do i quietly stand there like the others and watch the show?<br><br>If my school/camp make us have forced donations or sales target, do i accept the fate?<br><br>If I see someone spitting or eating, or bring durians in train/bus, should i jus ignore them?<br><br>What is right? What is Wrong?<br><br>Being too gung ho might get you in trouble. Even though u r rite, recent reports in the news suggest that if you are a busybody, you will get hurt<br><br>Is this the life i really wanted? to be a dun care, dun know and a yes man forever  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">      <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In your case, it involved legal prospective rather than ethics alone. Clearly, the owner is flouting the law by cheating the customers. You are clearly in the right &amp; may wish to lodge a complain to the authority on this matter.<br><br>For the rest of your questions, there is no right and wrong answer. I suggest you pick up a copy of ethics books from the library if you have the time. Merely to quote what I have read:<br><br>'Civility &amp; tolerance mean that there are times when we must mind our business. But compassion &amp; a concern for others means there are times when we must aid those in need.'<br><br>If we are too reluctant to intercede, we create a bleak and indifferent society in which each of us stuggles alone with no expectation of kindness from anyone else. But if however we intercede too readily, we create an intolerant society where everyone spies on and interferes with everyone else.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
