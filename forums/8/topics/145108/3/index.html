There is 2 type:<br>1) Cool follow like Eurasian, educated and wear like latin americas girl<br>2) punk rock or hip hop wear nerd specs losers open mouth come out ah mat, sialah bhutto like Malaysian KAMPUNG...</blockquote>1) is accurate lah. got a few malays pretend to be cool african hip-hop experts here and there, but almost all malays i've seen thus far are very nice one.<br>what's wrong with 2)????? actually, among all the races here, Malays are the best, least proud, most friendly, most down-to-earth and tolerable one. u go CBD look at those stuck-up Chinese and SPGs...KNN!!!! really cannot stand them leh. wha......wear executive suits go cafe and hawker centers eat......CEOs and CFOs is it? KNN.<br>malays also more approchable one. even those malay gangsters are friendly, trust me. KNN. been with them before last time in secondary school and ite loh. also, what's wrong with ah mat, sialah blutto???!!!! that one is down-to-earth malay language mah! malays also better at listening to you and more reasonable loh. besides, if you're in the army infantry where a lot of malays are there, they never play office politics with you loh. most indians also don't really play office politics, but chinese.......worst of the lot loh!!!!! you do a minor thing unintentionally and they back-stab you all the time. KNN eh!<br>furthermore i also chinese, so i know lah. if you know me, you'll see that i always treat malays with total trust and respect(in addition because they're so united) and i'm friendly towards indians too. but everytime i engage with conversation with fellow chinese, i always have to think twice before i speak, or else later they bear grudge against me and act on me in future loh. KNN!<br><br><blockquote>Nikar stop scolding KNN THERE KNN HERE, don't act cool lah fat ass piece of $$!%</blockquote>i say KNN also act cool meh? i told you all before already.......when your daddy here(me) say KNN, it means that it makes my talk/speech even juicer and smoother, like poetry. how many times do i have to repeat? u get offended that's your business loh. why so insecure and get upset so easily? eh, I ask you. why get so insecure and so intolerable? KNN. also, i'm quite handsome and not fat at all lah. my only problem is to get more muscle and be even cooler and more handsome.<br><br>anyway, i encourage you all to say KNN and add KNN into your everyday talk at SGF.<br><br>good day,<br>nikar.</div>
