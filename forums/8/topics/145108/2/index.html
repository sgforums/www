Personally I find most indians I knw are either dickheads or complete losers regardless they come from maldives, sri lanka, india, etc. The self deluding arrogance they carry about themselves. Some of them consider themselves 'playboys' which is so full of bs, with their stories of their conquest full of holes...i know..cos one guy was saying how tis gal slept with him yesterday, etc...which was bs..cos she was my flatmate  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That Galtwenty is right. U must go to other c ountries and see how Singapore is nothing- PEANUTS.... Look at the Chinese wannabes out there everywhere.

This type got one more who try to imitate western accent on radio ,  wear thick frame specs thinks very high class and carry high tech gadget boasting and talking like some minister son/daughter lidat but ask him where they stay, say 3 -room HDB flat and u call it high class? also can tahan  but those kind imitate street kids......really cant tahan .hang out at paco wear suaku jeans like going to anytime drop down your legs lidat.... please lah dont try follo western blacks or Londoners if u dont have the features  like Lucy Liu lidat and end up Ah-Kua . Feel out of place with westerner<br><br>And Malay dont need say. There is 2 type:<br><br>1) Cool follow like Eurasian, educated and wear like latin americas girl<br>2) punk rock or hip hop wear nerd specs  losers open mouth come out ah mat, sialah bhutto like Malaysian KAMPUNG...<br><br></div>
