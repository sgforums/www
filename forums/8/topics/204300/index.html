High security is causing delays at all UK airports. The threat level to the UK has been raised by MI5 to critical.<br><br>According to MI5's website, critical threat level - the highest - means "an attack is expected imminently and indicates an extremely high level of threat to the UK".<br><br><strong>Three US airlines are believed to have been targeted. </strong><br><br>According to BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera new intelligence was received in the last five days which led to the decision for police to act as soon as possible.<br><br>The plot is thought to have involved a series of "waves" of simultaneous attacks, targeting three planes each time.<br><br>He also said the plan "revolved around liquids of some kind".<br><br>"Officials say the explosives would have been sophisticated and extremely effective," our correspondent said.<br><br>Meanwhile, Heathrow Airport has been closed to all incoming flights that are not already in the air, while several outbound services have been cancelled.<br><br>Gatwick Airport has suspended all flights.<br><br>Heathrow airport is crammed with thousands of passengers, while at Stansted more than 2,000 people are queuing to pass through customs.<br><br>Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Stephenson said the alleged plotters had intended "mass murder on an unimaginable scale".<br><br>This disruption is one of the short term limits on freedom that are needed<br><br>"We are confident that we have disrupted a plan by terrorists to cause untold death and destruction and to commit, quite frankly, mass murder," he said.<br><br>"We believe that the terrorists' aim was to smuggle explosives on to aeroplanes in hand luggage and to detonate these in flight. We also believe that the intended targets were flights from the United Kingdom to the United States of America.<br><br>"I can confirm that a significant number of people are currently in custody and the operation is ongoing."<br><br>Police had spoken to a "good number of community leaders to make them aware that a major operation was under way," he added.<br><br>Head of the Met's anti-terrorist branch Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke said the investigation had had "global dimensions" and had seen an "unprecedented level" of surveillance.<br><br>The decision to take action had been taken on Wednesday night, he added.<br><br>According to BBC sources the "principal characters" suspected of being involved in the plot were British-born.
