So, you better make sure that you have all these software available before doing anything. In fact, as mention earlier, it is best you get someone who knows this better to help you along even if you want to do it yourself. There is a good chance you may lose some software permanently in the whole process due to forgetting you have this software only in the HDD. Personally, I have a checklist of software I need to install after formatting. I use to do it about every year just to clean things up when the earlier versions of windows always reduces it's performance after a while.</div>

Uninstall applications that you won't use, or vaguely intend to use in the remote future. Clear all your internet history, cookies and tmp files. There are applications to do all that.
