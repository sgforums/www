            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by AndrewPKYap:<br><strong>In relation to the sun, the earth changes position (around its own axis and revolving around the sun), leading to day and night, and the four seasons.<br><br>One complete circular change of the position of the earth in relation to the sun on its own axis is a 'day'.<br><br>One complete circular change in the position of the earth around the sun is a 'year'.<br><br>One circular rotation of the earth on its own axis in relation to the sun, people conveniently call is a day and the concept of time comes into the minds of humans.<br><br>What is 'one circular rotation of the earth on its own axis in relation to the sun'?<br><br>It is the [b]change</strong> in the position of the earth in relation to the sun.<br><br>Space is both a concept in people's head as well as existing outside of people's heads.<br><br>That is why people can travel in space.<br><br>Time exists only as a concept in people's head but it does not exist outside of people's minds. You can only do time travel in your head (in your own imagination).<br><br>When you apply Einstein's theory to 'time' it is not time travel but a slowing or speed up of time. It is not time travel.<br><br>For example, if you go into outer space at the speed of light, and it takes you 10 light years to come back to earth, you might find that you have aged one year instead of 10 years wheres everyone on earth has aged 10 years.<br><br>When you say that time slows down, what you mean is that the changes has, for you slowed down.<br><br>If you imagine that everything slows down and one day takes what previously takes one month, you think you have 'more' time? You think you have now one month instead of one day?<br><br>No you haven't! That is because, now, you take 30 times longer to type a post in the computer and you take thirty times longer to get to school. It is back to square one!<br><br>To 'increase time, what you do is to increase 'change' in relation to a day. If you do in half a day what takes you previously one whole day to do, you have compared to everyone else, two days in twenty four hours!<br><br>Another interesting thought for you to consider, 'If space is empty, a vacuum, nothing... how can 'nothing' exists?' hahahahahahahahaha[/b]</blockquote>How true.. Everything is all in our minds.. When you have 10 hours of sleep and you stay awake for 10 hours doing nothing. Which seems faster? It is how the mind perceives things in relative to other things. Andrew mentioned, "If you do in half a day what takes you previously one whole day to do, you have compared to everyone else, two days in twenty four hours!" It is all about relativity isn't it?<br><br>Even if you go faster than light, you are just changing your relative position in space and not in time.<br><br>Perhaps, maybe just perhaps, it is possible to see the actual happenings/events of the past, but it will be just like what you see on cameras, video cameras etc. ; can't create a disturbance in it..</div>

You can only do time travel in your head (in your own imagination).<br><br>When you apply Einstein's theory to 'time' it is not time travel but a slowing or speed up of time. It is not time travel.<br><br>For example, if you go into outer space at the speed of light, and it takes you 10 light years to come back to earth, you might find that you have aged one year instead of 10 years wheres everyone on earth has aged 10 years.<br><br>When you say that time slows down, what you mean is that the changes has, for you slowed down.<br><br>If you imagine that everything slows down and one day takes what previously takes one month, you think you have 'more' time? You think you have now one month instead of one day?<br><br>No you haven't! That is because, now, you take 30 times longer to type a post in the computer and you take thirty times longer to get to school. It is back to square one!<br><br>To 'increase time, what you do is to increase 'change' in relation to a day. If you do in half a day what takes you previously one whole day to do, you have compared to everyone else, two days in twenty four hours!<br><br>Another interesting thought for you to consider, 'If space is empty, a vacuum, nothing... how can 'nothing' exists?' hahahahahahahahaha[/b]</blockquote>ur post very make people think.</div>
