              <h2>The sixth season of AMC’s The Walking Dead is scheduled to premiere 
              later this year, with fans already wondering what’s in store for Rick 
              and the gang. Actor Steven Yeun, who plays Glenn, has addressed 
              speculation regarding the character’s rumoured death. Read on to find 
              out more</h2>
              <p>Following The Walking Dead’s fifth season finale</p>
              <p>after walking in on Rick executing Pete, Jessie’s abusive husband. We 
              last left the survivors narrowly avoiding a walker attack after Father 
              Gabriel left the Safe Zone’s gate unlocked, with Pete’s murderous attack
               on Reg, Deanna’s husband, leaving Rick the de facto leader of the Safe 
              Zone. Fans are expecting big things from the show’s new episodes, slated
               to premiere later this fall, with those familiar with EP Robert 
              Kirkman’s original comic book series beginning to wonder if Glenn will 
              continue to feature as heavily in Season 6. <strong>Actor Steven Yeun has addressed rumours surrounding the character’s death in a recent interview with</strong></p>
              <p>While Yeun and Kirkman refused to directly confirm whether or not Glenn 
              will be killed off in Season 6, the actor did reveal that if Glenn were 
              to die, his final scenes would have to be <em>“meaningful”</em>. Yeun commented: <em>"The
               writers and everybody really want to focus on making things poignant 
              and purposeful and meaningful... So if it were for Glenn to go, then 
              it's probably going to be awesome."</em><strong> Fans of Kirkman’s original canon will know that Glenn is brutally murdered by Negan</strong>,
               whose arrival in Season 6 is still yet to be confirmed, shortly after 
              the survivors have arrived at the Safe Zone. For more information about 
              what's in store.</p>

              <h1>The Walking Dead Season 6: Morgan's return will "change the show's dynamic"</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.thydemonsbescribblin.com/uploads/2/9/2/8/29282825/330307_orig.jpeg?403" alt="" width="620" height="376"></p>
              <h2>The Walking Dead's fifth season wrapped up last month with 
              "Conquer", where fan favourite Morgan finally caught up with Rick and 
              co. in Alexandria. According to executive producer Gale Anne Hurd, the 
              character's return will change the show's dynamic when Season 6 
              premieres later this year</h2>
              <p>Following an altercation with Jessie's abusive husband Pete, who stabbed Deanna's husband Reg to death in a drunken rage, <strong>Rick was given permission to take the law into his own hands</strong>,
               executing Pete with a bullet to the head as the shocked Alexandrians 
              looked on. It looks like the Ricktatorship is set to continue when new 
              episodes premiere in the fall, with executive producer Gale Anne Hurd 
              adding that Morgan's arrival in the Safe Zone is set to change the 
              dynamics of the show. <strong>Read on to find out what she had to say about the character's return.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Speaking to Deadline, Hurd revealed: </strong> <em>"I can say whenever the 
              group adds new characters to their core, it changes the dynamic. So with
               the re-introduction of Morgan, we’re going to see the dynamic change...
               With Morgan now having eschewed violence and become like a Zen warrior 
              we’ll see what kind of impact that has on Rick as well as Deanna and the
               new group that’s a combination of Alexandria and our survivors."</em><strong> During a subsequent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Hurd declared: </strong><em> "Morgan's story will be interesting because he was clearly a homicidal 
              maniac when we saw him in "Clear," and now he's transformed into... 
              someone who is able to survive, who is able to take on multiple people 
              with his fighting staff, but he's not someone who really wants to have 
              to kill anyone. When he encounters Rick, it looks to him like Rick just 
              killed another human being in cold blood, execution style. There could 
              be some interesting encounters given how their roles have reversed."</em></p>

              <p>Born and raised in Southern California, Christian knew from an early age
               that she wanted to be an actress. As a toddler, she was already a 
              compulsive performer. She would entertain her family nightly by 
              re-enacting television shows. Christian put all that passion into dance 
              and studied ballet along with ice-skating. Christian competed frequently
               in ice-skating competitions. She enjoyed dance and ice-skating so much 
              that she decided to study multiple dance styles. Christian started as a 
              Ford model.</p>

              <p>The living dead stalked Tokyo on Saturday as some 100 zombie fans 
              lurched around a city park for an annual gathering in grisly makeup.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1432012999087_1213">Assorted representatives of the 
              undead staggered their mindless way through Yoyogi Park covered in gore 
              and fake blood, some making it a family outing with their zombie infants
               in tow and enjoying the startled reactions of passersby.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1432012999087_1181">"I love zombies," said Daisuke Tanaka, 33, while adding "blood" and mock cuts to his neck.</p>

               fun to see people stunned and scared by my zombie appearance," Takaka 
              said, next to his friend with guts hanging out from his unbuttoned 
              shirt.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1432012999087_1453">While most dressed as 
              modern flesheaters and reanimated corpses, others appeared as the 
              classic Chinese "jiangshi" hopping zombie-vampire or as Frankenstein's 
              monster, the great-granddaddy of the undead.</p>

              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1433485605260_703" class="first">As night falls in a 
              small Spanish village, horror movie fan Noelia Vacias prepares for a 
              night as a zombie invasion survivor, her eyes glowing white from tinted 
              contact lenses, her arms covered in fake blood.</p>
              <p>Nearby Enrique Morales wears a helmet and dark glasses and carries a fake gun.</p>
              <p>Like the hundreds of others waiting in the park, for the next eight 
              hours they will flee the living dead with blood dripping from their 
              wounds to avoid being contaminated and turning into zombies themselves.</p>
              <p>"A zombie does not have the power of other characters" in science 
              fiction, says Vacias, a 35-year-old logistics expert. "Before being 
              zombies there were normal people. But they never get tired and that is 
              what is frightening."</p>
              <p>For Morales, a 23-year-old telecoms engineer, meanwhile, the game is "a way to take part in reproducing a zombie apocalypse".</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1433485605260_876">The scenario, which resembles a scene from the TV series "The Walking Dead", involves over 400 participants.</p>
              <p>"Survival Zombie" -- held recently in the village of Olias del Rey, 
              70 kilometres (40 miles) south of Madrid -- was the 22nd edition of the 
              event in Spain since it was launched in 2012, with more and more people 
              turning out in each town that hosts a zombie invasion.</p>
              <p>A group of actors dressed as soldiers are also involved in the game, 
              helping some players against the zombies or making it harder for others 
              to solve the clues to survive.</p>
              <p>Some of the largest zombie games in Spain have drawn up to 3,000 participants and even involved tanks or helicopters.</p>
              <p>- 'Fighting to survive' -</p>
              <p>Most participants are men aged 17-40, even if the game is open to anyone over the age of 10.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1433485605260_877">Pablo Lueiro, 33, and his friend 
              Juan Carlos Fernandez, 44, are hooked on the adrenaline provided by the 
              all night roleplaying game and have taken part in several editions.</p>
              <p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/c31S0U9p5Zq63fkEYT1v6g--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9aW5zZXQ7aD0zNDg7aWw9cGxhbmU7cT03NTt3PTUxMg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_sg/News/AFP/1905ace648bdc462a11e207d78d1d373e43302ea.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="348"></p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1433485605260_878">"When you play, you are almost 
              convinced that you are fighting to survive," said Lueiro, who works as a
               video game tester, adding that he felt fear even if it was only 
              "psychological".</p>
              <p>His friend, who carried a flashlight and a walkie talkie, said the game revived memories of playing catch as a child.</p>
              <p>"We walked nearly 50 kilometres during another zombie night," he said.</p>
              <p>Zombies have been in fashion since the beginning of the 2000s in the 
              movies, literature and video games, according to Jerome-Olivier Allard, 
              who has a doctorate in film studies from the University of Montreal in 
              Canada and is a fan of the genre.</p>
              <p>The games allow people to tap into their "survival fantasies", he said.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1433485605260_879">In addition to Spain, Zombie-themed events have proved popular in other countries as well.</p>
              <p>In the United States and Canada zombie marches started being held in 
              the early 2000s, drawing several thousand people in some cities, before 
              the fashion spread to other continents.</p>
              <p><img src="https://s1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/VoO0_5bbFdbWv70MIsXLnQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9aW5zZXQ7aD0zNTg7aWw9cGxhbmU7cT03NTt3PTUxMg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_sg/News/AFP/41049340e938d6dc6ad258f6511279675b1fb46d.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="358"></p>
              <p>In Britain, a zombie chase game called "2.8 Hours Later", inspired by
               Danny Boyle's 2010 cult film "28 Hours Later" about a pan-global 
              epidemic that turns people into cannibalistic zombies has been held in 
              several cities.</p>
              <p>In Canada, a summer camp for adults provides lessons on how to survive "an attack by the living dead".</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1433485605260_880">- Fascinated by zombies -</p>
              <p>Diego de la Concepcion, the organiser of the "Survival Zombie" 
              roleplaying games in Spain, said other creatures did not spark as much 
              interest.</p>
              <p>"We tried with other themes, with aliens and predators, but they did not have as much success," he said.</p>
              <p>The goal of the game is for participants to stay alive until morning by avoiding getting touched by a zombie.</p>
              <p>The contestants need to find clues that will help them reach a safe haven, the end point of the contest.</p>
              <p>They are not allowed to attack the zombies so their only means of survival is by avoiding the living dead.</p>
              <p>For French sociologist Maxime Coulombe, author of the book "The Small Zombie Philosophy", the appeal of the games is simple.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_9_1_1_1433485605260_881">People are fascinated by zombies, he says, and "contemporary societies are obsessed with the end of the world".</p>
