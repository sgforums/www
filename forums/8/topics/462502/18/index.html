              <h1 class="story-headline">This Walking Dead star hopes he is killed off in a blaze of glory</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/rl680/public/articles/2017/02/18/NP_20170218_GRJOSH18_1504001.jpg?itok=cZ0m9iXq" alt=""></p>
              <p>t is not often someone tells you he is looking forward 
              to his death. But not everyone is on hit television zombie drama The 
              Walking Dead, either.</p>
              <p>Josh McDermitt is excited about the prospect of his demise - on screen, that is.</p>
              <p>The 38-year-old US actor, who plays the less-than-gung-ho survivor 
              Eugene Porter, told The  Sun News: "I hope he goes out like a hero."</p>
              <p>In town as part of the show's Asian press tour, the Arizona native 
              said: "He has lived his life in the shadows of cowardice, and I hope he 
              goes out in a blaze of glory, saving people.</p>
              <p>"It will be an epic death because they do not just kill people - you 
              have your guts ripped out and your head smashed in. I am looking forward
               to it."</p>
              <div class="mid-article-ad-block">
              <div id="dfp-ad-midarticlespecial-wrapper" class="dfp-tag-wrapper"></div>
              </div>
              <p>Not that he wants out. Before he was cast in the show, he was - and remains - a huge fan.</p>
              <p>"I just hope it is like three, four, five, six, 10 years down the road," he joked.</p>
              <p>While the series, now in its seventh season, maintains a central 
              group of protagonists led by ex-cop Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), it has
               no qualms about suddenly killing off beloved characters.</p>
              <p>The current season opened with fan favourites Glenn Rhee (played by 
              Steven Yeun) and Abraham Ford (Michael Cudlitz) meeting gory ends.</p>
              <p>McDermitt, who joined the show with Cudlitz in the fourth season, was affected by their on-screen deaths.</p>
              <p>"They are the two I was closest to, Michael especially. He is like a big brother to me," he said.</p>
              <p>"I still get a little emotional when I think about not going to work with him."</p>
              <p>An occupational hazard of being on such a popular show is the spoilers.</p>
              <p>McDermitt admitted to lying to his family and friends, saying: "There
               is a level of protectiveness (the cast members) all have when talking 
              to anybody, whether it is a journalist or a fan.</p>
              <p>"Some cast members have bigger mouths than others. I have watched 
              some stuff get spoiled right in front of my face, and they do not even 
              realise they are saying it."</p>
              <p>He said the tightly-knit cast generally keeps things light.</p>
              <p>"If Danai Gurira (who plays Michonne) has a heavy and emotional 
              scene, we are not going to be running up to her and goofing off. We want
               to give her space so that she can do that," he said.</p>
              <p>"But because the elements are so challenging, we do try and keep it 
              light. We hang out as often as we can to build up that sense of family 
              and friendship.</p>
              <p>"It makes the challenging parts easier because you realise you are not doing this alone."</p>
              <p>What would he change about the show?</p>
              <p>"The worst thing about working on the show is Andrew Lincoln. He is a
               jerk... I am kidding. You can print that, he will not care. He loves 
              it!"</p>

              <h2 class="entry-title">Trolls worse than zombies, says 'Walking Dead' star</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.themalaymailonline.com/uploads/articles/2017/2017-02/josh_mcdermitt_21022017.jpeg" alt="" width="800" height="534"></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE — If there is one thing The Walking Dead star Josh McDermitt hates, it is haters.</p>
              <p>The
               38-year-old, who plays Dr Eugene Porter on the popular American TV 
              show, was recently in the news for speaking out on behalf of co-star 
              Alanna Masterson. She received brutal online criticism in November about
               her weight after being seen in the show’s new season, having returned 
              to shooting her role as Tara Chambler after giving birth to her first 
              daughter in 2015.</p>
              <p>McDermitt responded to the criticism, saying that weight gain was part of the natural and beautiful process of childbirth.</p>
              <p>“There’s
               a bigger issue here. It’s not just about body shaming. It’s more about 
              the Internet and how there are no consequences on social media,” he said
               in an interview with TODAY. “That’s a problem because we’re breeding a 
              lot of people who spew hatred. It’s sad that our society is headed in 
              that direction.”</p>
              <p>Irresponsible Internet trolls are why 
              McDermitt thinks many public figures, including himself, hold back from 
              sharing their lives on social media: There is just too much negativity.</p>
              <p>“I’ll
               be honest: I don’t get on social media as much as I used to, because I 
              see a lot of bad things there and it drags me down. I get negative,” he 
              said.</p>
              <p>“When people say, ‘I hate Eugene’ — you’re entitled
               to your opinion and I get that he’s not going to be everyone’s 
              favourite character, but do you have to send that message to me? Have 
              some manners. I’m not saying you have to like him, but you don’t have to
               throw that in my face.</p>
              <p>“That’s why I’ve kind of pulled back from social media; I 
              think that’s why other people do too ... And at the end of the day, the 
              people who then suffer are the fans of the show.”</p>
              <p>McDermitt was in town last week for the first time to promote the show, which has begun airing part two of its seventh season.</p>
              <p>One
               thing that you cannot escape talking about with McDermitt is his 
              mullet. His character is so known for this distinctive hairstyle that it
               even led to the star commenting on how Singapore is somewhat similar to
               Atlanta, Georgia, where many scenes for The Walking Dead are filmed.</p>
              <p>“It’s very hot, very humid,” McDermitt said of Singapore, noting that Atlanta can be the same.</p>
              <p>“The humidity (here) is taking its toll on the mullet,” McDermitt deadpanned.</p>
              <p>Asked
               whether he minds having to wear that particular style for the show, he 
              says that “the mullet is iconic. I don’t know that many people having 
              the mullet these days, and so it’s nice to represent that sect of 
              society”.</p>
              <p>Does that sect of society write to him to thank him for being their champion?</p>
              <p>“I
               don’t think people who have a mullet know how to write. Unfortunately, 
              they’re so busy maintaining their mullets, they’re not literate,” he 
              quipped.</p>
              <p>On a show where every character’s fate hangs in 
              the balance (fan favourites like Abraham Ford, played by Michael Cudlitz
               and Glenn Rhee, played by Steven Yeun, have been killed off), something
               as insignificant as an actor’s hairstyle can be a spoiler.</p>
              <p>“A
               lot of fans say, ‘Oh, you still have the mullet, therefore you’re still
               alive (on the show)’. I want to caution them on that,” McDermitt said.</p>
              <p>“Just
               because I have the mullet doesn’t mean anything. You could be talking 
              to a dead man right now, and you don’t even know it.”</p>
              <p>Ask him about how Eugene would really do in a real-life zombie apocalypse, and McDermitt chuckles.</p>
              <p>“I
               think Eugene represents what many people would be like in the 
              apocalypse: Someone who is scared, maybe a bit of a coward, hoping 
              someone else protects them.</p>
              <p>“If the apocalypse started tomorrow, I think we would see a lot of 
              Eugenes out there. Unfortunately, a lot of people would die,” he said.</p>
