            <div class='col-md body'>Harsh reality sets in for these Vietnamese brides<br><br>A BLUE-and-white porcelain vase nearly a metre tall stands facing the marital bed.<br><br>It's heavy with about $2,000 in coins and notes. These are part-time masseur Teo Xiong's savings, and his wife's 'escape' money.<br><br>'I tell her, any time you want to leave me, take the money, buy a ticket and go home,' he said, stroking the long hair of his Vietnamese wife, Ms Tran Thi Tu Trinh.<br><br>Ms Tran did. Once. She fled home last November, shortly after coming here. She was homesick, and he felt guilty about marrying such a young girl. She turned 19 in August, while he is 51. But a day later, he asked her to come back. She did and they wed in January.<br><br>Mr Teo is among the increasing number of Singaporeans taking Vietnamese brides. These brides make up 300 to 500 of the Vietnamese community of 3,000, estimates Vietnam's embassy here. It said the influx began in the late 1990s.<br><br>It isn't easy for the women.<br><br>'I cried every day because I was homesick. I was used to having my papa and mama around,' said Ms Tran, who comes from a small village, seven hours' drive away from Ho Chi Minh City.<br><br>Her husband expects her to sweep the white tiled floor of their rented flat in Commonwealth Crescent every day. But she 'doesn't notice the dust', he complained, because she was used to a dirt floor back home.<br><br>Tempers flare. She snaps at him in Vietnamese. He retorts in Mandarin. 'I never know what she's scolding me,' Mr Teo said with a chuckle.<br><br>No official breakdown nationality of foreign brides was available, but the rise of matchmade pairings between Singaporeans and Vietnamese point to the trend.<br><br>In 1996, just 20 couples wed this way. Last year, there were about 90 such marriages, according to figures from the agencies.<br><br>Sin Ye, which started in 2000, said it is responsible for 100 such Singaporean-Vietnamese weddings, while Life Partner Matchmaker said that it has matched 200 couples since 1996.<br><br>A recent report on the news website Asia Times said Vietnam was cracking down on quickie marriages between its women and foreigners.<br><br>Not so, said Mr Nguyen Kuyen, head of consular affairs in Vietnam's embassy here.<br><br>'Getting married is the freedom of every person, and the government won't intervene,' he said.<br><br>Many of these brides are simple village girls in their late teens or early 20s. Sent to the cities to find a foreign groom, they are picked out of parades by strange men and cannot afford to be choosy.<br><br>But after the wedding toasts are made and the bridal rouge is creamed off, reality sets in. Now, they must share a bed with a virtual stranger.<br><br>Said Ms Mai Leng, 21, who married security guard Weng He Quan, 41: 'I cried a lot when I first came. I was very scared. I didn't know my husband then and he looked fierce.'<br><br>And if things go wrong, they have no social network to lean on. Counsellor Wong Kwong Sing from the Tanjong Pagar Family Service Centre recently helped a Vietnamese woman battered by her Singaporean husband to get a divorce.<br><br>In-law difficulties often loom large. Madam Nguyen Thuy Hang, 38, who is married to a contractor, said she knows of at least seven Vietnamese women who are taunted by their in-laws. 'They say, 'Why did you marry my son? You want money right? You want the whole flat right?' '<br><br>When things get tense with the in-laws, cultural differences and language problems only make it worse.<br><br>For unlike the China brides who started making inroads here in the l980s, most of the Vietnamese can manage only a smidgen of Mandarin - if at all.<br><br>Adapting to city life is also hard. It takes about six months for them to adjust.<br><br>For months, Ms Hong Than, 21, who used to live in a kampung hut, was afraid to look out from the ninth-floor flat she shares with her businessman husband.<br><br>Despite the difficulties, most of the women stay married. Divorce bears a stigma in Vietnamese society and life back home would be infinitely tougher than it is here.<br><br>Ms Tran, for one, doesn't intend to touch the rest of her husband's savings in that big vase again. She said: 'If I go back to Vietnam, it will be with my husband.'<br><br>http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4386,213133,00.html?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
