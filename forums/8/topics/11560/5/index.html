Can I question you to tell me "How was the whole world made?", "How is it that you have breath and a conscience to think?", "How is it that the smallest life form and the biggest animal is so wonderful and intricately designed?".  Using maths, "What's the probability of life happening from a big bang?".  Can you explain this?  No?  That how can you say there is no God?  Can you prove that God doesn't exist?  Show me the proof using your science and your logic.<br><br>Back to your NASA problem.  If you work in a big Company and found out that the Biggest Boss is embezzling funds and his connections is far and wide, political, social, judicial, you name he has it and everywhere. Would you still want to expose him?  Even if you did, what will it achieve?  I said before there's no point talking about the NASA issue because without the actual statistics or access the right people or data.  Everything else is a speculation.  If you have work in a big government organisation, you'll realise how screwy everything is.  Knowing how things work in these agencies, it's easy to pin a scapegoat.  Haven't you thought of that?<br><br>I believe your not anti-christ.  You're just anti-God.   :p</div>

Even today there are many different denominations and cults which interprets the Bible different.  I would piss a lot of people if I said my views about other denominations and Roman Catholism.  The Bible said "So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day."  It didn't say that the sun moved around the earth, did it? Wrong interpretation, right?  What's your interpretation?<br><br>I was taught to keep an open mind and explore what's going on before I come to a conclusion.  You will think that this is the end of the matter but have you read about what Scientists have calculated using Scientific Methods and Maths and realised that there is a missing day in the whole history of creation.

Which Klactovak have said.... "Go get some sleep..." Stop wasting your brain juice here... Try pouring it somewhere else...?<br>AND have you heard of POLITICAL MONITORING of INTERNET SITES by the Singapore Government....? Do you think by spilling so much articles on RELIGION would get you EXCUSED...? (HELLO... Anybody UP THERE...??)<br>YES... By the end of the day, your words might have put your 'opponent' down...

Let you people discern what is right or wrong...<br><br>Whether you believe in God or not, is your personal decision.  I do not have bias in your beliefs.  If you think there is no God, then put a qualifier in front of your assertions like "In my opinion, I do not believe.... blah blah blah...."  but your statements are always "There is no God."<br><br>You do not have a right to say things like this because it may or may not be the truth and secondly, you cause other people to think that what you say is the truth.

BUT as long as the person refuses to believe or accept.. it is furtileless.. NO offence ok. I believe very much in individual soul liberty. Even GOD HIMSELF would not force anyone to believe in HIM. So i hope people will be interested to learn more about the bible not thrash it. I would be most glad to read of posts discussing the bible instead of scrutinise it. I don't go around studying the Quran or any other materials cos i don't want to be tempted to discredit them. Christians should present the gospel and not bring down other religions so likewise i believe it's fair for us to receive the same treatment.<br>u will never experience GOD's love till u allow HIM to love u cos HE never force HIS way in.<br><br></div>

Urmm if Christ didn't exist, why would our calender have this thing called "BC" huh..? Don't tell me they made an error. If so y do people still use this calender... Any takers who can prove Christ didn't exist... Wait before u attempt to debate, how do u write ur date one huh(in which format, which calender)..?</strong></blockquote>And King Arthur, don't you think that bringing up this kind of argument to support your stand of christianity is a kind of insult to your own intelligence or you just wanna act the same way like those goondu black sheep?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>My personal belief is that a person can be presented with so much evidence that it doesn't even take a kid's logic to believe or accept... BUT as long as the person refuses to believe or accept.. it is furtileless.. NO offence ok. I believe very much in individual soul liberty. Even GOD HIMSELF would not force anyone to believe in HIM. So i hope people will be interested to learn more about the bible not thrash it. I would be most glad to read of posts discussing the bible instead of scrutinise it. I don't go around studying the Quran or any other materials cos i don't want to be tempted to discredit them. Christians should present the gospel and not bring down other religions so likewise i believe it's fair for us to receive the same treatment.<br>u will never experience GOD's love till u allow HIM to love u cos HE never force HIS way in.</strong></blockquote>In the end, I'm so surprised that you still can say "Yeah 77" which totally contradict your own theory of calendar AD/BC. If you are not sure of any proof that Jesus is the son of GOD and GOD is real, then stop telling everyone like those goondu black sheep as described by domyoji33. Just keep everything to yourself. Your own personal belief is that such that you can be presented with so much evidence that it doesn't even take a kid's logic to believe or accept... (Does that imply your own kiddy's logic?? Sorry, ours is not as simple as yours after so much education). And you expect everyone to accept something that's without any concrete proof like you? Wouldn't this whole earth be full of dreamers then? Wouldn't the whole earth be waiting for death when all the pple just know how to pray, know their bible in and out and dreaming of going to heaven ???<br><br>Sorry, luckily not everyone is a dreamer, everyone have their own freedom of choice. Stop being irritating if you are one of those black sheep and to tell us you all going to hell if you don believe in christ etc. You wanna believe then you keep it to yourself. we have better thing to do.<br><br>You wanna excel in christianity and be expert in biblogy? carry on. no one stopping you. Get your christianity cert with 1st class honor and nothing else. That certificate ensure your path to heaven and nothing else matters anymore.</div>

Personally, I fall short of being one.  But that does not stop me from trying.  The important word is "repent" from an old way of life, hating the things you enjoy doing.  Pubbing, cigarettes, boozing, prostitution.  It's never easy.  Many people give up and most have been deluded that as long as they believe without a total change in lifestyle they are saved.  I hate to rain on your party but my opinion of being a Christian is never of lip service but a total sacrifice in body and soul... it's really difficult.  All the struggles and temptations, especially when you give in to temptations.  One always have that feeling that how can God love someone who keeps sinning.  The good thing is God's love is unconditional.  Just do your best and stay in touch with God.<br><br>For those people who don't believe in God.  Please ignore this post or read it for your benefit.
