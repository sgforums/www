            <div class='col-md body'>In the bible, Jesus didn't tell us to show off our knowledge or force others to see logic in the bible. HE only told us to do the great Commission. There are so many questions that are still being left unanswered. GOD only gave us enough knowledge in the form of the bible to achieve salvation. So what if we can convince u in the topics mentioned here, u can always trump up another question. I think as christians we should show others the love of GOD.<br>To poopoomoon;<br>U never was alone, GOD provided your wisdom and words and is always in you, with you and around you. Even the devils tremble upon hearing HIS Words. just continuing trusting and have faith.<br>GOD's logic is actually very simple, find the ultimate sacrifice,complete it and those that accept the gift/sacrifice do not have to die. That sacrifice was and is Jesus. All it took was the greatest love ever. But there were no forcing of wills.<br>try and see GOD's love for yourself.<br><br>[This message has been edited by King Arthur (edited 26 June 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Christ*advocate:</div><div class="quote_body">The bible contains a series of 66 books that is compiled over more than 4000 years. It's amazing that they can all have a central theme of the saviour Jesus christ. Maybe you can give a good explaination for that? Pure coincidence of 4000 years?<br><br>If you can't answer this, is your belief of a non christian illogical?<br></div></blockquote>Have you read the articles thru the link that i provided you and analysed how christian survived until now by forcefully spreading itself and eliminating non-christian so as to achieve conformity? That's explain mostly for your coincidence of 4000 years. Read about the <a href="http://atheism.about.com/religion/atheism/library/weekly/aa072299b.htm" rel="nofollow">crusades</a> And stop acting like jap pushing any blame off themselves wat they did in ww2 if you try to deny the occurances of crusades. The history is written even in your own book to show the crude nature of christianity. Go and read for yourself. Any morally good person will think negatively of such religions if they are thinking logically, not blindfolded and still having their right mind. Can you deny there's no killing, mass slaughtering just like wat the jap did in ww2 in the history of bible?<br><br><blockquote><strong>As for the pharaoh story, I think it's unfair to look at one side. What about the jewish people? They were protected irregardless of their morality. They did not land up like the egyptian simply becoz of God's grace, nothing else. Isn't that unfairly good for the jews? God just wanted to protect His people and likewise you can choose to be christian and be protected like the jews or otherwise.</strong></blockquote>Yeah, it's unfair to look at one side. yes the jewish is somehow protected by the god but that's because they succumb to the god in fear of losing their life like the rest of the pple. Imagine, the japanese overrunning over Asia during ww2. Can you still say the same thing? And tat is it's unfair to look at one side cos there are still pple who surrender themselve to the japanese empire and hence being protected and live till today? Likewise, you can choose to pledge your loyalty to the jap and be protected like the japanese or otherwise?<br><br><blockquote><strong>In any case, if God is so heartless, He wouldn't have given pharoah 10 chances. If i am God, i will make pharoah's son die straight away, dun think i have so much paitence with a stubborn guy. </strong></blockquote>If the god is so heartful, he could had spare all the living things in Egypt and just put the evil doer pharoah to sleep if he's really guilty.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>kyo 23, you speak of being a morally right person. All religions teach that, they teach good morality and behaviours to go to heaven. But seriously, who can boast of good morality? i bet you can't even control yourself from fantasizing or lusting after woman and you wanna talk about good morality?</strong></blockquote>When did i say i'm a saint?? And are you one?? trying to be personal, isn't it?? Trying to make a comparison to see who stand on a higher authority to command as stated in the christianity world? only man can be a preachers etc etc? <a href="http://atheism.about.com/religion/atheism/library/weekly/aa022300b.htm" rel="nofollow">(Gender discrimination)</a> discrimination against disabled pple? Those who is unfit cannot be preachers cannot speak??<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>and God knows we all will fail if we are judged by the law of God. He send His only beloved Son Jesus to fulfil the law and die for all mankind so that all can be justified by the grace of God and not by works of man.<br></strong></blockquote>There you go again with the story of jesu. Are you sure his death saved the mankind? he might just be a dreamer who thought he will save the world if he die when actually it isn't so. The earth still rotate, the sun still rise as usual even if this guy is still alive. When is his 2nd coming? If there's no such event, wouldn't some pple be wasting their time praying and praying so that they can go to heaven (their aim in life is just to go to heaven that's all when they have no proof whether this heaven exist or not)? You haven't answer the question wat sins or disappointment of ours are there for him to die in place of us when we are not even borned during his time?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 26 June 2001).]</div>

I guess the answer is the god himself who is as sinful as the satan. Maybe god is satan himself? Maybe not?? so what's god?? no one can explain or prove. What's heaven?? what's hell?? anyone can explain or prove?? how come the god who is as mighty as you all claimed to be can allowed a sinful world ruled by satan to exist?? why not make it all disappear??? And one more thing, you seem to be diverting all the suffering caused on the innocent to be the work of another virtual character The Satan when it was written clearly in the bible that it's the LORD aka god himself who kill mercilessly all the innocent (baby, woman, animal etc).<br><br>Finally, there's something i like to comment out loud. LUCKILY, THIS IS THE MODERN ERA not like the olden time when the crusade is allowed to happen because of majority is the christ believers. In this modern time when more and more pple are more educated and having a right and logical mind, we are at least safe from all those merciless crusaders who were empowered by the LORD aka god to do all those killing cos god himself also kill like nobody setting an example in the bible. Doesn't this sound familiar?? Japanese general killing like nobody inciting his soldiers killing the innocent who don't surrender to japanese for the glory of the japanese empire in ww2??</div>

It's not a befief that they are writting but <strong>logical analysis and reasonnig of what's WRITTEN in the BIBLE</strong>. Did i ever said or mentioned it's offensive to me that you christian believe in the true bible?? I mentioned it's alright that individual believe in his own god or even everything written in the bible, just don irritate and preaches to others by mentioning, implying or cursing "it's a sin not to believe in christ" or "you all going to hell if you don't believe in christ etc etc". You can believe in what ever you want, it's individual time, effort and business. Just don harm or interfere with other's normal life and activities. There's freedom of choice.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>2 Timothy 3:16<br>All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is] profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:<br><br>Doesn't this verse means that the bible was given by GOD HIMSELF.<br></strong></blockquote>So what's the answer to this question? Aren't all scripture which [is] given by inspiration hand written by mortal man???<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>The verse didn't say it will answer all the questions u have regarding God's reasons for doing the things that may seem "heartless" but is not. It is up to the Creator to know and not up to us to decide for HIM.</strong></blockquote>so you yourself also can't explain question regarding God's heartless and cruel behaviour since it's not up to us to decide for HIM and yet you mentioned "God's reasons for doing the things that may seem "heartless" but is not" Aren't you deciding it for him then?? contradiction?? No offence but please use logical reasoning, thinking and proof to verify god's behaviour. I bet some of the good hearted pple who read the mass killing WRITTEN in the bible and the events of the crusades will weep for all the suffering of those innocent pple killed. Study your bible and weep for them please.</div>

He has no experience and knowledge that fire will burn or the knife will cut and hurt him until he hurt himself. That's why teaching and guidance is necessary to make him learn. If you force the child to go away or forcefully removes the knife, you don't explain to him that there's satan in those thing. You need to explain to him why these thing are dangerous in the correct and proven sense. Everyone know that it's a fact and by past experience or teaching that a fireplace or a knife can be dangerous especially to an ignorant child. However, no one know for sure the origin and validity of an religion. They themselve can't even explain the validity of religion unlike the case of the fireplace or knife which they can explain to the child. So what's view and opinion imposing on the child then when there's is truth and explanation that can verify why fireplace and knife is dangerous to the child?? All i can say, this is teaching of fact not imposing a view or opinion anymore.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>do you dare to say you know 0.000001% of the information in the universe? if not, how can you immediately discredit stuff you hear bout the christian faith?</strong></blockquote>Yes, we cannot say that we know more than a tiny bit of the information in the universe. And yes, we cannot immediately discredit stuff we hear about the christian faith, but that doesn't mean we can in turn credit it. All we can do is to keep these stuff in view and try to verify the truth of them. Until it is provened like the case of hard fact in the fireplace and knife that you mentioned, then we can start teaching it even in our educational system just like wat we did for math, physic, history etc spreading it worldwide. that's for your thought why subject like math are worldwide acceptance while religion are subjected to so much diversity in acceptance level.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>anyone has a single shred of evidence that there is an error in the Bible?</strong></blockquote>Any evidence to verify all that's in the bible? incest of adam and eve and their children to create human kind??<br><br><blockquote><strong>people who say that there's alot of bad stuff in the Bible, mass killings, females mistreated and alot of other stuff. yes itz true these stuff DID happen. but ever considered the reason?

Think we might like to hear from the female about their view for all their suffering. And one more logic, since adam and eve had fallen towards the evil side, why wouldn't the almighty merciless god just kill them all and restart again with a new pair for his pleasure and company?? maybe he just enjoy flooding the human lot to gain pleasure, maybe he just like to hear the suffering, dying cry of the human including innocent baby of the egypt etc.<br><br><blockquote><strong>to those people out there: taking a chance now to throw all kinds of insults at Christians and Christianity now, aren't you doing the same thing like those christians 'did'? they said your gods were idols and fakes, now you're calling them fakes too. if you can't stand christians, cant you prove that you're better than them</strong></blockquote>I'm a freethinker and hence don't support any side of the religion but only believe in logic and science with proof. Everyone believe in hard provened science cos it explain why thing come about their way e.g thunder, elicpse etc. Aren't this better in some sense? So for religion, i can only respect them for their belief cos it's just a human belief and everyone has a freedom to choose what they want to believe. For all my observation, christianity might be one of the religion which practises religion intolerance promoting all the bad stuff i mentioned which explain all the violence and religious war in the religion history. These are just some thought that you might want to analyse and not forcing you to accept. you want to believe in your religion is your own business, don't force others to accept it the way like you do.<br><br>And lastly edited.

Following your logic, if some parent has kids that are deformed or retarded... why not kill them off and start anew.  Good choice, right?  And in your case extremely logically.  I wonder what you have to say now?  The reason why God doesn't wipe everyone off the face of the earth is re-conciliation.  My friend (freethinker) has a better argument... Why put the "Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil" and "Tree of Life" in the Garden of Eden which is accessible to Adam and Eve to fall into sin.  Freedom of Choice to trust and obey or to rebel.

The sun revolves round the earth, the earth is flat and so on.  Proof?  Theory of Relativity is based on Thinking Experiments and Maths.  Do you consider that proof?  It won't stop there, relativity, quantum physics, may be in a flux until someone comes out with a better theory. As for the TOE, let's wait and see.  If I were to put you a challenge to read the entire Bible will you do it?  I guess not, just like I'm not ready to read Koran, or Buddhist Scriptures or Taoist teachings.  Therefore, I hope everyone keeps their peace and stop pointing fingers and saying things that are untrue about another's religion.  Think before speaking, don't speak without thinking.  Your recent arguments has lessen the cohesiveness of your initial argument/debate.... sigh.  I hope this is the end of it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
