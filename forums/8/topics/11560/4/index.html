If your knowledge is not stable, don't cause another to flounder.<br><br>Kyo23, the Bible does not promote sexual discrimination.  Your infallible logic lacks commonsense at times.  Following your logic, if some parent has kids that are deformed or retarded... why not kill them off and start anew.  Good choice, right? And in your case extremely logically.  I wonder what you have to say now? </div></blockquote>the Bible does not promote sexual discrimination?? so what did the bible say for woman?? please read <a href="http://atheism.about.com/religion/atheism/library/weekly/aa022300b.htm" rel="nofollow">your bible</a> regarding the <a href="http://atheism.about.com/religion/atheism/library/bible/bl_NumbersJealousy.htm" rel="nofollow">rule for woman</a><br>if the parents had kids who are deformed or retarded, the lord will not hesitate to discriminate against them as WRITTEN in the bible also. And the lord will not hesitate to kill you if you choose to believe other gods. Would your own parent do the same thing if you choose not to believe them but other's parents?? Please use valid example, the LORD is not your parent. Check your birth certificate if you have doubt. My point is the LORD is merciless as can be analysed from all the crime he did. He would not care for much of a single living thing as long as they are disloyal to him. that's why the flood. Now i wonder what you have to say now.<br><br><blockquote><strong> The reason why God doesn't wipe everyone off the face of the earth is re-conciliation.

Freedom of Choice to trust and obey or to rebel.  Why this?  I do not know.<br>There's a plan somewhere that my limited mind cannot comprehend.<br></strong></blockquote>You are a christian right?? shouldn't you know why he did that?? Slapping your own face now isn't it when you say you do not know and yet you believe in something you don't know? wat plan?? a plan to cause the fall and suffering of all human kind?? a conspiracy???

            <div class='col-md body'>ky023;<br>please don't twist my words. I didn't say GOD's actions were heartless or cruel, i only said it seemed so from our humans' point of view. I hope and pray one day that GOD will open your eyes to HIS love. How can i an insignificant sinful created being put myself in the creator's shoes and understand and knows HIS thoughts. 1 thing i can say is GOD as the righteous judge has the right to judge us whether we like it or not. If u say u want proof and logic and science, i suggest u probe deeper into stuff like quantum physics cos GOD cannot be defined by some theory or mathematics formula. I urge u to accept HIM before the 2nd coming, cos when we stand before the white throne of judgement, we'll have no defence lawyers or anyone to save us. Today's the day of salvation.May i ask what are u trying to prove here ?<br><br>[This message has been edited by King Arthur (edited 02 July 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Kyo23,<br>I am not the type to direct specific replies to pple, but this one is to you. Let me just say that having read all your posts. I think pple like u will eventually become Christian.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. And I hope and am looking forward to see that day in my lifespan.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Next, I'd (not to start another fight) but to correct your incest theory about Adam and Eve. Now if I am correct, you assume it had to have been incest (offspring of Adam and Eve sleeping with one another to reproduce), bcos u thought that Adam and Eve were the only pple on the planet?<br>Hmmm ... I'd like to bring up the issue of studying the Bible carefully here.<br>First let's look at this point. God warned Adam in Genesis Chapter 2, Verse 17 (New King James Version) regarding not eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. God said,"but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die."<br>Now we all know Adam didn't die that very day that he ate forbidden fruit. In fact, He lived hundreds of years before dying. So what can it mean? It means ... that God meant that Adam would die a spiritual death, one that meant separation from communion with God (as in Eden).<br>Now let me turn your kind attention to Genesis Chapter 4, verse 14, where Cain's evil deed of killing Abel has been found out by God and he is banished from his homeland. Cain says,"Surely You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; I shall be hidden from Your face; I shall be a fugitive and a vaabond on the earth, and it will happen that anyone who finds me will kill me."<br>Now here, Cain, if Adam's family was the only one on earth, who would find and kill him, when he was banished? Hmmm ...<br>What if the first man and woman, as in Adam and Eve, meant symbollically the first to have communion and relationship with God? And that only they were featured in Genesis 1, and 2. Although, God DID create others like them as well? You see, let's have an example, it may not be too good an analogy, but I hope you see my point. You and I are Singaporeans, but why are only the PM and President and S-league players in the news? Something like that ...<br>So if God didn't make others, why would Cain fear being caught and killed by others?<br>There would've been no one out there outside of his homeland! Right? So you see, sometimes, when you read the Bible you have to use some brains ... and that I hope can help you use more of your so-called acclaimed 'logic'  to read more of the Bible and investigate it with true science, and not pseudo-science and pseudo-logic.<br>God Bless.<br>And I still think, some day my friend, you will be Christian. See you at the end.<br>Your Friend,<br>Direction</div>

The Bible said, for example, that the sun<br>stopped<br>&gt; moving in the sky for a whole day while Joshua and his army fought,<br>which<br>&gt; implied that the sun moved around the Earth. If what Galileo said was<br>&gt; believed true, the church was afraid that might make the Bible look<br>&gt; "wrong." If the Bible were believed wrong in that matter, the church<br>&gt; feared, why would people believe other things the Bible said? So some<br>new<br>&gt; scientific discoveries of Galileo and other Italians were often<br>banned as<br>&gt; "heresy," or contrary to God, and they were instructed not to talk or<br>&gt; publish any opinion which contradicted the Bible. If they did, they<br>could<br>&gt; be imprisoned, tortured, or even burned at the stake.</div>

There's no need for you to work or lead a life like us since you all think that your current life is sinful, the world will end and the heaven is your ultimate aim. You can just go and serve the lord, pray all days and night, study just your bible and live in the church till the end of the world. When you are hungry, your lord will feed you, there's no need for money or food from earth. When you are sick, your lord will heal and save you, there's no need for you to go hospital,see doctor, eat medicine etc.<br><br>There's no need to work for any employer on earth, cause you work only for your lord aka god. the god will bless you etc etc. No one stopping you, guys. Carry on but just don't come and bother the rest of us. we would carry on with our normal life, strive for technological advancement and maybe somedays we might start living in space when the earth do come to an end due to pollution or a meteor collison etc and not because of the<br>2nd coming. And then we would hope that the god will protect you pple down there who is still stubbornly praying to him in the church everyday for him to bring you all to heaven.<br></div></blockquote>Whew... I thought you'll never end.  Using logic, can you tell me where in the Bible was there sexual discrimination?  You cannot tell me too if you don't read the entire Bible and interpret everything in "CONTEXT".<br><br>If you persist in being in your own way go ahead.  One day, it might dawn on you or maybe not.  Go seek and busy yourself in whatever you do.  Nothing wrong at all.<br><br>But don't go on a crazy assumption-based argument.  Your thinking is so simplistic at times it amazes me.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Perhaps, that's where all the cult groups got their ideas from, some assumptions and the will to interpret things into their own mindset.  Study hard and Good Luck.<br><br>Oh, if you believe in the concept of soul.  Where does the soul goes when the physical body is dead?  And who is the soul's parents?<br>I've said enough.  Thanks for the mental workout.  Gotta work for a living now.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>ps.

Isn't all these mentioned in your bible and not by me? Didn't i argued upon the flood and this <strong>VIRTUAL</strong> being LORD aka god as mentioned in YOUR storybook the BIBLE.

            <div class='col-md body'>Kyo 23:<br>The flood was sent for our good.<br>If you read genesis 6 carefully with the revelation of the Holy spirit , you will see the mercy of God there.<br>It was written that the sons of God had come to take wives of the daughter of men. The sons of God here refers to the 1/3 fallen angels that has followed Satan, they came down and lay with woman on the earth.<br>Then the woman of the earth gave birth to giants which are clearly in v 4.<br>These giants aren't normal human beings; they are gigantic monsters, deformed beings because the fallen angels have step over their domain.<br>It was because the whole earth was filled with these wicked giants that God had to send the flood( v 5). There were no pure human beings left except Noah and his family.<br>God send the flood to preserve the human race, not to wipe out.<br><br>The reason why Satan sends his angels to lay with woman is to stop Jesus from coming.At the garden of eden, God had said that the seed of the woman will cruch Satan's head.<br><br>After the flood, Satan did send his fallen angels to lay with woman again. That's the reason why God raise up Israel to kill these tribes of giants known as the philistines or Hittites and others in the Old Testament.Goliath was one such giant.<br><br>a lot of people have read the bible and misunderstood the purpose of the flood completely because they didn't read it with the revelations of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>Another thing is that Christ teaches sexual equality, not discrimination. This is in<br>Galatians 3:28 - There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.<br><br>Lastly, you have clearly misunderstood what the bible is talking about labour. Yes we christians work unto the Lord but that doesn't mean we don't work for employers. In fact the bible encourages us to be diligent in our labor. The bible says a person who don't work is worse than an infidel.<br><br>Oh, b4 I forget. God didn't say just pray and I feed you, dun need money in the world.<br>In fact, Jesus did mention about money more than anything else. He knew money is very close to people's hearts.<br><br></div>

Well I like your phrase "Without proper access to the actual findings/people there's no way a person can say for sure that it's true or false." So let's stop talking about truth in the bible when there isn't any proper proofs/findings. Cast that bible aside or treat it as a urban legend story book etc.<br><br><blockquote><strong>As for Galileo's story... OK, in the history of the Christian church.

It is better to believe in hard provened science.

You should be asking the follower for the truth instead. Wow....this is getting more and more exciting. Next time , we go to church, stop asking the high priest for truth but instead the followers cause they are the "real christian" not the stupid idiotic high priest who is not fit to be in his robe.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>In a Nutshell:<br>Things are not always as black and white as it seems, there are many shades of greys in between.

If right and wrongs were on a scale from 1 to 10, I prefer to stick at the side I feel more comfortable with and accept the perspective that benefits my belief system.<br><br>Correct already or not?</div></blockquote>One is quite accurate but there's no reason to dwell on it because... you never know who will be correct in the end.<br><br>Two is ok but if I were to ask you if Roman Catholic and Protestants are considered the one and same.  If you know enough about it?  You will know the right answer.  During the middle ages in the U.K. it was the Church of England that was ruling, many protestants were persecuted because of disagreements in teachings.  I've not researched into Galileo that much, but that's a definite possibility.<br><br>At first, I'd like to disagree with your last point but it's true not only for me but for everyone also.  That's what a mind is for to discern the truth and decide your beliefs, isn't it?  Not benefits your belief system but to check and improve if your belief system is right or not?  I get back to Kyo23 later, not happy with some of his conclusions. Heehee....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read many christians rebuttal of the evolution theory. Most gave the feeling that they started with a conclusion (e.g evolution is untrue, god created all lives) and then seek to prove that belief.<br><br>This differ from evolutionist who comes to a conclusion only after they evaulate their findings.<br><br>The latter should provide a less bias opinion.</div>

The final decision of an individual is his/her to make.<br><br>I just hope these pple will wake up cause in the event when the end of earth is coming maybe due to a meteor collison, at least we have pple to help think out a solution and save the earth using our existing technology or any innovatioin instead having bunch of pple impractically praying and praying to god in church when the meteor is closing and crashing into earth to kill all lifeform and they are still thinking selfishly that they are on the way to heaven soon.<br><br>Our planet earth could have survived that crash if we simply diverted the path of the meteor. In this sense, wouldn't it be better that we have more science and technology in our hand instead of a whole planet earth full of christianity dreamer who are expert in bibilogy and who know how to pray and attained virtual "immortality" themselve? Wouldn't we need more pple like Galileo instead of putting these pple into imprisonment due to our stupid religious belief??<br><br>When it come to a point that the end of the earth cannot be avoided, at least we human race can continue to live in space with our science and technology instead of dreaming and waiting for death on earth, praying to the god.</div></blockquote>Hmmm... 2 points of discontention.<br><br>One - On Christian leaders.  The way you put it... is ALL Christian leaders are bad and the followers know everything.  What I meant was there are a few who are not so good.  Just like there are always good and bad people in the world so are there good and bad leaders... also good and bad followers.  My point was "without a proper examination of the actual situation then, one cannot know what happened then".  Even the Japanese History Textbooks on the subject of the Japanese Occupation, so who is right?  I guess you know the answer, don't you?<br><br>Two - What makes you so sure that science can do all that?  I know you don't believe in souls and how did science explains people who have near death experiences?  Is it all a hoax too or do you believe that science can actually explain the phenomenon of near death?<br><br>Christianity is a personal way of life, so is Buddhism, Taoism and so on.  Why do you continue to pick on Christianity?  And not say Muslim, or Buddhism or perhaps some occult groups?  Or especially those that emphasise on meditation... what good is meditation to science or blowing up an incoming meteor?  You may not know, until you try some meditation yourself.<br><br>I agree that you believe in Science and Technology but leave others to their religion or philosophy of life....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>And if some Christians approaches you in future... you can just laugh at them and ask them for scientific proof of an actual flood, or perhaps the missing day.  If not, just laugh it off and tell them there's no such things and walk off...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think all this interest in this, is in a way good, and i hope that as you all ponder more and more, one day, you will be able to see that God is real, and that He does love you. So much that He gave His only Son, Jesus Christ, to die for your sins, to be punished instead on your behalf, so that you who believeth in the Lord, might not perish, but obtain eternal life with God in heaven.<br>Amen.<br>God Bless.

NASA putting a link saying its not real does not mean that there wasn't such a thing done previously.  Many things in the world are hidden in secret.<br><br>77, have you seen your brain before?  How do you know its there if you have not seen it?<br>So logically speaking if NASA comes up with a link (or if your friends and parents say) that you don't have a brain, will you still believe NASA/them???  I'm not saying you're lying but they said you have no brains.
