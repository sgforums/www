            <div class='col-md body'>It makes me sad to see so many people lining up to take a bash at Christianity, above all other religions. Many a time, these people are people who have never really read a Bible, sat attentively through a church service, through a Bible study, and base their conclusions upon hearsay or from the mouths of people who are mistaken themselves about the truth of Christianity. We never get a fair hearing.<br>These people are just like people who have based their judgements that love is a brainwashing event, that love 'unfairly' tries to raise itself as the highest emotion, baesd on hearsay from the mouths of people who don;t know what love is themselves, and who have never really fallen in love themselves. and they would say that love is a fallacy, that it ain;t real, that its just a perfectly created ideology.<br>that's the way they are talking abt Christianity here. and it wouldn;t be a fair court hearing in today's context even.<br>(hmm.. ever wondered why court trials are known as 'hearings'? it's to give the case at hand , a hearing, the judghe is not interested in talking and talking, but abt listening to the case.) and these people are only interested in talking and talking and they never really sit down and listen without interrrupting.<br>and then there are those here who ask for proof, for this and that. question, how do we see material proof for love? but we know it exists right? how do we see that love exists? by marriages? what abt the skyrocketing divorce rates then? love cannot exist, right? no! it does, the father who gave his life to save his drowning child, only to drown himself. the spouse who went through the risky transplant op to save his dying wife. love exists. we dont need proof. we know it does. its part and parcel of God's gift of life!<br>and God exists! just look at the world around you. it may be messed up now cos of the fiddling that we;ve done to it, but its intiial design was perfect! look at the hydroglogical cycle, that renews and is meant to run forever! there has to be a Designer! the dozens of muscles that click and work together to help u dribble a ball in soccer, did that happen by accident? no, a Designer did that! and that Designer, is the Almighty God ... whom Jesus the Son of God talks of.<br>all that i ask, is of these people, to take some time out, to sit down with soem Christian friends, not to quarrel, but to peacefully listen to them tell you why they are Christian.<br>God's love, power and faithfulness are not dependent on the performance of His children.<br>Sure there are good and bad Christians.<br>that is the same with any family (with good and bad children), but that doesn't make the Father any less loving, and any less real.<br>I used to hate Christians as well. But one day, I met Him. and experienced Him for myself. And i found that all i thought and heard from hearsay, even those which were erroneously 'preached' to me, were all unfounded. take some time out to listen to some Christians tell you why they are Christians. and i pray that you will find Him too, in your lifetime.<br>God Bless.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is not true that people hate christians. Apart from christianity, there are 101 religions out there which advocates harmony and believe in gods.<br>So why do people like to put down christianity? Is it because of the way christians condemn other religions? Or is it because a lot of christians are snobbish people?<br>In my opinion, most people are just using the way christians used to put down other religions as a retaliation.<br>Let them taste their own medicine, so as to say.</div>

That's reality and life. I suppose u have a point: that there are "good" and "bad" christians. However, i believe the reason why ppl flame christians is due to the unparalleled arrogance of a minority.<br><br>I myself have been "ambushed" in Ang Mo Kio Central by preachers who wish to acost me into christianity. I have no qualms abt humble believers, but when u start to tell me that i should believe in god, that i have "fallen from grace", a sinner who can be returned to the fold....please...<br><br>Why should i believe in an omnipotent being who guides my thoughts and actions? Just becoz u have faith does not give u a license to condemn those who dun believe...when i made that clear, the preacher actually told me my heart is "impure" and then i should cleanse myself....balls...all he did was incite me and make me all the more eager to ridicule him, which i did and ended up making him angry (good thing i did too)<br><br>Hence, my point is very simple: U have ur faith, i have mine. Dun tell me wat i SHOULD do or who i MUST believe in...there is no MUST. Each religion is unique. I read the bible and treat it as a story book. I bow my head as a sign of respect whenever i enter a holy place (be it a church or a mosque). That does not make me a believer.<br><br>In short, that's the only reason why i dislike christians..besides that, they are fine.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I totally agree with Billabong and gang .<br>I can tell you in the face that I am not a christian.<br>I believe that is only but one supreme being that has governed our world and he comes in various different forms and in different religions.<br>Just Sit down and think for yourself, in all the main religions in the world example, Islam, Buddhism , Christianity , they teach people to be kind and compassionate and behind all these religions there is always one Almighty Supreme Being Which is in the centre of the respective religions itself.<br>Come to think of it ,it is like a conspiracy . And Some one is behind all this Who might that be? Hmm.... the only rational answer is ,yes, some one above us, God.<br>I do not believe that religion is a cover for Man's weaknesses or insecurities either.<br><br>I read this book written by a catholic pastor and his views are not biased to his religion or to himself.<br>This book is actually a case study of various sightings of the Virgin Mother Mary, in this book there was this certain case study that was very interesting .<br>It happened to this Spanish Boy who went into the forest and actually witness a very bright ball of light . His first thoughts were that it was the virgin mary herself, as he came from a Roman Catholic Community .<br>He asked the ball of light, "Who are you? Are you the Virgin Mary? Are you Buddha or are you Jesus Christ?"<br>The Appirition just answered him,"If you think I am the Virgin Mary , I am the virgin Mary. If you think I am Buddha, I am Buddha.If you think I am Jesus Christ , I am Jesus christ."<br><br>These events are true and I think that religion itself is up to you to choose and not to force down into your throat.<br>Imagine if there is only one religion.Wouldn't the world be a dull place?<br><br>------------------<br>ChIcKeN FeEt Soup <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks ChickenFeet for speaking up  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Me &amp; billabong's point abt being pressed against our will too much is a valid point - and i think Direction (where's the guy?? come back leh!! 1 post then chao already???) should really take a note of that.<br><br>Of course, there are stories like what, after getting pestered so many times, you start to think - and wonder - and etc. etc... but i think those are super-rare.. if it were me, it would only make me angrier...<br><br>think about it - would you like it if one fine day you were walking down Orchard road, and there's this bunch of crazy buddhist guys coming to pester you about converting, even though you're not interested at all? What if this thing happens repeatedly?<br><br>Not that the buddhists do that, of course... guess it's because they're not that convicted maybe??? Anyway, even if you dont make it in this life, you still have the next - so tough luck... just carry on living, and dying, and then reincarnating again - try again... better luck next time<br><br>Christians though, have a different agenda. It's either this life or that's it. Which does help to explain why you see and hear so many cases of getting ambushed by Christians - instead of pp from other religions.. that's just the way it is. (I'm speaking in fairness here...)<br><br>But the way things are done, I think they must be done with tact...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh and btw, regarding ChickenFeet's (can i just call you "CF" for short?) story about the floating ball? i would think that whatever that thing was, it definitely did say something wrong (my opinion).<br><br>maybe it may be possible to bring other religions together (I dont know every single religion of course, so i cant be sure), but definitely not Christianity. You see, its claims are too radical liao - you either accept it, or you deny it outright. There's just no in between...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All i can contribute on top of what most pple like BillyBong had said is that if you want to convince other pple about your religion, convince with fact and proof. Yes you can say some of the thing like love cannot be proven, but at least you don have to get to the point that when pple ask you this and that about your own religion you start to have doubt or speechless, in the end you use "cannot be proven" as an excuses. This happen to me.<br><br>Typically, i was riding on the bus and just like the rest got pestered by a preacher asking me to join their church for a function during weekend. Well, as usual i warned him about my stand for religion. you need to be convincing enuff. He took the challenge and started with all the lengthy stuff from the bible. When i ask him question back about some logic and proof. He start to be speechless and don seem to know his stuff well. Well, by that time i had reached my stop and i simply say bye n dropped off. All i can say is, wat a lousy salesman.<br><br>Then another occasion, i went to a church to fetch my cousin cos she's helping out as panoist in the church at jurong east. So i parked my car and seated myself on a bench just beside the main door. Then a man dressed in white came up to me and started his preaching. We talk so much about stuff in the bible and he still failed to convince me with any proof for his stand and yet i can retort him back with example of fact against his stand. He simply brushes most of the topic off with the word " some thing cannot be proven " and he seem very angry with me. Woah, he was on fire i guess. In the end before i bid him farewell, then i know he's the head of the church from my cousin.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 21 June 2001).]</div>

And Some one is behind all this Who might that be? Hmm.... the only rational answer is ,yes, some one above us, God.<br>I do not believe that religion is a cover for Man's weaknesses or insecurities either.<br><br>I read this book written by a catholic pastor and his views are not biased to his religion or to himself.<br>This book is actually a case study of various sightings of the Virgin Mother Mary, in this book there was this certain case study that was very interesting .<br>It happened to this Spanish Boy who went into the forest and actually witness a very bright ball of light . His first thoughts were that it was the virgin mary herself, as he came from a Roman Catholic Community .<br>He asked the ball of light, "Who are you? Are you the Virgin Mary? Are you Buddha or are you Jesus Christ?"<br>The Appirition just answered him,"If you think I am the Virgin Mary , I am the virgin Mary. If you think I am Buddha, I am Buddha.If you think I am Jesus Christ , I am Jesus christ."<br><br>These events are true and I think that religion itself is up to you to choose and not to force down into your throat.<br>Imagine if there is only one religion.Wouldn't the world be a dull place?<br><br></div></blockquote>Chicken feet, the story doesn't sound very credible. Maybe that spanish boy was having some confusing hallucinations.<br><br>hmm..we all know Virgin Mary give birth to Jesus.<br>If the person the spanish boy saw claimed to be both virgin mary and Jesus, then wat is he/she?<br><br>Maybe you can at least sort out his sexual identity first or is it a "it"?<br><br>It sounds more incredible if he can be the monk buddha and yet be virgin mary.<br><br>Virgin mother buddha?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am glad to see that my fellow Christians have not been selling the faith of Christianity out, from your disgruntled comments. Make no mistake about it, maybe in the world's eyes we are bad salesman as one of you said. But God is not meant to be packaged like a singer to gain public recognition. Any 'god' who does that is not god, that'll be a politician then. Or a singer/artiste. And we aren't interested in your membership in our faith to make it grow in numbers and becoming the most 'powerful' faith or something like that. But we are interested in helping to save souls. And no I will not lie by telling people that Christians believe that the human soul is pure. It isn't. No one's is. I will only say that yours and mine, and any tommy, dick or harry has an impure soul. For we believe that all have fallen short of the glory of God, and need the saving grace of Jesus. I do not however stand by the post abt an unnamed 'apparition' calling itself whatever you want it to be. It is obvious that the spirit is of no good intention and obviously un-divine. A 'god' who allows himself to be bent to human preferance, (in this case, be envisioned as whatever the person wants him to be) is not a god, and obviously doing this to crave for attention. Catholic priest wrote that bk? We'll hv to see abt the authenticity of the publisher's claim then. And for you, my unbelieving frends, I pray for you. That you will in your own time, hopefully soon, find the Lord in your life. Trust in this, He will not bend to suit your demands, for He is Almighty God. But to the ones who honestly seek him, and not to fulfil personal conditions abt what God shud be like, Almighty God will reveal Himself unto you. God Bless.</div>
