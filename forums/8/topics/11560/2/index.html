Cos at least it showed that they believed in it seriously enough, to even ~give~ their lives for it.<br><br>And it wasnt' just one small bunch of people isolated somewhere from the main world, and other sources of information, where they had no other indoctrination/sources of info than their "almighty" leader...

It's wrong to force people into thing and thoughts. Freedom of choice is important.

Well guess we can't - in some sense. Guess only God can, since He created life, and He will be the one, whoever He is.<br></strong></blockquote>Well, guess we can't in some sense. Guess wat? (no offence meant) you assuming there's this god who can. Is there any proof that he created life yet? i need scientific explanation. When we can't explain how life come about, we don't simply assume someone with a nick God create it. That's my thinking and i'm not forcing anyone to accept that.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>But if you were to argue that all life is the same, then according to your argument you should go kill yourself !!

But that's a natural process, you din consiously go and kill them and furthermore they are doing harm to you just like any other pest like mosquitoes etc. Natural process and life cycle is unavoidable. However, for god as imply in the bible, he simply want everyone who is just ignorant or non-christian to be dead killing them without mercy. Can you live under such a tyrant?? If the god is real and as almighty as everyone thought, he could simply make satan vanish.Or maybe he could simply make all the sinned human disappear or not create them in the first place instead of mass killing to clear the mess. why do so much extra jobs?</div>

Maybe you can give some examples and we can discuss about it.<br><br>I think the heart of God is very much misunderstood by a lot of people. The gospel is meant to give people hope and a chance to live a new life. A lot of people have misunderstood that the gospel is there to condenm us all as sinners. True enuff, we are all sinners but condenmation is not the gist of the gospel.(romans 8:1)<br><br>it is clearly written in the bible that the Jesus came to reconcile man to God. And that means no matter how much failures or mistakes you have made in ur life, God stil accepts and loves you becoz of what Jesus has done on the cross of calvary. And the weakness of man is that all of us do fail more than we succeed. The very mistakes and failures that you have all made is all imputed on the very God that you are scolding now. You might be critisizing and scolding Him now but you can't change the fact that He gave His life so that you can have a chance to live and know why you ever existed on planet earth.<br>You are the very reason why Jesus died on the cross, for your mistakes and disappointment in life.<br><br>Now that He has died and resurrected for u, the choice is very simple. You can choose Life or death. the choice is yours.<br><br>Don't accuse God of causing you to die, you chose the path yourself.<br><br>The real battle of life is when you are all alone in your room and you ponder in your mind. Do you really know why you exist, why you live or watever is life? What purpose are you living for?<br><br>If you have clear answers to these questions, you will have a glimpse of what Life is all about.<br><br></div>

You want to convince, please convince with fact, logic and proof not just a storybook. And one more fact, noone is stopping you from believing in something you believe, just don't force it on others.

            <div class='col-md body'>While i was once having breathing problem and admitted into the hospital and i needed help. The doctor and nurse with good morality and supreme intelect came to my help and i'm well &amp; healthy as ever.<br>Next time if you ever end up in hospital, please tell those doctors and nurses to shun aside cos you waiting for the god to help you. What do you think of that?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Note : When a person who somewat believe in god is on the dying edge, he will try to catch on any hope for survival. Tentatively, he will think of god since it supposed to be the almightest. he will develop the courage and will to hold on and survive. That's one thing good about idolizing someone. It's the same theory for a freethinker who is on the dying edge, he might think of his wife who crying for him, he too will develop the will and courage to hold on and survive. It take both the patient's will and the doctor's help to save a life.<br><br>And thanks for the respect, and I respect you for your noble choice n hope you have no regret just like i do. It's individual's choice and path how you want thing to be. One advice, stop wasting time and be useful esp during your weekend.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 22 June 2001).]</div>

There's nothing to justify. furthermore, i think it's useless to explain too much cos christian pple will stick to their bible no matter wat. It's really up to them whether they want to use their logic and reasoning or just blindly follow wat ever is written in the bible. we can't force them cos if we do, we will be making the same mistake as what they are doing preaching others to believe in them. there are freedom of choice and no need to use words like "you all going to hell if you don believe in christ, god bless n god bless x 100 " just like what pple like direction is doing<br><br>I'm not a saint myself but I think there are other more important thing in life than to believe in something that you yourself can't explain to others clearly. Being a morally good person on earth naturally without others knowing doing all the good deed compared to be trying to be morally good on the surface and letting everyone know, letting the virtual spiritual being up there know in the hope of reward of going to heaven or for fear of going to hell after life. which one do you prefer??<br><br>Everyone will die eventually, it's whether you had made full use of it in your current life. why bother whether you go to heaven or hell after life? what happen after life no one knows. why be so stressed?? You can go to church pray days and night and feel happy for yourself, or be a hyprocrite in church session thinking that you are saved and will go to heaven when in actual life you lead a not so moral life. Noone say you are wrong, it's up to individual how he/she want to lead it. With all these extra time, i would rather spent it with my love one and friends, spent time with my grandma or grandpa when they are still around, teaching my next generation well, cultivate oneself morally, helping others, doing good deed, contribute to the society etc. And when you die, you will have no regret. becos you really put those times into meaningful things and not because you believe you are going to heaven and not to hell since you believe strongly in god having gone to church pray all days and night, having got baptised or converted your friends to christian etc.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 23 June 2001).]</div>

Finally, the Pharaoh allowed the Jews to depart.<br>Exodus 12:29 "And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.
