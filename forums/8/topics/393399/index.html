              <p>How does a person become a bankrupt?</p>
              <p>When he cannot pay the debts, the banks sue him and the judge will order to check all his bank accounts and assets and freeze them so that he cannot transfer the money out and if the remaining outstanding amount is more than 10k than he becomes a bankrupt?</p>
              <p>After he become a bankrupt, if he is working he have to make a monthly deduction from his bank account to pay for the debt?</p>
              <p>What happens if he is not working? Will the judge check regularly if you are working so that he can order to start deducting a monthly payment from your salary to settle the debt or how?</p>

              <p>But i know that the last one not applicable. Court cannot force
              him to sell the flat.</p>
              <p>But he is staying with his parents right, his parents must be
              careful to prove all the things inside their hse belongs to them
              using documentations [ e.g car u can prove who's the owner ] if
              cannot prove, i think will be taken by court.</p>

              <p>Yup. I think like for example you borrow a large sum of money from the bank and before they can sue you for not repaying it, you transfer all the money to your spouse or parents.</p>
              <p>Any valuable assets like labtop etc don't keep it in your house. Keep it with your friends or relatives house 1st and after the court official is gone, he can bring back the things to his house..</p>
              <p>If he is working than inform the HR department to pay the salary into his spouse or parent bank account and than tell the judge that he is not working so cannot make the monthly instalment payment. Not sure if the court will check his cpf account anot because if got money enter into his cpf every month than the court will know that he is working already..</p>
              <p>Is this a good idea?</p>

              <p>I think you transfer to spouse / parents ,the money will still be taken.</p>
              <p>That's why u see most cases is that the parents divorce, so at least the bankrupt party holds all responsbility. it's better this way.</p>
              <p>Yeah maybe the assets u can keep in other ppl place is better.</p>
              <p>As for the income part I think you better don't do that. if get caught it's very serious. it's like almost avoiding income tax.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for CPF, govt will not take.</p>

              <p>I don't think if money transfer to parents can be taken back. because you can say that you give the money to parents is because you want to pay them for taking care of you, you had previously taken a loan from them and now you repay back the loan etc..</p>
              <p>If cpf govt don't take than maybe can use your money to top up your cpf account, next time you can even use the cpf money to buy a flat so very worth it..</p>
