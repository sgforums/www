              <p>This is of course not right lah.</p>
              <p>If that auntie wants to use the table, she should have at least asked nicely.</p>
              <p>And besides, it is after all a restaurant.... she should have waited for the serving staff to seat her.</p>

              <p>Personally I'm ok with sharing tables so long as they ask politely, just like many of you here.</p>
              <p>But what about the point of chatting with your meal partner(s) and having a loss of privacy when eating coz share table with a stranger? Honestly, if there is a need for a stranger to share table with you, chances are the foodcourt/hawker centre is already very crowded. Chatting should be left till after meal when can walk to a more convenient, less crowded place. Chatting at the table without finishing your food asap is also quite inconsiderate during rush hours.</p>

              <p><br>Actually the polite thing for you all to do would be to settle the bill and find somewhere less crowded to continue your conversation/ catching up. After all, it is just as impolite on your end to make others wait just to satisfy your own desires that can be satisfied at another, less crowded area. I have queued up before outside restaurants where some patrons, even after finishing their food long ago, continue to sit there and tcss for ages. It really gets frustrating.</p>
              <p>What I might do is to ask the staff to talk to certain tables, perhaps even pin-pointing them to tables with patrons who are blatantly hogging their seats if possible. I will remind them repeatedly if nothing much is done on their part to ensure table hoggers are not "taken care of".</p>

              <p>agreed. actually we hadn't even noticed the queue cos there was a screen blocking the entrance. We just hadn't noticed it cos we were too busy chatting. In fact, if the service staff had pointed it out politely, I think I would feel quite bad about it.</p>

              <p>I think it depends on the type of restaurant or eating place.</p>
              <p>For example, if it is a coffee house and planning to meet and chat with friends over coffee. Then it gets crowded - and people wander in standing around waiting for seats.

              <p>I agree nobody is obliged to move off when dining at a restaurant but its more of a courtesy issue. Of course, if dining at a posh place like in a good hotel or something then I feel it is fine to take your time as after all, chances are patrons there are not just there for the food but the ambience as well. Moreover, one has to probably pay a King's ransom to dine at those places.</p>
              <p>But in places like Mahattan or Dian Xiao Er etc where there always queues outside, does anyone really need to hog the table? I mean, what ambience is there in those places? Whats more, when fully crowded these places are really noisy and it would be difficult to sit back and chat as well.</p>

              <p>I agree with you that the lady is at fault if it was a restaurant. But I guess that you did not read my original post clearly. I wouldn't personally walk to any particular table and tell them to move off in a restaurant like the lady. It would be quite class-less on my part as well. But I stated I might let the staff know that I feel some patrons are hogging the tables, in a polite manner of course. </p>
              <p>Ultimately, it is up to them whether the staff want to politely ask the current patrons whether if they are willing to move off or not. And if the patrons refuse, then there's nothing I can do about it. But I would appreciate it if the staff explain it to me politely that after all, it is the right of the customers to sit there as long as they want.</p>

              husband, then some strangers came up to ask, can I sit with you
