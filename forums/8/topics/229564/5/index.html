Plus, even if the Court decides not to add the 60 charges of Computer Misuse, he would still have to go to jail because of the bomb hoax.<br><br>Either way, the bomb hoax charge will stay.</div>

Its written in the books but whether the person wants to pursue the matter at hand its really up to him. The fact is every little thing happening every day causing a person to be annoyed at another might be liable for a case if either party choose to send the other party to court. If the person has the money and time and wants to he can consult his lawyer and go about with the fliling. I mean yes you can complain but what if others steal the bandwidth again? About password securing i agree its the least thing you must do.<br><br>What actually happened when the guy did the bomb hoax i do not know. Maybe he was not that savvy enough but i think covering his tracks only serve to delay the investigation outcome. It will only be a slight delay before the Police uncover the mask and complete the trace. For a big 'public enemy' case like bomb hoaxes, they are answerable not only to the public but also their superiors.</div>

Technically, it's the same.<br><br>But the length of the password increases the time needed to crack it. It's based on a live environment, where is the test done, I'm not telling.<br><br>Of course it's weak to say that I've hacked down a WEP key. Script kiddies can do it, professional hackers can do it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
