This has much to do with the culture here as it has to do with a legal system that pays heed to the lettering and not to the spirit of the law. In fact, the first case was dealt pretty fine IMHO, and the judge was prudent to give him just a slap on the wrist, whereas the prosecution was screaming bloody murder et al.<br><br>What is needed is a differentiation to be made, but I believe the legal codes here are not attuned to the changing times of the Internet Age. </div></blockquote>The legalities with respect to this issue is clear through legislation we have brought in and I agree with it. As others have mentioned, it is difficult to catch the perpetrators. So when we do catch one, he should be prosecuted according to the law as a warning to others.<br><br>Sha yi jing bai</div>

When this person was caught posting a bomb hoax, the police traced the IP address to another owner. As per usual, the house was raided and all IT-related stuffs are confiscated. When the police hacked down the whole computer for evidence, they could find none, and figured out that somebody might be using her wireless network.<br><br>I think read about this somewhere, as she kept protesting her innocence. Netizens were discussing about it also, and some chided her for not securing her wireless network.<br><br>After some investigations, it was finally traced to this bomb hoax poster.<br><br>That's how he became our second offender. For your info, he has 60 other charges under his name, 9 of which could see him sitting in jail for a maximum of 27 years because of Section 6 of the Computer Misuse Act.</div></blockquote>For the first case if the stolen bandwidth was causing lag my guess is most probably anyone will get mad at it.<br><br>As for the second case its clear that the offender has a certain degree of IT and networking intelligence. Its just that the Government and the Police have their finest people and hardware so unless you are working for the 'CIA' the chances of evading the consequences of a bomb hoax is less than 1 percent.<br><br>He may be intelligent but just do not have the common sense to assess a situation. People like him may be an amateur but given the guidance and opportunities he might be a professional working for the better Good instead of walking on the dark side.</div>
