            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys, have you heard of any ghost stories (real) abt ur school or other places and you like to share with others, well, let me tell you about one,<br><br>In my school, not saying which, there is a toilet which is locked and pupils are forbidden to enter. It was said to be haunted by my seniors and according to what they say, there is one incident after their basketball training, they were given the key to the toilet to bath, so they did enter. When they were bathing, they all heard a loud bang, they all thought that someone was playing a plank so they ignored and continue doing what they were doing. After they bath, they saw a bench (those wooden bench we had for the canteen last time), coated with red paint(I don't know abt this). Strange though, who threw this bench in?? Did it fall from the 2nd storey?? Why was it on four legs?? They then reported to the teacher and was asked to carry the bench to the hall.<br><br>The next day, the teachers went to the hall and noticed that the spot the bench was  standing had red paint, four red paint marking. Teachers tried wiping it, spraying paint on it or by all means, the stain was still there, shocked huh. Everyone was shocked and confused. To what my seniors had said, there was an old man, he entered the toilet and never came out, people went in and look for him but there was no sign of him.<br><br>Believe or don't is up to you, the toilet is really locked and whenever I ask the teacher, he refused to say anything. Anyway, about my school, there's still alot of them, if you want, i can tell you bit by bit next time. Remember to post your stories too..<br><br>------------------<br>Cherish wat you have now and go for wat you want, don't regret if the chance slip away from your hand, wat ever you do, just do it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I posted this story in some other forums but no reply, it's not well written lor, can't seem to express it properly in text, but in words, I usually freak people out. Still could remember my girlfriend sqealing when I told her the story in sinister, grisly detail... hahaha... Anyway, here it is for those who have not read it:<br><br>---<br><br>People from my school will know what I'm talking about, and where I come from. As usual, such stories usually comes in different variations. This is just one of them...<br>It is said, that during the nights, if one should dare venture into the sinister corridors of the technical block, especially the second floor, you might win for yourself some uninvited audible treats... In the dead of the night, the unearthly churning of machines in the technical lab is said to be audible to some. The gates of the labs are firmly shut and locked at the end of the day... And if that wasn't enough to send your skin creeping across the cold cement floor, look again -- literally.<br><br>It seemed that whoever dares take a peek through the shuttered windows would be greeted by a sight that would haunt them for life. The bench drilling machines are stationed just behind the window shutters. A severed head, lying on the bench top, would be clearly visible from your view. The drill is in action, halfway in the process of drilling into the it's skull. Bits of blood and brain matter spew around the place, as the head stares at you with a look of excruciating pain and agony... as if it is desperately asking for help... unheard screams voiced out from it's twisted mouth, and soulless eyes dims it's last glimmer...<br><br>----<br><br>It is rumoured that in technical class quite some time ago, long before I was enrolled in the school. A girl had her hair caught up in the fast spinning drill bit. Part of her scalp was torn off in her frantic attempt to save her skin, but what happened next was relatively unknown. The teacher who supposedly knew the story, ended it abruptly with a "Just be careful, tie up long hair, tuck in your shirts."<br><br>The technical block is one of the out-of-bound areas during school camps --- but mainly during the night. None of us newer students know the actual reason for this. But now we have a pretty good guess.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I love ghostly stories.<br><br>My secondary school was rumoured that their clocked tower is haunted. I think few schools in SG have a clock tower.<br><br>Rumour has it that a girl who failed terribly for her test commited suicide by jumping down from the clock tower as it is pretty high.<br><br>I had a camp in my secondary school and well, at night the whole school looks eerie as hell. Nothing much happened to me though except I got eerie feeling while walking around my school at night during the camp. Boys as you know, trying to be adventurious and ended up running back to our room.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, just read ur stories, damm it was scary!! I have a few more stories about my school and it's up to you to believe it.<br><br>Every secondary school has a Home Econ room rite, well, there are stories about the home econ room in my school. It was said to be haunted. Some of my friends in NCC, were doing a night walk round the school during their school camp. When they walk past the room, damm it was eerie, they heard the sound of sewing machines and babies crying ( I kinda of don't believe this ).<br><br>Stories tell that there was a pupil who hung herself in the home econ room. After the body was removed, teachers removed the rope and found burnt marks on the wall. They tried removing the stain by all means but the stain was still there until now.....<br><br>Believe it?? Well, I have nothing to say but it is eerie, isn't it?<br><br>------------------<br>Cherish wat you have now and go for wat you want, don't regret if the chance slip away from your hand, wat ever you do, just do it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My college has some ghost stories that might not really send the shivers down the spine of most, but they are ghost stories nonetheless.<br><br>There's a dance room in my college, for the Dance Team (duh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ). Anyway, the dance team would usually organize overnite camping at the college as part of their orientation programme. One year, the campers slept outside the room. In the middle of the nite, some of the awoke to hear music being played within the room. And they could also hear footsteps from within the room. Ok, so you might think that some seniors could be in the room and putting all this up to play a trick on the juniors. But those who were awoke were the seniors themselves. And they were sleeping outside the room because one of them forgot to bring the keys to the room.<br>When the room was opened the next morning, the dancing shoes were all in place, except for one pair, which was placed neatly in the centre of the room.<br><br>There are also stories about the lecture theatres, but I'll tell you that on another occassion.</div>
