            <div class='col-md body'>I just think that its pretty scary how the microwave radiation can boil a bowl of water in 2 minutes. Whatever radiation is in there it must be pretty strong. Well then maybe I should start eating microwaved food for every meal since it will not harm me.<br><br>I believe there exist the freedom to fartulate, although its unwelcomed in confined space like lifts, crowded mrt etc, hey wad do you know, I can't smoke in these places as well.

Hypocrisy?<br><br>Newsflash!!!<br>The toxin from car's exhaust will cause more harm to your lungs than smoking.<br>The food that you eat cause corollary blockade than tobacco.<br><br>While I understand that there are many nice people who are under the impression from properganda or otherwise believeing that everyone would become healthier if there are no smokers, I sincerely thank you for your concerns. Contrary to popular belief amongst non-smokers, there are actually intelligent life amongst the smokers, and they actually (GASP!) have a perfectly logical chain of thoughts as to why they are still puffing. Please respect these people's decision.<br><br>So all I am asking from every non-smokers, is that everytime someone lights up, they haven't commit a crime, please don't them feel as if they had. Thank you.</div></blockquote>true true.. but who's the one paying for the smokes? not me. and it isn't a crime to smoke, but u're hurting other ppl too. ppl around u.</div>
