            <div class='col-md body'>I think the problem with some faculty is the average hit rate to secure a job is not as high as other faculties. Of cuz one can list down frens they know securing good job but when we talk about faculties, we talk about the whole batch of certain year graduates from that faculty and their hit rate in securing a job.<br><br>Fireice mention those are the lucky ones but those positions are few in the organisation. Can we have 100 newcasters in mediacorp? On the contrary, boring jobs like engineers are always in demand and they can take in &gt;100 engineers in different departments of a company.<br><br>So if look at the big picture, it is indeed certain faculties enjoy better hit rate of being employed. For those less hot faculty you need to be outstanding or among top 5% to secure a desired job. For engineering, if you can and want to do those hands-on task of which our indian or china ppl are doing, you can easily secure a job.<br><br>My 1 cent worth of opinion  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

An Arts degree is a general degree. It doesn't teach u how to do anything specific. It teaches u how to think.<br><br>Let me be clear: I was from Arts. B.A (History) with Honours (second-upper division).<br><br>After graduation, i jumped around for awhile. I was a multimedia content developer for awhile, found it crappy, moved on to a bank, liked it there, then finally moved on when a gov't dept made me a decent offer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>The job-hunt was a humbling experience. Cos along the way, u'll always feel that people really don't know what u're capable of... the pay is crap, the treatment is crap, etc etc...<br><br>The recognition is not there for Arts grads... part of the problem is that the faculty doesn't do enough to promote their undergrads.<br><br>Arts grads have all the right skills to succeed... they can think independently, in depth, in detail, from different angles, back it up with good research, know how to analyse it and how to use it... given half a chance that is...<br><br>Now, i would never say that Arts grads are useless cos i'll be saying that I was useless <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> but in all fairness, marketplace relevance is not directly there and the recognition is certainly NOT there. u would have a much steeper climb to get to the same place as probably, a biz-ad or economics major in the private sector.<br><br>Now... <strong>Why Teacher</strong>? Lets answer this in a calculated and brutal fashion: Arts grads have happily worked themselves into this stereotype because they are too lazy to go bashing around to prove their worth.<br><br>Teaching offers the most efficient exhange of time for money for someone with their qualifications.<br><br>E.g. You COULD work in a bank as an entry-level officer and draw less than 30k a year ... you COULD potentially work yourself up to the level of Manager or AVP eventually and make 60k (5 year plan? ) or more a year. With those experience, you COULD eventually make 100K (10 year plan? ) or more a year.<br><br>BUT as a teacher with honours, u immediately fulfill the 30k a year dream. u can get credit card and call yourself a moderate success.<br><br>AND its EASY to get in. MOE needs pple... turnover's high. If u ask me, is it a good idea to enter a job with better than average pay but apparently, very high turnover and no market place relevance?<br><br>My finely tuned Arts grad analytical skills suggests no... that's why i'm not a teacher  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  am i a big success? no... not yet anyway. but that's not up to my degree. that's up to me.<br><br>All the best in your pursuit to be a successful journalist.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Let me be clear: I was from Arts. B.A (History) with Honours (second-upper division)</strong><br><br>You had good grades. I was assuming say you just graduate from Arts with no honours and merit and compared to an engineer with no honours and merit too. The chance of an engineer securing a job (even if low paying) is still faster than an Arts going by my proposition.<br><br>In Arts or other less hot faculties, you need to have good grades or at least top 5-10% to stand a chance to secure a desired job. Refer to my earlier posting as I like to compare WHOLE batch of graduates hit rate in securing a job. This is better and provide a more accurate picture.<br><br>My proposition is if want to go to less hot faculties, you have to excel and cannot afford to be just the typical common graduates. You have less leeway as compared to hotter faculties graduates.<br><br>My definition of hot may offend some but hey it is my 1 cent worth of opinion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

You gotta feed your stomach. And if a society or demand for certain profession service is very low, it will indirectly mean you have a harder task to get a job assuming you want to be employee and not employer mentality of cuz.<br><br>If you take a look at typical poor family parents, they have been poor their whole life and know the hardship of being poor so they would want their sons/daughters to major in a profession that will bring in more money and stability so can have more comfortable life once they are married. They don't want their kids to be trapped in the cycle of poverty.<br><br>For more richer family, they can afford to let their children choose a profession they deem fit their interest. Now if this earlier generation family is poor, would they still adopt the same strategy? I would think no. Earn more money is more important.<br><br>So the poor can only admire those kids that came from relatively more wealthy family and hope one day to reach their status too. Majoring in a profession that cannot bring in money is not a good step towards that direction.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
