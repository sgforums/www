              <p>Now I truly wonder what sparked the first thought of "satan's" existence in your life?</p>
              <p>Not meaning to be rude...</p>
              <p>But I thought what you expounded was the greatest hypocritical bullshit I've read in Sgf the whole time I've been here. You spoke of how satan got you KFC; how satan helped you aced your exam; how great he is. Then you took a step back with how you would not break the law for your supposing faith.</p>
              <p>I bet all my money if ever the cops would to arrest you, beat the shit out of you and slap you with the prospect of doing 20 years in jail - you would totally renounce the goodness of your so-called God.</p>
              <p>Man... Try to have a li'l more confidence in yourself and be surprised at life's generosity and suprises; you scored that A because you worked hard and persisted; you got the KFC for dinner because hey that's life way of saying "good things happen".</p>
              <p>What you lack is not a God to worship; but self-confidence and a sense of self-identity.</p>
              <p>Oh well, good luck and keep your nose clean.</p>

              <p>Also, do note that it is "Knowledge of good and evil", if you don't know what's good/ evil, you cannot sin right? And the bible says that "The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law." Which is the knowledge of good and evil.</p>

              <p>But I thought what you expounded was the greatest hypocritical
              bullshit I've read in Sgf the whole time I've been here.
              You spoke of how satan got you KFC; how satan helped you aced your
              exam; how great he is. Then you took a step back with how you would
              not break the law for your supposing faith.</p>
              <p>I bet all my money if ever the cops would to arrest you, beat
              the shit out of you and slap you with the prospect of doing 20
              years in jail - you would totally renounce the goodness of your
              so-called God.</p>
              <p>Man... Try to have a li'l more confidence in yourself and be
              surprised at life's generosity and suprises; you scored that A
              because you worked hard and persisted; you got the KFC for dinner
              because hey that's life way of saying "good things happen".</p>
              <p>What you lack is not a God to worship; but self-confidence and a
              sense of self-identity.</p>
              <p>Oh well, good luck and keep your nose clean.</p>

              <p>Satan encourages me to do what is best for myself. What is best for myself is not to break the laws of Singapore. I will follow Satanic beliefs to the point of not breaking the laws of Singapore.</p>

              <p>Why must you follow anti-God or "Satan" according to Christian
              theology..?</p>
              <p>Maybe you should worship some Muslim devils? They also have
              Satan and lower level evil genies.</p>
              <p>Maybe you should worship Hindu Gods or their versions of "Satan"
              or evil deities?</p>
              <p>There are so many description of Satans, why are you following
              the Christian description? Maybe your teacher foolled you? Just
              like you said Christian Bible perhaps is not right, or written by
              one sided "winner", so why are you following its description of the
              loser side? For instance you said something about 666, why should u
              believe in this?</p>
              <p>Maybe you should do more research and then decide on one Satan
              that you want to worship, and make sure it is very powerful.</p>
              <p>OK good luck.</p>

              <p>As I said, I am a new Satanist and so my defination of Satan is still very influenced by my ex-christian background. I am reading up on other versions of theistic Satanism. One of them is the Joy of Satan ministry. They believe the christian god is a lie and that Satan is the only God of the universe. However, they also believe Satan is an alien. And I do not share their belief in Satan being an alien.</p>
              <p>I believe the bible to be an inspired work of Yahweh/Christian God that tells partial truth. Since the bible is inspired by Yahweh, it told things from his point of view. It portrayed Satan to be evil and God to be good. It showed Satan to be an adversary of mankind. I think the story of garden of Eden happened. It is just not like the way God said it to be. Satan gave mankind knowledge, and freed man from being the mindless slave of God.</p>
              <p>I also think that the bible underestimated the power of Satan in its account. Satan was a created being, no doubt. But he had the power to overthrow God. He created hell where he chose to live now and work from. Hell is a place of pleasures for all followers of Satan. So Satan is definitely not the loser.</p>
              <p>Anyway, my views of Satan may change as I grow more mature in him as a follower.</p>
