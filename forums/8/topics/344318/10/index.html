              after so many years, the thesis of the christian bible must have change already due to so many different languages and stories. So how does one can tell the consistency of the bible? 
              Just like I tell u today Im going to market to buy a fish. you go and tell my mom that im going to market at 7am to buy a fish for cooking. Then mom tell dad that im going to cook fish for dinner tonight. And it goes on. But I never say I'm going to cook dinner tonight....
              
              christians morals - sex after marriage must have been created by some woman 
              
              satan rebel against god to create hell...hmm sounds like a story that only appears in movies

              <p>I agree, one does not need to be religious to be morally right.
              BUT , without the guidelines to what is n what is not, u tend to
              see things differently. Like how u say Christian morals such as sex
              only after marriage which deny ou instinctual urges as such
              impulses are what makes us human right ? Then killing... taking
              what we want , lying , destruction are also our instinctual urges
              to do so for selfish self preservation. Can u imagine if we all
              just let our impulses and instincts run the show? Confirm God
              created us to experience all these desires.</p>
              <p>He did not say cant have sex right ? But the question is, do u
              think it is.. right, believing God or no God, to stay true to one
              person. Well, there are known problems of sex before marriage, not
              just the psychological issues, its also the morality decay of
              things resulting after it and subsequent generations. U see, the
              difference is that we hope to leave a lasting good impression, to
              fight temptations , to stay true to what we think is right. If u
              wish to be free , indulge in the desires of our human instincts
              uncontrollably, fine with me man. I find the whole issue of sex
              before marriage just bullshit before, but as time goes, well, lets
              just say after what i've seen, i think there is some point as to
              why they believe sex after marriage . ;p</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The point I'm trying to make is that Christian morals are horribly flawed because they impose rules which although may be practical in certain circumstances, are just too general to be beneficial. Surely sex after marriage may have advantages for a select few but in most cases it's just an unecessary restriction on your happiness as are many other Christian laws. We should not need a distinct, uncompromisable set of laws on how to live our lives, we have the ability (most of us anyway) to determine what is good for ourselves and if we are aware of the consequences of our actions and still wish to act upon them then nobody should be able to tell us otherwise.</p>
              <p>There are definitely beneficial rules such as 'Thou shalt not kill' but we have no need for Christianity or religion in general to tell us that, each country's enforced law covers that and it is a universally human taboo to kill, steal, etc. even for supposedly godless and lawless native tribes.</p>
              <p>We don't need God to tell us what is wrong and right, we already have our own, much more reasonable conceptions of right and wrong. </p>

              <p>I know it doesnt preach murder. But, if murder will get what u
              want.... why not right ? ;p Isnt that what it said about Satanism ?
              Self indulgence ? I read the threads.. oh yes i do. Or else i wont
              be typing so much stuff here.</p>
              <p>Ur perception of u die n thats it, fair enough.. thats why like
              i said again, u lead the way u lead ur life. Because u believe that

              percieve others n yourself is different already just based on the

              <p>I live my life to the fullest. hell i enjoy life ;p  i have
              doubt too. we all do. Beliefs will shapre our characters and how we
              think and act on it and things around us. When my belief was weak,
              i did the things an atheist does. My perception of things are
              different, the way i treat others and myself is different. But now
              that i believe , i am different. So there is difference. =D Thats

              <p>Yes, Satanism preaches self-indulgence but with restriction. Every religion or set of beliefs have restrictions, it is part of law.</p>
              <p>Beliefs and values may shape our character but those beliefs do not have to be religious in  nature. Atheists are just as morally upright as the religious. Furthermore, you do not have to be religious to believe in the teachings of a religion. I do not believe in a God but I do agree with much of Jesus' teachings.</p>
              <p>Speaking of which, there have been countless crimes against humanity committed in the name of God, religion has its obvious disadvantages in that sense as well as the fact that God has done what most people would consider evil on several occasions. Evidence from the Bible:</p>
              <p>II Kings 2:23-24 (NIV)</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; line-height: normal;"> <span id="en-NIV-9575" class="sup" style="font-size: 0.65em; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: text-top;">23</span> From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some youths came out of the town and jeered at him. "Go on up, you baldhead!" they said. "Go on up, you baldhead!" <span id="en-NIV-9576" class="sup" style="font-size: 0.65em; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: text-top;">24</span> He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths.</span></p>
              <p>What kind of a sick and twisted God sends bears to maul forty-two children because they mocked one of his followers? Surely no just God would condone, let alone commit, such an act.</p>
              <p>1 Samuel 18:25-27 (New King James Version)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Charis SIL'; line-height: normal;">
              </span></p><p> <span id="en-KJV-7702" class="sup" style="font-size: 0.65em; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: text-top;">25</span>And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</p>
              <p> <span id="en-KJV-7703" class="sup" style="font-size: 0.65em; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: text-top;">26</span>And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.</p>
              <p> <span id="en-KJV-7704" class="sup" style="font-size: 0.65em; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: text-top;">27</span>Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>These supposed followers of God killed two hundred men for his own selfish gain of attaining a king's hand in marriage. There are countless instances in the Bible of Christians or Jews murdering in the name of God who explicitly commanded them that 'Thou shalt not kill'. Even God goes back on his word when he lets forth the bears to maul the children.</p>

              <p>i'd introduce you to a friend called irony but I see you know him already. You accuse me of not having read the bible before making my conclusions, and yet go off on a ridiculous rant about satanism, most of which was completely worng in any case, and then talking about imaginary friends who set moral standards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Congrats on missing the point completely, which was that I don't need an imaginary friend to act as my moral compass or to tell me that murder is wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ever heard of the Golden Rule ? "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" ? Empathy ? Before accusing others of ignorance, it'd bode you well to look in the mirror first.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately for you, I have read the bible, the Koran, the Torah, the Bhagwad Gita, all to try and understand the dynamics of religion and why it's become such a dominant force in the world today. I'm not some school kid who decided to be atheist because it's cool; I've actually been studying and debating this for the best part of 8 years now !</p>

              Would you tolerate religions which harasses you to convert? Would you tolerate people who want you to turn or burn (literally)?
              
              I think tolerance is only for those who know their limits.

              <p>Satan is a misrepresented figure in the christian bible. The

              What if Satan is the good guy and God is the bad guy?</p>

              Satan gave Eve knowledge, while God in the christian bible, wanted
              men to remain a blind and stupid slave to him. God is the one who
              forbid knowledge in the bible. How many scientific knowlege, like
              human cloning, etc, are seen as evil by the christians simply

              <p>So the basis of your religious philosophy is simply reversing the "good bad" standing between God and Satan.  Which also goes to nowhere with regards to your dilemma of losing your grandfather since some of your friends or relatives who believe in the Christian God will go to heaven, and hence again, separated from you. </p>
              <p>Oh by the way.  Where do you think evil people go?  Do they go to hell also? Or is there a special department for the evil people?</p>

              <p>I have come in the name of God to make light to you something since you have broken the 1st commandment. I'm not going to quote anything from the bible &amp; argue with you on it cos the bible is there for all to see. No point debating as there are millions who argued on the truth of the bible. I will mention real-life matters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have been a devoted catholic for a few years now becos i was once misled &amp; think that i do not need God some time ago. i thought i was fine by myself &amp; i did not have Him in my life for 5 years..but i was really wrong as he really stood by me all these while when i was involved in a criminal case &amp; He pulled me out of it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now im living a blessed life. I have a stable career, a loving wife &amp; kids, a house &amp; a car. Finiancally i have no problems.(Sorry people not that im boasting but coming to my point)...all these thanks to God for blessing me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what did you have meanwhile...when believing in satan? Has he given you anything?? other than kfc which no one has problems getting. You mentioned praying to satan for good results during exams..do you know that praying to God doesn't give you anything less? In fact more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You mentioned you were once a christian. Which means you turned to the dark side. I'm curious why...were you abused in any manner or were you lack of love? Or because you ask for something from God &amp; He did not give you? Do you know God will give us anything we ask? But not at the snap of our fingers. If not He will be our slave, not master. All He asks from us is patience then he will give it to us. Call it training if you must but it's definately for our good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You called satan "father". Indeed he is a father...a father of lies &amp; deception for he has won you over from God. People who cannot wait will pray to the devil.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You also mentioned God doesn't give you freedom where satan does. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY WRONG! God gives us the highest form of freedom. He gives us the freedom of CHOICE! He allow us to choose between Himself &amp; the devil. You cannot accept His commandments, therefore you chose satan.</p>

              <p>Are you so sure it's God who has given you a stable career, a loving wife and kids, a house and a car or did you have to work to get those? I'm sure you didn't just pray to God and was given all those without having to do anything to obtain them because that's what giving denotes, that you didn't have to do anything to obtain them as it was a gift from God.</p>
              <p>I myself am an ex-Christian and if God truly gives us anything we ask for then I would've been a billionaire but the fact is I am not even though I have asked for it so God does not give you everything you ask for. Patience? I've prayed for certain things every day for years and never gotten them.</p>
              <p>God certainly doesn't give us the freedom of choice as if we do not obey him he will damn us to an eternity of torture. That's as much freedom as a mugger gives you when he puts a gun to your head and tells you to give him your wallet. Sure, you have the 'freedom' to choose whether or not to do what he tells you but disobey him and you'll receive a bullet to the head, or in this case even worse - an eternity of suffering.</p>
              <p>No just God would sentence someone to torture for an eternity. I can safely say that I would never wish something like that upon another person and whoever would is sick and evil.</p>
