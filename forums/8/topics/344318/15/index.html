              <p>U want a biblical answer...here's it...</p>
              <p>God is eternal, infinite, omniscient, omnipresent, etc. Why should we human beings expect to be able to fully understand God’s ways? The book of Job deals with this issue. God had allowed satan to do everything he wanted to Job except kill him. What was Job’s reaction? “Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him”. “The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the name of the Lord be praised”. Job didn’t understand why God had allowed the things He did, but he knew that God was good and therefore continued to trust in Him. Ultimately, that should be our reaction as well. God is good, just, loving, and merciful. Often things happen to us that we simply cannot understand. However, instead of doubting God's goodness, our reaction should be to trust Him. "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Human beings are sinful. Do you want to know how God views humanity? “As it is written: There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God. All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one. Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit. The poison of vipers is on their lips. Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood; ruin and misery mark their ways, and the way of peace they do not know. There is no fear of God before their eyes”. Every human being on this planet deserves to be thrown into hell at this very moment. Every second we spend alive is only by the grace of God. Even the most terrible misery we could experience on this planet is merciful compared to what we deserve, eternal hell in the lake of fire.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us”. Despite the evil, wicked, sinful nature of the people of this world, God still loved us. He loved us enough to die to take the penalty for our sins. All we have to do is believe in Jesus Christ in order to be forgiven and receive a home in heaven. What we deserve—hell. What we are given— eternal life in heaven if we just believe. It has been said, this world is the only hell believers will ever experience, and this world is the only heaven non believers will ever experience.</p>

              <p><br> And for your info there is no old covenent and new covenent thing.
                      read your bible properly Jesus said, <em>"It is easier for Heaven
                      and Earth to pass away than for the smallest part of the letter of
                      the law to become invalid."</em>  (Luke 16:17 NAB)</p>
              <p>Anyways i dont believe jesus is the messiah. So new testament is
                      invalid</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Prophecies to Identify the Messiah, Which Jesus
                      Does Not Fulfill:</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">1) Matthew 1:23 says that
                      Jesus (the messiah) would be called Immanuel, which means "God with
                      us."  Yet no one, not even his parents, call him Immanuel at
                      any point in the bible.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">2) The Messiah must be a
                      physical descendant of David (Romans 1:3 &amp; Acts 2:30).
                       Yet, how could Jesus meet this requirement since his
                      genealogies in Matthew 1 and Luke 3 show he descended from David
                      through Joseph, who was not his natural father because of the
                      Virgin Birth. Hence, this prophecy could not have been
                      fulfilled.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">3) Isaiah 7:16 seems to say
                      that before Jesus had reached the age of maturity, both of the
                      Jewish countries would be destroyed.  Yet there is no mention
                      of this prophecy being fulfilled in the New Testament with the
                      coming of Jesus, hence this is another Messiah prophecy not
                      fulfilled.</p>

How powerful men of the past such as priests and kings wrote the law and twisted people into believing what they wrote is the word of God. If God is so powerful and wanted to tell Man something he will tell them with his own mouth and not through some power hungry money hungry warmonger.

              <p>Well i know for a fact that the person who give you all your needs and helps you with life and everything is not your God from the Bible, so you shouldnt attribute everything that happens to Him. Cos from whatever i have read from the Bible, it is just not his style. His style is Kill Kill Kill.</p>

              <p>The only reason i can offer is this which i think u hav not seen above...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>God is eternal, infinite, omniscient, omnipresent, etc. Why should we human beings expect to be able to fully understand God’s ways? The book of Job deals with this issue. God had allowed satan to do everything he wanted to Job except kill him. What was Job’s reaction? “Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him”. “The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the name of the Lord be praised”. Job didn’t understand why God had allowed the things He did, but he knew that God was good and therefore continued to trust in Him. Ultimately, that should be our reaction as well. God is good, just, loving, and merciful. Often things happen to us that we simply cannot understand. However, instead of doubting God's goodness, our reaction should be to trust Him. "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Human beings are sinful. Do you want to know how God views humanity? “As it is written: There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God. All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one. Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit. The poison of vipers is on their lips. Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood; ruin and misery mark their ways, and the way of peace they do not know. There is no fear of God before their eyes”. Every human being on this planet deserves to be thrown into hell at this very moment. Every second we spend alive is only by the grace of God. Even the most terrible misery we could experience on this planet is merciful compared to what we deserve, eternal hell in the lake of fire.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us”. Despite the evil, wicked, sinful nature of the people of this world, God still loved us. He loved us enough to die to take the penalty for our sins. All we have to do is believe in Jesus Christ in order to be forgiven and receive a home in heaven. What we deserve—hell. What we are given— eternal life in heaven if we just believe. It has been said, this world is the only hell believers will ever experience, and this world is the only heaven non believers will ever experience.</p>
