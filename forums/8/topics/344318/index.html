              <p>Latest Update:  I am currently not sure which religion is the true religion. I used to believe in Jesus. I used to believe in Satan, and in a way, still believes in him. But now, instead of seeing him(Satan) as God that I should worship, I see him more as a friend to help me in time of uncertainty.</p>
              <p>I see many miracles in many religions. I think all religions are valid. I am moving towards not relying on any god, not Yahweh the christian god, not satan. I think I am my own god. That is, I do good deeds because I want to and I love to, not because I want to please any particular god.</p>
              <p>During my free time, I am reading up on religions. Any and every religion.</p>
              <p>My old post:</p>
              <p>Is it illegal to start a satanic coven in Singapore? I am interested in the religion of theistic satanism. My beliefs are mainly similar to the cathedral of the black goats. I am interested in starting or joining a satanic coven in Singapore. I just wonder if it is illegal to do so. I do not want to do anything against the laws.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P/S: If you know of any existing theistic satanic coven in Singapore, kindly PM me as I am interested in joining.</p>
              <p><br>Theistic Satanism actually believes in Satan as God. It is different from atheistic Satanism which believes in man as God.</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for all your information.</p>

              <p>There is no need to get so worked up. I am merely wondering if it is legal to start a satanic coven in Singapore. This shows that I am of a clear mind, since I do not want to break the laws of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Satanism is not as scary as all of you think. We don't sacrifice human. Satan is not actually evil. When you start praying to him, he actually answered your prayers.</p>
              <p>Once, I wanted very much to eat KFC chickens but lack the money to do so. I pray to Father Satan and he answered my prayer. My parents bought KFC chickens for me that day.</p>
              <p>I don't wear black, don't drink human blood, don't curse the christians, don't break the laws of Singapore. I give tuition to primary school students, studied and graduated from the university of Singapore, watched Korean and Japanese dramas and write letters to penpals from all over the world. I believe in filial piety, respecting one's own parents.</p>
              <p>The only difference I had with most young adults my age in Singapore is that I actually pray to Satan before I go to bed every night.</p>
