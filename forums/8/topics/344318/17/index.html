              <p>Thanks. I had yet to find a satanic coven to attend. So I have
              to practise my faith alone.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>What does practising your faith entail? If it doesn't involve blood libel, sacrificing cute babies or self flagellation or murder or just doesn't harm anyone, then go right ahead girl! :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What you described as Satanism sounds bit like Bible fanfiction actually - ultimately theres:</p>
              <p>1. A higher power (or erm, lower power since He's in Hell?)</p>
              <p>2. You pray for divine providence from the higher power</p>
              <p>Not really different from Christianity, methinks. Just that you subverted the bad and good players. But same consequences in any case. I mean, Satan is just a name. You should find comfort in whatever you believe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BUT I REITERATE: don't break any laws; don't sacrifice anything...and if you do, tell me so that I will stay at home and guard my doors :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck dear!</p>

              <p>Sg gal,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please do not follow your faith mindlessly. You sound awfully ignorant and immature. Asking Satan to bring you KFC? Do you even listen to yourself?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While I may be a Christian, I have to admit I'm not a really good one but I can point out a few facts to you. But before I do so, I would just like to point out that I'm not promoting my faith, but would just like to point out a few fatal flaws in Sggal's religious views. So here goes:</p>
              <p>1. Jesus is God, in the form of man. God came down in the form of man(Jesus) to heal the sick and die for our sins. So if you like Jesus but hate God, you are just contradicting yourself.</p>
              <p>2. Satan did not just deceive Adam and Eve, he rebelled against God and there was an epic battle and he lost and got banished to hell. Lucifer was an angel before he became the Satan that we know. He got 1/3 of heaven to rebel against God. Failed, and therefore is the bitter demon that he is in hell. It was not for freedom, but power.</p>
              <p>3. If God made us all his mindless servants, why do we have free will? And how are you possibly a Satanist. If what you say is true, I would be praying and worshipping God 24/7. So would you, so kindly reflect on that please.</p>
              <p>Then again you could just refute me by just saying that the bible is wrong and go on living your life.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying that what I just pointed out above is correct, but I'm just showing Sggal that her points really cannot make it ah.</p>
              <p>Hope you do some proper research before you just dive into a faith. Because from the way I look at it, you are really misguided. Go look for some proper Satanists and ask them for the full picture. How things actually happen. If I were Satan I'd be laughing my ass off at how you assume things about me without actually finding out stuff. And if KFC could win over people's faith. Damn I'd have started my own religion.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>1. I think Jesus is good because of what he does in the new testament. I think he is misguided, that is, he is deceived into believing his father is good.

And then the sequel continues with different people spreading it and there's no end untill it spreaded till it became made believed in people's mind that they started a church and said god made them do it. THIS is when all rumours about God, jesus is put to the test and all reported rumours were fake. An example is the christian religion, mormons. search it in wikipedia, just by reading it and u will know its fake.</p></div>
