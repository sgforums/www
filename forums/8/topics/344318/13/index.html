              <p>That is your opinion.(Don't want to start a religious wars

              <p>I am 25 years old this year. It is not you I am against, either. You seem sincere in your devotion to your God. I just had some issues with believing your God.</p>
              <p>Satan may seem like a bad guy to you, because you are a christian. But he had actually helped me in life.</p>
              <p>I do not go about converting others to Satanism. I understand that people are still very afraid of Satan. For me, believing in Satan is a private practise.</p>
              <p>I do hope to attend a Satanic Coven, though, one day as it can be quite lonely to worship Satan alone.</p>
              <p>If I believe Satan is evil, I will not have worshipped him, as I am against evil.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The Bible to me seems pretty one sided too, like continuously siding with whoever writes the chapter. Lots of killings made justifiable in Samuel seemly under instruction from God. It sounds like an excuse Samuel made up to get his subordinates to obey him. And all that stuff about God being real originates from Moses and those 5 chapters he wrote. Odd that Satan is powerful enough to ruin lives of people but can't get a book written about him. So i conclude The bible is a load of horseshit. Go take up Buddhism instead</p></div>
