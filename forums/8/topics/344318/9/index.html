              <p>U just answered the reasons why Christians believe in God and why they are the way they are. ;p</p>
              <p>If everything is the way u see it... there will be chaos. There will be no rules. No control. No morality. No right. No wrong.</p>
              <p>Thing make more sense because ur level of knowledge and comprehension is at your level, if u believe in the Almighty, it pretty much means his knowledge surpasses our own. We may eventually use science to explain things, but there will always be the unexplainable. He created us in his image, so its only natural that we mirror him in may ways , just that we are still at n infant stage in this evolution. lol</p>
              <p>its always easier to accept things u can understand. believe what u can see. I dont blame you guys. We are but only human. Since the beginning of time we have already wondered about the existence of a higher being. N we will keep on searching until the very day we go extinct. ;p</p>
              <p>So let us believe our God, and live the life of a God fearing, morally upright person that seeks salvation and knowingly that the sins we commit on this earth, are punishable before Him. And the fear of Hell itself makes us an example to the world of how to lead a pious virtous life. But we are not perfect, we never will. So at least , that is a guide for us on how to live our life. =D</p>

              <p>Well, Christians equate Satanism to evil... like DUH ...  lol! What u expect them to equate to ? lol. U talk about not being instrusive and offensive , if u are really such an, understanding person, maybe grab the book, have a read at it and perhaps know WHY Christians equate Satanism to evil ? But are u arrogant enough as to not have a read at it ? mmmm...  itsp to u. ;p</p>
              <p>Think of it as a guide.  A general guide to how one should lead his/her life. If we all know exactly what how n when to lead our life , there wouldnt be any religion on this planet at all right ? lol..</p>
              <p>If Satanism teaches the love, the love for another being, and the non-violence, the fear of damnation of the sins one commits , the sharing and the caring.. hell, i would think that Satanism will be pretty alrite. But will the world be a better place if everyone is an atheist or a satanist cult member ?</p>
              <p>Anyways, when we pass on, and u believe that u will just become part of the soil... future crude oil, its your choice. Because the way  u percieve how one leaves this earth, believes or doesnt believe in the afterlife, will also determine how u see , feel and deal with what is on this world and how u leave it as it is and treat others in times of peril, comfort, joy , fear ...etc .</p>
              <p>Oh.. n if my imaginary friend preaches me not to murder , n urs tells u to kill me to survive, then ... i wonder whose imaginary friend is better.. ? N what is better... is different between us.</p>

              <p>U just answered the reasons why Christians believe in God and
                  why they are the way they are. ;p</p>
              <p>If everything is the way u see it... there will be chaos. There
                  will be no rules. No control. No morality. No right. No wrong.</p>
              <p>Thing make more sense because ur level of knowledge and
                  comprehension is at your level, if u believe in the Almighty, it
                  pretty much means his knowledge surpasses our own. We may
                  eventually use science to explain things, but there will always be
                  the unexplainable. He created us in his image, so its only natural
                  that we mirror him in may ways , just that we are still at n infant
                  stage in this evolution. lol</p>
              <p>its always easier to accept things u can understand. believe
                  what u can see. I dont blame you guys. We are but only human. Since
                  the beginning of time we have already wondered about the existence
                  of a higher being. N we will keep on searching until the very day
                  we go extinct. ;p</p>
              <p>So let us believe our God, and live the life of a God fearing,
                  morally upright person that seeks salvation and knowingly that the
                  sins we commit on this earth, are punishable before Him. And the
                  fear of Hell itself makes us an example to the world of how to lead
                  a pious virtous life. But we are not perfect, we never will. So at
                  least , that is a guide for us on how to live our life. =D</p>

              <p>One does not need to be religious to be morally upright. I just don't believe in senseless Christian morals such as sex only after marriage which deny our instinctual urges as such impulses are what makes us human. If there is a God he must be having a laugh at us as he created us to experience all these desires then tells us we must resist them.</p>
              <p>I am non-religious and I do believe in abiding by the law and treating others as I would like to be treated. What's disgusting is that some Christiand only do what is considered right because of fear of punishment instead of doing it out of principle and morals. A hypothetical God surely wouldn't want that.</p>

              <p>I am not scared to go to hell. Hell is not the scary place of burning fire that the christian god said hell to be. Hell is a place for satanist to go to and reunite with satan and the demons.</p>
              <p>Hell is one reason I lost faith in the christian god. My grandfather was a non-christian. Will he go to hell simply because he does not believe in Jesus?</p>
              <p>Satan is a misrepresented figure in the christian bible. The bible is told in the point of view of God. So, of course, Satan is painted to be the bad guy while God is painted to be the good guy. What if Satan is the good guy and God is the bad guy?</p>
              <p>In reality, what crime had Satan really commited besides tempting Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil? Satan gave Eve knowledge, while God in the christian bible, wanted men to remain a blind and stupid slave to him. God is the one who forbid knowledge in the bible. How many scientific knowlege, like human cloning, etc, are seen as evil by the christians simply because God forbid knowledge?</p>

              <p>Well, Christians equate Satanism to evil... like DUH ... 
              lol! What u expect them to equate to ? lol. U talk about not being

              Christians equate Satanism to evil ? But are u arrogant enough as

              <p>Think of it as a guide.  A general guide to how one should
              lead his/her life. If we all know exactly what how n when to lead
              our life , there wouldnt be any religion on this planet at all
              right ? lol..</p>
              <p>If Satanism teaches the love, the love for another being, and
              the non-violence, the fear of damnation of the sins one commits ,
              the sharing and the caring.. hell, i would think that Satanism will
              be pretty alrite. But will the world be a better place if everyone
              is an atheist or a satanist cult member ?</p>
              <p>Anyways, when we pass on, and u believe that u will just become

              <p>I know exactly how to live my life and that is to have the best time possible before I die without restricting others from doing the same. Though I may have doubts about this at times, no human doesn't, even a Christian questions his faith at times.</p>

              <p>I agree with that but however, i think ur a very naive person/like the other unintellectual people. By beliving in "gods" for answering prayers, it show ur simple minded too-ur just lucky. If u calculate it , the chances of "god" answerign u is high, for example , u may not really clsoe ur eyes and pray but jsut imagine wishing to god, sometime u just forget it as it fails, but if u get what u asked for u freak out and worship fking satan.</p>
              <p>by not beliving in the Christian god, u remove it's flaws and turn to satanism.which doesn;t have retarded eternal-hell for non christian and one-prayer=no more sin, etc...</p>
              <p>and by logic, satan is extremely powerful, he dun need an ant like u to join his legion , and if there's a battle between good or evil or whatsoever, the immortals wont need u. so ur just worshipping satan just because he is ur Flawless-God. u shud rethink ur mind concept, but i bet ur stubborn mind is fixed.</p>

              <p>I agree, one does not need to be religious to be morally right. BUT , without the guidelines to what is n what is not, u tend to see things differently. Like how u say Christian morals such as sex only after marriage which deny ou instinctual urges as such impulses are what makes us human right ? Then killing... taking what we want , lying , destruction are also our instinctual urges to do so for selfish self preservation. Can u imagine if we all just let our impulses and instincts run the show? Confirm God created us to experience all these desires.</p>
              <p>He did not say cant have sex right ? But the question is, do u think it is.. right, believing God or no God, to stay true to one person. Well, there are known problems of sex before marriage, not just the psychological issues, its also the morality decay of things resulting after it and subsequent generations. U see, the difference is that we hope to leave a lasting good impression, to fight temptations , to stay true to what we think is right. If u wish to be free , indulge in the desires of our human instincts uncontrollably, fine with me man. I find the whole issue of sex before marriage just bullshit before, but as time goes, well, lets just say after what i've seen, i think there is some point as to why they believe sex after marriage . ;p</p>

When my belief was weak, i did the things an atheist does. My perception of things are different, the way i treat others and myself is different. But now that i believe , i am different. So there is difference. =D Thats why in the end, i would think that to believe is better then not believing.</p>

              governments and thus may be considered a set of moral
              standards.<br> <br> I personally believe so many sets of morals lead to confusion,
              chaos and eventually war.<br> <br> One might see other's morals to be right or wrong, but thats only
              based on YOUR perspective.<br> <br> Is there really right and wrong if not for us humans? No.<br> <br> When one labels something as right, thats only your views, based on
              your moral standards, and that goes for when you label something as
              wrong as well.<br> <br> Morals are designed so that we can live happily in peace, but
              conflicts with moral standards of other groups of people create
              disputes.<br> <br> The most idealistic way to end this, is for someone to unify and
              rule the world, having everyone conform to his moral
              standards.<br> <br> However, this is not reality.<br> <br> Christian evangelicals believing they are right, seek to alter
              other's beliefs to conform to their own.<br> <br> This is impractical.<br> <br> People of different beliefs will revolt.<br> <br> People will develop their own beliefs to quell their fears of the
              unknown.<br> <br> Christianity may or may not die out, but even if it does, another
              religion will be born (Bahai faith is one of them, once people
              realise the bible is imperfect)<br> <br> The world will forever be in conflict because we humans have the
              ability to think.<br> <br> Morality is not a way to solve this problem, in fact it adds to the
              problem.</p>

              <p>Well, i think thier morals as good, if not better.. ;p Morality is just one of the issues we face. I know morality is different from everyone and there are philosophies that explain the different forms of morality, the divine morality issue, the moral relatavist argument, the evolutionalist argument and a few others more.</p>
              <p>No doubt that our morals are different, of course i know. The decisions made by those with different moral perspective can be seen today. What disgusts us is does not disgust them. My point about morality as one of the issues or the main drive of one of its key principles in Christianity , is that its better then now having any morals at all. Even the Laws today based on the Catholic laws by St Thomas Aquinas is passed down as it is and because of this, there are arguments on what the law should be or ought to be. But that is another issue all together albeit related.</p>
              <p>Bahai faith, or Bahai`u alath , yes.. i studied thier faith. ;p Thiers about the messiahs are all sent by the same god , but in different times. Thiers is even more imperfect, especially able to claim that anyone can be a messiah. But when i said if i say i am a messiah will they believe me ? They didnt say nuttin. N just told me to chant n hymm to the enigma like music. Hey man..</p>
              <p>Well, aggressive faiths like the muslim and christianity definately tries to seek to save the word from damnation. Of course we humans think and there will be conflict. Why u think there is the UN to have a more universal moral standard. Why not just let everyone run free... without morals.. or morals of thier own. If thats the case, wont there be MORE conflict ? Imagine.. a world.. without morals. Like now.. which is at its low.. and may go even lower. How ? U got a solution ? So how then do we solve.. moral disputes ? =D</p>
