              <p>I am not scared to go to hell. Hell is not the scary place of
              burning fire that the christian god said hell to be. Hell is a
              place for satanist to go to and reunite with satan and the
              demons.</p>
              <p>Hell is one reason I lost faith in the christian god. My
              grandfather was a non-christian. Will he go to hell simply because
              he does not believe in Jesus?</p>
              <p>Satan is a misrepresented figure in the christian bible. The
              bible is told in the point of view of God. So, of course, Satan is
              painted to be the bad guy while God is painted to be the good guy.
              What if Satan is the good guy and God is the bad guy?</p>
              <p>In reality, what crime had Satan really commited besides
              tempting Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil?
              Satan gave Eve knowledge, while God in the christian bible, wanted
              men to remain a blind and stupid slave to him. God is the one who
              forbid knowledge in the bible. How many scientific knowlege, like
              human cloning, etc, are seen as evil by the christians simply
              because God forbid knowledge?</p>

              <p>you sound more like you're just replacing the word god with satan...ultimately you're praying to something who was made by god himself... something that is only as powerful in this world for as long as god permits him to be...wot i think is that in this situation, god actually is very merciful to let satan exist to this day...</p>
              <p>i'm much the opposite...just like how you pray to satan for the little of things, i too if not always, get the smallest of prayers(or in this case hope) answered...like how i hope that no one is home(coz if my sis is home, she'd dominate the com) or that the bus stops right in front of me...</p>
              <p>yea...one of the reasons why we should thank satan is for letting us enjoy the gift of life...without which adam and eve wouldn't even have the genitals to reproduce...LOL...</p>
              <p>unless god had other plans...which i doubt so since he is the all knowing..so that must mean that everything is going according to plan</p>

              entire tribe that does not worship him. God, according to the
              bible, sends people to hell. Most of the people in the world today
              don't believe in the christian God. God, the tyrant, sent the
              majority of the world people to hell.</p>
              <p>Only a sadistic God will delight in torturing people forever and
              ever just because they don't believe in him.</p>
              <p>Only an egoistic God will demand every one to keep praising his
              name and saying he is good. God wants us to be humble in the bible
              but he is the least humble being in the universe.</p>
              <p>Satan is not a bad guy. He gives knowlege to Eve. That is his
              only crime. God is the one that takes the garden of Eden away. God
              is so egoistic that the moment Eve wants knowledge over worshipping
              God, God immediately sends Eve out of the garden of Eden.</p>

              <p>I need to correct some statements of yours before you try to twist more lies into truths. When some people think that cloning is evil, that's THEIR opinions, and everyone's entitled to their own, just like you think that Jesus is evil.</p>
              <p>Those Middle Age assholes who set fire on scientists are probably nowhere better than the terrorists these days. So are you trying to say that just because those assholes happen to believe in Christianity, ALL Christians should therefore be deemed as evil?</p>

              <p>I don't think christians are evil. I have many good christian friends. I just think some of them are misguided. Christians tend to be intolerant of other religions. They claim that only their God is the one.</p>
              <p>As for KFC, I really like KFC. I know it is not healthy but I still like it very much. Satan encourages his followers to indulge in the pleasures of this world. This includes sex, watching japanese and korean dramas, food etc. You think that such freedom is bad. I don't think so.</p>
