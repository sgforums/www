              <p>I am not scared to go to hell. Hell is not the scary place of
              burning fire that the christian god said hell to be. Hell is a
              place for satanist to go to and reunite with satan and the
              demons.</p>
              <p>Hell is one reason I lost faith in the christian god. My
              grandfather was a non-christian. Will he go to hell simply because
              he does not believe in Jesus?</p>
              <p>Satan is a misrepresented figure in the christian bible. The
              bible is told in the point of view of God. So, of course, Satan is
              painted to be the bad guy while God is painted to be the good guy.
              What if Satan is the good guy and God is the bad guy?</p>
              <p>In reality, what crime had Satan really commited besides
              tempting Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil?
              Satan gave Eve knowledge, while God in the christian bible, wanted
              men to remain a blind and stupid slave to him. God is the one who
              forbid knowledge in the bible. How many scientific knowlege, like
              human cloning, etc, are seen as evil by the christians simply
              because God forbid knowledge?</p>

              <p>Interesting viewpoint. I am not a Christian and don't believe in God (I am a Buddhist). Well, I have no idea if Satan is evil or not,  but I don't like the way Christian insists that non-believer will go to hell.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I don't think it is legal to start a Satan coven here as the gov is very sensitive towards to religious harmony  and the Christians here will definitely protest against Satanic activities here.</p>

              <p><br>From what I understand, it's illegal. Laws have many things ill-defined. This is one aspect of it. When public pressure comes in... In a country like Singapore, you'll get the 'proper' reprimanding or prosecution whether you deserves it or not.</p>

              <p>Atheistic satanism believes in the worship of self, and
              therefore I will say that they worship man. I find it ironic, but
              that is not my belief. My belief is in theistic satanism.</p>
              <p>Basically, here is the sum of what I believe in:</p>
              <p>I worship Satan and Demons.</p>
              <p>I believe that the Christian god created the world to be his
              mindless slaves.</p>
              <p>I believe that Lucifer (once an angel) rebelled against the
              Christian god and created Hell.</p>
              <p>I believe in Hell, not as the burning lake of fire--but as
              Satan’s spiritual Kingdom.</p>
              <p>I believe that the souls of Satan worshippers join Satan’s
              legions after death.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believe that Satan is the giver of all knowledge and
              freewill.</p>
              <p>I believe in the Antichrist 666.</p>
              <p>I do believe in the eventual earthly battle between the
              Christian god and Satan, however we have faith that Lord Satan will
              triumph and claim all existence!</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why don't you take Buddhists or Hindhu scriptures and believe the opposite of whatever the Hindhus and Buddhists believe? hahahaha... Is it because you believe Christian theology is a lie? Then why believe anything, SATAN, GOD, whatever whatever mentioned in the Bible and Christian Theology?</span></p>

              <p>So I'm assuming the reply to my first point is therefore 'no' because unless you just sat back and did nothing and was somehow given those things then it would be a gift. You obviously had to work for those and therefore those things aren't gifts from God but a result of your own doings. It is senseless to call something you had to work for a gift.</p>
              <p>If God won't give me money then God doesn't give us everything we ask for as money is included in everything. I've also asked for getting 100% exam scores but never did get them, therefore God doesn't give me everything I ask for and I did go to church every sunday, read the Bible, prayed for things other than money such as health, etc.</p>
              <p>Sure, God won't put a bullet through my head if I sinned, he'd do something much worse - condemn me to hell. God does supposedly condemn us to hell by choosing not to save us even though it is an effortless act for him as he is omnipotent and his power is infinite. Through his inaction he condemns us.</p>
              <p>If someone was hanging off a cliff, about to fall to their death and all you had to do to save them required less effort than blinking yet you chose not to, you would be a murderer and a sick, evil person and also a criminal under the legal system. It is senseless to think that God loves us yet allows us to experience eternal suffering.</p>

You obviously had to work for those and therefore those things aren't gifts from God but a result of your own doings. It is senseless to call something you had to work for a gift.</em></p>
              <p><strong>REPLY:</strong>Ok to be specific...yes i do work for it. But all these is being paved for me by God. God has a plan for all of us before we were born. Like in the scriptures...the law has already been written long before the Son of God came to our world. What He is to do on earth has already been in the scriptures. Isn't it?</p>
              <p><em>If God won't give me money then God doesn't give us everything we ask for as money is included in everything. I've also asked for getting 100% exam scores but never did get them, therefore God doesn't give me everything I ask for and I did go to church every sunday, read the Bible, prayed for things other than money such as health, etc.</em></p>
              <p><strong>REPLY:</strong>Yes we all need money to survive. But my point is how much is enough? You have been asking for 100% for exams but did you study hard enough? God will not give us everything, He will give us the necessary required to survive long enough in this world. It's nice to hear you have been going church every sunday, read the bible &amp; prayed. Pls don't give up just because you didn't get what you prayed for. Maybe the sincerity isn't enough? e.g... like some people who go church to "pray", they actually go church to ogle at girls &amp; woo girls. the agenda is hence very wrong. If you have enough sincerity in whatever you do &amp; prayed for...it will come.</p>
              <p><em>Sure, God won't put a bullet through my head if I sinned, he'd do something much worse - condemn me to hell. God does supposedly condemn us to hell by choosing not to save us even though it is an effortless act for him as he is omnipotent and his power is infinite. Through his inaction he condemns us.</em></p>
              <p><strong>REPLY:</strong>Bro, you didn't get my point. John 3:16-----&gt; <em>For God so love the world, he sends his only Son to the world to save us. And whoever that believes in Him will be saved. </em>Yes we are all sinners. But do you believe in Lord Jesus Christ &amp; He will take away our sins? do you believe in asking for forgiveness from someone after you done them wrong? The fall of adam &amp; eve, though initially caused by the devil, was ultimately caused by the sin of pride. They refused to acknowledge their mistake after they sinned. If they had admitted their sin then &amp; ask for forgiveness, God will forgive them &amp; not banish them to the world. Besides catholics believes after death, we will go "purgatory"...a place to reform, not hell. i'm not sure about other religions.</p>
              <p><em>If someone was hanging off a cliff, about to fall to their death and all you had to do to save them required less effort than blinking yet you chose not to, you would be a murderer and a sick, evil person and also a criminal under the legal system. It is senseless to think that God loves us yet allows us to experience eternal suffering.</em></p>
              <p><strong>REPLY:</strong>If you were that someone, i believed you will go to the person's aid right? we are all born good naturally, why go against it? Actually we can go on &amp; on about this topic...but at the end of the day...it boils down to faith. some believe others don't. Like im beginning to wonder where has the creator of this topic went? she has been missing for some time. Is she really a devil in disguise to create chaos &amp; disharmony among us here? Anyway from your post, i can see you are definately not a sick &amp; evil person. Don't give up believing in God. Continue your faith my friend.</p>

              <p>Exactly, you do work for it so it therefore cannot be called a gift.

              <p><strong>REPLY:</strong>God has a plan for all of us. If we prayed to Him, He will give us the gifts He  had planned for us in certain stages of our lives. If we rebel against Him, He will not give us the gifts He planned. It's our choice. If your parents gave birth to you &amp; they plan for you to go to sch to study &amp; take over your family business in time, but if you do not believe in their plans &amp; refuse to listen to them. You grow up...take drugs, commit robbery &amp; murder. Will you ever receive your parents' gift?</p>

              <p><strong>REPLY: </strong>Ok i put it simpler. If you prayed that you want someone's wife or house or car, do you think God will give them to you? If you prayed for good things definately He will answer you. If you pray for things to your own benefit but results in others' loss, do you think He will answer you? From your above post you mentioned "<em>If God lies then he is not God as you Christians perceive him to be."</em>  I assume you are no longer christian? But you claimed you are sincered in your prayers, attend church regularly &amp; you believe in God &amp; Jesus, then why did you doubt the bible &amp; left christianity??</p>

              <p><em><strong>REPLY:</strong>Unconditional love in the beginning yes when we are born. But don't abused His love for us.
