              <p>The problem is, the bible is a christian book, so it tends to see things from a christian point of view, including Satan.</p>

              <p>I side with Satan because I actually believe him to be misrepresented in the bible. I think he is not as bad as the bible made him out to be.</p>

              <p>The Bible to me seems pretty one sided too, like continuously
              siding with whoever writes the chapter. Lots of killings made
              justifiable in Samuel seemly under instruction from God. It
              sounds like an excuse Samuel made up to get his subordinates to
              obey him. And all that stuff about God being real originates from
              Moses and those 5 chapters he wrote. Odd that Satan is powerful
              enough to ruin lives of people but can't get a book written about
              him. So i conclude The bible is a load of horseshit. Go take up
              Buddhism instead</p>

              <p>hmm. i only know the bible says that the laws are written in man's heart.</p>
              <p>if he died without ever knowing Christ, he will be judged according to his heart, for good or for bad</p>
              <p>but if he died rejecting salvation, then yeah.. </p>
              <p>but who except God is privy to a man's soul at the end of his life? If you are looking into death squarely in the face, wouldn't you cry out to God for help?</p>
              <p>And God, so ever merciful, when He hears that cry, wouldn't He immediately help him?</p>
              <p>To be honest, I don't know what happened to your grand dad, but i do know that God loves him. Just as He loves you.</p>
              <p>He is the type who will have 100 sheeps, and if 1 gets lost, He will put aside the 99 and go after that 1 lost sheep. That's how far He will go. So I'm sure if your grand dad, in his spirit, uttered a gasp of help, God would have answered Him.</p>

              <p>This paragraph remains a debatable issue for believers &amp; non-believers. My 2 cents...probably God "killed" the entire town becos of sin. Take it in this manner. If u set up ur own computer and all's well at first but then a certain program or file got corrupted wif a deadly virus, would u destroy the file to save ur computer? or becos of ur affection for dat program u keep it...and thru time, the virus infects the other programs &amp; files &amp; ur whole computer is corrupted, wouldn't it be too late to save it then?</p>

              <p>Good Afternoon S.gal83</p>
              <p>I am a catholic. Let me share my view.</p>
              <p>God is not evil nor is he/her arrogant proud or self absorbed as you may have imagined.  Lets start from the beginning. Many a times we are faced with things we do not understand for example why is there suffering, why do bad things happen to good people and etc. As a result of our inability to understand some of us begin to believe that there isn't a God afterall.</p>
              <p>In your case you begin believe in Satan because he has granted you KFC and etc. Well God granted you and your parents life. Looking back, you actually do believe that God created Adam and Eve. It was not Satan who created Men but God.</p>
              <p>God does not demand you to sing or shout his name, that is a gross misconception. He asks that you Love God, Love your Neighbour and Love him. I dont shout his name in church or on the streets. Similarly, you dont shout or sing your parents' or your boyfriend's name on the streets just because you love them. You show your love but being concern about them, listening to them and etc. In the same way, God wants you to love him because you are his and he is yours. Also he wants you to love others and others to love you because we are all part of this love.</p>
              <p>If you pray to Satan to strike 4D tomorrow, you would have a higher chance of winning than praying to God. Its true because that is not what God is about. Your relationship is about you and him and the rest of the people. Its about relationship and love. I believe that materials will distract you from this. The more you want to be rich, famous and etc, the more you forget about relationship and love which God tells men is what life is really about.</p>
              <p>As for going to Heaven. Not all christians will go to heaven. Not all non christians will go to Hell. Being christian is not about being baptised or about going to church every weekend. Its about how you lived your life.</p>
              <p>As to the killing of scientist, it was sadly done by the Roman Catholics in the past. It was done because of a twisted faith. No where did God deny knowledge or discouraged it. In fact he made solomon the wises Man when solomon asked to be granted wisdom.</p>
              <p>I have much more to say but I there is too little time and I know it will be a huge bore. In the end I have seen many people proclaiming to be christian doing many things which makes people hate "christians". Similarly I am not perfect and sometimes I do tarnish the image. In the end it is the person that tarnish the image of christianity and not the teachings of God. There are many limitations to understanding the faith mainly because the Bible can be read from different perspective and it will mean totally different things. As to many of the concerns you have raised, I honestly have no answers for them because I am not God himself. In the end, if you wish to know then you will have to hear it from the horses mouth. Ask God why and listen to what he says.</p>

              <p>the old covenant was exactly that. the children of israel made a covenant with God, where the terms are the laws and commandments.</p>
              <p>That's what a covenant is.. They take an animal, they cut it into 2, then declare that anyone who breaks the terms and conditions die exactly like this animal.</p>
              <p>so they already knew how serious it was, so how does that make God bad? God finds no pleasure in the death of His creation. Even if a sinner dies, God takes no pleasure in it</p>

              <p>The old covenant demands death for sin, that's holiness. That's why the jews, and muslims, kill goats and sheeps as sin sacrifices, the animal dies on behalf of them.</p>
              <p>the new covenant in Jesus, is the same. Jesus died for our sins, so that we may live. Holiness, and Love are met. </p>
              <p>God didn't practice double standard on his holiness. There must be shedding of blood, to have forgiveness. When Jesus took up our sins, and took responsibility for our wrongdoings, God didn't spare him also. What He dealt out in the old testament, He dealt out on Jesus, His only begotten Son.</p>

              <p><br>And for your info there is no old covenent and new covenent thing. read your bible properly Jesus said, <em>"It is easier for Heaven and Earth to pass away than for the smallest part of the letter of the law to become invalid."</em>  (Luke 16:17 NAB)</p>
              <p>Anyways i dont believe jesus is the messiah. So new testament is invalid</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Prophecies to Identify the Messiah, Which Jesus Does Not Fulfill:</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">1) Matthew 1:23 says that Jesus (the messiah) would be called Immanuel, which means "God with us."  Yet no one, not even his parents, call him Immanuel at any point in the bible.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">2) The Messiah must be a physical descendant of David (Romans 1:3 &amp; Acts 2:30).  Yet, how could Jesus meet this requirement since his genealogies in Matthew 1 and Luke 3 show he descended from David through Joseph, who was not his natural father because of the Virgin Birth. Hence, this prophecy could not have been fulfilled.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">3) Isaiah 7:16 seems to say that before Jesus had reached the age of maturity, both of the Jewish countries would be destroyed.  Yet there is no mention of this prophecy being fulfilled in the New Testament with the coming of Jesus, hence this is another Messiah prophecy not fulfilled.</p>
