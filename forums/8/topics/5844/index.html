            <div class='col-md body'>When are the times you would lie to your partner/friends/families? Why would u do that? How do you feel about doing that??<br>How would u feel if others lie to you?<br><br>I personally hate it when people lie to me. I think the truth speaks the best for itself. Which is why i feel uncomfortable lying to people as well. When people lie to me, it makes it lose the trust I have for that person. If they want to lie to me, the best is not to let me know that they are lying. But somehow, most people can't lie well, and I can easily see thru their lies. And it makes me feel cheated. Maybe some people may say that it's just a white harmless lie, but a lie is still a lie...when u lie, do u think of how the person will feel when he/she finds out the truth? Depending on who the person who lie to me is, I will not hesitate sometimes to expose the person..and see how the person will react...though i realise that most of the time, the person will just come up with another lie to cover up the first one.<br><br>Any thoughts, anybody?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well as a chronic liar, if you would permit me to use that term, I guess sometimes I find it hard to justify myself too. I can suggest to you possible conditions under which I have lied before:<br><br>1.) To protect my own ego ( I guess everyone has one, but mine's kinda big, to say the least. ) I guess this is somewhat unjustfiable.<br><br>2.) To politely turn down someone eg saying that you have something else on so that you don't have to go out with this specific person. I mean, it's kinda bad to say, " I don't wanna go out with you" , even though u may actually feel that way.<br><br>3.) To shirk responsibility. I know this is real bad, but I'm guilty of it occasionally, not always. I try my very best to let my integrity triumph, but sometimes it just doesn't work.<br><br>I guess if you're talking about a bgr, then it's best to be open about things. Sometimes, an undeliberate lie ( because you were too lazy to explain the truth ) can lead to rather severe consequences. I'd like my frens to be honest with me too, but well, sometimes my ego can't help but wail, " Spare me the ugly truth"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well there is a small but important distinction in lying....the most acceptable type is white lies when u do it to spare someone or to maneuver out of a situation u know can not be maneuver out of by telling truth.....<br><br>then theres the lie with no reason type ...got nothing to say to that...<br><br>Hey JORAEN.....maybe you can ermemebr one of the clues from BARDS TALE.....<br><br>"Lie with Passion and be Forever Damned"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the best way is to lie with your eyes and your face. If not, that when telling a lie, don't embelish it too much. A lot of people make mistakes by adding a lot of fiction that it sounds ridiculous. Sandwich the lie between two truths will make it easier to swallow. Or if you're like me, instead of lying, do the sin of omission. Don't tell the whole truth unless you have no choice.<br><br>Lying is not good but at times necessary. I will not hesitate to lie if it would get me out of awkward situations or if I wish to avoid telling the truth. Sometimes it is a subconscious thing that happens without thinking.<br><br>Everyone lies, even me.<br><br>Just my two cents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometime back, I did mentioned about the term "conscience".<br><br>To lie or not to lie, it really depends on yourself, what your values are.<br><br>However, I do agree that once you get into this vicious cycle(of lying), you'll find yourself lying again and again to cover up your previous lies. I deemed it to be a drug, and addicts are die-hard.<br>And I don't encourage drug-abuses.<br><br>I think if there's something that you can't say it, just don't say it. Be honest about it(that you do not wish to say it). You have the right to keep your own privacy. Just like the right to say no to drugs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>-shrug- trying to find out... but well, is that the point? Since I have said out the truth anyway, but if he/she chose not to believe me, -shrug- dunno what to do anyway. Even if I go and find out why, will it change the situation? anyway, I don't wish to remember painful memories. -shrug- don't feel like talking about this for a while. Good luck for those who haven't mastered the art of lying. One day you will find it useful.
