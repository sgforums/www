Oh come off it, we all wish to live in peace in our own countries..meaning Malays in OUR Malay Archipelago, Indians in India, Chinese in China and other foreign scum in their own rubbish tip. Now how unfair could that be? To our beloved chinese and Indian friends, feel free to stay as long as you wish. We Malays of a sovereign and cultured race will never fail to welcome you, as according to our adat. But let it be known...the main point is you are in OUR home and by virtue of that, it absolutely makes no point to argue about how this country will never succeed if not due to a certain race or a certain figure or a certain political party. All that arguements are worthless as the overriding factor is the fact you all are IMMIGRANTS and the desecendants of IMMIGRANTS and will continue to breed the spawn of IMMIGRANTS. So, feel free to stay but don't make yourself at home. And..oh yeah..its useless to derisively refer to the Malay race as this or as that..Its of no importance to us. We certainly dont need to be told how to run our household do we? So before you open your mouth or type that rich-parents-bought-computers of yours, reflect on your not so ancient history and discover who your forefathers are. And while you're at it, do read the Singapore Statuettes and open wide your slant eyes on what is refered to in the CONSTITUTION who is considered the INDIGENOUS race here in Singapore. And..one last parting friendly reminder...We Malays are reknowned for our hospitality..but look up your Dictionary and look up the word AMOK. Don't let this word become an adjective..oh I forgot.

PAP is the malay singaporean last line of defence...unite we will remove PAP from singapore , then 350,000 malays will know their fate... they better pray very hard ... God would have shown mercy ... we wont.. period<br><br>+<br><br>PAP-4-EVER said...<br><br>LOL Remove of PAP? What a joke! You must be smoking crack. More like the PAP will remove you and you better pray very hard they don't put you in a jail cell with a big horny guy who will help you get in touch with your femanine side.<br><br>+<br><br>And about removal of PAP. Im sure u have your own thoughs, but they are rather retarded. Do u even know y they are there in the 1st place? And do u know y they are reelected election after election? I don't think u can comprehend this using your pea sized-coconut head. If u need to know, just go ask some sane un biased adult. They will start talking to u about 1965 and how PAP has only half the seats then, about how the other party withdrew, about how PAP has done a great job. I'd bet u didn't know a tiny bit of PAP's history, not to even say the inner workings of the party, as well as their contributions.<br><br>All u ever do is post things in a extremely lazy manner (As Dr Mahathir has said) and do not say anything to justifly yourself (probaly unable to say anything due to your limited vocab). I think even Christian preachers are better than u. At least they try to explain their cause.<br><br>And finally, eye for an eye and the whole world goes blind. U are no different from those racist posters. I think alot of people will be keeping a close eye on this site. As soon as a racist remark has been passed, the authorities will be knocking on your door.<br><br>You can continue to post for all i care. The next time i see a "4th" blogger charged and if he is a malay, I know he's u. Then i'll laff at how retarded u are posting this shit.<br><br>+ man i thought chinapork was a real racist site, now i realise its full of humor (to the brim too)</div>
