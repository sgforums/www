            <div class='col-md body'>Having a Strong SAF is like having a gun with 1 bullet against 2 or 3 thugs. you cannot kill them all but u can deter them from making the first move. We may not be able to take them all but surely not a problem to take 1 down with us, who will be so stupid to attack and get killed while the other 2 thugs benefit. The strong emphasis on our Armed forces is just to act as a deterrent. Nothing beats peace and harmony.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read quite through most of the thread and find that quite a number of spore citizen will try to run away or surrender when war in spore start! In the past,I 'm also think that way! But I change my mentality and decide to stay in spore to defend it when war comes! Why?<br><br>1st- I'm not rich man(at least 10 million dollars).When war comes,airplane will only reserve for all MP and rich businessman like Sim wong fu,Kenny Yap to escape. Spore air space will be tightly control by the state! If u r thinking of trying to escape by sea is even worse! When yr ship travelling up north of spore to South China sea,trying to escape to HK or China! U will encounter the RMN and it will sink yr ship before if gets out of Pedra Branca!<br><br>If u decided to go north west to India from Strait of Malacca,laggi worst.Yr ship will sink by both TNI ship and RMN ship and u can say sayonara!<br><br>Finally,the last route u want to go is Australia! Unthinkable! Before u can pass through Indonesia sea and reach Australia,u will either kill by TNI-navy or Indonesia pirates!<br><br>2nd-If u decide to surrender,I think is the worst option! When u have guns.U don't want to shoot at them and rather give it them.Once they have yr guns,they will slaughter u first then rape yr woman! Take away all yr properties,make yr future generation their slave forever!<br><br>Unless u have a great plan for poor and middle-class spore to escape safely when war start! U think spore gov so stupid,let every tom-dick harry sporean take airplane to siam war.If not, I will pick up my gun and fight until my last breadth!<br><br>Think carefully before u say u will not defend spore when war start!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>few pointers :<br><br>we are not here to debat on why we wana go to war. but in case n matter wat reason, the govt call on us to defend our country i will do so no matter who we are fighting. this is the only country we have, if we give up, you might give up your family and loves one.<br><br>i share some view that most NSmen just wana past time. i was once a regular, i also wana finish my contract and fxxx off. and i did. it comon to have such feeling whether regular or NSmen because we are not motivated to fight as we all know end of the day, just training. but when the day come for us to fight matter of life and dead, protect your family, wife and gf, i bet most of you will stand out like a man.<br><br>on nuclear war scenerio, i dont think singapore will face nuclear war scenerio as our neighbouring country at this stage doesnt have such capability. if we go to war, only 2 country would ever attack us and we know better who they are. this is just a scenerio, as i mention before to survive i agree that we need food and water that why we cant sit still and fight the war on our front. we need to bring the war to their front meaning, we take land from them to increase the area of coverage and protect their arti from shelling singapore.<br><br>i am from the sea, i did exercise with them b4, their skill and weaponary sucks.<br>airforce is no problem what i worry is whether our army NSmen can do the job. which i believe we can.<br><br>dont flame anyone for putting down their idea, anyway just a scenerio, not complaining why we go to war but rather in case if we go war, would you stand out and fight like a men. everyone scare of dieing in peace time, but when the time to fight come, hero in ourselves will step out.<br><br>glad that ppl are responding well to this thread though and expressing their own opinion.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When a war breaks out, it will not be sudden but rather some escalation of events leading to war. When that escalation happens, i do not think SAF will sit around but rather strike first.<br><br>A war to break out should come as a surprise. A surprise attack will not be diplomatically accepted internationally (Iraq-Kuwait).<br><br>When SAF strikes, i do have confidence (IN THEORY) that SAF should be able to repel or overcome its aggressors. But i am really concerned with the mentality of its soldiers.<br><br>Will NSmen stay? Will people see MO/downgrade when battle's coming?<br><br>At the battlefront, are they brave enough to face bullets flying against them?<br><br>I have been thinking this.... if the enemy abducts or captures 1-5 soldiers. Behead them, dismember their limbs, take their internal organs....  throw these dismembered bodies parts back to Singapore soldiers....  can they stomach the sight? It will really demoralise them especially when singaporeans nowadays are not exposed to animal slaughtering other than Biology lessons in secondary schools.</div>

We will help to defend our neighbours if they are under attacked by those japanese soldiers or other soldiers...just like world war 2. Basically our country's interests is in our neighbours. They perish, we perish.<br><br>If they cannot see that and want to build a crooked bridge...then I'm afraid that it will be difficult for them to retreat to Singapore should they fail to defend their own country.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, I would love to see our army used in concert with our neighbours as an integrated ASEAN defence force if there was ever any conflict which threatens us as a whole.But the worry is that in that scenario, we might become the spearhead against the hypothetical enemy, due to our technological prowess.In any case, a good deterrent force will help to let our nieghbours think twice before they try to pull any stunts on us.</div>
