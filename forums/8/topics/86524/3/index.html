My opinion may be wrong, but there is no need to curse me like tat. You keep claiming like u are sort of protector or sumthing. Tell ya, action speaks louder than words, make sure u don't freak out when the time comes. I came across alot of pple who say say but in the end cannot do or freak out.</div>
