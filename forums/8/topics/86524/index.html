We will most probably lose coz most pple will be running away.<strong> Most</strong> of the Singaporean youngsters serving NS has only the mentality the clear NS as soon as possible. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fighting a war is not equal NS training</span></strong>. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If a war really breaks out, do you think most of us got the guts to fight if we knew lots of sacrifices will be made no matter whether we win or we lose.</span></strong><br><br>Also Weapon technology is only a small factor in an outcome of a war. Singaporeans' determination and morale made up the major factor here.<br>Also regarding the part where u differ tat we are too small, you are absolutely wrong. Yes we are small, but the problem is we are TOO small. Thats the natural fact. We maybe able to defend for a few days.  But how bout our food supplies?? Don't forget that Singapore food resources depends on neighbouring countries. And War is not a thingy tat ends in one day. War usually last at least a week. Depending on the situation it may last more. Soon our supplies will be deprived. While they can still refill their resources.<br><br>Also the part u mention bout rebuilding after the war, LOL u tok as though war is a simple task to do in your school. Do you know how much physical pain and emotional pain it will bring to the pple. If u really mention about rebuilding, then u can forget it, coz while rebuilding, they will bring another force to finish us once and for all. They have a huge population compared to us and they can regroup in a instant. While we don't have enough pple to defend as most of us will be badly injured or dead.<br><br>I don't know why you have the confidence to say Singapore can fight Malaysia and Indonesia at the same time. But don't forget War does not rely on theory and weapons alone. <strong>The best scenerio is we don't fight a war</strong>. Singaporeans mentality and will to fight is the main factor here. If we let our neighbouring countries know tat we are prepared to fight, a war will not start coz most probably they will be afraid to fight us high morale singaporeans + modern weapons and they will aso pay a price. But if it is the otherwise, they will fight us coz they knew tat sooner or later we will fall.<br><br>I used an example in the three kingdoms era history. I hate repeating these but i see this as a gd example. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Zhuge Liang helping Liubei defending Xinye which is a small city which is like Singapore compared</span></strong>. Cao Cao send 100 thousand troops to invade Xinye as Cao Cao not happy to see Liubei face. Zhuge Liang manage to defeat Cao Cao troops with least casualites with his great tactics, well trained troops and modern weapons in tat time (i think is 3-3 way-crossbow). After the defeat, Cao Cao <strong>DU LAN </strong>liao. <strong>He send 500 thousand troops from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">his whole big territory which is like Malaysia </span>compared</strong>. This time Zhuge Liang told Liubei that the soldiers are tired due to the previous encounter and they are too tired for the next one which is greater in numbers. Zhuge Liang told Liubei: "it is useless and unnecessary to fight the war to sacrifice our soldiers if we can't win this war at all, Xinye is too small to defend and not enough pple, we need to abandon this city and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">move our pple </span>to jingzhou and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">seek help in the south</span> with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sun quan (indonesia).</span><br><br>By looking at the above example, we should realised that no use fighting a war if u need to sacrifice a lot of pple which in the end makes pple hate you and leave u.<br><br>Reyes, i hope u are not the one who always think violence can solve all problems, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">if u are the one who thinks that war is easy to fight with no consequences, i hope by tat time u are not a high rank military commander in any sort or leader in any form for Singapore coz most probably u will propose for war if given a choice and mark my words i will want u down.</span></strong> Think of the pple that will be sacrificed and suffered in a war. Rebuilding is bullshit if almost all pple are killed, your relatives, friends, loved ones are killed. Whos cares about defending and rebuilding if pple u cared died.? Imagine Singapore still exists but left only a few pple but the ground is filled with corpses and blood. And u see ur loved ones are in there.<br><br></div>
