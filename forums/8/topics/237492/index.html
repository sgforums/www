They're mainly situated in the North East of England. The Chav phenomenon is an exclusive Northern British sub-culture. What do you mean by benefit collecting?<br><br>Do you mean on the 'doll'. If so, yes, most of them tend to claim monetary and housing benefits off the government.  As Magaret Thatcher once said ' The fatherless lone parent families are married to the state...the state is a nanny state'. I quite agree with her, don't you?<br><br>But your description of a 'chavette' is pretty accurate however you have missed out 'foul-mouthed and promiscuous' as intrinsic attributes that are integral to classify them as part of the Chav Community. Oh! Accent as well, they tend to have thicker accents, with tendencies of changing simple words such as 'about' to 'aboot' and 'you' to 'ye'.<br><br>Unfortunately I live in the North East of England, I know a lot about a chavers...nearly turned into one myself haha<br><br>Though directing back to your suggestion, with UK's Human Rights and human trafficking laws it would be extremely hard to export one of them out of England.</div>
