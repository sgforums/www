            <div class='col-md body'>sgforums. See which of the clones gets on my nerves.<br><br>Actually I am thinking of how to get back at this classmate who ride on everyone's work for the past 2 years and got through the course. And she would b!tch around and claim she done the most and everyone was so unhelpful. Actually, she's the lier and the one who created issues for others and many people who worked with her confirmed her attitude and lies. Anyways, I've come to the conclusion and chua is a bad chua (further salnder she works for roche as sales, so ppl beware). She shadows some girl who took her B!tchin' anger on little old me (how convenient - cause actually I am non confrontational. No one wants to ruin a relationship) but decide never to take action against the perpetrator. (what a stupid b!tch! But I realise my friendship to her must worth nothing to her. Besides she a Fuckin' rich man's housewife who do MBA just for fun.)<br><br>Similarly, another incident happen which I was left out of a particular meeting but then my chiobu team lead had always leave me out of meetings so that she gets exposure which makes it easy for her to thumb me down (This is not the first time, but I used to be a nice person and not attend meetings to embarass her). So that particular meeting came to my attention through a 3rd party who invited me along. Imagine the embarassment and shock. Opps she did it again must be her theme song and explained afterwards why she left me out and kept communications on these meetings to herself and herself only. (Again, isn't thoughfully convenient. I suppose I was not a threat, but now I've become angry and loud, I am someone she cannot just ignore. So therefore she came about to explain heself loh. Right... I am stupid...hmmm...) So... what should I actually do. Like I theorize, being nice ain't gonna make my life easy, being bad ain't goona make my life any worse off. If I am going down for this, hey, so should she. Its not a matter of face because she never gave me any anywas until I got angry (but its too late cause her previous bad treatement made my bad side come out full force) but a matter of doing the right thing.<br><br>For these things, perhaps in your opinion, its not worth getting angry. Perhaps you are not in my shoes nor do you know me. But I do give many chances each time before I draw on my conclusion. This is based on 2.5 years of studies and 4 years of work within the same company, that I now summarise..<br>So ladies and gentlemen, in your future work, please do not let people take you for a ride, do not ride on others, and do not allow people to get away getting countless free rides out of you. Life gets complicated here on.<br><br></div>
