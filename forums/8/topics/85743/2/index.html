            <div class='col-md body'>reminded me of an incident pretty similar to yun's.<br><br>it took place in quanzhou, fujian province. i ran out of renminbi and decided to go to the nearest atm and withdraw some cash. but in china, only bank of china's atm can be used wif visa credit cards, and the nearest one was abt 20 mins walk away from my hotel.<br><br>the atm was juz along a busy street where there's a lot of ppl.<br><br>i withdrew RMB1000 (abt S$200) and the moment i left the atm and quickly put in the cash in my pocket, i was approached by a mother and daughter, and were carrying those big red-blue-white bags.<br><br>they politely asked if i can lend my hp and use or not. i asked them where they wanna call to, and they said they wanna call home in anhui province. they said they ran out of money and wanna call home to remit the money over to them. fine, i'm using the prepaid sim card from china mobile and left less than RMB10 worth, so out of sympathy, i lend them my hp.<br><br>the daughter dialled a number and spoke quite loudly over the phone in some kinda dialect i couldnt understand. but i kept watch on her, fearing that she might run away wif my hp.<br><br>while the daughter was calling, the mother chatted up wif me, thanking me for being kind-hearted, asked me if i'm a local, i said no, asked where my home is, i said shanghai... dont dare to say i'm s'porean.<br><br>after abt 3 mins, the daughter ended the phonecall and passed me back my hp. they thanked me for lending me my hp and requested to have my hp number so that they can contact me and return me the phone charges.<br><br>i said no need becoz i'll be leaving quanzhou the next day and i turned away. but they insisted to do so, and i told them say it's only a very small amt and they need not go thru the trouble to return.<br><br>i turned and left again, and the daughter pulled me back. she said they dont have any cash wif them now and they have no place to stay and havent had dinner yet.<br><br>i told them i cant be of much help and tried to leave. they kept pulling me back as i wanted to make an escape, asking me to spare them some cash for accom and a meal.<br><br>straightaway can tell it's a con job, and i brushed away their grasp and left quickly. they followed behind and begged, "qiu qiu ni, xing xing hao. bang bang wo men mu nÃ¼ ba!"<br><br>i quicken my pace and can tell that they were trying to catch up. unfortunately to them, they have huge baggages wif them and finally gave up on the chase.</div>
