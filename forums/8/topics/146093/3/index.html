            <div class='col-md body'>Burning paper money is definitely not a buddhist practise. Buddhism is teaching of the Buddha which highlight on moral, self-discipline, prayers (chanting) &amp; meditation &amp; so on. But of Buddhism practises are mix with taoism when it was spread to China long time ago.<br><br>Originally taoism highlight more on the law of nature - the creation of feng shu, I ching &amp; the T'ung shu (Ancient chinese alamanac) In fact if we study the alamanac carefully, some of the taoism practise have scientific prove, as in human psychology(beliefs/spiriture.enegry) &amp; the surrounding Nature/*geography). --- All about communication, proceedures, rules, *relationship between human, nature, spirit(s) &amp; God(s). It hv been recorded from few thousand of years ago, before the born of Christ.<br><br>Buring paper money is one thing, if u do not believe in what u are doing, probably it doesn't work. Same goes if u r praying to God. In spiriture sense - "believing" is a kind of "enegry" that link &amp; contributes to the existence of<br>the spiriture "worlds". Chinese taoism believe when a person dies his or her spirit (enegry) will stay on for a few days on the living world b4 proceeding to the "world of hell" for judgement. The "story" goes on... too long to write it here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I.e. Animals have no religion, so they are under the mercy of the Law of Mother Nature - one of the law is "fittest survive".<br><br>There are so many religion in the world, sometimes what to believe in can be confusing to some people. It really up to individual. At the end of the day, whatever u believe if u 'feel' that ur religion have help u to become a better person, this is the most important. Spread and prove it to people if u want,<br>but don't ever condemn other people's religion.<br><br>(I am not sure about this burning joss stick and paper money, it MAY also link to Confucius during the Ching Dynasty (A.D.1644-1911) this practise is also used for imperial ceremony purposes)<br><br>u guys may visit <strong>www.spi.com.sg</strong> there are some truth, but not totally, again it is up to individual. Just keep an open mind to all things in life. Whether which God we believe in, HE would not want to see us whacking one another over Him.<strong></strong></div>

Even by nature itself, during hot weather, which large area of forest caught fire by itself - This is part of the nature.<br><br>Then again, if we think &amp; observe carefully the *purposes of burning joss sticks or paper money is more related to spiriture beliefs, as in respecting the dead, maybe a culture or tradition practice. One day every one of us will die remember not necessary by old age, what happen if the other "world" really exists.<br><br>I am more concern about the economic pollution the *purposes due to people's constant craving for higher standard of living. How much waste &amp; gases is generated in a city like Singapore in 1 day.
