The explanation for the destruction of  the tripods were at its best, lame. I do not deny the movie really got me interested as it progresses on but the ending is truly disappointing. To think the explanation was done by a narrator in 3 or 4 sentences, i think thats trying to pull a fast one.<br><br>All's well ends well. But not in this movie.</div>
