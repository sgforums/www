            <div class='col-md body'>War of the Worlds (a preview from Rolling Stone)<br><br>Cloned from the Martian Invasion in the 1898 H G Wells Novel and the 1953 film version, this updated spin gives director Steven Spielberg another close encounter with aliens.  Trust Spielberg to give his pal Lucas a run for the grosses, especially here with the ETs decidedly unfriendly and the mother ship firing death rays.  It helps big time to have Tom Cruise in the star spot, playing a New Jersey dockyard worker and divorced dad who uses the invasion to bond with his estranged kids (Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin). Tim Robbins plays the astronomer who tries to predict what will happen next.  I predict a box office north of $250 million.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>i love Rolling Stone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with octega. It doesnt matter whether you read the book or not. When a movie is shown, you should assume that no one has read the book and explain as clearly as possible. It is not a matter of whether you read the book and whether you are showing respect to this classic, it is just a matter of a movie badly ended.  Like someone here said, most people knew the ending of shows of Star Wars or LOTR or whatever... does it mean then, the movie can just show the ending with the narrator in just 3 or 4 sentences? I then think that is doing injustice to the book, not us.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I think the main focus of the movie was never really the ending really, it was just following the story through to it's conclusion. This is one of those movies where the focus is on the journey, not the conclusion as per normal hollywood storytelling eg. Spiderman faces off Dr. Octopus or Daredevil vs. Kingpin.<br><br>If anything was the climax, it was the short sequence where that platoon took out the tripod, which is more of a symbolic representation of the end of the invasion (they were invincible previously), rather then the neatly presented, force fed thing we expected from hollywood.<br><br>Also, I suspect the director decided to follow the book's anticlimatic ending rather then to make a summer blockbuster presentation of the ending for the simple reason that this is a representation of the classic novel, and in the future when all the hooha has died down and people view it in its context against the novel, that's the kind of movie greatness that will go a long way, rather then the short-term pleasing of the audience, which should be getting more from this show then just blockbuster kicks anyway, which was more of the intent of this movie in the first place.<br><br>I could argue that movies like Black Hawk Down had anticlimatic endings as well, they just ran out... but that's what makes them compelling, they are the "this is the way it is" movies. Of course, the person who watches the movie with the intention of seeing how the martians will die will be dissapointed, for they weren't really the focus of the movie at all... The War of The World really focuses on the human characters, and certainly they did conclude ther critique of humanity rather well. The martians were more of the plot device to conduct that critique.<br><br>Sorry if it seems I have been thinking too much about this movie, but it was a thought-provoking experience for me... I wonder how it would have felt to be in such a situtation were we are just the maggots to be crushed.</div>

I've read till the middle of the book and still the people are just rushing and running. No sight of the stupid aliens.<br><br>Sigh... I like science fiction but this is like a english literature book.  I expected some blood, gore and fighting or something. I like the story 'The Tripods' and that's a triology. I wish someone do a movie on that. There was a serial done on this during my school days on the tripods but I doubt many people heard of it.<br><br></div>

It doesnt matter whether you read the book or not. When a movie is shown, you should assume that no one has read the book and explain as clearly as possible. It is not a matter of whether you read the book and whether you are showing respect to this classic, it is just a matter of a movie badly ended.  Like someone here said, most people knew the ending of shows of Star Wars or LOTR or whatever... does it mean then, the movie can just show the ending with the narrator in just 3 or 4 sentences? I then think that is doing injustice to the book, not us.</div></blockquote>its doing it justice. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
