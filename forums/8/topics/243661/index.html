            <div class='col-md body'>Chanakya is not just an organizational genius. You may be surprised to know that he was responsible for all of Nanda Dynasty and also was responsible for being an obstacle to Alexander's march. He is a king maker and got two kings of Maurya dynasty rule the larger part of India then known as Magadh.<br><br>I understand Sun Tzu on the contrary is War General, (I stand corrected if this is not so)<br><br>Chanakya has written a lot of about accountancy and wealth management and investmet policies which Sun Tzu has not attempted.<br><br>Singapore government looks more like following Chanakya tactics than Sun Tzu as they avoid war and use shrewd business tactics to get things going for the nation.<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>
