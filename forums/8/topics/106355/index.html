And talking about learning bike, do you think you need to learn how to shift the gears before moving at a higher speed? If so, you will most likely start off with low gear/low speed right?

            <div class='col-md body'>i used to ride a bike too many years ago. And are you suggesting that all new bicycle/bike learners should start off with high speed moving in order to learn how to handle the bicycle/bike well? But before that.. do you think they are able to do it especially when they have no experience with riding? I don't think so. More like they will buang...All learners start off with low speed moving and that simply requires balancing skill no matter ithey are on bike/bicycle.  That's also physics....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I have never seen learner going at a high speed the first time they got onto the bike/bicycle.<br><br></div>
