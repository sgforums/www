            <div class='col-md body'>when the time (breaking up)is here, there is no escape or hiding from it. the best strategy will be a direct confrontation. the most apparent indicaction that a relationship is going nowhere happens when u tend to fight over trivial things...<br><br>face it. when u need to end it all, do it frankly and not wif any lame excuses which will set the other party questioning  ur 'excellent' reasons and often these 'excellent' reasons will have a devastating result on the other party..<br><br>my ex-gf came up wif the world's 'best' excuses when she initiated the breakup.( not that i'm cursing her as i was dumped by her.) <strong>reason 01: her father doesn't reali think highly of me as i came from a neighbourhood sch.(so wat?) reason 02 : ex-gf doesn't like my mum and sis.. to compound this, she even passed bad remarks about my mum which reali perturbs me.</strong> till now, she and i are not on talking terms... ( she will live to regret for coming up wif all those lame excuses wifout using her cerebrum.haha~)<br><br>cheers..<br><br>------------------<br><br>who else but me......<br><br>[This message has been edited by fingers (edited 08-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If u told all ur friends and her friends u both broke up b4 her.. I all i can say is the guys is a total BASTARD.. How can a guy do someting like that.. It will ruin the friendship that might b there. Just cause u can't be partners doesn't mean u can't b friends. And all your friends will find out the truth sooner or later and will think less of u for it. And u might lose friends over it..<br><br>Not that i'm saying any1 is doing that..<br>Just my 2 cents worth.. Not that it counts much..<br><br>But up front is the best way.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh... why bring such a sad topic of breakup into this lively newsgroup? Anyway ForeVer, you're quite true, gals are usually better at such things.<br><br>The best way to settle the whole thing is to sit down (no phone calls pleaz!), talk it over a cup of coffee (Coffee Beans?) and settle the whole problem once and for all. Well, at least both of u know where the problem lies and when u're into yur next relationship, u wouldn't make the same old mistake.<br><br>As for gals, I wouldn't quite approve of some of their 'BU' (BreakUp) methods.<br><br>I had this ex who had ditched me for another seemingly richer guy a few years ago, I was just another staff working in this MNC then. (Could only take the public transport then)Well, she didn't even bother to explain and clear things up but simply said that I offered no sense of $ecurity (get the hint?) to her. I was furious initally... but I had gained some 'advantage'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> from a guys point of view (guys u would know what I mean, no little stuff like petting but even bigger things  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I won't say it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">). Kinda pervert huh? Anyway that's the only way I could get back at her. Sigh...<br><br>Well, recently my ex called me up and wanted to patch things up with me. It seems that that rich guy had fallen out with his family and left home without a cent in his pocket. Thank god my GM was wonderful enough to send me overseas, if not, I wouldn't be capable enough to takeover his post when he retired.<br><br>Only said three words to her before cutting off all forms of communication to her:<br><br>FUCK U, UNDERSTAND?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"We will still be frens" tot that's the standard "comfort-yur-ex" line after initiating a breakup?<br><br>I dun deny the fact tat some pple do it so that they can continue making use of their ex even after the relp ends. But then I also feel that a previous relp can make the basis for a great frenship. Imagine, both of u have been through so many good times and bad, confided in each other yur fears and frustrations, share the joy and laughter. There's already a deep understandin between the two of u. The only difference after the breakup would be tat there's no romantic sparks involved.<br><br>This only holds through for those couples who mutually accept the fact of breakup though. So if one party still holds any hopes or grudges agst the other (as is often the case), I dun think its possible that a great frenship can come out of it either.<br><br>Remember the good times not the bad<br>The laughter and romance we once shared<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Fingers, it's alright if u say that my ex deserves it. Looking back, I sure kinda enjoyed putting her down. U can say anything abt her as I hate her to the core!<br><br>Seriously, this 'we can still be friends' is just a comfort line to those gulible people out there. This line sucks and is a feeble attempt to salvage whatever is left of a broken down stall. In my point of view, almost nothing is left once a relationship is gone. Unless both parties are willing to keep up this 'friendship' stuff (which I doubt will last too long either).<br><br>Of course, as what dLaNoDcAm has said some keep in touch with u juz to make use of u. If at any point u saw thru their plot juz give them the 'three-word-treatment' as I gave to my ex.<br><br>True Frienz are alright but make-use is a no-no.

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, I think I'm a little late with my thoughts... Anyway, just something I feel.<br>1. Always talk face to face, and choose a not so public spot [especially not void deck]. You dun want the whole neighbourhood to know that you broke up with your bf/gf and cry in front of everyone.<br><br>2. Dun go for personal attacks, especially the person you're breaking up with. You can make lame excuses that the mother is not supportive, etc... but try to make it seem as if the cause of the breakup is the fault of the mother.<br><br>3. If there's a 3rd party, dun deny [unless there is a risk of your bf/gf going to disturb the 3rd party or throwing a drink in your face when you're out dating].<br><br>4. Always say "We can still be frens", even if you dun mean it. But try to sound sincere.<br><br>There is no best strategy...every breakup is sad... This is what I have come up with</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Face to Face will often result in either party sort of begging n crying to take back the words. I prefer to do it on the phone or through email. At least, u will b able to express ur true feelings n words without the other party staring at u.<br><br>I think the best breakup is to get her a gift, something that u like rather than the other party. Fold a paper ring with the words sorrie n the number of yrs, months, days, hrs, mins that has spent together. Send a DHL of the gift to her house.</div>
