            <div class='col-md body'>Hate to break the bubble but I feel that it is almost impossible for a guy and a ger to remain as very good friends, without either one party developing feelings of some sort at some point in time during the friendship. This is especially so if the guy is a very strong emotional support for the gers. Coz usually it's the gers who will develop such feelings. The reason why such friendship can still continue is becoz most choose to surpress those feelings, which may get eroded as time goes by or when they meet other members of the opposite sex.<br>For those who have such platonic frens. Ask urself have u ever have the slightest feeling that u may have fallen for him/her? Or ask ur fren whether he/she has ever fallen for u at all throughout the frenship? Dun deny, answer truthfully.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Iz definitely possible.... I used to think iz not possible until I become closer to a female churchmate... she is 4 yrs younger than me, same height as me and have the same interests as me... we often go out together but we have no crush or electric sparks between us... we are just very close and we can share our problems... even she admits she cannot think wat it will be like if we become a pair and she admits its impossible and gives the yucks expression and personally, I oso dun think iz possible for the relationship to go further... maybe iz bcause she not good looking... hehe  :p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>seifer:<br>Your reply is actually the same idea that was runnig through my head. I don't think (any more) that a guy and a girl can just be good friends without other thoughts entering their heads at SOME point in the relationship. I think this will have to occur especially if the two of them are very close and do everything together - hell they night as well be a couple!<br><br>shiok:<br>you raise an interesting angle to the thread. When you said that your friend is not good-looking, is that the only reason why the two of you can remain as good friends? what if she was absolutely a babe, then will you fall for her?<br>Same thing goes for girls - if your guy friend was a super-hunk, and you knew that other girls were after him, and the two of you were sooooo close all the time, would that make it harder to stay just platonic?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyah.. its very very very very possible for guys and gals to be very good friends. I just think that its the way the majority of our society thinks, that if a guy and a girl are on good terms, they have to be gf and bf.<br>Hai.. wondering if i'm making sense again.</div>
