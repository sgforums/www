            <div class='col-md body'>Well, one classic example...ME! Well, how do you think that I can go around flirting like nobody business then? Because the girls know and I know that we are just friends and all of it is just in the name of fun. You just got to know how to respect them as a friend and they will treat you like one. But if you even have thoughts that he/she could be a possible BF/GF then you will act differently. It is a sub-consicious act or behaviour that you dun even control, you might unknowing throw him/her the type of gaze only admirers give. (Me exception, I can summon that gaze anytime, I am trained, the girls can vouch for that.) A lady standing  beisde me just said, (this is true and not made up) "I have many good friends that are guys!"<br><br>Well, it is not so much a matter of whether it is possible, because it has always been possible, but more a matter of how easily do you fall in love? If you fall in love at the slightest hint of compatibility then I suppose it would almost be impossible.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i guess its a pretty difficult thing to do..as in to be able to be good friends with a girl if ur a guy.. we all know whats gona happen..somehow or rather. even if it doesnt, im sure we have at least thought about it, even if its fer fraction of a second. Its not impossible either but sometimes its just too difficult due to our upbringing and our society.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why not?<br>personally, I have a habit of making close female friends. Much more than male friends.<br><br>Problems of misunderstanding? Indeed possible. I avoided such problems as I'm equally nice to all of them (well...almost all...) and they know that the chances of me and most of them making it as a couple is probably astronomical.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think what Callan says is very true. I mean if both of you know that you 2 are gonna be friends and nothing more, then, chances are you guys are gonna stay that way. If not, then something may happen.<br><br>Then again, Velocity has a point in that it is difficult to be just friends, especially really close ones. Most of us are more eastern in our ways of thinking. The reason I say that is that, we view relationships, among other things, different from the westerners. Take for instance, if you're married and later get divorced, would you still be friend with the person? I can say that most of us, if not all, won't do that. Maybe not a good example, but I do hope you know what I'm getting at.<br><br>I have the fortune of having a really close friend who's a girl (or misfortune for nothing more than that  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ). But I think it's just might as well. You can't really have a relationship without the 'feel', know what I'm saying?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks for the replys guys. I agree that boys and girls can and should be comfortable being just friends on a platonic level, and I must say that when I was friends with this girl, we had the best times together. There was so much we had in common, and the best part was how comfortable we were with everything. I would tell her stuff that i hadn't told anyone else, and she would do the same.<br><br>I guess though it may have been my fault as well that things fell apart coz we became so close that people began to talk about us being an item. I think that may have gotten to her head and she may have felt that i wanted something more from us.<br><br>Besides, the best way to maintain a good relationship with your partner is to be friends, and hopefully even best friends. So naturally this would have been the best stepping stone to a relationship huh?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hrm.. I do believe that its possible for a boy and a girl just to be good frens. When I was in the states studying, my best friend was a guy named Brad and no, we did not end up being bf and gf.<br>I don't know why, but sometimes I feel that its easier to tell certain guys some stuff that I do not usually tell my girlfriends, such as relationship problems.

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm... i do believe that that guys and gals can be good frens if they work at keeping it that way... but they are not careful and do not make a big effort to keep a comfortable distance, things may get complicated. something like that just happened to me. i kinda fell for a fren of 8 years and told her so. then things started to get really complicated and now i have no idea what is happening. she is starting to treat me real weird and stuff. maybe i should never have risked it, huh?<br><br>anyway, i still have a lot of close galfrens and i find that with the exception of my best fren whom i have known for 12 years, all my really close frens are gals. they say that i am really east to talk to. wonder if i am lucky or not to be a "fren" kinda guy?<br><br>hmm... goes back into meditation on the mystery of women...

            <div class='col-md body'>Peiyi:<br>You said.....<br><br>"I don't know why, but sometimes I feel that its easier to tell certain guys some stuff that I do not usually tell my girlfriends, such as relationship problems. Its like the girls will just sympathise with you, but the guys actually give valuable advice."<br><br>I agree with you completely. Many of my female friends have said the exact same thing to me. They agree that sometimes telling guys stuff they know that they won't bitch about them behind their backs. Rather guys will be more inclined to analyse and take in what they say and give advice - it may not always be good advice, but it will still be advice!!<br><br>This works the same way with guys too. Some things you just can't tell your guy friends, but you can tell your girl friends. Maybe its a macho thing but we can't help it.<br><br>I guess its because we can become so close to our friends of the opposite sex that things may eventually move on to another level. Sometimes it may seem that they understand you better than your gf/bf, and this is bad territory if you want to stay platonic<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sleek,<br>if you don't mind me asking, what's the mystery about this one woman in your life? I've long given up hope of solving the mystery about women. Just the fact that there's mystery about them is the reason why they are so goddamn attractive, and consume so much of our thinking time!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's kinda cute.. but when I was in Pri 4, a gal told me she like me.. but too bad I like someone else then (sounds a bit too young.. hahaha). Still we remain contact for the past 14 years. Not exactly that often, but we do keep each other updated and sometimes tell each other our problems. Funny thing is she still remember the girl I liked when I was in pri sch.<br><br>Another weird thing is the girl I am crazy over now used to be my buddy for 2 years. We can tell each other anything under the sun, practically we know who the other person has crushes on and such. Now, things still doesn't change, we are still pretty frank with each other.. but we dun call each other buddy anymore. Dunno what is our relationship now also.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys and gals need not only be couple, there can be many type of friends. Some who treat you like buddy. Some who treat you like good friend, tell you their problems. Some who look for you if they need company. Some who can always ask you out for a meal or movie when free. Depend on how you handle the relationship. If you can handle relationship well, having many good friends (regardless of guys or gals) are good.</div>
