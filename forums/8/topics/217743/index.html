Starbucks alone earned almost <strong>$5.8 billion</strong> in net revenues during the first three quarters of 2006.<br><br>With as many as 15 million Ethiopians dependent on coffee, Ethiopia has decided to get its farmers more of what they deserve. The country's government has asked Starbucks to sign a licensing agreement that will allow Ethiopia to control the names of its coffees. That way, Ethiopia can help determine an export price that makes sure farmers see a larger share of the profits <strong>enabling them to feed their children, send them to school and get them better healthcare.</strong><br><br>Oxfam and a coalition of allies are asking Starbucks to sign this agreement. According to one coalition member, control of the name brands could <strong>increase Ethiopia's coffee export income by more than 25 percent - or $88 million</strong> annually. This money could go a long way to help lift millions of Ethiopians out of poverty.<br><br>So please, help us convince Starbucks to sign this agreement with Ethiopia. Poor farmers deserve a fair share of the profits.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Coffee debate: Oxfam v Starbucks<br><br>Oct 28 2006<br><br>After criticism of Starbucks' business policies earlier this week, Oxfam and the coffee chain put their cases<br><br>Western Mail<br><br>Together we can make Starbucks wake up and smell the coffee<br><br>THERE'S a story behind every cup of coffee you drink, and it's often one that would leave a bitter taste in your mouth if you knew about it. A case in point is the story that appeared this week revealing that Starbucks is opposing Ethiopian plans to trademark its most famous coffee names.<br><br>There's a real opportunity here for Ethiopia to capitalise - quite rightly - on the consistently high quality of its coffees by being able to trademark their coffee names and control how those names are used by others. If Starbucks can vigorously protect and make best use of its own globally recognised brand name, while at the same time making a big noise about selling the finest Ethiopian coffees, isn't there a whiff of hypocrisy in the air?<br><br>It's a pity, too, as Starbucks not only prides itself on its "mutually beneficial relationships with coffee farmers" but also has a history of doing more than most of its contemporaries to pay fairer prices to producers for their coffees. Indeed, Oxfam has worked with Starbucks as recently as two years ago on a project to benefit a coffee-growing community in Ethiopia.<br><br>The real shame, then, is that when it comes to promoting truly sustainable ways for poor farmers to work themselves out of poverty, Starbucks appears to be drawing the line at some very public gifts to projects in developing countries and a limited commitment to Fairtrade.<br><br>In the meantime, we have strong evidence it is working behind the scenes, using its power and influence to oppose this initiative so it can continue to charge up to Â£14 per pound for speciality Ethiopian coffees, while the farmers who supply that coffee earn between 30p and 59p for their crop. That is barely enough to cover production, let alone a single cup of Starbucks' "Black Apron Exclusive" luxury Ethiopian coffee.<br><br>There's a parallel here with another coffee giant, NestlÃ© , who attempted to force a compensation payment of about $6m out of the Ethiopian government four years ago. The justification for diverting money from the Ethiopian government to line the pockets of the world's biggest food company was slim at best. Back then, outrage was so great that the combined efforts of tens of thousands of ordinary people worldwide, with Oxfam, forced Nestl to back down.<br><br>The same can happen this time around. Starbucks can still make amends by signing a voluntary licensing agreement tabled by Ethiopia, which would recognise Ethiopia's ownership of its coffee names. It has to date failed to respond to this proposal, and coffee drinkers around the world - whether Starbucks customers or not - can help convince them to do this by taking action at www.maketradefair.com/starbucks right now. Together we can force them to wake up and smell the coffee.<br><br><a href="http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/features/tm_headline=coffee-debate--oxfam-v-starbucks&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=18006877&amp;siteid=50082-name_page.html" rel="nofollow">http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/features/tm_headline=coffee-debate--oxfam-v-starbucks&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=18006877&amp;siteid=50082-name_page.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oxfam Responds to National Coffee Association and Starbucks<br><br>In response to OxfamÂ’s announcement that global coffee giant Starbucks has opposed a plan by Ethiopia to gain more control over its coffee trade, Starbucks claimed that it has never filed an opposition to the Ethiopian government's trademark applications, nor claimed ownership to any names used to describe the origin of its coffees.<br><br>Oxfam responded by saying that Starbucks did prompt the National Coffee Association (NCA), of which it is a leading member, to file an opposition to the applications, which is the reason the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) gave for rejecting them. At a meeting held this past July at the Ethiopian Embassy, Embassy staff and advisers met with the NCA president to discuss a letter of protest filed against EthiopiaÂ’s trademark applications. Ethiopian Embassy staff asked the NCA President what had prompted the NCA to file the opposition after more than year of silence on the issue. The NCA President responded that Starbucks had just brought it to the NCA's attention.<br><br>It is therefore disingenuous for Starbucks to claim they were not responsible for the application being blocked. Ethiopian Embassy staff and Ron Layton of Light Years IP, a Washington DC-based intellectual property rights organization that is helping to advise the Ethiopian government, have gone on record with this.<br><br>Starbucks has also claimed that its investment in social development projects and micro-finance initiatives in coffee growing regions has been recognized for its leadership within the industry.<br><br>While Starbucks has taken some positive initial strides in this area, Oxfam thinks the company can do better. As a company that prides itself in such efforts, it is unclear why Starbucks would oppose EthiopiaÂ’s efforts to help its farmers realize a greater portion of the value their coffee commands on the international market<br><br>Intellectual property ownership makes up a huge proportion of the total value of world trade but rich countries and businesses capture most of this. Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee, and one of the poorest countries in the world, is trying to assert its rights and capture more value from its product. It should be helped, not hindered.<br><br>Oxfam continues to call on Starbucks to show leadership for other coffee companies by immediately recognizing Ethiopia's rights in this case and signing the licensing agreement that Ethiopia presented to the company in September, recognizing the countryÂ’s rightful ownership of its coffee names.<br><br><a href="http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=starbucks_10272006.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=starbucks_10272006.htm</a></div>
