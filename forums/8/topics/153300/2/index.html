I am quite a conservative person and there is a special kind of person like transsexual I will overeact also don't know why maybe due to my mentality of thinking??? I think the government somehow diswelcome those gays,lesbians and transsexual as they may spoil the society. Like those person mixing aorund with normal people and may get influenced to it??? <strong>So JennTS are you really a transsexual??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </strong></div>
