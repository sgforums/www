            <div class='col-md body'>god...no one here really knows how a ts girl really feels like.<br><br>so i was born male, okay? but in my heart i always knew im female. it has already been scientifically proven.<br><br><strong>Transsexual:</strong><br><br>A transsexual is a person who was born with a rare (roughly 1 in 80,000) birth defect in which the sex of the brain (neurological sex) is in opposition to the sex of the body (physical sex). This situation, (which also can occur in other animals besides man) creates severe suffering and affects behavior and sometimes even (in very slight degrees) appearance and physical development. because the brain is one sex, and the body another, the individual suffers in a host of ways, including a conflict between their internal kinesthetic sense (the 'body map' within the brain), conflict with the way sex hormones affect them overall, and of course their position within society as a whole. Depending on location and culture, as many as 50% of all transsexuals die before their 30th year, usually by their own hand, due to this suffering. Transsexuality can be cured by altering the body to fit the brain that owns it. This is done through hormones, which make up some 80% of the transformative process, and may be completed with surgery to reconstruct the sexual organs (Sexual Reassignment Surgery, or SRS). To qualify for surgery, a patient must have the recommendations of two psychiatric professionals, one an MD, and also have successfully lived for at least one full year entirely in the chosen gender role (the 'Real Life Test). These requirements are known as the Benjamin Foundation Requirements. Transsexuality is marked by several key indicators:<br><br>1. The patient has a deep misery with regard to their body and their sex, and consider that their internal gender is in opposition to their physical sex.<br><br>2. The onset for transsexuality is almost always before puberty, indeed from earliest memory, though the transsexual may spend a lifetime trying to dismiss, ignore, or fight dealing with the issue.<br><br>3. The transsexual is focused on gender, internal identity, and not only on appearance. The need to be what is the seeming opposite sex is actually a need to correct a mistake of nature, and a misery, and has little or nothing to do with sexuality per se.<br><br>Transsexuals may be heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or even asexual, since the issue is one of identity and body construction, not sex. Transsexuals are equally divided between the MTF or 'Male-To-Female', and FTM, or 'Female-To-Male' varieties, though because of the nature of our society, the MTF type get almost all of the attention, and the FTM types are almost entirely ignored.<br></div>

U should get a counsellor. They aren't there to just convince u u are male. They listen to you and tell u all the options open to you, and help u understand all the pros and cons of any decision u make. they bring in a view from an angle u may not have considered. U should get one actually. If u're still in school I'm sure u can get access to the school counsellor. Try it. U'll be surprised. Although in this case one small advice I'd give u is to ask for a female counsellor. They might be more understanding of your circumstances.</div>

Jenn doesn't understand why u guys so enjoy being male anyway but he's not voicing that out. If u're trying to understand, Jenn might try to answer you, but there are certain limits to questions and u have to be sensitive about what she's going thru. Maybe u can't fully understand and maybe u're shocked but is voicing your shock so important that u don't care if u cause grief to another human being? Be sensitive about what u say or ask, and I'm sure Jenn will be more than happy to share some of her views on this matter.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok people i think you're all being unfair. gender is more than what genitals u were born with. a dog and a cat is different in that they are 2 different species, but with gender the issue is more complicated. I think that was a very unfair and cloudy comparism. Seriously, while its good that u're all getting Jenn to go for counselling, there are ways to go about that, and trying to shame or berate her is not it. All u'll do is cause her more grief. For now I suggest that instead of creating an adverse psychological reaction to the word "counselling" leave her alone and let me talk to her, and see if I can't convince her to go for it. Its no good helping someone when your methods are getting the opposite results. And some of you are already bordering on 'insulting' with your advice.</div>
