Have you lost the cool, logical and balanced mind that SgForums developers need when forging servers of SgF's calibur? You have singlehandedly destroyed SgF and its integrity with this change. You have harnessed the chains of malice and incompetency to drive your hellish steeds of destruction and despair through the rejoicing worlds of the living and ruin SgF in the process. Words simply cannot EXPLAIN how angry I am with this change, your development skills and your love for the human race. Here is what you have done:<br><br>What the hell were you thinking?
