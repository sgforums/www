            <div class='col-md body'>United suffer travel sickness again<br>By Ian McGarry<br><br>Anderlecht 2-1 Manchester United<br><br>What began as a blip has become a blight. Manchester United lost to Anderlecht in Brussels, turning a dry spell of results on European soil into a drought.<br><br>Gary Neville applauds United's fans after the 2-1 defeat<br>(RossKinnaird/Allsport)<br>It is 218 days since the 1999 Champions League winners recorded an away victory on the Continent. Failure to beat Dinamo Kiev in the safer environs of Old Trafford in two weeks' time will push United out of the competition.<br><br>Who could have imagined when Group G was drawn that this rather innocuous pack of clubs could take the mighty United within a game of being evicted from a competition they long to make their own?<br><br>The truth in this case is stranger than fiction. Last night's defeat was United's second of the first phase, coming three weeks after they were dismantled by PSV Eindhoven.<br><br>Had it not been for the heroics of Fabien Barthez during a torrid 30-minute period in the first half, Anderlecht would have had the match sewn up by the break.<br><br>As it was, a timid and toothless side which lacked the bite of Roy Keane in midfield were over-run and outplayed by the Belgian champions, who had obviously studied the means by which United can be defeated.<br><br>If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Sir Alex Ferguson should not feel aggrieved that his side are now the benchmark for any who aspire to open and attacking play.<br><br>Anderlecht coach Aime Anthuenis had obviously watched the video of United's defeat in Eindhoven when they were beaten at their own game. With Walter Bassegio, Jan Koller and Tomasz Radzinski impersonating Keane, Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole, United didn't know what to do.<br><br>Ronny Johnsen was more bemused than most and his dreadful habit of failing to attack either ball or opponent as they bore down on the United goal caused most of the problems.<br><br>It also left his manager condemning the defence as 'a shambles' but Ferguson must take some of the blame for failing to spot the fatal flaw which has seen his side struggle badly when faced with the sort of speedy and skilful forwards who are not in great supply in the Premiership.<br><br>Maybe now, a few English clubs with a mind to break United's dominance at home might now look to acquire one.<br><br>Real Madrid's Raul did it in last season's quarter-final. This season, Maksim Shatskikh came closest to scoring in Kiev, and United defenders are still having nightmares about Mateja Kezman of PSV.<br><br>You would have thought, therefore, that they might have been wise before last night's encounter in which a victory would have made next week's match a cake-walk. Along with a lack of away goals - United have now gone five matches and no goals in open play - there seem to be learning difficulties at United.<br><br>Radzinski is hardly an unknown quantity. For 20 minutes of the first match at Old Trafford he terrorised and teased Jaap Stam before United scored and the floodgates opened.<br><br>The Canadian striker ripped through them again with an uncanny ability to move swiftly enough to create the illusion of being in two places at once. He ghosted away from Johnsen and on to Yves Vanderhaeghe's pass after 15 minutes. He was probably offside but, in any case, Barthez should have been better protected.<br><br>Instead, Radzinski luxuriated in the amount of time he had to steady himself before placing the ball past the goalkeeper from close range. Koller was gifted a similar chance a minute later but Barthez blocked brilliantly and kept his side in the hunt.<br><br>The French goalkeeper must have felt like a marked man for the next few minutes. His saves denied Bart Goor and Radzinski and prevented the scoreline more accurately reflecting the run of play.<br><br>With United's midfield failing to pick up on any of the running players going through them, a second strike was inevitable, and it came after 34 minutes when Koller's touch deceived Mikael Silvestre and his centre was converted by Radzinski with skill to equal his exuberance.<br><br>Only good luck or outrageous skill could stem the tide for United and fortune smiled upon them within 60 seconds. Dwight Yorke found Andy Cole in the box. In avoiding the tackle of Bertrand Cresson, Cole was upended by Glen De Boeck.<br><br>Denis Irwin despatched the penalty but it hardly inspired his team to equalise. The pattern rarely strayed from the one so elegantly established in the first half.<br><br>In the predictable Alamo style siege in injury time, Barthez, who was United's best defender, also looked their most potent threat. His 35-yard shot underlined how impotent every other member of the team had become.<br><br>Anderlecht have now taken control of their own destiny and their progress will be guaranteed of they beat PSV.<br><br>United, meanwhile, might want to dig out the tape of their win in Bordeaux last March for inspiration.<br><br>now they blame it on travel sickness...COOL<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> FnU  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>------------------<br>Thank you for loving me baby<br>You'll always be the one who drives me crazy<br>I think this is a gift from God to have you here..<br>Thank you for loving me baby<br>I'll treasure all your love and all the things we share..<br>And I wanna tell you, how much I love you.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>-   NEWS<br><br>Wednesday, October 25, 2000<br>Rivaldo keeps Leeds waiting<br>By Martin Lipton<br><br>Leeds 1-1 Barcelona<br><br>So close, so horribly, gutwrenchingly close, so bitter the desperation. Yet, for all the anguish of David O'Leary's team, spilling over as Alan Smith clashed angrily with Puyol and Abelardo, this was the night that proved just how much courage Leeds have and why only a fool would bet against them when they seek the point they still need against AC Milan at the San Siro in a fortnight.<br><br>Jonathan Woodgate challenges Luis Enrique<br>(ShaunBotterill/Allsport)<br>That it was Rivaldo who finally breached the astonishingly resilient white wall Leeds had placed in front of the magnificent Paul Robinson was inevitable.<br><br>The Brazilian, the scourge of Leeds in the Camp Nou last month, had been thwarted time and again by the stand-in goalkeeper, whose display could surely not have been bettered.<br><br>But just as Leeds seemed to have done enough, Rivaldo struck in a fourth minute of injury time that only Norwegian referee Terje Hauge can explain.<br><br>Lee Bowyer, whose fifth minute free-kick had put O'Leary's babes within touching distance of the promised land of the next phase, for once was unable to complete his clearance, giving Phillip Cocu the chance to launch one last all or nothing attack.<br><br>Not even Robinson's sensational reflexes could do anything about substitute Gerard's header, which cannoned against the foot of the post. Before Elland Road could breathe a collective sigh of relief, Rivaldo leapt in with the grace of a panther to side-foot home the rebound from the penalty spot with his favoured left foot.<br><br>Barcelona - and the whole of Catalonia - celebrated as Leeds collapsed in dejection, their dreams of glory snatched away in such a brutal fashion. The pain and despair felt by every Leeds player and supporter was understandable. This had been the sort of rearguard action that only the truly brave can undertake.<br><br>Leeds still only need to draw against a Milan side already sure of their progress, and who would not be averse to seeing Barcelona exit at the first-round stage. Leeds' efforts mean they deserve that opportunity.<br><br>Bowyer's early strike, his searing delivery from the left floating over Richard Dutruel's flailing hands to finish in the back of the net, had set the scene for what was to follow.<br><br>Barcelona, inspired by the litheness of Rivaldo, the intelligence of Luis Enrique and the scintillating speed of Portuguese flyer Simao, were a relentless tide, surging forward with the intensity of a team that could not afford to fail.<br><br>But instead of folding, of giving in, Leeds - with only Nigel Martyn, Lucas Radebe and Harry Kewell missing from O'Leary's first-choice side - refused to bow to their supposed betters.<br><br>In the midfield, even when they appeared to be overrun, Olivier Dacourt - running the risk of a red card throughout, so great was his commitment - Bowyer and Eirik Bakke kept on hustling and harrying, forcing Barca to find another direction for their attacks.<br><br>When they did, Jon Woodgate and Danny Mills in particular were quite sensational. Woodgate grew with every passing minute, his calmness a reassuring presence as other heads began to wander with the anticipation of what might be.<br><br>But it was Robinson, catapulted into the spotlight when Martyn tore his groin 10 days ago, who was the hero of what was so nearly Leeds' greatest European night since reaching the Final at Barca's expense 25 years ago.<br><br>When the 21-year-old flew to his left to keep out Rivaldo's tracer bullet header from Xavi's free-kick midway through the first half, it appeared a stop to savour. By the end it was evident that it was just the beginning, as Robinson kept his side's lead intact in quite unbelievable style.<br><br>The leap down to his left to turn aside Rivaldo's stunning free-kick on the stroke of half-time was better still, while the effort to deny Alfonso's close-range header from Luis Enrique's cross on the hour was the best of the lot.<br><br>Leeds occasionally threatened to add to their advantage, with Smith and Mark Viduka feeding off the scraps that came their way. Dutruel redeemed himself with a dive to turn Smith's scudding drive wide and when Bowyer linked with Viduka - who held the ball up so well - the Dutch goal-keeper had to save with his legs.<br><br>If the midfielder had been able to play Viduka in when he appeared in space to his right 16 minutes from time it would have been all over, even though Barcelona remained dominant.<br><br>Robinson made two more fine saves from Rivaldo, both at the foot of his right-hand upright, and he deserved the bit of luck that came his way when the Brazilian diverted Alfonso's shot into the bottom corner only for the linesman rightly to raise his flag.<br><br>The boasts of the absent Marc Overmars and Manu Petit that moving to the Camp Nou would increase their chances of winning Europe's biggest prize were looking hollow and even though a sense of foreboding greeted the announcement of four minutes of added time, nobody could have anticipated such a devastating conclusion.<br><br>Fortunately, the spat between Smith and the Barcelona duo at the final whistle was swiftly defused, although UEFA may take a dim view.<br><br>Europe's governing body may be even less happy about the prospect of Barcelona being knocked out, though when Leeds have time to draw breath this morning, they will know that they are still in the Champions League box-seat. Just one point in the San Siro and they will have achieved the near-impossible.<br><br>If they play with this spirit, against a Milan side with no reason to care, it is not beyond them. That will be all the motivation O'Leary and his players need.<br><br>------------------<br>Thank you for loving me baby<br>You'll always be the one who drives me crazy<br>I think this is a gift from God to have you here..<br>Thank you for loving me baby<br>I'll treasure all your love and all the things we share..<br>And I wanna tell you, how much I love you.....</div>
