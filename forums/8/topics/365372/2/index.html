              <p>Ok not trying to start anything but i think its kind of reality lah lets face it, if you know the man your gonna marry is earning only like $1k/mthn u will marry meh, ok im not saying 0 cases . there will be some cases who proves otherwise, but compared to our mother's father's time nowadays MORE women goes for a quality lifestyle and this is very obviously proven needless to say, even men also. So given our this kind of mentality now i think such cases of marriage being a success is less probable than years ago of 1k's equivalent then.</p>

              <p>Many claim that in the past, things were cheaper and life was easier. A cup of coffee perhaps only 20 cts.</p>
              <p>Let's be realistic.</p>
              <p><strong>How much did the common worker get let's say in the late 60s? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only average est $300</span></strong></p>
              <p>How did our forefathers lived in the late 60s? Shanty huts, costing est $25/mth, which consists of cement floors, smelly drains, perhaps not even piped water, charcoal stoves, etc.</p>
              <p>How much was primary education back then? $2/mth.</p>
              <p>How much meat did the common worker eat per week? Perhaps only once a mth, rice, vege and an occasional fish was the staple. Eating out meant roadside stall serving noodles or chicken rice, considered a luxury.</p>
              <p>How much was entertainment back then? 50cts in non-aircon cinemas, wooden chairs with no armrest. Beach and Mt Faber was free.</p>
              <p>But  did they stopped having children? Nope, and did not stop at even three.</p>
              <p>Did our parents grew up deprived? Nope, they were normal humans, working for an honest living and provided for us, some even pampering us as our nation progressed.</p>
              <p>And now, how much <strong>NOW</strong> are our salaries? <strong>No citizen earns lower than $800 for the meanest job and while i do not have empirical figures, most earn above est $1,500/mth.</strong></p>
              <p>The point is - have we citizens became self centred, so much that we no longer are willing to sacrifice for anything other than ourselves in instant self gratification for both males and females, to the extent of not even having kids, ending ourselves within this generation with no one to call us dad or mom, and depend on charity for our old age?</p>
              <p>More frighteningly, as a progressive and civilised society, have we the current generation stopped loving children and having any of our own?</p>
