            <div class='col-md body'>Very true indeed...quite disappointed with the mentality of the medical practices. Wonder what will happen if the patient's family is poor and couldn't afford to pay for the medical bills...will they just simply let the patient die because they couldn't afford to pay for the medical bills?<br><br>Do we really allow such tragedy to exist or are we waiting for one such incident to happen before we seriously take a look at our healthcare policies?<br><br>Perhaps the government should take a serious consideration into the people's welfare and well-being...make sure that this issue is well taken care of. Really worried what will happened if we're old in the future...does the country takes care of us? Afterall, every citizens does contribute to the growing of the country itself. Shouldn't the country takes care of its citizens when they are old and sick?<br><br>Without the citizens, there can never exist a country.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by niceguy_123:</div><div class="quote_body">Why is our society gearing towards such mecenaries acts?<br><br>Rippling one's off during one's emergency is so unethical.. why run a Life-saving centre in the first place?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>-------------------------------------------------<br>March 2, 2005<br>It's an emergency but settle bill first<br><br>MY BROTHER-IN-LAW was visiting a relative at Mount Elizabeth Hospital on Friday evening when he had a stroke.
