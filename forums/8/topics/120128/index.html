            <div class='col-md body'>smrt defensive stock ok for newbie investing.<br><br>chuan hup mm.. good management, very pro shareholder.<br><br>but the best company that I like is still sgx, the business is monopolistic in nature as there no other stock exchange listing in singapore other than SGX, their business is charging &amp; collecting stamp fees for any buying and selling transactions on the stock &amp; commodities market in singapore or any overseas exchanges that happen to have a listing here, apart from the share price movement the business is quite recession proof:<br><br>If there is a bull market here and people start buying a lot of shares, they collect more stamp fees, likewise if there was panic selling the same applies they collect more fees so how can they lose?<br><br>their business is one of those that can consistently accumulate large horde of cash and occasionally they have been know to give good dividends 9cts/share and on occasion special dividends as much as 30+ cts/ share in the past.<br><br>And their costs is quite fixed: unlike smrt and chuan hup cost can be quite high for equipment upgrades and money for upgrades needs to be set aside each year as things gets depreciated.<br><br>I also heard SGX exploring to re-open the malaysia-singapore stock exchange again like the old clob exchange. If that happens means more fees to collect means more profits means more dividends.<br><br><strong>Background</strong><br><br>BACKGROUND<br>SGX was formed in 1999 in order to effectuate the demutualization and merger of the two exchanges: Stock Exchange of Singapore and Singapore Intl Monetary Exchange. Prior to the merger, each exchange was owned by the member firms that engaged in trading and clearing and settlement functions. Pursuant to legislation adopted to effect the merger, SGX was created to own the exchanges and their related clearing houses, and the former owners and seatholders were given shares in SGX in exchange for their shares and seats in the two exchanges.<br><br>SGX owns and operates the only integrated securities exchange and derivatives exchange in Singapore and their related clearing houses. The securities exchange was the first fully electronic and floorless exchange in Asia. The derivatives exchange is one of the largest in Asia and was named "Derivatives Exchange of the Year" in 1989, 1992, 1993 and 1998 by the International Financing Review and "Asia's Best Derivatives Exchange in 1999" by The Asset magazine. Together, the two exchanges serve a wide array of international and domestic investors and end users, including many of the world's largest financial institutions, and have been among the most innovative exchanges in the world in technological and new product development.<br><br>SGX has been developing alliances and new products in order to meet the changing needs of the international and domestic financial communities. SGX was a founding member of the GLOBEX Alliance together with some other leading derivatives exchanges. It also has alliances or significant relationships with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Australian Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India. SGX has introduced a variety of securities and derivatives products to respond to investors' desires for 24-hour trading, diversification and trading across markets.<br></div>

Wait for price to drop.<br>U must buy when people are selling &amp; sell when the uncles &amp; aunties start buying.<br>If u have spare cash buy blue chips like banks/ those who give good dividends.
