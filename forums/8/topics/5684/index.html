            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Suzi, my friend had a similar encounter like your friend. Gf went to study in Australia and bf is in Spore. Gf promised bf to come back to him and will remain faithful when in Australia.<br><br>During the study there at Australia, maybe coz of loneliness or what, knew this guy and stayed with him. Broke up with my friend. Told my friend that she doesn't love him anymore and is just using him to "REPLACE" another ex bf. Then got pregeant and is now graduated and back in Spore planning for this shotgun marriage. Heard that the gal is under a lot of pressure from friends and parents about this marriage. Do you think she found the rite person or she's just plain impulsive ?<br><br>What will you do if you are this guy ?<br><br>I told this friend of mine to forget her and look for a better one. Imagine you are with her for nearly two yrs and she's just using you to "SUBSTITUTE" her ex bf. Would you like that ? True lah, my friend nearly went crazy over this breakup and never believe in relationship anymore. But that's the hard fact lah.<br><br>If I will him, I will ask her to fuck off if she comes crawling back to me. Sometimes you don't know what she is thinking, maybe coz you are the only one she can relied on when the marriage failed and you are the only one there for her. She might not go back to you coz of love but maybe of your status : financial stable with a job and house to look after the child.<br><br>This makes me wonder : sometimes don't know what you gals are thinking in your hearts when you are telling someone you love but deep down the person is just a replacement.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps this doesnt happen to girls finding replacement for their exs only..My friend's bf, after 3 years with her, told her that she's just a substitute for his ex...3 whole years!!<br><br>They sort of have some misunderstanding before that, and the guy somehow just couldnt give the girl a proper explanation for the things he were doing, such as neglecting her but yet enjoying himself with his friends, stopped chatting to her at nights..everytime they talked, it was just to say that he was going to sleep...etc etc...one day my friend couldnt take it anymore, and asked him to explain to her what exactly was going on...he refused, and said he'll call her the next day..but my friend wanted to settle it that nite, and in the end, in her anger and desperation, told him that she wants to end the relationship. The guy didnt even bother to try patch things up.<br><br>Now, it seems that there is another girl, but yet, even after my frd and the guy has broken up, the guy still insists that the girl is only a good friend...there was no third party....&amp; my frd still loves him, wish to try the relationship again, the guy says no and said that the girl was only a substitute (for 3 years!)...even though there's supposedly no third party....incredible.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Zhao Yun :<br><br>Someone once asked me this question after my breakup with my ex-gf, as she ran away with another guy (which happened to be her 1st bf). I told that someone it is perfectly irrelevant to answer that question since I felt that she will never come back to me in my life anymore. However, supposed I have to answer it, I will just say that I will forgive the person for her betrayal and if it is ever possible, start a relationship again with her. Lost love is very difficult to find. It is very difficult to get over someone you love. In truth, you never get over her, because every time you hear a song, walk to somewhere where you once have a happy time with her, and so forth... However, I suppose that I am one of those men who cannot stay friends with my ex-gfs... Sad but it is my way of life.<br><br>In the case of marriage, the situation is slightly different. I think at the end of the day, I will still forgive my wife if she has betrayed me in whichever way.<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 15 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What if your gf tells u one day that she has a five year old son and the dad is not obviously you??And she told you that she got pregnant by a Brunei guy and the guy ran back to brunei and she has to raise the kid as she does not want to go for an abortion. She told you about 3 months after both of you went steady together??So the question is will u still be with her? Assume you love her a lot and you get along with her son..and u are only in your early 20s...tough question for me...hmm<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 15 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To err is human, to forgive divine.<br><br>I guess anyone in life will commit mistakes, small and big ones. If someone breaks the trust you wholeheartedly gave, surely it would be painful. Surely the scar would be a deep and unforgettable one. That scar would definitely leave an emptiness waiting for someone special to fill it and heal it.<br><br>Whether he or she comes back to ask for a second chance, you should try to forgive. Not forgiving would mean that you will always be on the defensive, not willing to open up to other people, not able to put yourself in another committment. You would be always afraid whether you would be betrayed again. Forgiving and letting go of the hate takes lots of courage, but it's the best thing to do. Don't let someone's past hinder you from loving him/her.<br><br>I guess the simple answer is if you love her, forgive her. Whether to want her back, you got to be sure whether is she coming back to you because the guy who got her pregnant dumped her and she is coming to you out of desperation. Exploiting your feelings for her. Listen to the head instead of the heart. If you want the relationship back, then forget the past and look the the future loving both her and the child.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Iamsilly<br>It is easy to just say forgive cos it is not only the problem of only three person but the family of the guy as well...who would actually accept a daughter in law who has a kid born out of the wedlock??Imagine your son is the cream of the crop in his studies and he can find all the woman he can love instead of this woman who actually got a kid before marriage. The relatives, his friends...and all the ridicule the guy has to suffer...and the kid...when he grow up..will he really accept him as the real father??You might say that if you really love a person, you would brave all storms and so on...but rememeber we are Humans..we have pride and we also have a limit of forbearance...how many ridicule can we tolerate before we can erupt like a volcano...Love is irrational but you have to weigh consequences as well as the future... We dun survive on love alone but with the world as well...it is the cruel reality but it is the earth that we are living in...Can u say not...?<br>Ppl get together not knowing if they are compatible and just live on the word love..but realise one day how naive they are not facing up the reality...I want to just be like any other naive being living but the world does not permit me to just love as it is..cos the nurturing environment has just more than one choices besides love alone....thus I dun believe in just living on love alone...there are other realtionship that can keep us alive...but it is true love that leads to eternity salvation</div>
