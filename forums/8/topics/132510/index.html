            <div class='col-md body'>I was from a girls' school from the east..primary sch i mean.. wow those teachers i encountered when i was pri3, 4, 5 and 6 are seriously a bunch of shitnitz... U'll be condemned if you don't suck up to them..<br><br>Usually it's the noisy, hyper kids who gets punished.. but back when I was in pri sch... those freakin lame ass teachers just love discriminating students with so-so grades...even though when u're quietly sitting there.. also will kena! There was this young teacher (young at that time, i think she's around 40 now) man..she has got freakin bad temper.. and loves screaming and shouting at people for no reason.. and calling people names...like "bloody idiot" and "ninkampo (i still dunno wtf that is)" , and she likes picking on malays too... she throws books at student's face...and outta the window too..<br><br>My pri 6 teacher gave be the most "Memorable" day in pri sch.That freakin old hag... she came in class with a fouled up mood...and started picking innocent pupils to vent her frustrations... i had this rather intelligent gal sitting next to me...who got scolded for nothing... and the very next person was me... she was like " HEY. SO WHICH SECONDARY SCHOOL DID YOU CHOOSE?  OH... COMEON, LOOK AT YOURSELF, YOU'RE SO FREAKIN STUPID, DREAM ON ...U'LL NEVER GET IN THAT SCHOOL " I stood there   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> I was stunted..gave her an expressionless look...and she continued "HEY. DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK. STOP SHOWING ME THAT PIG FACE." then she asked the rest of the class " DON'T YOU AGREE? " blah blah.. and she hurled more insults at me....Luckily I'm not a malay..if not. i'll make her pay a huge price for callin me PIG FACE... lolzzzz..<br><br>Man. WTF was that.... luckily at that time i was quite "immuned" to insults...but when I think back... I still feel damn pissed. Fancy getting insulted infront of the whole class for no reason!!!!<br><br>Anywayz....i realise that those sadists tempermental female teachers usually are  in their late 30s and still not married ( i bet they are still single now)...and those who have been married for sometime but still childless.... it would be great if IMH can reserve a few wards just to cater to these insane old b|tches...</div>
