            <div class='col-md body'>Usually when they say in the other outlet, I will ask them to double check.<br><br>Recently, I also experience this type of service before in Adidas Takashimaya, not the basement one but the one at the top level within Tayashimaya itself.<br><br>My friend has his eyes on one of the jacket when we went in at the Ngee Ann City outlet, the one at the basement but the size that he is looking for, left the display piece.<br><br>Then we went up to the Takashimaya outlet, ask the sales lady. After checking the stocks at the outlet, she say dun have this size. When we ask whether other outlet might have, she immediately say that only other size is available and keep repeating the same thing over and over.<br><br>I mean, WTF... can't she bother to check the outlets for available sizes??? I mean that their services sucks lor. Imagine that even the low cost brand would actually bother to check with other outlets for stocks and that is actually within their job scope lor.<br><br>Some more on weekdays and not busy. This type of people should be booted. I try to find their email but could not, cos the contact us section of their site always down... Think they did it to stop receiving massive complaints! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
