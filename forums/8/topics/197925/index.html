Hmmm.. to handle autistic children you need to set certain perimeters for them that would help them to feel comfortable. It gets very confusing for children with autism because a lot of us tend to speak very generally Or worse, we tend to use imagery, a lot of 'inferences', and hints when we speak to children.<br><br>E.g. "If you don't hand up your homework by tomorrow, you see what will happen!" and unfortunately, they just might decide to see.. what will happen - thus sometimes, they end up being construed as disobedient or hard to control.  Which is really unfair and unfortunate for them. It is also really difficult for children with autism to be in a mainstream class when the teacher don't understand how hard it is for them to pay attention (when they are a million and one distractions!) and get upset with them.<br><br>But yeah.. as mentioned above, because it affects each individually so differently, a lot of time and patience is needed to understand each child's needs.<br><br>Hmm.. as for parents not... being able to discipline their children.. Hmm.. sometimes I think it takes a lot for parents to accept that their child with special needs is still a child and NEED to learn discipline to help them function independently in future, and beyond that... the discipline have to be administered in specific style to be effective. it isn't easy and its hard enough for them to cope with their children.... and a public with lack of understanding doesn't make it any easier for them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
