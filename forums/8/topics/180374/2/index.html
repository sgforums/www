            <div class='col-md body'>we will definitely live another 100 years, but add another zero to the back, and i cannot say if that is certain. humans are on the path to self-extinction. every new breakthrough in science and medicine is another tool for use by evil corporations to make foul plans to secure their greed. one day the technology we have will be used against ourselves and thats our end.<br><br>about the alien/god theories you guys speak of, it is much wiser and much more logical to believe aliens exist.<br><br>from the scientific point of view, the universe houses billions of galaxies that contain billions of stars each and there is an estimate of 0-20 (or more) planets per star system. if we have 50 planets, there is a very high possibility that atleast one of them contains the ingredients for life.<br><br>from the religious point of view, if god exists, when did he create life on only one planet, earth, in the vast universe of countless other planets. are humans, then, doomed to live alone in this vast ocean of space, having all the planets to ourselves, and no one to share them with?<br><br>combining both views, i'd say that even if god exists, there must also be other alien life forms on other planets in the universe.<br><br>being an atheist, i'd rather believe that god is nature itself.</div>

But humans are EVIL, which is far more deadlier than any poisonous snake, or ferocious animal.<br><br></div></blockquote>What's the definition of evil? For me, evil's no more than a disagreement about the way things are supposed to be...<br><br>I rather believe that there is only one creator of the universe. This creator had made many worlds, watched each flower or die, and gone on to make endless worlds beyond. A gardener did not weep for each blossom that fell. And this world is left for human and all other life-forms to make of it what they could - a heaven or the pit of doom by their choosing.<br><br>But men's only a small part of the whole thing, and they're not really here for very long. A man's born, lives out his life, and dies in so short a time that mountains and stars don't even notice him as he goes by. So why care whether will our species be walking on this very earth a million years later... maybe yes, but i'm sure they will not be known as Homo Sapiens...<br><br>But one thing for certain though... nothing lasts forever.</div>
