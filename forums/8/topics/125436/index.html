            <div class='col-md body'>So now, we had more girls from local Uni into prostitution..

'candice' unfortunate plight certainly saddens me..<br><br>I think it will be interesting to know that up to 15-20% of the local cohorts in some faculties in NUS and NTU are made up of foreign scholars..<br><br>They don't have to pay school fees, and they still get a handsome allowance every month to spend on fast foods, movies, and high end PCs for gaming and online chatting.. And the worse thing is, these freeloaders are not even grateful, most of the time as history has shown, the china chinese people have a tendency to bite the hands that feeds them.. Recently one such case happened here as reported by the chinese paper, bastard criticise the very hands that fed him..<br><br>Seriouly I have never seen a government like ours that bleeds our own citizens and students by raising school fees, and gives away places in our *prestigious* universities for foreigners FOC..<br><br>Aren't we the Harvard of the East? If so, then why aren't foreigners paying to come here to study? Why do we need to give away free places in order to attract FTs to come here to take our jobs, our uni places, and cause social unrests?<br><br>If China has so many talents, why aren't good universities in the west and down under giving them free seats in their Unis like us? Maybe they are, if you know please post the URL here to show us that our govt is indeed doing the right thing..<br><br>Because of all these nonsense that our govt is doing, I don't feel proud having served NS at all.. What's the point? Who am I protecting? Am I protecting the country so that more freeloaders can come here and take our jobs, our livelihoods, and sometimes our woman as well? Why do I have to sacrifice my life every year doing reservists while the commie freeloaders enjoy?<br><br></div>
