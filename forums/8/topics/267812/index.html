There were 10.1 live births per 1,000 residents last year, up from 10.<br><br>And for the second consecutive year, the total fertility rate has inched up, from 1.25 in 2005 to 1.26 last year. It was 1.24 in 2004.<br><br>Although the gains are small, National University of Singapore sociologist Paulin Straughan said the figures from the Report on Registration of Births and Deaths should not be sniffed at.<br><br>"We're at the sad state where anything not going south is good news," she said. "So, it's encouraging news that first of all, the numbers have not fallen, and secondly, they've gone up."<br><br>A closer look at the numbers offers more signs for optimism.<br><br>First-time mothers contributed 45 per cent of all live births last year, while 36 per cent were by mothers having their second child.<br><br>Compared to 2005, this is an increase of 2.2 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively, an "encouraging" development according to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA), which issued the report.<br><br>Associate Professor Straughan told TODAY that the decision to have the first child is always the most difficult to make. So, the increasing number of births in this category is good news, and comes after the Baby Bonus scheme extended benefits to the first and fourth child from August 2004 onwards.<br><br>However, the ICA said that the "immediate impact" of the scheme "has not been felt", based on the age and waiting period for mothers to have their first or subsequent child.<br><br>The median age of first-time mothers was 29.4 years at the time of giving birth. Malay mothers have their first child at 25.6 years against 30.1 years for the Chinese, 27.9 years for Indians and 29.1 years for other ethnic groups.<br><br>Furthermore, Malays have their first child 408 days after marriage while the Chinese do so in 978 days, Indians after 801 days and 505 days for other ethnic groups.<br><br>Still, there is a more pro-family climate now, noted Assoc Prof Straughan, who offered one other possible reason for the improving birth rates: The economy.<br><br>She said: "The economy has been doing well, and investment in children requires a certain level of optimism. If the numbers didn't go up, it'll be worrying. You'd wonder what is needed to tip the trend."<br><br>In other data on births, 495 babies were born to single mothers, of which 35.8 per cent were teenagers. Half the single mothers were Malays, up from 30.1 per cent in 1997, when single parent births stood at 419 in total.<br><br>Teenage births fell by 1.8 per cent last year to 838, but which is still higher than the 704 births in 1997.</div>
