            <div class='col-md body'>I was a bit like you..... the part abt the no gf. In fact I only starting dating when I was 25 years old  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I have a few pieces of advise for you.<br><br>Firstly, don't expect a perfect romance. If you keep looking for the perfect girl, you'll never find her and will miss out on all other great girls around. Besides if you never that the time to know a girl, you'll never know that she is for you right ?<br><br>Secondly, my advise is to mingle more and know more people. This will allow you to widen your circle of friends ( the more people you know, the more change you'll have of finding a gf, right?).<br><br>thirdly, don't worry too much abt looking for a gf. Let nature that's it course.<br><br>Finally, don't compromise on your principals and morals. You'll find someone in time who'll appreciate you for who you are.<br><br>-----<br><br>If someone as ugly and socially inept as me can find someone, you can too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>take care</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your advice sharr..<br>can u tell me about your experience? I mean u said u only started dating at 25 right.. so how was it? i reckon from your signature that you are happily attached? did u take a long time to find that special girl you are with now?<br><br>and xln(short for xiaolongnu): I reckon from your reply that u r a piscean or that you have encountered pisceans that are not like me?</div>

I once wrote part of a song with those same ideas..<br>I called it "Teenage angst".<br><br>honeydew: hmm.. I dont quite get you.. I dont mind having more friends.. I'm just doubtful about finding "the one".. It scares me because nowadays ppl consider a <strong>one-year </strong>relationship <span style="font-style: italic;">LONG</span>...<br>Are there still ppl out there who believes in true love? I want to seek them out. And no I'm not looking for a gf just for the sake of having one. I'm looking for one because i feel that a life without love is not considered a life at all. Perhaps its because pisceans are driven by love..</div>

You are not a flirt, neither would you find one, therefore relation to you is a serious business. But in the real world, most of the time you have to experience and go through a few relation before you actually know what you want in a woman. Those quality that you mentioned are what you think that may be sufficient for you, but how sure are you? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>No matter who you ask, everyone would tell you the same thing - expand social circle and start dating. Dates doesn't mean anything and there is no harm trying to get to know some one better as a friend. Perhaps you don't have to change yourself because true love, if it is meant to be yours, it will walk in by itself, but you have to open the route for this to happen. You can't just sit there and watch the world pass you, that's because in the end, you only have yourself to blame. You don't have to appear desperate and seek to find any woman - the key difference is ATTEMPT. You try and attempt to mix around by being yourself and know more people, through group outing, personal dates, etc. You don't have to date with a purpose of trying to see if she is suitable or not, just treat it as trying to know her as a friend. If done in mass, you will discover that there is someone so much different from the rest, then you have to work you way from there  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Guys, sad to say, if too passive, always stands on the disadvantage side because someone would come by and take what seemed to be yours few minutes ago.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Nan ren bu huai, nui ren bu ai  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>By the way, the dream that you hold is admirable and not dumb, because few people could achieve it and it takes more than just basic principles to uphold it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
