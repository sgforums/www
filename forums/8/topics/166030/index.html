            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes when shit happens, you want to be able to articulate the experience more than just you've, taken a shit. Here are some shit definitions to help you explain the situation better to your friends and family...<br><br>Ghost Shit<br>You know you've shit. There's shit on the toilet paper, but no shit in the bowl.<br><br>Teflon Coated Shit<br>Comes out so slick, clean and easy that you don't feel it. No traces of shit on the toilet paper, you have to look in the bowl to be sure you did it!<br><br>Gooey Shit<br>This has the consistency of hot tar. You wipe your ass 12 times and it still doesn't come clean. You end up putting toilet paper in your underwear so you don't stain it. This shit leaves permanent skid marks in the toilet.<br><br>Second Thought Shit<br>You're all done wiping your ass and you're about to stand up when you realize it.....you've got some more.<br><br>Pop a Vein in Your Forehead Shit<br>This kind is the kind of shit that killed Elvis. It doesn't come until you're all sweaty, trembling and purple from straining so hard.<br><br>Bali Belly Shit<br>You shit so much you lose 5 kilos.<br><br>Right Now Shit<br>You better be within 10 seconds of a toilet. Usually it has its head out before you get your pants down.<br><br>King Kong or Commode Choker Shit<br>This shit is so big that you know it won't go down the toilet unless you break it into smaller chunks. A coat hanger works well. This kind of shit usually happens at someone else's house.<br><br>Wet Cheeks Shit<br>This shit hits the water sideways and makes a BIG splash that gets your ass wet.<br><br>Wish Shit<br>You sit there all cramped up and fart a few times, but no shit!<br><br>Cement Block or Oh God Shit<br>You wish you'd gotten a spinal block before you shit.<br><br>Snake Shit<br>This shit is fairly soft and about as big around as your thumb and at least three feet long.<br><br>Cork Shit (Also Known as Floater Shit)<br>Even after the third flush, it's still floating in there. My god! How do I get rid of it? This shit usually happens at someone else's house.<br><br>Mexican Food Shit (also called Screamers)<br>You'll know it's alright to eat again when your asshole stops burning.<br><br>Beer Drunk Shit<br>This happens the day after the night before. Normally your shit doesn't smell too bad, but this shit is BAD. Usually there's somebody standing outside to use the bathroom. This kind of shit also usually happens at someone else's house.<br><br>The Frightened Turtle<br>The kind of shit that just pokes its head out then quickly goes back in<br><br>The Bungee Shit<br>The kind of shit that just hangs off your ass before it falls into the water.<br><br>The Ring of Fire Shit<br>The kind of shit where you eat really spicy food and your asshole feels like the inside of a cigarette lighter.<br><br>The Crippler<br>The kind of shit where you have to sit on the toilet so long your legs go numb from the waist down.<br><br>The Big Bobber<br>The kind of shit that no matter how many times you flush it always floats back to the surface.<br><br>The Shitty Shitty Bang Bang<br>The kind of shit that hits you when you're trapped in your car in a traffic jam.<br><br>The Incredible Hulk Shit<br>The king of shit that sits in the toilet overnight and mysteriously expands to twice it's normal size.<br><br>The Jack the Ripper Shit<br>The kind of shit that yanks out the hair of your ass as it pushes its way out.<br><br>The Party Pooper<br>The giant shit you take at a party. And when you flush the toilet, you watch in horror as the water starts to rise.<br><br>The Toxic Gas Shit<br>The kind of shit that makes you pass out and fall of the toilet before you finish, and then you wake up in some strange South American town.<br><br>Dirty Bowl Shit<br>The kind of shit that comes out in a million pieces a second, reminiscent of an avalanche - but with rocket propulsion, and splatters all over the toilet bowl.<br><br>The Windy City Shit<br>When you sit down, and fart for so long and hard that you no longer need to take a shit.<br><br>Oh Shit! Shit<br>You shit so much and wipe your ass so furiously you run out of toilet paper and you say OH SHIT!<br><br>The Never Ending Shit<br>It's the shit that keeps running out of your ass like pea, and just when you start wiping your ass your stomach gargles and splash, more shit runs out. This always happens after eating at Kentucky Fried Chicken.<br><br>Ouch That Hurt Shit<br>The type of shit that leaves you feeling like you just hoped onto a bicycle without a seat. Sensation usually lasts hours.<br><br>I'm sure that upon reading this, you'll nod your head in agreement as you will all have experienced most, if not all of the scenarios listed. If you haven't you need more fiber.....<br>The Perfect Dump<br>Every once in a while everyone experiences the perfect dump. It's rare but a real thing of beauty. You sit down expecting the worse, but what you get is a smooth sliding, fart-less masterpiece that breaks the water with the splash-less grace of an Olympic high-diving champion. You use the toilet tissue to find that it was totally unnecessary. It makes you feel that all is right in the world and that you are in perfect harmony with it.<br><br>The Beer Dump<br>Nasty! Depends upon the dumper's tolerance and is the result of too many beers - doesn't matter if it was 2 or 22. What you get is a sinister, lengthy, noisy dump accompanied by an odious malevolent fog that could close the bathroom for days. Naked flames are ill advised.....<br><br>The Chilli Dump (aka The Japanese Flag)<br>Hot when it goes in and napalm when it comes out. It stays with you all day stinging yer ring and generally making your choccie starfish feel like the Shuttle's heat shield. Also makes your ass look like "a Japanese Flag".<br><br>The Empty Roll Dump<br>Relief - you've finished and reach for the tissue only to find an empty cardboard cylinder staring back at you. Panic overcomes you. You could use the curtains but then someone would ask "where are the curtains?" Use the rug? Nah, too bulky and cumbersome. You then come to the same conclusion that every "empty roll dumper " must face.....pull up yer kecks tighten yer cheeks and shuffle yourself to the nearest loo roll. Failing that you could always use your shirt-tail or one of your socks!<br><br>The Splash Back Dump<br>This one drops like a depth charge creating a column of cold water that washes your sphincter with a startlingly unpleasant shock. Now your wet - and embarrassed if the column of water went half way up your back. Tip of the day: blot instead of wiping.<br><br>The Childbirth Dump<br>This one is just too big to go through the aperture provided by nature for this purpose. You sit there thinking over your dilemma. First it hurts, and then gets no better. You sweat violently and wonder if you'll ever see your loved ones again. You imagine the newspaper headlines screaming "Man dies trying to hatch monster loaf!" There are only three things you can do: 1. Scream 2. Call an Obstetrician 3. Hope to hell you've got some Vaseline to help you get through it.<br><br>The Machine Gun Dump<br>Best utilized in public conveniences. You sit there in sublime peace when suddenly you emit a group of noisy gassy bursts that break the tranquility like machine gun fire. The guy in the next cubicle hits the floor like a Vietnam veteran, cradling his umbrella like a M16....damn commies.<br><br>The Sound Effect Dump<br>You feel a noisy one coming on but relatives, friends or work mates are within earshot. So, you must employ some clever techniques to cover the disgusting sounds you are about to emit. Timing is of the essence. At the precise moment of release, try the following: 1. Flush the toilet 2. Drop loose change on the floor, 3. Sing the first two stanzas of your favorite opera.<br><br>The Cling-On Dump<br>You've finished but there's one damn morsel that refuses to drop. You grip the seat with both hands and wriggle. You twist and pump but the little bastard just hands there, suspended, clinging like a canned peach between you and the water below. If only you had some scissors.......<br><br>The Whole Roll Dump<br>No matter how much you wipe, it just isn't enough. You blow the whole roll and have to flush at least a dozen times. The whole episode is consumer waste. Eventually if your toilet paper runs into minimal supply anything will do, towels, wash clothes, carpet, walls, whatever it takes.<br><br>The Encore Dump<br>Ahhh, you've done, so you wipe, dress, flush, wash hands and are about to leave the auditorium when you feel another dump coming on. You must therefore return for a curtain call. The world record is seven encores.....<br><br>The Houdini Dump<br>You go, you stand to flush and it has disappeared! Did it creep down the pipe or did you dream the whole thing? Should you flush? Oh yes as you can guarantee that if you don't, it will reappear and smile at the next person who comes in.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

It stays with you all day stinging yer ring and generally making your choccie starfish feel like the Shuttle's heat shield. Also makes your ass look like "a Japanese Flag".<br><br>The Empty Roll Dump<br>Relief - you've finished and reach for the tissue only to find an empty cardboard cylinder staring back at you. Panic overcomes you. You could use the curtains but then someone would ask "where are the curtains?" Use the rug? Nah, too bulky and cumbersome. You then come to the same conclusion that every "empty roll dumper " must face.....pull up yer kecks tighten yer cheeks and shuffle yourself to the nearest loo roll. Failing that you could always use your shirt-tail or one of your socks!<br><br>The Splash Back Dump<br>This one drops like a depth charge creating a column of cold water that washes your sphincter with a startlingly unpleasant shock. Now your wet - and embarrassed if the column of water went half way up your back. Tip of the day: blot instead of wiping.<br><br>The Childbirth Dump<br>This one is just too big to go through the aperture provided by nature for this purpose. You sit there thinking over your dilemma. First it hurts, and then gets no better. You sweat violently and wonder if you'll ever see your loved ones again. You imagine the newspaper headlines screaming "Man dies trying to hatch monster loaf!" There are only three things you can do: 1. Scream 2. Call an Obstetrician 3. Hope to hell you've got some Vaseline to help you get through it.<br><br>The Machine Gun Dump<br>Best utilized in public conveniences. You sit there in sublime peace when suddenly you emit a group of noisy gassy bursts that break the tranquility like machine gun fire. The guy in the next cubicle hits the floor like a Vietnam veteran, cradling his umbrella like a M16....damn commies.<br><br>The Sound Effect Dump<br>You feel a noisy one coming on but relatives, friends or work mates are within earshot. So, you must employ some clever techniques to cover the disgusting sounds you are about to emit. Timing is of the essence. At the precise moment of release, try the following: 1. Flush the toilet 2. Drop loose change on the floor, 3. Sing the first two stanzas of your favorite opera.<br><br>The Cling-On Dump<br>You've finished but there's one damn morsel that refuses to drop. You grip the seat with both hands and wriggle. You twist and pump but the little bastard just hands there, suspended, clinging like a canned peach between you and the water below. If only you had some scissors.......<br><br>The Whole Roll Dump<br>No matter how much you wipe, it just isn't enough. You blow the whole roll and have to flush at least a dozen times. The whole episode is consumer waste. Eventually if your toilet paper runs into minimal supply anything will do, towels, wash clothes, carpet, walls, whatever it takes.<br><br>The Encore Dump<br>Ahhh, you've done, so you wipe, dress, flush, wash hands and are about to leave the auditorium when you feel another dump coming on. You must therefore return for a curtain call. The world record is seven encores.....<br><br>The Houdini Dump<br>You go, you stand to flush and it has disappeared! Did it creep down the pipe or did you dream the whole thing? Should you flush? Oh yes as you can guarantee that if you don't, it will reappear and smile at the next person who comes in.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>WTF!!!LOL!!!</div>
