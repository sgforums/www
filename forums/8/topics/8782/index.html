            <div class='col-md body'>Qwerty, not a bad piece of writing coming from a local studying overseas. So, you are studying overseas coz you couldnÂ’t get into NUS? Does that mean that you are also one of these good-for-nothing loafers who go overseas to smoke pot, drink, club etc, except study? (btw, you havenÂ’t showed me your havoc pictures  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">)Â…to think that you are actually criticizing people of your own kind.<br><br>Your parents have spent an enormous amount of money to send you abroad to study, and yet, what have you learnt? What have you been doing the past year that you were away? Learnt to fold paper aeroplanes and throw them at your supervisors?<br><br>Qwerty, you show no respect at all for the foreign universities by giving them all sorts of names. Woodbridge? Cow? Bastard? Do you know how many people yearn to go to these prestigious universities but can never make it? Now, if all students studying abroad think and behave the way you do, then I would really want to thank my lucky stars that you are not in NUS. I dread the thought of having to study in the same place with someone like you. I guess itÂ’s people like you who bring down the reputations of these fine foreign universities.<br><br>So, when are you going to decide to give up pursuing your foreign degree and come back and sell chicken rice? IÂ’ll be waiting for another treat from you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

The reason why these Universities are so prestigious is due to the number of papers they produce not the standard of teaching .<br><br>Are you saying our local universites are inferior to these foreign universities you mentioned ? Alot of local U students who hear this will be angry that someone say their University is inferior .<br><br>Don't be fooled by the so-called higher standards of these so-called prestigious foreign Universities . All you need is some lucky academic results and the ability to con them during the interview and you're in already .<br><br>And I really can't stand those graduates from those so-called prestigious universities they really make me sick .<br>Thats why I'm glad to say I don't know any one from those Universities.</div>

But we're comparing quality here . I mean if all things being equal , you as an employer would have to choose between 2 differnet University graduates which do you choose ?<br>A local University or a Foreign University graduate .<br><br>As for marketable subjects . Things like engineering , medicine is pretty useful since they are real subjects .<br><br>Subjects like management are pretty useless don't you agree ?
