            <div class='col-md body'>qwerty, my example was specific. if you compare nus and cambridge, i would say that cambridge is better. it is afterall the best uni in UK. but, i do not want to make a sweeping statement that local unis are inferior to all foreign unis. If you compare local uni with the foreign unis in this region, they are in no way inferior.<br><br>in a general sense, management does sound simpler than engineering, since engineering is a technical subject. however, management is about relating to people, and managing them. some people do not have these people skills and to ask them to do management would be a chore to them. they'll rather interact with non-living things, which is why some people can only be engineers, but never managers.<br><br></div>

If you compare local uni with the foreign unis in this region, they are in no way inferior.<br><br>in a general sense, management does sound simpler than engineering, since engineering is a technical subject. however, management is about relating to people, and managing them. some people do not have these people skills and to ask them to do management would be a chore to them. they'll rather interact with non-living things, which is why some people can only be engineers, but never managers.<br><br></div></blockquote>My Dear Sparkle ,<br><br>You have shown me the light . I agree with what you say about Cambridge and NUS with NUS being not as good as you say . I concede this fact rather reluctantly as I feel I've let down my brothers and sisters for not defending our University ...sighz<br><br>I also agree that management jobs are tougher since they have to deal with people . Skills which you pick up since kindergarten and pursued to the University level . Engineering is just a technical subject where you deal with numbers . I'm pretty sure a management graduate can become an engineer if he bothered to learn to count since its quite a simple chore for anyone to do .<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>goodnite...me logging off</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Qwerty has missed some of the other aims of studying overseas. Other than drink and club etc, there is also the convenience of driving cheap cars, indulging in carnal pleasures and staying away from the family. Dammit, its unfair.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, its pretty vague to compare generally as usual. There is so much difference in the quality of education in different universities and standards vary with whatever faculty you talk about.<br><br>I guess the important thing is that the student embraces the opportunity to study overseas and enjoy themselves while studying hard. Its really a privilege which only a proportion (albeit increasing) of people have. Including the very people who post here.<br><br>For every arrogant bigshot who acts like he/ she is the greatest just because he/ she studied overseas, there is another foreign graduate who has benefited from the exposure and the independence that living overseas has afforded him/ her. A larger world view, different concepts, refreshing outlooks.... These are what overseas universities potentially offer.<br><br>As well, being able to enter another university gives people a second chance for tertiary education. They might have failed to qualify for it initially due to some temporary setback.<br><br>Studying overseas is just a process. How people turn out from this process has a lot to do with the individual.<br><br>Say, the main posters would not be by any chance trying to argue against their own case, are they? I.e. the ones who enjoyed studying locally arguing why its better to go overseas, and vice versa.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 25 August 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha...... Pacman, I have absolutely no idea the rationale behind this thread. It might be due to the fact that the culprit's got a screw loose somewhere, tsk tsk tsk...... TRYING to invite flames which I have yet to see him get, but I think he won't get anyway.<br><br>Well, regarding local and overseas studies, as of any other stuff, have their own pros and cons. One chief attraction (and sometimes a disincentive) that one has overseas is the fact that you are responsible for your very own actions. No mama to run back to when you do something wrong, no family friends to bail you out when you do something wrong. Everything is down to you, you and you.<br><br>Exposure, that is a definite plus. But with NUS and NTU opening up, increasing their intake of overseas students to, can't remember the figure, roughly 20%? There will definitely be no shortage of intense competition and high calibre graduates from these universities. So if the system is changed to one whereby there are more opportunities for exchange of cultures between local and foreign students, that would be icing on the cake. Anyway, I think it is tougher to get a good honours in Singapore then abroad. Don't you think so?<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There would be flames had he been genuinely pompous.<br><br>No idea about honours though. I guess Singaporean universities are really competitive academically. Honors is way out of my league and I aim for passes. Not able to comment on that.<br><br>I guess opening up the universities to foreign students is one thing. As to whether any productive cultural exchange can come out of it, we sure hope so. I sure hope the visitors don't crumble under the stress of our educational system.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 25 August 2000).]</div>
