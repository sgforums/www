            <div class='col-md body'>My theory, is that there will be a third world war and most of the males will be enlisted in the fighting of the war and unsuprisingly will perish in this war, leaving behind only a limited number of males with tons of females. The remaining males are then ordered by the female leaders to become reproductive machines. However due to the nuclear fallout that has occured in the war, males chromosomes are damaged by the microwaves, leaving them able to only produce female offspring - resulting in an increasing female population.<br><br>Thus the world becomes dominated only by the female species.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I'll have to disagree with Gambler about the Maths part. I think girls are better at Maths. Just look at their performances in the international olympiads. Our students top the world man!! And most of the time, they're gals.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Notice Accountancy and Economics are very popular among the females? I would say females have a knack for calculating stuff and keeping things in balance. Don't you agree?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I do feel likewise about the part where their memory are better than the guys'.<br><br>I would say that the males have more practical but flexible minds. Usually, it is the males to come up with radical reasonings and ideas. We usually excel in physics, electronics, computers. Of course, there are exceptions. There are those who are good in management and business too. But in terms of creativity... just to give some examples, the best chefs (yes, it was mentioned above), designers, hair stylists, sculptors, inventors, are all (well, mostly) males. I must agree that females do not lose out when it comes to handiwork, but innovations and inspirations are usually what separates the best from the good.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it'll be unfair to compare the physical aspects of the 2 sexes. Somehow, male humans have evolved to be physically stronger than their female counterparts. But I think the females don't need to have strong bodies to make the guys go weak in the knees (you know what I mean...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">)<br><br>Basically, it's the mentality. I think we have to realise that for the human race to flourish, both sexes have to complement each other. When I say complement, I don't mean that we depend on each other to reproduce. Females have their specific ways of thinking and so do males. The key is to find a middle ground where both can maximise their contribution to the human race without compromise. Females tend to excel in certain mental aspects and guys complement with other aspects. So to plot an infinity curve, the equlibrium is not any one sex leading the world, but doing it together.<br><br>To feminists who insists that females are the future and usually overuse the fact that all man are borne from mothers, here's a techno note which ought to debunk this fact once and for all:<br><br>I'm sure we are all aware of IVF (in-vitro fertilisation)? Here, we only need the sperm. Male is out of the picture. Then we have this recent news that scientists have realised that a foetus can be developed outside a mother's womb, contrarary to believes. So as long as the environment is right, a life can be created. Now the Female's out of the picture.<br><br>So now, the ingredients are sperm, egg and (artificial) incubator. In case you haven't realise, the Human Genome Project will be completed next year. From that point onwards, the study of the human DNA will be accelerated, to a stage that mabbe even the sperm and egg can be artificially produced. 10 years, 20 years, mabbe even 50 years. The time will come when the first man-made human will be borne. It's a scary thought, but entirely plausible.<br><br>So feminists, argue while you still can, coz' it'll only be a matter of time before you realise that separated, the two sexes will definitely perish, but together, they will be one and the human race will flourish!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The future is going to be female in a certain aspect. Women now know more of their rights and how to assert them, as compared to say a hundred years back. This makes them appear more "domineering" when in fact women have been the same all this time.<br><br>Singapore women for one thing actually realise what it means to be a modern woman. The new mentality as specified in the Straits Time is that it is hip to be single. Women also like to retort that they "won't depend on men"...which is a rather feminist concept. No one ever said the woman is "weaker" if she had to depend on a guy or if she got married but society simply views it that way - that the wife is the meek and submissive one if she's the housewife and the husband is the breadwinner..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>As for the Human Genome project, yes it's true they plan to elucidate the entire genetic sequence of every single gene in the human body. Full details of nucleotide sequence, possible mutations (leading to congenital disorders) and chromosomal abberations would then be available in say....20 years time ? At the rapid rate technology is progressing, I won't be surprised.<br><br>I would think that even if there was a choice to "produce" human beings artificially, not everyone would wish that. Woman are still basically human and would want a man in her life to keep her company. The guy is not just the "propagator of genes" so to speak...he provides an emotional and psychological support for women too. The same goes for men although it may seem that men would die without woman  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>It is important to remember that we humans can create life only to the extent that we can replicate the chemicals that make up life. We are unable to clone the SOUL.....I may not be a Christian but I believe that the  essence of what something "alive" cannot be recreated in a laboratory.<br><br>Scientists have often created protoplasm by combining all its chemical constituents but the end-product is that it is a dead cell, and they have no way of making it "live"...<br><br>Enough said on this...cheers all !</div>
