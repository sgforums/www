The most confident human being will still fall by virtue of the fact that he is exactly that, a human.<br><br>Yes Kelvin, many people turn to God when their in dire straits. Many christians, in fact, do that. When things are rosy they forget him, when things aren't, he's the almighty savior. To me these people are worse than non-christians. But let's not get religious here.<br><br>By the way. I'm not necessarily talking about myself in the first post.<br><br>I believe if a person feels this way about his life and approaching breaking point it may not necessarily be a bad thing. Such breaking point situations define a being's character. It will change them, for better or worse it's just up to them.<br><br>It's all well and good to say, "Eh pick your god damn sorry self up and smell the roses."<br><br>Do you think that really helps?</div>
