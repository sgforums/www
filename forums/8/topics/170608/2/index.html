There are many cases of industry espionage and sack internally.<br><br>Thats why the ST group suffer a big lost $600m for failing to understand the complexity of hdd R&amp;D, manufacturing and components and competition despite being warn first hand on buying a useless team and outdated R&amp;D.<br><br>Many of these mergers or acquisition involves picking the best R&amp;D and manufacturing capability to jump start on someone knowledge and platform and to add value to existing or new team.  Thats how seagate survive.  They cherry pick from company to company, in this case maxtor has something they can leverage on.<br><br>Philips does their main R&amp;D here in toa payoh.  These consumer products transfer to do R&amp;D here does not post a threat due to the kind of knowledge transfer.  Some Handphone R&amp;D can also be done with small startups and emerging everywhere in china.   These R&amp;D are also transfer to china or local countries at the same time for local designs.<br><br>How much R&amp;D will still depends on nature of products.<br><br>No other countries can get their hands on maxtor except an american company or america allied company.  You can imagine the tremedous impact it will have in the hdd industry if PRC takes over maxtor even at triple the price.  MAxtor will gets the 50% business in china by default, not to mention the R&amp;D rights and contents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Most of the companies will do it quietly if the job cuts can be done gradually and in batches. i heard from most of my friends. All companies are having cost cutting exercise. Either adding more work to you or show you the door!!!<br><br>As i said to my friends before, Singapore is gradually becoming a paradise for rich people but a hell for common people.<br><br>All the profits will go to investors / rich people.<br>The left-over will only be given to common people so that common people can survive and keep working..<br><br>Well, sad to say, rich people still need common people to serve them.<br><br>Just a note: our retirement age is longer and longer to ensure we work most of the time in our life.<br><br>I was hesitant to post this as it's probably is too 'deep' or too 'chim'.
