            <div class='col-md body'>honestly i think the driver has done nothing wrong, at the most he just asked the wrong question. i mean of course she tapped the card otherwise would there be an error.<br><br>the old lady simply is arrogant and horribly bad-tempered.what has her grandchildren being graduates,selling cars, challenging the driver to a fight and calling ppl to back her up in a fight has to with being asked if she tapped the card?  simply irrational. she is being arrogant abt her children being successful in life. fine, you may argue that she has a bad day and they tend to be grumpy etc,but scolding the driver to such an extent simply doesnt warrant such rough attitude.<br><br>sometimes we look pity or at least take into consideration what each and every bus/taxi drivers etc, have to go through each day.<br>insults,praises,commendations,polite commuters,etc.<br>if u are unhappy, be reminded that you are only going thru this for the length of yr journey, he has to bear with all this all day for the rest of his life.<br><br>my 2 cents worth</div>

You come down from your driver seat and we go to one side and fight it out................"<br><br>And the rattling goes on. My stop is here and I alighted from the bus. At time the bus is very crowded and how can the bus driver see whether the old lady has zapped the card? Ahysterical old lady or just a pure misunderstanding? Is the driver's fault or the illiterate old lady fault for "zappng" the card too fast?<br><br>What does this tell us?............</div></blockquote>i think the old lady has a problem wif self esteem.<br><br>she has low self esteem thats why when people jus say anything she will be oversensitive, thinking people are looking down on her and yada yada... she probably is quite lonely too tts why the ranting when no one asked for all that. perhaps she was rather rich in the past but lost quite a huge part of her assets recently causing the soreness and the need to take public transport.<br><br>in the end she mus be delirious to want to fight with the young man.<br><br>mabbe shes jus a siao zarbor.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's no one's fault but the old lady I tell you...people see her old trying to help her then she got problem...depending on what tone she was in and how I was in the situation that old lady will definitely kana from me man. I don't care old she is.<br><br>Being old doesn't give you the right to act like that. It's not like being old is a disability and neither is it an advantage to treat people like that. I respect the old people that deserve to be respected. Some just never learn after experiencing life for so long and are full of crap.<br><br>I don't discriminate treat if she want to act like that treat her like any other person full of crap regardless of age, she should know better. Ok, maybe children cannot treat like that ah, cause they're younger....</div>
