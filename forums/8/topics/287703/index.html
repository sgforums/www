Encourage partner to continue close friendships with others. Each partner allows space for independent activities. Partner willing to accept others wishes-even when ending the relationship without causing self-destruction or devastation. (this is an ideal relationship)<br><br>Romantic love-everything seems perfect-when we think we have found that perfect partner. All traits are viewed as positive; selfish, stubborn, or thoughtless are portrayed as independent, determined, and absent-minded, and possessive becomes devoted.<br><br>Intimate love- This is the part of love that makes you feel close to your partner. It involves feelings of trust, security, and self-disclosure. It usually develops over time as people get to know each other better. Intimacy makes you feel comfortable talking to your partner and opening up to him or her.<br><br>Passion love- This is the feeling of being physically attracted to your partner and having the desire to express it sexually. It doesn't mean that you have to express your passion sexually, but usually some physical desire is present. Passion is that feeling of always wanting to be near your partner and always thinking about your partner. Passion usually characterizes the first stages of a relationship. Passion can, however, be similar to infatuation or lust.<br><br>COMMITMENT love- This is the decision you make to be loyal and faithful to your partner in many ways. It involves openly and honestly deciding that you both want to strive to have a satisfying and lasting relationship. This involves planning for the future, working out problems, and consciously not doing things that you think would hurt your partner.<br><br></div>
