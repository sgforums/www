Else it will be such a waste if the guy gives up and you decide to salvage it by getting him back. when you attempt to salvage then he will play hard to get!

In that Scarlett O'Hara wasnt playing hard to get, but she was *not there* in her relationship with Rhett Butler. However I believe that Rhett was one such man who seeks challenges. When you find yourself really wanting to capture the heart of such a *try-me!* guy or someone who needs to go through pains to realise how good you are, you will need handle your relationship a certain way? =)<br><br>But for some guys who are more shy and less experienced with girls, playing hard to get can backfire. You will want to be just nice and natural with them =)<br><br>I think all these are the different faces of a girl that makes the whole courting game fun =) Never bully a guy who likes you.. he cant help liking you.. just follow your heart and Good luck to you and *him*   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>You are my first star at night, I'd be lost in space without you<br>I'll never lose my faith in you,<br>How will I ever get to heaven if I do</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi Scarlett!  Such a coincidence! I posted something like this about a few months back.  Guess this is something both of us were (are?) pondering over.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The problem with humans is that they don't treasure everything that comes easily.  Take for example the love of parents.  Usually parents come to us "free", i.e. we don't have to do anything to get their unconditional love.  But do we care?  Nooo!  We are usually too hung-up over the boy in school we have a crush on, or the cute babe at the bus-stop we saw this morning.  We do any, and everything to get their attention.  We don't take them for granted because they are not ours... yet.<br><br>But Scarlett, take heart.  Not every guy wants a girl who plays hard to get.  Like so many people has said,  just be what you are.  There's no point in acting cool and icy to get someone when you are not like that inside.  We all deserve someone who likes us for what we are, and not what we are acting as.  Anyway, its so tiring to put up a front on the time right?  :p</div>
