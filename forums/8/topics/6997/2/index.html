            <div class='col-md body'>Scarlett:<br><br>Playing hard to get...You have to know your target, and know what you want<br>from it.  At times, I play hard to get, but I have to make sure I know what<br>is it that I want from him, from the relationship.  If it's just for fun,<br>then why not?!  We are girls, and girls love attention, the more the merrier<br>rt?!  OF COZ!  If you want to be serious w/ a guy, then it's better to be<br>yourself cuz you really don't want him to fall for someone that is not<br>you...get what i mean?  If you do play hard to get, and once you develop<br>feelings for him and he realized that you are not the same girl her met b4,<br>then how?  He will eventually loose interest and you are left w/ a broken<br>heart.  It's okie to play hard to get, but you have to know when to stop.<br><br>My personally experience is...I play hard to get, guys chase, the harder<br>they chase the faster I run, but there will be a time where I have to slow<br>down, and that's when I develop feelings for him.  Or, if i don't slow down<br>and continue to run, they will eventually get out of breath and stop<br>chasing.  If he does, I will get hurt.  Why?!  Cuz all these time, I have<br>enjoyed playing this game w/ him, and once he stop playing I will have an<br>empty feeling.  What happen next?!  Well, I will start to chase then cuz I<br>feel the need for him to continue to play this game.  I enjoy the attention,<br>I enjoy his company.<br><br>For, me...Playing hard to get is flirting.  I flirt w/ no intention to hurt<br>anyone, but at times it's does hurt the other party.  Once I find a guy i<br>like, I don't play anymore...I tend to be myself and tell him how I feel,<br>but I never initate first!  =P<br><br>Not all guys that like "hard-to-get" girls are consider as bad guys.  They<br>just merely want some fun while courting the girl.  Just like you will start<br>a essay w/ a interesting sentense rt?  Chasing hard to get girls is like a<br>ego-boost for guys.  They feel a sense of accomplishment once they get the<br>girl.  They feel that they can do anything.  But those guys are humans also,<br>they have feelings, if you really want to play hard to get to those guys,<br>you have to beat them at their own game.  Know what you want and what he<br>wants and then at that point set the rules and plan your game.<br><br>If you do decide to play hard to get, give it a shot.  See if you enjoy it,<br>but lemme warn you, once you start to play w/ fire you are bound to get burn<br>one way or another...<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>
