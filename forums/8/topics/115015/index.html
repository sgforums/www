Vaseegaran owns 50 companies worldwide with a turnover of more than Rs 1000 Crores lives alone in a palatial house with his ‘Nani' (who brings him up from childhood) and a host of servants. He has no friends and the only person who is close to him was his nani who always reads Cinderella stories to him. Vaseegaran was also a neglected child as his parents were interested only in business and multiplying their money rather than taking care of their child. One of the bad habits of Vaseegaran is that he is a kleptomaniac. He enjoys flicking cell phones, pens, gold rings etc. Vidhya (Priya Mani) who belongs to a middle class family one day happens to witness Vaseegaran stealing one of the curios from a huge shopping mall but when she follows him somewhere down the stairs she misses him. On another occasion Vaseegaran steals an expensive diamond worth of 10 Crores from an exhibition where Vidhya works as the sales girl. Now the theft falls on innocent Vidhya but she identifies the thief to the police officers through the CC Video cameras installed at the venue. But everyone gets surprised including her fiancÃ©e Pratap (Akash), a police officer, when Vidhya points out the fourth richest Indian as the thief. But they give her chance to prove her innocence. Vidhya makes a plan and enters Vaseegaran's house as his secretary there by she can get back the diamond. But Vaseegaran falls for her the moment he sees her and he starts believing that Vidhya is his dream girl Cinderella come true. But Vidhya's true colors get revealed before she could get the hidden diamond. But Vaseegaran is so obsessed that he does not allow her that easily and promises her that he would give her back the diamond if she agrees to spend with him five days in Switzerland . He also promises that he would not even touch her. Though Vidhya was not game for it, circumstances force her to accept his condition. The rest of the story is how both of them fly to Swiss and the incidents, which lead to gory climax.<br><br>Vaseegarn, the debutant hero looks ok as the guy neglected from childhood, but he has to go a long way by way of acting. Hardly there are any expressions as a love possessed man with a negative shade. Priya Mani fits well for the role and also has given a good performance. Bharathy Raja has moved away from his usual rustic style to a thriller (though he has given films like Sigappu Rojakkal, Tik TikTik etc years back), which has a fairly good story. But the inconsistencies in the screenplay mar the speed of the film. This could be the result of the film being under production for a long time. Rahman does it again. Especially the songs  are sure to hit the chartbusters. The camera work by Kannan needs special mention especially in the songs<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2nd half of Lai Theme music is fantastic dude! ARR had never done anything like this before..a bit of note here.this is not ARR's usual fare...more like symphony orchestration music..quote by Rahman himself=<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I have been watching Chinese movies for the seven years — the ones in the festival circuit. Sony Classical and Columbia Pictures are producing the movie. It was Sony’s head who had offered me the film Warriors of Heaven and Earth. It’s about the silk route from China through Turkey to India. My music is a mix of Indian, Turkish and Chinese. The director He Ping had heard my Lagaan and Vande Mataram albums and liked them so much that he made a ‘temp-track’ and used it in his film, which quite impressed me. The musical score was done in Prague, London and mixing here in Chennai in my studios with a sound engineer from the US." - A.R.Rahman [New Indian Express]</span><br><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/director79k/WOHEpage.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/director79k/WOHEpage.html</a></div>
