            <div class='col-md body'>25 Year Old Beauty Seeks Rich Banker<br>05/10/2007 following exchange took place on Craigslist - donÂ’t miss investment banker's response<br><br>'What am I doing wrong?Â’<br>Okay, IÂ’m tired of beating around the bush. IÂ’m a beautiful (spectacularly beautiful) 25 year old girl. IÂ’m articulate and classy. IÂ’m not from . IÂ’m looking to get married to a guy who makes at least half a million a year. I know how that sounds, but keep in mind that a million a year is middle class in New York City, so I donÂ’t think IÂ’m overreaching at all.<br>Are there any guys who make 500K or more on this board ? Any wives ? Could you send me some tips ? I dated a business man who made an average of around 200 - 250K. But thatÂ’s where I seem to hit a roadblock. $250,000 wonÂ’t get me to Central Park West. I know a woman in my yoga class who was married to an investment banker, and lives in Tribeca. SheÂ’s not as pretty as I am, nor is she a great genius. So what is she doing right ? How do I get to her level ?<br>Here are my questions specifically:<br>- Where do you single rich men hang out ? Give me specifics - bars, restaurants, gyms<br>- What are you looking for in a mate? Be honest guys, you wonÂ’t hurt my feelings<br>- Is there an age range I should be targeting ?<br>- Why are some of the women living lavish lifestyles on the so plain? IÂ’ve seen really Â‘Plain JaneÂ’ boring types, who have nothing to offer incredibly wealthy guys. Then IÂ’ve seen drop dead gorgeous girls in singles bars in the . WhatÂ’s the story there ?<br>- Lawyers, investment bankers, doctors. How much do those guys really make ? And where do the hedge fund guys hang out ?<br>- How do you rich guys decide on marriage vs. just a girlfriend ? I am looking for MARRIAGE ONLY.<br>Please hold your insults - IÂ’m putting myself out there in an honest way. Most beautiful women are superficial - at least IÂ’m being up front about it. I wouldnÂ’t be searching for these kind of guys if I wasnÂ’t able to match them - in looks, culture, sophistication, and keeping a nice hearth and home'.<br><br>An Investment Banker's Response:<br>Dear Pers-431649184:<br>'I read your posting with great interest and have thought meaningfully about your dilemma. I offer the following analysis of your predicament.<br>Firstly, IÂ’m not wasting your time. I qualify as a guy who fits your bill - that is, I make more than $500K per year. That said, hereÂ’s how I see it:<br>Your offer, from the prospective of a guy like me, is a plain and simple crappy business deal. HereÂ’s why. Cutting through all the B.S., what you suggest is a simple trade: you bring your looks to the party and I bring my money. Fine, simple. But hereÂ’s the rub, your looks will fade and my money will likely continue into perpetuity - in fact, it is very likely that my income will increase, but it is an absolute certainty that you wonÂ’t be getting any more beautiful!<br>So, in economic terms, you are a depreciating asset. Not only are you a depreciating asset, however, your depreciation accelerates! Let me explain - youÂ’re 25 now and will likely remain pretty hot for the next 5 years, but less so each year. Then the fade begins in earnest. By 35 - stick a fork in you!<br>So, in Wall Street terms, we'd call you a trading position - not a buy and holdÂ…hence the rubÂ…marriage. It doesnÂ’t make good business sense to 'buy you' (which is what youÂ’re asking) - so IÂ’d rather lease. In case you think IÂ’m being cruel, I would say the following: if my money were to go away, so would you - so when your beauty fades I need an out too. ItÂ’s as simple as that. So the deal that makes sense for me is dating, not marriage.<br>Separately, I was taught early in my career about efficient markets. So, I wonder why a girl as 'articulate, classy and spectacularly beautiful' as you has been unable to find your sugar daddy. I find it hard to believe that, if you are as gorgeous as you say you are, your $500K man hasnÂ’t found you - if only for a tryout.<br>By the way, you could always find a way to make your own money - and then we wouldnÂ’t need to have this difficult conversation.<br>With all that said, I must say youÂ’re going about it the right way. Classic 'pump and dump'. I hope this is helpful, and if you want to enter into some sort of lease, please let me know'.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by boredtulan:</div><div class="quote_body">An Investment Banker's Response:<br>Dear Pers-431649184:<br>'I read your posting with great interest and have thought meaningfully about your dilemma. I offer the following analysis of your predicament.<br>Firstly, IÂ’m not wasting your time. I qualify as a guy who fits your bill - that is, I make more than $500K per year. That said, hereÂ’s how I see it:<br>Your offer, from the prospective of a guy like me, is a plain and simple crappy business deal. HereÂ’s why. Cutting through all the B.S., what you suggest is a simple trade: you bring your looks to the party and I bring my money. Fine, simple. But hereÂ’s the rub, your looks will fade and my money will likely continue into perpetuity - in fact, it is very likely that my income will increase, but it is an absolute certainty that you wonÂ’t be getting any more beautiful!<br>So, in economic terms, you are a depreciating asset. Not only are you a depreciating asset, however, your depreciation accelerates! Let me explain - youÂ’re 25 now and will likely remain pretty hot for the next 5 years, but less so each year. Then the fade begins in earnest. By 35 - stick a fork in you!<br>So, in Wall Street terms, we'd call you a trading position - not a buy and holdÂ…hence the rubÂ…marriage. It doesnÂ’t make good business sense to 'buy you' (which is what youÂ’re asking) - so IÂ’d rather lease. In case you think IÂ’m being cruel, I would say the following: if my money were to go away, so would you - so when your beauty fades I need an out too. ItÂ’s as simple as that. So the deal that makes sense for me is dating, not marriage.<br>Separately, I was taught early in my career about efficient markets. So, I wonder why a girl as 'articulate, classy and spectacularly beautiful' as you has been unable to find your sugar daddy. I find it hard to believe that, if you are as gorgeous as you say you are, your $500K man hasnÂ’t found you - if only for a tryout.<br>By the way, you could always find a way to make your own money - and then we wouldnÂ’t need to have this difficult conversation.<br>With all that said, I must say youÂ’re going about it the right way. Classic 'pump and dump'. I hope this is helpful, and if you want to enter into some sort of lease, please let me know'.</div></blockquote>In summary...if you the her beauty and his money calculate it with discounted rate and get the future value....one is going cheaper as time goes by..e.g. P4 PC is ex last time but cheap now, while another is going up, e.g a piece of land in orchard road.... so....the actual present value of the gal maybe only worth $1 while that guy may worth $1M....<br><br>Conclusion.. gal ar.. dun be so choosy lah.. u think u who?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nothing wrong in being choosy what....she just want to choose the most expensive dick she can stuff up her vagina and then call all her other howlian friends to show-off with the gold dick still inside her.<br><br>Guys also the same thing one...if can screw a rich girl, who would want to screw a poorer girl if both are available to screw? Most probably also will screw the rich one then go to NS/Army to howlian to all his bunk mates for his entire NS/Army career....maybe even to the extend of spreading it to his university mates?<br><br>Who doesn't like branded stuffs? Not to mention branded human private sex organs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
