              <p>I think it is possible even though the chinese greatly outnumber them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The mongols under Genghis Khan and the manchus are good examples.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The manchus were estimated to have only about 200 000 troops under them when they conquered China and set up the Qing dynasty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The mongols under Genghis Khan were also estimated to be only able to send up to a maximum of 200 000 troops only but they also managed to conquer Chian and set up the Yuan dynasty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So if Japan had concetrated its army on just attacking China and treated the chinese well to win them over they could have conquered China.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like Genghis Khan had this policy than any cities that surrendered to the mongols without fighting them he will not kill any of them. But for those cities that fight with the mongols, once the mongols have conquered the city they will massacre the people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So this policy actually made it easier for him to conquer them and reduced the casualities his army may suffer and also help him win the hearts of the people which he conquered.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So if Japan had come out with such policies, they could actually conquer the whole of China</p>

              <p>during world war 2 the china government was also weak and corrupted and divided too.</p>

              <p>Don't think so, they didn't have enough troops or fuel to carry on a long war.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3><strong><a name="p2">THE BASIS OF THE PROBLEM</a></strong></h3>
              <p>9. Why is the War of Resistance Against Japan a protracted war? Why will
              the final victory be China's? What is the basis for these statements?</p>
              <p>The war between China and Japan is not just any war, it is specifically a
              war of life and death between semi-colonial and semi-feudal China and imperialist
              Japan, fought in the Nineteen Thirties. Herein lies the basis of the whole
              problem. The two sides in the war have many contrasting features, which will
              be considered in turn below.</p>
              <p>10<em>. The Japanese side. </em>First, Japan is a powerful imperialist country,
              which ranks first in the East in military, economic and political-organizational
              power, and is one of the five or six foremost imperialist countries of the
              world. These are the basic factors in Japan's war of aggression. The
              inevitability of the war and the impossibility of quick victory for China
              are due to Japan's imperialist system and her great military, economic and
              political-organizational power.</p>
              <p>Secondly, however, the imperialist character
              of Japan's social economy determines the imperialist character of her war,
              a war that is retrogressive and barbarous. In the Nineteen Thirties, the
              internal and external contradictions of Japanese imperialism have driven
              her not only to embark on an adventurist war unparalleled in scale but also
              to approach her final collapse. In terms of social development, Japan is
              no longer a thriving country; the war will not lead to the prosperity sought
              by her ruling classes but to the very reverse, the doom of Japanese imperialism.</p>
              <p>This is what we mean by the retrogressive nature of Japan's war. It is this
              reactionary quality, coupled with the military-feudal character of Japanese
              imperialism, that gives rise to the peculiar barbarity of Japan's war. All
              of which will arouse to the utmost the class antagonisms within Japan, the
              antagonism between the Japanese and the Chinese nations, and the antagonism
              between Japan and most other countries of the world. The reactionary and
              barbarous character of Japan's war constitutes the primary reason for her
              inevitable defeat.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, Japan's war is conducted on the basis of her
              great military, economic and political-organizational power, but at the same
              time it rests on an inadequate natural endowment. Japan's military, economic
              and political-organizational power is great but quantitatively inadequate.
              Japan is a comparatively small country, deficient in manpower and in military,
              financial and material resources, and she cannot stand a long war. Japan's
              rulers are endeavouring to resolve this difficulty through war, but again
              they will get the very reverse of what they desire; that is to say, the war
              they have launched to resolve this difficulty will eventually aggravate it
              and even exhaust Japan's original resources.</p>
              <p>Fourthly and lastly, while Japan
              can get international support from the fascist countries, the international
              opposition she is bound to encounter will be greater than her international
              support. This opposition will gradually grow and eventually not only cancel
              out the support but even bear down upon Japan herself. Such is the law that
              an unjust cause finds meagre support, and such is the consequence of the
              very nature of Japan's war. To sum up, Japan's advantage lies in her great
              capacity to wage war, and her disadvantages lie in the reactionary and barbarous
              nature of her war, in the inadequacy of her manpower and material resources,
              and in her meagre international support. These are the characteristics on
              the Japanese side.</p>
              <p>11. <em>The Chinese side. </em>First, we are a semi-colonial and semi-feudal
              country. The Opium War,<strong> </strong> the Taiping Revolution,  the Reform Movement of 1898,  the Revolution of 1911<strong> </strong>and the Northern Expedition<strong> </strong>--the revolutionary or reform movements which
              aimed at extricating China from her semi-colonial and semi-feudal state--all
              met with serious setbacks, and China remains a semi-colonial and semi-feudal
              country. We are still a weak country and manifestly inferior to the enemy
              in military, economic and political-organizational power. Here again one
              can find the basis for the inevitability of the war and the impossibility
              of quick victory for China.</p>
              <p>Secondly, however, China's liberation movement,
              with its cumulative development over the last hundred years, is now different
              from that of any previous period. Although the domestic and foreign forces
              opposing it have caused it serious setbacks, at the same time they have tempered
              the Chinese people. Although China today is not so strong as Japan militarily,
              economically, politically and culturally, yet there are factors in China
              more progressive than in any other period of her history. The Communist Party
              of China and the army under its leadership represent these progressive factors.
              It is on the basis of this progress that China's present war of liberation
              can be protracted and can achieve final victory. By contrast with Japanese
              imperialism, which is declining, China is a country rising like the morning
              sun. China's war is progressive, hence its just character. Because it is
              a just war, it is capable of arousing the nation to unity, of evoking the
              sympathy of the people in Japan and of winning the support of most countries
              in the world.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, and again by contrast with Japan, China is a very
              big country with vast territory, rich resources, a large population and plenty
              of soldiers, and is capable of sustaining a long war. Fourthly and lastly,
              there is broad international support for China stemming from the progressive
              and just character of her war, which is again exactly the reverse of the
              meagre support for Japan's unjust cause. To sum up, China's disadvantage
              lies in her military weakness, and her advantages lie in the progressive
              and just character of her war, her great size and her abundant international
              support. These are China's characteristics.</p>
              <p>12. Thus it can be seen that Japan has great military, economic and
              political-organizational power, but that her war is reactionary and barbarous,
              her manpower and material resources are inadequate, and she is in an unfavourable
              position internationally.</p>
              <p>China, on the contrary, has less military, economic
              and political-organizational power, but she is in her era of progress, her
              war is progressive and just, she is moreover a big country, a factor which
              enables her to sustain a protracted war, and she will be supported by most
              countries. The above are the basic, mutually contradictory characteristics
              of the Sino-Japanese war. They have determined and are determining all the
              political policies and military strategies and tactics of the two sides;
              they have determined and are determining the protracted character of the
              war and its outcome, namely, that the final victory will<strong> </strong>go to China
              and not to Japan.</p>
              <p>The war is a contest between these characteristics. They
              will change in the course of the war, each according to its own nature; and
              from this everything else will follow. These characteristics exist objectively
              and are not invented to deceive people; they constitute all the basic elements
              of the war, and are not incomplete fragments; they permeate all major and
              minor problems on both sides and all stages of the war, and they are not
              matters of no consequence. If anyone forgets these characteristics in studying
              the Sino-Japanese war, he will surely go wrong; and even though some of his
              ideas win credence for a time and may seem right, they will inevitably be
              proved wrong by the course of the war. On the basis of these characteristics
              we shall now proceed to explain the problems to be dealt with.</p>

              <p>By the beginning of 1941, the Japanese attack on China had bogged down and was in such imminent danger of collapse that something drastic had to be done. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But there was no agreement within Japan as to what direction such drastic action should take.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>A timid majority existed, even within the Japanese government itself, which would have been willing to withdraw from the Chinese "incident" if this could have been done without too great "loss of face." On the whole, this group was timid and ineffectual because of the danger of assassination by the extreme militarists and hyper-nationalist groups within Japan.</p>
              <p>Moreover, it was impossible to reach any agreement with the Chinese Nationalist government which would allow Japan to retain its "face" by covering a real withdrawal from China with an apparent diplomatic triumph of some sort.<br><br>The advocates of an aggressive policy in Japan were divided among the insignificant group who still believed that an all-out assault on China could be brought to a successful conclusion and the more influential groups who would have sought to redeem the stalemate in China by shifting the offensive against either Soviet Siberia or the rich Anglo-Dutch possessions of Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In the long run, the group which advocated a drive to the south was bound to prevail,</strong></span></span> because Malaysia and Indonesia were obviously weak and rich, while Soviet Siberia lacked those items (such as petroleum, rubber, or tin) which Japan most urgently needed, and it had demonstrated its power in the battles of 1938-1939.</p>
              <p>Germany, which originally encouraged the Japanese to move southward against British Malaysia and then, when it was too late, sought to redirect the Japanese blow against Siberia, played an insignificant role in Japan's policy.</p>
              <p>The decision to move southward, where the defense was weaker and the prizes so much greater, was made in an ambiguous and halfhearted way in the summer of 1941. The critical turning point was probably during the last week in July...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>So actually it can be seen that the Japanese digged their own grave by invading China in 1937.</p>

              <p>Don't think so, they didn't have enough troops or fuel to carry
              on a long war.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3><strong><a id="p2" rel="nofollow" name="p2">THE BASIS OF THE
              PROBLEM</a></strong></h3>
              <p>9. Why is the War of Resistance Against Japan a protracted war?
              Why will the final victory be China's? What is the basis for these
              statements?</p>
              <p>The war between China and Japan is not just any war, it is
              specifically a war of life and death between semi-colonial and
              semi-feudal China and imperialist Japan, fought in the Nineteen
              Thirties. Herein lies the basis of the whole problem. The two sides
              in the war have many contrasting features, which will be considered
              in turn below.</p>
              <p>10<em>. The Japanese side.</em> First, Japan is a powerful
              imperialist country, which ranks first in the East in military,
              economic and political-organizational power, and is one of the five
              or six foremost imperialist countries of the world. These are the
              basic factors in Japan's war of aggression. The inevitability of
              the war and the impossibility of quick victory for China are due to
              Japan's imperialist system and her great military, economic and
              political-organizational power.</p>
              <p>Secondly, however, the imperialist character of Japan's social
              economy determines the imperialist character of her war, a war that
              is retrogressive and barbarous. In the Nineteen Thirties, the
              internal and external contradictions of Japanese imperialism have
              driven her not only to embark on an adventurist war unparalleled in
              scale but also to approach her final collapse. In terms of social
              development, Japan is no longer a thriving country; the war will
              not lead to the prosperity sought by her ruling classes but to the
              very reverse, the doom of Japanese imperialism.</p>
              <p>This is what we mean by the retrogressive nature of Japan's war.
              It is this reactionary quality, coupled with the military-feudal
              character of Japanese imperialism, that gives rise to the peculiar
              barbarity of Japan's war. All of which will arouse to the utmost
              the class antagonisms within Japan, the antagonism between the
              Japanese and the Chinese nations, and the antagonism between Japan
              and most other countries of the world. The reactionary and
              barbarous character of Japan's war constitutes the primary reason
              for her inevitable defeat.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, Japan's war is conducted on the basis of her great
              military, economic and political-organizational power, but at the
              same time it rests on an inadequate natural endowment. Japan's
              military, economic and political-organizational power is great but
              quantitatively inadequate. Japan is a comparatively small country,
              deficient in manpower and in military, financial and material
              resources, and she cannot stand a long war. Japan's rulers are
              endeavouring to resolve this difficulty through war, but again they
              will get the very reverse of what they desire; that is to say, the
              war they have launched to resolve this difficulty will eventually
              aggravate it and even exhaust Japan's original resources.</p>
              <p>Fourthly and lastly, while Japan can get international support
              from the fascist countries, the international opposition she is
              bound to encounter will be greater than her international support.
              This opposition will gradually grow and eventually not only cancel
              out the support but even bear down upon Japan herself. Such is the
              law that an unjust cause finds meagre support, and such is the
              consequence of the very nature of Japan's war. To sum up, Japan's
              advantage lies in her great capacity to wage war, and her
              disadvantages lie in the reactionary and barbarous nature of her
              war, in the inadequacy of her manpower and material resources, and
              in her meagre international support. These are the characteristics
              on the Japanese side.</p>
              <p>11. <em>The Chinese side.</em> First, we are a semi-colonial and
              semi-feudal country. The Opium War,<strong> </strong> the
              Taiping Revolution,  the Reform Movement of 1898,  the
              Revolution of 1911 and the Northern Expedition --the revolutionary
              or reform movements which aimed at extricating China from her
              semi-colonial and semi-feudal state--all met with serious setbacks,
              and China remains a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country. We are
              still a weak country and manifestly inferior to the enemy in
              military, economic and political-organizational power. Here again
              one can find the basis for the inevitability of the war and the
              impossibility of quick victory for China.</p>
              <p>Secondly, however, China's liberation movement, with its
              cumulative development over the last hundred years, is now
              different from that of any previous period. Although the domestic
              and foreign forces opposing it have caused it serious setbacks, at
              the same time they have tempered the Chinese people. Although China
              today is not so strong as Japan militarily, economically,
              politically and culturally, yet there are factors in China more
              progressive than in any other period of her history. The Communist
              Party of China and the army under its leadership represent these
              progressive factors. It is on the basis of this progress that
              China's present war of liberation can be protracted and can achieve
              final victory. By contrast with Japanese imperialism, which is
              declining, China is a country rising like the morning sun. China's
              war is progressive, hence its just character. Because it is a just
              war, it is capable of arousing the nation to unity, of evoking the
              sympathy of the people in Japan and of winning the support of most
              countries in the world.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, and again by contrast with Japan, China is a very big
              country with vast territory, rich resources, a large population and
              plenty of soldiers, and is capable of sustaining a long war.
              Fourthly and lastly, there is broad international support for China
              stemming from the progressive and just character of her war, which
              is again exactly the reverse of the meagre support for Japan's
              unjust cause. To sum up, China's disadvantage lies in her military
              weakness, and her advantages lie in the progressive and just
              character of her war, her great size and her abundant international
              support. These are China's characteristics.</p>
              <p>12. Thus it can be seen that Japan has great military, economic
              and political-organizational power, but that her war is reactionary
              and barbarous, her manpower and material resources are inadequate,
              and she is in an unfavourable position internationally.</p>
              <p>China, on the contrary, has less military, economic and
              political-organizational power, but she is in her era of progress,
              her war is progressive and just, she is moreover a big country, a
              factor which enables her to sustain a protracted war, and she will
              be supported by most countries. The above are the basic, mutually
              contradictory characteristics of the Sino-Japanese war. They have
              determined and are determining all the political policies and
              military strategies and tactics of the two sides; they have
              determined and are determining the protracted character of the war
              and its outcome, namely, that the final victory will go to China
              and not to Japan.</p>
              <p>The war is a contest between these characteristics. They will
              change in the course of the war, each according to its own nature;
              and from this everything else will follow. These characteristics
              exist objectively and are not invented to deceive people; they
              constitute all the basic elements of the war, and are not
              incomplete fragments; they permeate all major and minor problems on
              both sides and all stages of the war, and they are not matters of
              no consequence. If anyone forgets these characteristics in studying
              the Sino-Japanese war, he will surely go wrong; and even though
              some of his ideas win credence for a time and may seem right, they
              will inevitably be proved wrong by the course of the war. On the
              basis of these characteristics we shall now proceed to explain the
              problems to be dealt with.</p>
