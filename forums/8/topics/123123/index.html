I'm more likely to look at pretty girls than at not-so-pretty girls as I'm walking down the street.<br><br>However, when it comes to falling in love, I look at the person's character first. Believe me, some of my friends got pretty amazed when I told them about the girl I liked.<br><br>Them: 'What? She's so plain!!!!'<br><br>Me: 'But she's really a nice and caring person.'<br><br>Them: 'Well, yeah, but......'<br><br>No point in falling in love with a pretty girl with a severe attitude problem, methinks.</div></blockquote>bravo!</div>
