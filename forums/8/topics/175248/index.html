            <div class='col-md body'>Letter from Anne Xavier<br><br>I was retrenched in December and while searching for a new job, I wanted to take up some short courses on IT skills.<br><br>As an NTUC union member, I was looking forward to taking advantage of the courses conducted by the NTUC Learning Hub which gives discounts for older workers like me.<br><br>On calling its hotline, I was told that union members who are unemployed are not eligible.<br><br>I was disheartened and, wanting to know the logic behind this policy, I contacted the NTUC customer services hotline.<br><br>I wanted to know what was the objective in offering courses to the employed member, and am of the view that it is more important and more urgent for the unemployed to upgrade their skills in order to be employable.<br><br>The officer I asked for suggestions suggested I find a job first, then apply for the course. She added that I should contact their Career Link office.<br><br>I found this suggestion to be absurd.<br><br>The NTUC website talks about rewarding union members "who take personal responsibility to upgrade their skills".<br><br>My intention was to take the IT course and personally search for a job, and not to seek NTUC's help to find a job, as I am confident my work experience and skills make me employable except for the fact that I lack one particular IT skill.<br><br>Can someone change this policy so that even the unemployed can benefit from being a union member?<br>Letter from Anne Xavier<br><br>http://www.todayonline.com/articles/95452.asp<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thats the style of our gov.  It put a value system on its citizens and if damn poor and jobless or just lost job, then negative value.<br><br>Even same story as foreign talent vs local talent.<br><br>Its says very clearly these help or bonus are for those who are in work force.  Housewife, homemaker, above 50s  and care giver or unable to work for some unfortunately reason are consider no value and even thus not entitled to share the fruits of the country.    Give them money left hand, right hand cannot take back.  No job people are a parasite to them.<br><br>They paid themselves well above the next highest civil servant so as to stay afloat at the highest.  so called untouchable and share the best fruits of the economic growth.<br><br>SIngaporeans must be prepared to really save for rainy times, if that unfortunate day do come,   there will be no help for jobless, except to take the lowest possible available job.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i saw the clause, must pay members fees and its only for working people.  IF members lose jobs cannot pay fees, then organisation has a negative liability member, which will not healthy to them.<br><br>The policy must have rules to protect them.  The ntuc is not a job fare union, usually mistaken by many who join.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually other than filling out the employment part which includes the company name and business address in application form for the course they won't ask you to show proof that you are actually working for that company so you can still go ahead and take that course.<br><br>The reason why I think they would want you to be employed in the first place<br><br>The courses are already discounted by NTUC and further subsidized by citrep, application for citrep assistance/reimbursement would require to show proof of your employment I think and in the event you are not employed it will be to your disadvantage as you can claim back 40-50% of paid course fees in some cases thru citrep which is quite substantial amt.<br><br>For your case I think if you want to avoid this problem 2 things you can do.<br><br>1) ITE courses, they do have a continuing education program on a pretty wide spectrum of IT/electrical/engineering short courses. Quite cheap also.<br><br>2) See your minister at "meet the people session" to raise your problems if all else fails, they are there to help you and especially during this period they even more keen to help you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> other than writing out a blank cheaque to you, they can help you in ways that you cannot imagine possible by writing a simple letter of recommendation perhaps? For your case since you are not asking for a handout ... it will be in the bag.<br></div>
