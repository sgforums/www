            <div class='col-md body'>People marry for many reasons. I can list a few. Some are silly but they are true.<br><br>- People marry so that they can apply HDB. You buy at a subsidised rate and sell at market rate 5 years later.<br><br>- To pool their income and share expenses. (e.g buy car or private house)<br><br>- To enjoy each others companionship. (They could do so while remaining single. The only difference is that the commitment is formalised upon signing the dotted line)<br><br>- To have children. (Single parenthood is still frowned upon in S'pore)<br><br>- To make their parents happy, so that family name is continued.<br><br>- Pressurized by peers, friends and family.<br><br>- Shotgun<br><br>What is love? Hard to explain. I once asked my doctor how do I know if I had asthma. He said that I WILL know it if I have it. Likewise, I think it is with love... a possible symptom is that you will start doing things you normally would not do.<br><br></div>

Maybe someday when you find your special someone, you will know what it feels like and it is true, we may very well lose the person we love but the love that we give away is the only love that we will keep. It is hard to explain to a cynic so you just have to wait and see for yourself.

            <div class='col-md body'>For the more cynical perspective.<br><br>Love is nothing but an arbitrary value notion placed on a relationship between two people. The idealized notion of romantic love is a medieval concept brainwashed into us by the relentless drivel the media, pioneered by the twin forces of Disney and Hallmark, which deludes us into thinking that the "right, perfect one" exists, only to be inevitably disappointed when the reality fails to live up to that sterling expectation(Ally McBeal does a pretty good job discussing this issue despite its other flaws as a show). Love is also tainted by the neurotic whims and fancies of social pretension such as our inhibitions against sexual activity outside the institution of marriage, as well as the psychological bitterness tha overwhelms an individual once the initial rush of courtship is over. Sure, some people manage to overcome these and stay together out of social stigmata, or because of fear of loneliness, or simply because they're lucky enough to achieve a level of physical and mental compatibility to build a lasting relationship on. But those are few, compared to the many miserable relationships that either fall apart and die, leaving both parties bitter and resigned, or, even worse, those who stick together grimly despite the lack of feeling because they can't imagine life alone.<br><br>What is love? Simply a point of view, a rabid delusion, a figment of the imagination inspired by too many bad TCS serials and Valentine's Day cards. A notional feeling that can be purchased with the careful application of free meals, movies, flowers and other baubles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello,<br><br>Sometimes ever wondered what love is all about? IMHO, I think that love is just a over-sensationalized version of the reproductory system in action. Think about it.Chemicals are what trigger the the "love" feelings. So what about true love? Maybe it is just purely a Hollywood concept(not that it originated from there but...) that people like to take in view since there is no order reason (other then protection, reproduction and almost-guranteed companionship) for liking someone "suddenly".

U love that person so much u can't bear to have him/her betray u in any way.<br>I experience this before. I love this guy a lot and still do but I know we can never be together even though he feels the same way. I can't bear to see him talking to another girl, I get paranoid if he dun call me until I could not take it. I guess the best way is to let him go. It was very difficult for me but I had to do it to save me from a breakdown. Now, I dun think I can love anyone as much as I loved him.

Whether we find that individual or not is highly variable on number of factors, not the least of which is your personal attributes like looks and $$$, and whether you can actually sustain a relationship with an individual long enough without the inevitable dry rot of familiarity seeping in is doubtful.<br><br>Love.

            <div class='col-md body'>Heh. Finding the right partner is crucial indeed, but it's not as simple as saying "not the looks". It's the whole package, and what you want. It's the intersection between the fantasy you can't have, and the reality you might be able to. It's about compromising your standards and going for the closest you can(and some people's "closest" is pretty damn far from what they'd like) becuase the alternative is spending the rest of your life watching television alone in your HDB flat with your dog Ah Kow and microwave dinners heaped high in the kitchen sink.</div>

Prolly not......<br>Then again, do I really know what is love, depsite the gaZilllion times that word and professions of it cmae forth from my mouth? How many of those times did they come from my heart? If love is judged by one's willingness to sacrifice unconditonally and one's ability to change, perhaps I have not loved. If love is measured by the drops of tears and blood I have shed, maybe I have.....What is love? 23 years later, I'm still trying to figure that one out......<br><br>Oh and I really am stumped by the True love thingie.

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to agree with Honey on the whole issue of love.  I posted something like that somewhere here yesterday night(or morning:-p).<br><br>U will never love the next person the same way that u loved the last.  Sometimes, most people like to base relationships and feelings of love by their first most emotional relationship.  It must feel as good or must be as good.  I had to find out the hard way that it will never feel the same way.  Each person is different and the love(if u believe in it) u feel for each of them will be very different.  For those of u who have had the chance to experience more than one or a few, u might know what I'm talking about.  The feeling might be similar, or or might be very different, but it's never the same.  Once we understand that, we will appreciate each relationship for what it really is and not some fairy tale version imposed by past realtionships/emotions.<br><br>The only thing that will always be the same is the sting of betrayal... The pain of loss and the loneliness that follows while waiting for that loved one knowing that u can't contact them(they switch off handfone&amp;pager etc...  Sitting in ur cold dark room and feeling the walls squeezing in closer and closer...and each time u dial their number u get a busy signal or u hear the telecom announcement that the subscribers pgone has been switched off.<br><br>That's the only thing that will stay the same.  The good is always different and the bad the same.  Am I right on this?<br><br>Love is for u to believe...and to believe it u must experience it and once u do, all other definitions dissappear because what u feel is the only thing that will ever matter...and u know it.<br><br>Don't give up hope.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha! What a topic here. Just like one of tha questions i got in my Mid-yr General Paper. Well, anyway its good though, i can practise my composition skills here and prepare for moi A-level exams hehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To be a civilised and a responsible human that inhabit this earth, it is important for one to get married. This will clearly differentiate us from being called as animals or other living things. Do we ever see crocodiles or rats or ants getting married? Even if we do, still it is us that make fun of them, insulting their species (remember that monkeys being dressed up by us, people, shown on tv, in tha so-called wedding ceremony? GOSH!) wonder if we are able to understand their language. im sure they'll label us as "molesting their species"<br><br>Of course, to marry, we need one that will make up as an ideal companion as possible. Being patience, understanding and willing to give and take are some factors that contribute to a happy family. Dear Blasphemy, i wonder why do you raise such question. well, im just as concern those people that reply to ya too.<br><br>well, besides those 'strange but true' reasons that are being contributed by our dear Zephure and others, there are still some that i like to share;<br><br>Marrying is to own officially, to own legally and to be protected and councellored by tha government if any problems arise. It is also a transfer of ownership from his/her parents to tha husband/wife. We need to undergo a lot of procedures, requirements, swearin and oaths before we can call ourselves husband and wife(ves)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Until then we will get that certificate that we longed for. Tha Certificate of Entitlement. IF we r not married, we are just merely<br>'stealing' other people property. if we are a parent of our child. How do we feel if someone 'steal' your son or daughter away? Hehehe just like owning a car. BUT its true though. Lots of procedures and requirements needed. we need to be able to handle (drive) them (just like handling family affairs), be financially equipped and insurred, know tha rules and regulations and etc.. until then you can call that car, yours. wonder if we are not qualified to drive... more likely we will end up in an accident, rite, just like ending with a divorce. THINK, my dear brothers and sisters.<br><br>One more thing (i like this part hehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">), to marry is to bear a child legally. wonder if we bear a child without legally married.. tha child of us will be called Bastards. ish! what a word! and when he/she grew up.. people will start calling them Bastards, Bastards, Bastards. do u know how low his/her morale will be? cant you think of his/her future with respect to tha society. And what about us? tha parents of tha bastards? dun we feel regret or embarrassed after what we did? im sure all humans HAVE a feeling or they are not human at all. im sure if we bear a child we want him/her to bring up our name and we will be proud of him/her in whatever he/she do, rite? Well, a good start makes a good ending rite?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>when our child grow up? do you prefer him/her to bear a child after he/she get legally married or not? well.. its for you to decide. Brains are for us to use, rite? Think ahead, for tha future and tha consequences.<br><br>for your info, tha words like you, me, us, etc that i use here is General ok. Hope im not offending anyone here. AAnyway.. nice topic  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Professional Critics</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I kind of agree with Prosucker.<br><br>Though crude in some way, but it's definitely true.<br><br>Some other definition,<br><br>To marry is to save all the effort of sending your bf/gf home after dates.<br><br>To marry is to officially own the title to that person you married, sort of to say (although stupid) "Hey! That person is mine" ...<br><br>To marry is the official way to have normal sex life with your partner.<br><br>To marry is the official way to share your partner's property... in some countries.<br><br>Last but not least, to marry is to gamble your life with someone else.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I always emphasize on "finding the right partner", because to marry is to spend the whole lifetime with your spouse (as in your marriage vows). It's important to find someone you can enjoy, someone who loves you truely. Money can't buy everything, looks can't satisfy every emotion. Sometimes, people just tend to marry for the wrong reasons only to find out they are on the path to divorce. True, remaining single means spending the rest of your life with your "ah kow", the loneliness that sends all of us frantically searching for the "significant other". How many people still hang on to the fairy tale ending of "happily ever after"? Ever thought of putting an effort to achieve it?</div>
