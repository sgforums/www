            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO, I think such government initiatives tend to take a slower time to take off than those initiated from the grassroot levels. Singaporeans are still shy and reserved about their opinions. And there is always some fear of a blacklist out there...<br><br>I realised that young Singaporeans who are working or studying abroad tend to mix around with more vocal counterparts. At least, this is what I have observed in North America. The Singaporeans either become more *turned off* and retreat into their shells or they actually speak up to their counterparts. I guess the latter group benefits from this exchange of ideas. On the local scene, I think the new school environment is nurturing kids who are more vocal and expressive. I guess this new group of youths will be the one who will really make this idea take off...<br><br>Presently, I think it will really take some time for the government to encourage Singaporeans to speak up, to encourage healthy exchange of opinions. For starters, i think such forums like Chit Chat are already training Singaporeans to be more vocal. The next step is to encourage them to step out into the public and make their opinions known in person and not behind a nickname  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>You are my first star at night, I'd be lost in space without you<br>I'll never lose my faith in you,<br>How will I ever get to heaven if I do</div>

We dont want to duplicate the current Hyde Park, but to import the idea. The actual turnout will depend on the social and political climate of the country in which this forum is held. If the country is socially and politically stable, I guess it is harder for dissidents to start arousing the wrong sentiments and turning this forum into a source of unrest.<br><br>------------------<br>You are my first star at night, I'd be lost in space without you<br>I'll never lose my faith in you,<br>How will I ever get to heaven if I do</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Commotion? Hmm... actually I think it will be interesting to see Singaporeans fight over something BIG than small hello kitties??? sigh I was away when the CAT issue happened. I was surprised and digusted, wondering what had happened to our society!<br><br>It will be a consolation if Singaporeans do stand up for ideals they feel close to their hearts. But dont you think that Singaporeans are too *bochup* to speak up on issues concerning them? We are becoming more indifferent to life and turning into irresponsible citizens. I think such a forum will help generate interest in public affairs and help generate ideas..<br><br>Singaporeans just aint brought up to be violent... *i hope* so i really doubt having to fear huge unrest due to such forums. What's more, why are we discouraging ourselves from going ahead with this idea just because of some worries?<br><br>I say we go ahead and promote this idea and handle any problems that arises along the way one by one...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>You are my first star at night, I'd be lost in space without you<br>I'll never lose my faith in you,<br>How will I ever get to heaven if I do</div>
