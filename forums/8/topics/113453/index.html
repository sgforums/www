            <div class='col-md body'>Hi SgForumsUser,<br><br>It's impossible to guess what the second interview will be like. I recommend u prepare urself, like knowing the company, knowing ur jobscope, preparing for technical and mental tests, preparing to negotiate salary, etc. In short, prepare for everything loh. Then on the night before, try to get a good sleep. On the day, dress well, arrive earlier, etc etc, i think u know liao. Good luck, just be confident.<br><br>I was once interviewed 4 times. In the end got the job. Some other jobs have even more rounds, like at some airlines if u want to be a stewardess. So, ur second interview may not be the last. Anyways just prepare and go.</div>
