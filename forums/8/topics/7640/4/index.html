            <div class='col-md body'>[Part 1]<br>On a lazy Friday afternoon, I was staring at my monitor typing my resume and cover letter. When suddenly, I heard the sound that I had not heard since my childhood. The unmistakedbly sound of the ice-cream truck with its trademark ringing tune.<br><br>Needing a break from the monotonous 16-bit colours, I decided to get some colourful ice lolly to break the monotony. I took a piece of note and wrote some words, then folded into an aeroplane, and threw it down. The paperplane glided and landed on to one of the vendor. Couldn't see the person clearly but he or she had pick it up. The person looked up and I waved from the window. I thought I saw a smile.<br><br>Moments later, the doorbell rang. I opened the door, and omigosh.....I thought I had died and was in heaven. There she was, an angel standing right in front. She was in a white embroided dress made of silk with long flowing hair. The sun at the horizon was behind her, and indeed made her an angel.<br><br>"Excuse me, sir, did you order the ice-cream?"<br><br>"Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, I did. How much is that?"<br><br>"It's two dollars."<br><br>"Here it is."<br><br>"Thank you."<br><br>"You're welcome. Say, how's the business going?"<br><br>"Well, not too good. People nowadays go for the ice cream parlor, so we had to deliver to stay competitive. But usually, we take phone orders, yours was, er, unexpected." She smiled, looking bashful.<br><br>My heart was beating quite fast now, and I'm sure the ice-cream was not melting due to me, or was it? I decided to stay calm.<br><br>"So, er, are you always busy?"<br><br>"Well, like I mentioned, depending on the weather. These days, the weather is hot, so plenty of delivery to do. My brother is helping me out. Say, I really must be going, he's waiting downstairs. Nice meeting you." She smile again.<br><br>"Yeah, same here. Er...I was wondering if you would like to meet up sometime?"<br><br>"Sure, you can reach me at this number. Probably be free on weekends." She scribbled on a piece of paper and passed it to me.<br><br>"Great. Well, hope you have a wonderful day, or whatever that's left of it."<br><br>"See you."<br><br>"Bye."<br><br>I watched her until she turned at the corner to take the lift. I quickly closed the door and enjoy the melting ice lolly in my mouth. It was sweet, yet clearly paled by her.<br><br>I sat down on my chair, enjoying the coolness of the ice lolly as my heart started to get back to its normal rhythm. I made a note in the organiser and suddenly, to my horror, I realised I forgot to ask her name. Now, who was I going to ask for when I called her!?<br><br>[To be continued.....]<br><br>[This message has been edited by lonewolfe (edited 06 June 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[Part 2]<br><br>Woken up by the soft sunray creeping up to my face. I went to wash myself, took a quick, warm shower and had a light breakfast. Wasn't sure what I was going to do for the rest of the day. Read a bit of morning news, realised that the world is full of sorrow and disaster and decided to stop, pretending nothing is wrong with this beautiful day.<br><br>Then, I remembered about the ice-cream girl yesterday and opened up my organiser. Decided to give her a call now, hopefully not too early.<br><br>"Hello."<br><br>"Hello, good morning."<br><br>"Good morning. Er..I..er..am looking for the girl who sells ice-cream. She has a brother who's helping her."<br><br>"*Chuckle*Are you the guy who made the paperplane?"<br><br>"Er..ya. Are you the girl?"<br><br>"Nope, that's my sister. Hold on a second."<br><br>Moments of silence later.....<br><br>"Hi."<br><br>"Hi, er...hope it's not to early?"<br><br>"Nah, it's okay. Used to waking up early anyway."<br><br>"Ahuh. So, not working today?"<br><br>"Well, today, I'll be selling ice-cream at the parlour until early afternoon, no delivery though."<br><br>"Oh, is that the one near my place? Ice-EntIce?"<br><br>"Yup, that's the one."<br><br>"Okay. Erm...I was wondering if I can come look for you then?"<br><br>"Sure, I'll be off at around 2:30."<br><br>"Great, see you then."<br><br>"Bye."<br><br>Looking out the window, I saw the sun behind the white clouds that looked like cotton candy covering the blue sky. Took a deep breath *cough* *cough* too much polluted air from the haze and vehicles. The world is indeed an oyster, like the taste of it, but can't take the smell. Little did I realise that the rays hide a deadly UV light. Oh well, the world is an unforgiving place, but I guess it's up to us to find heaven on earth.<br><br>[To be continued.....]<br><br>[Note: don't ask me how many parts, i also dunno, will continue as long as got inspiration]<br><br>[This message has been edited by lonewolfe (edited 06 June 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[Part 3]<br><br>Trying frantically to look for that straw basket in the store room, neglected since day one. Found a top instead, started playing with it. As the top spinned, my childhood memory swirled in my head...the distant past seemed so near.....<br><br>I was 5 years old, and my grandfather was still around. Running half-naked in the village, chasing little chicks and chickens, laughing like a tyrant as I watched them took flight in fear. I thought I was powerful! Having done enough for the day, I decided to head back home. Anyway, it was going to be dinner time soon.<br><br>Maybe it was some sort of a punishment, for I did not see any rock, yet I tripped and fell hard onto the ground. My granddad was nearby, and I looked up and tears began to flood and soon the floodgate could no longer hold and I burst into tears. My granddad looked at me and told me to get up on my own and stopped crying.<br><br>Then, he threw something and the device was spinning rapidly. After awhile, it stopped spinning and fell on the ground.<br><br>"Grandpa, what's that?"<br><br>"That's a top. You see, life has its ups and downs. Sometimes, you lose momentum and fall down. When that happens, you just need to give it a spin and it'll be back up again."<br><br>I picked up the top and started spinning it, soon, I was smiling again.....<br><br>My eyes were blurry, but, something caught my eyes. I pulled it out of the box. Hmmm....needed a bit of cleaning, but didn't matter. I brought the basket to the toilet and gave it a rinse. After that, I wiped it dry with a rag.<br><br>After having lunch, I went to the supermarket and bought some groceries. Back home, I began to fill the basket with french loaf, cheese, grapes, a vacuum flask of hot tea and other great snacks. Looking at my watch, I decided to walked to her shop.<br><br>Pedestrians looked at me in a strange way. Hmmm...what's wrong with a guy carrying a straw basket!? Anyway, I hastened my pace and soon I was at the corner of the row of shops. Just as I was about to turn, I saw a guy walking her back to her shop. They were talking happily, laughing.<br><br>I was quite sure it wasn't her brother. Could he be her other brothers? Could he be her boyfriend? They seemed so happy together. I was confused, wasn't sure what to do at the moment. I decided to turn and walk back home.<br><br>"Hey! You there!"<br><br>Too late, she had spotted me. I turned and smiled. "Hi."<br><br>"Thought you wanted to look for me?"<br><br>"Actually, I wanted to buy ice-cream." Damn, what was I thinking.<br><br>"Oh. Okay, we are still open."<br><br>"I wasn't sure whether I still want or not. The weather is not that hot today." The sun is scorching hot, you idiot, who are you trying to bluff.<br><br>"Oh. In that case, maybe another day."<br><br>"Yeah, maybe another day. Bye."<br><br>"Bye."<br><br>Turned on my computer and began to play quake3. I was running frantically, blasting every thing insight. I was angry with myself for not doing anything, not finding out what's really happening, for trying to lie to her.<br><br>I played for 4 hours and then my computer hanged. Great, decided to go to bed, since there wasn't much to do anyway. In the darkness, ants were happily raiding my basket of food. Well, at least someone is feeling great today. Little did I realise I had drifted into sleep. No dream tonight.<br><br>[To be continued.....]<br><br>[Credit to the author of Doraemon for the inspiration]<br><br>[This message has been edited by lonewolfe (edited 06 June 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[Part 4]<br><br>The first ray touched my face, gradually warming my whole body, removing the coldness I felt last  night. A pair of sparrows rested on the window sill, chirping quite happily. I pulled the blanket over and tried to use the pillow to cover my ears.<br><br>Ring...ring...ring...Wondering who was calling, I reached for the phone.<br><br>"Hello. Wakey, wakey."<br><br>"Hi...who is this?"<br><br>"It's me, Racheal. Still remember me?"<br><br>Racheal is my younger cousin. We used to play alot together when we were much younger. I remembered she had this knack of creating things with whatever she could get her hands on. She had gone to the States to do fine arts two years ago.<br><br>"Hey, what are you doing back here?"<br><br>"Why, I'm not welcome here?"<br><br>"No. I mean aren't you suppose to be in the States?"<br><br>"Oh, I'm having a break now."<br><br>"I see. Are you free? Would you like to meet up?"<br><br>"Hmm. Why not? It's been awhile since we last saw each other. Time for some catch up. Yeah, I'm free."<br><br>"Alright then. How about later in the afternoon? We can meet up for lunch."<br><br>"Sure, we'll meet at Tat's Place."<br><br>"Okay, see you then."<br><br>"So fast you want to hang up?"<br><br>"I'm still in bed. Probably won't be getting up yet."<br><br>"Still the lazybone you used to be. Alright then, talk to you later. Bye."<br><br>"Bye bye."<br><br>-----<br><br>Looking at my watch, I rushed down to Tat's Place, going to be late for sure. As I opened the door and walked through it, my mind started to think of what excuse to use this time.<br><br>"Oops, I'm so sorry."<br><br>As I was preoccupied, I didn't pay attention to the surrounding and accidentally bumped into someone.<br><br>"It's okay. You're late."<br><br>I looked at the person and realised that it was Racheal.<br><br>"Oh, Racheal, it's you. Hi, sorry that I'm late. You see, I..."<br><br>"Doesn't matter, you're treating me lunch." She looked at me and gave me this devilish grin.<br><br>"Ah...alright then."<br><br>We went to sit at a table at the corner. The waiter came and we placed our order.<br><br>"So, what have you been doing there?"<br><br>"Me? The usual - churning out junks and passing them off as my project."<br><br>As we talked about what we had done with our lives for the past two years, I began to notice just how little Racheal had changed. She still looked like the little girl who cried when I added a dab of black to her drawing of a mango, telling her that it was a rotten mango. Perhaps, the only difference was that she had cropped her hair, which only made her look the more feminine and vulnerable.<br><br>"Eh, would you like to go for dessert?"<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>[Sorry for the late post, was busy battling aliens in Half-Life. Also, thing's getting complicated and out of hand. Still not sure how to end yet.]</div>
