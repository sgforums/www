            <div class='col-md body'>Have made you people waited long enoughÂ…Â….<br><br>Now for part II of my story<br><br>As I was the unable to decide which favour to choose, the 1st lady suggested I have both. Of course the idea had cross my mind. The room might be cooling but the heat is defiantly turned on but the girls.<br><br>The 1st lady then go on the place her hand on my body going over my buttons and she said why donÂ’t u make yourself more comfortable as she continue to remove button after with her smooth flowing actions. She then proceed to press hers lips near my ear and whispered to me, now tell me do u want just ice creamÂ… as she said that she dip her fingers into a tub of chocolate ice cream and place them on my tongue, she then proceed to scoop some strawberry ice cream and did the same thing. My mind was racing and my heart is pounding, my thoughts distracted.<br><br>So have you decided what you want? Ask the 2nd lady.<br><br>But strangely her voice sounded a little distance and I beginning to feel a lost of balance, just then a flash of light come and Â…Â….<br><br>As I opened my eyes I could feel a heavy head, lifting it seem like lifting a lorry. As I tried to move my hands to rub my forehead, I realize I had been handcuffed to the chair. A moment of anxiety came over me, what happened and I started calling for aid but none came. As I regain my composure I begin to recap the events leading to me being tied here. Only then did I realize that the ice cream might have been drug. Now I was struggling to get free, I started screaming. And out of the blue, a flash back, I read an article about the death of a young manÂ’s body found in the river, nothing was found and police found no foul play for the autopsy shown nothing but some substance, mostly ingredients used to make ice cream.<br><br>I had a sudden rush over my body. Oh noÂ…. could it be? What will I do? I struggle violently to break free, but to no avail and I find my body weakening from the struggle.<br><br>Just as I was losing hop, the 2nd lady appear from with the satin curtains. She commented Guys always so predictable. They never learn their lessons. To that I ask what do you mean by that.<br><br>She replied u know Daniel the river guy, before him there was jack and then before him was Samuel. Hmmmmmmmmmmm but they keep coming for more those bastards!!!!!<br><br>Then I occurred to me yes 2 years ago there was 2 similar cases to Daniel, could it be the doing of the seemingly innocent and pretty girls? Was this a set up? What will happen to me? Fear is slowly creeping up to me. I am losing the battle to keep control of my mind. The 2nd lady proceed towards me, and ask she place her hand on my laps she asked tell me what would you have done it you havenÂ’t pass out?<br>IÂ…Â…. I struggle to find the most pleasing answer to try to get myself off the hook. WouldÂ…..haveÂ…Â…wouldÂ….  I paused. I continue when I entered the room I found the most lovely angel I had ever seen, I so very much like to make her my love to cherish and love her with all my life. I had never fail to impressed girl but this is the time I need it more the any other time in my life!<br><br>Nice try lover boy said the 1st lady as she entered the room but we had heard it all before. It would not work on usÂ…..<br><br>Just then she remove my shirt and place some ice cream on my body and as it starts to melt she place her tongue onto my skin and slowly running her warm tongue over my cold skin creating a sensation that is out of this world. Just as she was doing that the 2nd lady was feeding me with ice cream. At 1st it was like heaven but as it carried on, the dosage of ice cream increases and I felt my mouth be stuffed with ice cream, unable to catch my breath as the flow of ice cream continue is stuffed into my mouth.<br><br>Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…..<br><br>What will happen to our hero? Will is escape or will he be the next victim of the ice cream serial killer? Stay tune for the next installment of the Â….<br><br>------------------<br>Outing info <a href="http://expage.com/outing" rel="nofollow">http://expage.com/outing</a></div>

The front gate was left opened. We slowly walked to the door, and was surprised that it was not locked. When the door was opened, we had a shock - the drawers of the cabinet was opened and things were thrown all over the place. We stood there for a while, stunned.<br><br>I went inside and looked around...man, the whole place was turned upside down. Someone had ransacked the place. I went for the phone and informed the police.<br><br>"Racheal, I think..." I looked around, but could not find her. She must have gone up to her room.<br><br>I went to her room, the door was ajar. I pushed the door open slowly. Racheal was sitting down, picking up pieces of a broken tile. Tears were falling from her eyes. I went to her and saw the tile was the present I gave her on her tenth birthday.<br><br>The tile had a yellow sunflower drawn on it and a coat of varnish painted over it. I remembered the her eyes lit up when she opened the box and discovered the present.<br><br>I was very surprised that she had kept it that long. She looked up to me, tears still flowing down her eyes. I knelt down beside her and held her close in my arms.
