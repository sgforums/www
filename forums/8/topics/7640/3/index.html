            <div class='col-md body'>Well I try not to disappoint but after this maybe the girls might be frighten of me Â….<br><br>One a hot sunny day, with the scorching sun showing its might.. Â“boy oh boy do I need to cool myself down now..Â” was looking around when some shop in the corner caught me eye. I step into the shop Â“boy is good to step out of the sunÂ” As I look around I see satin in black and pink lying around with the occasional wind catches its movement. The blower emitting gusts that cool my boiling skin. As I was lost in thought, a laughter and sweet voice bring me back to reality. As I turn to see who it was, the beautiful sight appear in front of meÂ….this beautiful girl is then most sexy satin you can imagine. Revealing a very shapely body with incredible legs. Skin smooth as silk and smile as bright as the sun. Hanging loosely across her body is a piece of satin that might fly off with a gust of wind. I could almost see everything underneath   I was taken aback, freeze in time, not realizing how rude to stare with my mouth slightly open. That sweet voice once again rings into my ears sending sweet melody into my ear drumz. Â“ What can I do for u sirÂ”<br><br>My heart was pounding hard searching for a reply. Â“ errrh I I need a d.drink .. I reply with a soft and shaking voice. Then voice rang back but we only sell ice cream. It is only then did I notice part of the satin was smear with ice cream and causing the satin to stick onto her skinÂ…. Â“Oh then can I have some ice creamÂ” I replied, Â“ It is hot out thereÂ” Just then another voice came from inside Â“hey what is taking you so long.Â”<br><br>The girl said Â“excuse my friend she a little impatient. Well what type of ice cream do you want Â“  Â“ well I canÂ’t decide between strawberry or chocolateÂ” the girl ponder for a while and finally said well maybe this might helpÂ… she held my hand and led me into a smaller room .. I glance around the surrounding and found a huge tub lying near the side of the room. In the tub is an exquisite beauty lying there with only a satin across the tub to cover her but it still exposing her bear shoulder as I felt my under pant tightenÂ…. Â“Well there is strawberry on the right of the tub and chocolate on the left of the tub which would you like??<br><br>To be continueÂ…Â…<br><br>just for navie and tet<br><br>Just wondering which guy will be thinking of ice cream at this moment hell I want the tub!!!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An ice cream shop limited to my imagination.....<br><br>First, the satin and lace would be specially procured. Also, by then I would have acquired the rights of franchise for a Victoria's Secrets outlet in Singapore. The satin and lace would be collected at the end of all Victoria's Secrets modelling shoots, so all of them would be previously *worn* by the likes of Laetitia Casta, Naomi Campbell, Tatiana Patitz, Tyra Banks, and company, not forgetting the male undergarments from the respective male models. I would also have booked a single night where each of these ladies and men could make a trip to Singapore to appear at the shop. Separate nights, of course.<br><br>The shop? Keep it to the basics, no frilly stuff, no whatever. Just simple ice cream shop, keep running costs to minimum. Something done to the tune of a Haagen Dazs outlet should be fine. But has to situated next to my Victoria's Secrets outlet. Every purchase of $100 worth of ice cream entitles customers to make a bid with shop taking 20 percent non-refundable for any one reward, One of the rewards would be the all-expenses paid breakfast, lunch, or dinner exclusively, and a stay at the Ritz Carlton. The other, of course, would be the worn undergarments of the models. Half of the proceeds will go to UNICEF. The auction on the BLD w/ model will be closed, while the one on the undergarments will be open.<br><br>Waste not. You can have an option to just purchase the bid w/o the ice cream.<br><br>Name of the shop? Cream.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>For Romantic Tet</strong><br>I picked Tet up at her house for Dinner, she is wearing a black sleeveless satin tight little number. Her hair is tied up in a bun behind, and a pair of silver stilettos. I am wearing a Dark Blue L/S shirt with a silver tie, wearing black pants and my hair all comb to the back, as in "Shanghai, Shanghai".<br><br>As she sashay out of the door with the grace of a queen, the satin reflects light light as though she is shimmering herself, I recognize it is the one that she told me is her favorite. I go over and reveal the bouquet of pink Tulips I hid behind me. Gentle whispering into her ears, I tell her how beautiful she looks tonight, and how honored I am to have this date with her.<br><br>The night is cooling and dry. As she holds her hand in mine, we strolled casually to the road and signal for a cab to stop, I opened the door, and she board the cab with elegance. The cabÂ’s air refreshener has a scent that resembles moist grass in the morning. Everything is perfect.<br><br>The cab brought us to Haagen Daz at the Marriot, She ordered Cookies and Cream, while I ordered my favorite Coffee Ice-cream. A waitress wearing a white apron with pink lace lining serve us, and canÂ’t help but comment how beautiful she look. Each moment I look into her eyes, it glitters with a sparkle that mesmerizes me. She smiled and  it lights up the whole ice-cream palour for it is so contagious that everyone smiles along. Her charms are so subtle yet so dominating, so sweet, yet a hint of naughtiness hangs around her. She would be the perfect embodiment of sugar and spice, a balance of love and lust, she is perfect.<br><br>She suddenly stood up and went over to the counter and whisper something to the lady that served us just now. The 2 giggled and looked at me like 2 little girls. She winked at me and went to the ladies with the waitress. The suspense is killing me, I wondered what she is up to this time, she never failed to surprise me. I waited, a second tick pass and it felt like an eon has passed, the waitress came out first, I expected her to come out next, so I pretended not to expect anything and looked the other way. There is a light tap on my shoulder, I turned and to my surprise, it is Tet wearing the pink lacy apron, my mouth open in a gasp, and this is really surprising, for I did not expect her but the waitress. Before I recover from my surprise, she lean over and asked me what dessert would I like to have. For that moment I canÂ’t think of anything but say,<br><br>Â“You? ErmmÂ…..I meant is it you Tet?Â”<br><br>She smiled the megawatt contagious smile, and I know once again she surprised me.<br><br>Â“American Cheesecake please.Â”<br><br>She walk that cat walk over to the counter and ask for my order, with the whole counter giggling. She does not seem to mind and is enjoying the fun. She took the order, and brought it back to our table, she sat down, putting the cheesecake in front of me.<br><br>Â“ Would it be self-service or are you willing to pay the service charge?Â”<br><br>I smiled and replied Â“I would prefer to pay the service charge.Â”<br><br>She took the spoon and fed me, looking at me as though I am a young little boy, as if I am a baby. I enjoy the pampering thoroughly. The moment is perfect.<br><br>I finish the cheesecake slowly, savoring each and every moment while it lasted, letting it melt in my mouth. She seems to be enjoying the moment too, the look in her eyes spells happiness. After I finished the cake, I asked her how she would like the payment to be. She smiled and replied,<br><br>Â“All I need is for you to sent me home safely tonight, you big buaya.Â”<br><br>She charmed me yet again, with that subtle look, I know it is a payback I canÂ’t resist.<br>-------------------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Rest assure that I will sent back if you go out on a date with me Tet. This I promise.</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>For Playful Naivegirl</strong><br><br>I waited patiently at the airport, it is 5 mins to the arrival time. The bunch of fresh champagne rose buds in my hand awaits eagerly for their rightful owner to come receive them. Looking around I faintly spot a beautiful long hair lady, she seems to radiate an aura of cheerfulness and friendliness. I know it must be her, my long awaited princessÂ….Naivegirl. I waved at her she acknowledge by waving fanatically back. She is so vibrant, it is as though she powers the lights in the airport with her energy.<br><br>She walked towards me with luggage in tow, to my surprise I for once is so attracted by someone that I did not do my normal routine of being a nice guy and take her luggage for her. This would be unusual for me as a big buaya. I thought about it for a while and soon shrug it off. I recovered quickly and quickly stumbled over,<br><br>Â“Hi, Hi! I am Callan, You must be NaÃ¯ve! It is so great to know you!Â”<br><br>Â“Hi, Hi! I am NaÃ¯ve, You must be Callan! It is so great to know you!Â”<br><br>I am sort of surprised, that she gave me an almost identical reply. I smiled at her and think that she must be a really playful lady. I took the luggage from her and pulled it behind me as I escorted her to the Taxi stand. I tried to make small talk, but she only either nod her head fanatically, or smile broadly at me. I am wondering if she is so happy that she finally reaches Singapore that made her behavior so exceptional.  HmmmÂ…..such energy even after a plane flight is exceptional too, I thought. The queue at the taxi stand is very long, so I suggested we go for so Ice-cream at Swedsens first before going back to the hotel, seeing that she is not tired at all. She still maintains that broad smile and nods.<br><br>I brought her to the restaurant, we sat and I asked her what she wants, this time she shakes her head, so I thought that maybe she would like me to decide. I signal the waitress over,<br><br>Â“A double scoop of Vanilla and Strawberry for the lady and a sticky chewy Chocolate for me.Â”<br><br>Â“A double scoop of Vanilla and Strawberry for the gentleman and a sticky chewy Chocolate for me.Â”<br><br>She repeated to the waitress.<br><br>Â“ErmmmÂ…..Just take my order that would be enough.Â” I smiled.<br><br>She amuses me by now. What is she doing? If she is trying to show me that she is playful, I sure get the message already. She maintains that broad smile and look at me. A thought suddenly cross my mind, hmmm her luggage seems exceptionally light what did she bring to SG? So I casually ask her if she brought enough clothing to Singapore, she shakes her head. I frownÂ….hmmmÂ….I am really becoming suspicious.<br><br>The ice-cream arrived, I decided not to talk too much as our conversation seems to be getting nowhere for it is mostly just me talking. I thought that maybe if I keep quiet, she would talk more. She licked her ice-cream like a child, so innocently so naively. I smiled to think that she can really look this naÃ¯ve with a ice-cream. While I am deep in my own thoughts, she suddenly took the bag she was carrying in hand, open it, and seem to be talking to something inside. It broke me from my thoughts, and I tried to see what or who she is talking to. She then took a spoonful of ice-cream and seem to be feeding something inside. I do not know what. I got worried, no pets are allowed in the airport, I thought that she might have smuggled a dog in or something. I stood up and tried to see what is inside the bag. I canÂ’t see anything, just pitch black.<br><br>Â“Mind if I look into your luggage?Â”<br><br>She again shakes her head.<br><br>I do not know if it is a yes or a no, but I decided that I would think about the consequences later. I went over and put my hand into the bag to see if I could feel anythingÂ…Â…nothing except soft black satin. HmmmÂ….the satin does not seem to be part of the bag, so I tried to take out a piece of it. A big piece came out, it is satin all right, nothing else, except for a little ice-cream stain on it. I cannot explain the odd behavior of NaÃ¯ve. It would be rather abnormal. I do not know what to think. Intrigued I am now, so I decided to open her other luggage, to my surprise they are all not lock, and guess what is inside? Just Lots of pink lace and black satin. A whole lot of it.<br><br>It does not make sense any more, why would anyone just bring satin and lace to Singapore? Unless they are having some big fetish for it, winks but even that they would bring other things in their luggage too, not just these. I asked her what are these, and she maintains that broad big smile and shakes her head. This is getting nowhere, I do not understand.<br><br>Â“Are you NaÃ¯ve?Â”<br><br>Â“Are you Callan?Â”<br><br>She replied.<br><br>Â“Who are you?Â”<br><br>Â“Who am I?Â”<br><br>She asked me.<br><br>Â“Argh! If this is a joke you are getting to far. I treat you with respect and you take me as a clown, this is so rude of you!Â”<br><br>I barked.<br><br>She maintains that smile. It is becoming sickening. Then I heard someone calling my name at the entrance of Swedsens. I turned around, and saw Asure,<br><br>Â“Callan! We are all looking for you. NaÃ¯ve is already here! What are you doing here? Buayaing again?!?Â”<br><br>Â“ButÂ…..ermmmÂ…Â…butÂ…Â”<br><br>The truth suddenly seems to hit meÂ…..this girl in front of me is not NaÃ¯ve but someone else. Someone not so normal. I slap my self for my own silliness and my big blunder. So what am I going to do to this woman now? I figured that it will be best that I hand her over to the airport police and let them handle her.<br><br>I told Asure that I have some stuff to attend to and will join them tomorrow at the outing. I paid for the bill and get her to follow me, luggage in tow, to the Airport police office.<br><br>Â“Excuse me, I would like to hand someone who is not of the sane state of mind over. She might cause trouble for the public especially if someone is to meet someone who they have never seen before. (Gees, I can still dig at myself.) The sergent looked at meÂ…and then at herÂ…..<br><br>Â“OhÂ…itÂ’s you againÂ…..so how many satin and lace did you get from the luggage room this time?Â”<br><br>Â“Dun wantÂ…Â….dun wantÂ…..Â”<br><br>She is mumbling.<br><br>I somehow figured out from the officer that she is a regular troublemaker at the airport, stealing pink lace and black satin from other peoples luggage. She takes them as her darlings and is now a blacklisted person in their list. She is not suppose to even appear within the airport. And I would be so unlucky to meet her the day I pick NaÃ¯ve up.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">So girl, it would be great if you can sent me a photograph of yourself so that I would not mistake so lace and satin maniac for you when I pick you up at the airport. I suppose you will, after I crack this much brain juice to get a date from you right?</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
