            <div class='col-md body'>I personally feel that both sexs can initiate, but I enjoy dating not just I wanna get a girlfriend, its about the whole process of knowing someone NEW! =) (It's fun if you can get the opps sex to initiate) hahaaha....<br>Well, I guess you are not focus.  Generally, if you are not cute looking doesn't mean you can't get a girlfriend.  Look around man! Do you see a hot babe hanging out with a normal joe? Answer: yes! Why?  You must be thinking that they are bloody rich, right? Maybe! But not all.... Basically, they take it easy.  You take it too hard, you sound like you are suffering throughout your entire courtship!!!  Enjoy it man!!  Try to focus on your work or new hobbies, you might be surprise wat may come your way.  Tips, girls don't like a 100% Mr nice guy! So be naughty at times. Don't show your fox's tail too early (Don't say you like her on the first few dates), you maybe able to reduce chances of rejection. Paying for girls is just a gesture of being a gentlemen, ok? it's the courtship culture! Don't be a loser, K !.........for singles like you and me, ROCK ON!!</div>

But also, don't expect anything lah! You will get disappointed very easily. Just be good to the girls. Someday, someone will respond to you back. And if that is the one you want, then ho sie liao.....<br><br>You know, it is like using the machine gun, charm all of them first and see which one respond. And never mind some don't work out well.. you still earn yourself a good opposite sex friend who can be really helpful (advisor) in your next courtship. Also, I find that I learn a lot about myself after each failed courtship. So, it is not really that bad one.</div>
