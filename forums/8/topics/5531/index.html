            <div class='col-md body'>With reference to firewire's mention of Lonewolves in his posts, I wonder, how many people here actually are one?? On my part, I believe went through this phase a few times in my life. While it did feel cool then to be outside the fabric of society, I felt it raised inadequacies on my part.<br><br>I sought to become one becoz I couldn't mix in with the crowd, coz I don't "fit in". In retrospect, it taught me to be emotionally indepedent but at the same time I lost out in social behaviour. Making new friends is hard for me(esp. female ones  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>NS came and changed me slightly, though no longer a hardcore lonewolf, I feel in certain aspects, I still am one and perhaps a certain portion of me will be forever.<br><br>Just wanna know if anyone had similiar experiences to mine<br><br>Cheers!<br><br>------------------<br>Why? Why me?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if u're talking about the gamebook,u can still find it on alot of bookstores.<br>On the other hand if u are talking about the lonewolf inside our heart...well wat's wrong with carrying one cute wolf around?<br>I happened to like my wolf since it's always there no matter how high i climb or how low I felled...that's some companion.I think everyone should learn how to feel comfortable living with our lonewolf..there's nothing wrong with having one.It's only wrong if U let it out and bite others around.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey! Anyone talking about Lonewolf gamebooks here? hehehe i juz realised that im not tha only one cazy about that gamebook during my primary and secondary school times. i even had almost tha whole collection of it (excluding tha new order..cos it begin to feel sucks). wonder if you all collect them too! for your info, i am short of only 1 book; its no:5. wonder if u all got it and about to throw them away. i would like to buy it. k?<br><br>hmm about being lonewolf..(gosh! what do that mean?) hmm.. tha expression given by Eck 'shockingly' suits me too! about trying to live in an independent life, setting my very own unique journey after feeling that i cant live with tha society. but still feel theres something missing in moi life; tha bonds and relationship with them. im not good at making friends either cos ill always end up talking to moiself. until i feel sick of making new ones. well, i got a title now; 'tha loner'. thanx to moi teachers who had given me that title.<br><br>well, got to be 'cruel' sometimes (no choice). either you betray them or you being betrayed (im passive). friends are meant to be forgotten, keeping only those with fondest memories. tha more friends i make, more memories i got. more will come and go. forget and forgive, people might say.<br><br>well.. i have yet undergoing Nat Service (Gosh! Moi enlistment date is 25th Jan 2000! anyone havin same date with me??? see ya then). wonder how they will change me up? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> well, im looking foward for it!<br><br>------------------<br>Professional Critics</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmmm, in response to NemiSiS, the lonewolf phase is something I went thru prior to my army days.... Felt good though, liberating becoz for once I felt I didn't need to rely on anyone.<br><br>Of course it does not apply now, coz I have a number of good friends whose company I enjoy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But, thats(the lonewolf) a part of me that will always be there, coz sometimes, we all need to alone, no?<br><br>------------------<br>Why?

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, judging frm the response to this topic, it seems as though this "lonewolf syndrome" only applies to guys... or is it because of the predominantly male "population" here?<br><br>i guess everyone has tt "lonewolf" deep inside, it's just a matter of how strong tt urge is and how they deal with it, even girls. but IMHO, the reason why there're less female "lonewolves" is cos it's less "acceptable" for gers to want to be alone, to stay away frm ppl. for me, i'm always surrounded by "friends", but, although we laugh and have fun together everyday, i can honestly say tt none of them know me well at all. sometimes i wonder if they even know me... sad eh?<br><br>haha, realise i'm diverting frm the original topic but just wanted to relate a lil abt my personal exps and see if anyone else feels the same?</div>
