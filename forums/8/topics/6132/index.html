            <div class='col-md body'>i was on a field trip to south africa with my jc geography mates. one night, we stopped over at this resort place which had chalet thingy-like accomodations. each chalet was placed at a short distance from the other.it was shaped like those typical huts and it was circular in shape and resembles a maze inside...well...call me psyhic but i didn't have a good feeling when we got there...it was 5 persons to a hut. one double bedroom and the other bedroom had 3 single beds.<br><br>weird things happening:<br>1)the toilet door when closed seemed to have this effect as if someone outside the toilet is banging on the door, wanting to come in...its damn freaky and we concluded that there wasn't any wind in the hut...we all left the door open when we went to the toilet...<br><br>2)D and i were unpacking in the room with the 3 single beds and both of us heard something.it was a man's voice...coming rite inside the hut...we didn't have to ask each other whether we heard anything coz our looks said everything...we shouted across the other bedroom and asked whether anybody heard anything, they said no...D and i looked at each other...<br><br>3)3 of my frens were in one of the bedroom(the one with the 3 single beds) talking and i was at the sink outside the bedroom washing up. all of a sudden, i heard a voice...someone singing...or humming...it was a female voice...very mellow and rich...i think it was humming...damn creepy...my hair stood up...i walked to the bedroom door and asked "Did u all hear that?" my frens stared at me and all said yes. After that, we again confirmed that it wasn't from the tv as the program on at that time was a talk show...hosted by a man.<br><br>4)while all these were happening, D fell asleep while watching tv in the living room. We shouted from our bedroom and told her to come in, and luckily she woke up. none of us dared to step outside the bedroom...when she came in, she told us that while she was sleeping, she heard footsteps walking outside the hut, around it. the couch was placed beside the glass panel windows...it was those full length sliding glass doors thingy...she heard someone or something walk around our hut!<br><br>5)i couldn't sleep the whole nite...i thought i kept hearing the toilet door slamming...and people pacing outside the bedroom door...the next morning, Aly who slept in the room with the double bed told us, she woke up in the middle of the nite and heard footsteps on the carpeted floor...walking towards her. all of a sudden, she couldn't move! she wanted to grab Dee's hand(who was sharing the bed with her)but she just couldn't move...she started to pray and after a while, everything was ok...<br><br>well, we stayed there luckily for only one nite which was torturous enough...some of the other girls stayed in the nearest hut to us asked why we didn't go over to their place...and i guessed all of us were too freaked out to move...we just wanted to stay in the hut and not go out...! well...even though we didn't see anything substantial, but we all heard and felt its presence...creepy rite? eventually we even formulated a romantic love ghost story...this couple who had stayed in the hut had committed suicide in the doublebed room and had came to say Hello to us! now whenever we think of it, its pretty funny..but it was terrifying back then!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well that was really spooky, kat.<br>My experience was not so bad compared to yours.<br>My ex-bf, (still my bf then) suggested we spend a night in his fren's place (a flat in Bedok) for wat occasion i cannot remember liao. The home was vacated for quite long coz the owners were from HongKong. They only come to stay when they were in town. Anyway I was bathing in the bathroom, when I heard a man whistling. I can hear it quite clearly and did not sound like it came from next door. I was really scared and quickly finish bathing and left the bathroom. When I asked my bf, he said he did not whistle.<br>When I noticed that the master bedroom was locked, I asked my bf if he has the key but he said no, even if he has the keys, he would not want to sleep inside.<br>Then he told me that before he brought me there he had stayed there with his fren before and both of them could hear noises coming from the master bedroom.<br>Nothing else happened except when I went to bathe again the next day, the same familiar whistling sound could be heard......<br>Wat is funny is when my bf went in, he hears nothing......<br>------------------<br>Fiddle Dee Dee! I will not think about it now, I will think about it tomorrow!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Scarlett (edited 11 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Happened when I was in Tekong serving my BMT in camp 3.<br><br>Story 1<br>-------<br>This one was told by my sergeant, who was the duty sergeant one night. During the cookhouse inspection, he heard water gushing from a tap inside. It's really gushing, and very loud. But the cookhouse was locked so he had to go and wake the duty cook to unlock it and turn off the tap. Funny thing is the duty cook was the last to leave the cookhouse and lock it, and he was sure that the tap was turned off then (coz if on and gushing, sure can hear wan). And only the duty cook has the key to the cookhouse!<br><br>Story 2<br>-------<br>In my bunk, I sleep in the last bed. So just next to my bed is the wall. Every night, at around 2-3 am, I will hear tapping sounds coming from the other side of the wall. It's a kind of slow rhythmic tapping, very scary. But I kinda ignored them and slept..too tired liao.<br><br>Story 3<br>-------<br>We were back from the firing range one day when this fellow recruit started behaving wierdly. We called our PC. Then he actually scolded our PC using vulgarities. Suddenly he seemed to go on a mad rampage, trying to bite everybody. You can see mucus flowing down his nose, and it takes at least 7 of us to hold him down, though he weighs only 49kg. He kept shouting in Malay saying somebody stepped on his grave. We had a hard time tying him to the bed. Then all the PCs of the other platoons also came up. They gathered all the malays in the company to chant dun know some Malay scriptures....at the end of the day, he passed out. We were summoned by our OC and the MO and told to keep quiet.</div>
