The few times I've been there, I've noticed one very beautiful looking girl employee there. Her age in the 20s. Her face VERY beautiful. Beautiful eyes, beautiful nose, beautiful mouth, beautiful lips, beautiful cheek, beautiful skin, beautiful skin color. Overall result = very beautiful. Almost perfect. No makeup, no fancy hairstyle. Simply doesn't need those.<br><br>Okay I know someone will ask me about her body. I didn't pay much attention to her body though. Her face was so nice to look at that I didn't even bother about the body.<br><br>So beautiful. I kinda admire her looks.</div>

Know Jurong Point shopping center?<br>At the basement of Jurong Point, there's a supermarket called Liberty. The few times I've been there, I've noticed one very beautiful looking girl employee there. Her age in the 20s. Her face VERY beautiful. Beautiful eyes, beautiful nose, beautiful mouth, beautiful lips, beautiful cheek, beautiful skin, beautiful skin color. Overall result = very beautiful. Almost perfect. No makeup, no fancy hairstyle. Simply doesn't need those.<br><br>Okay I know someone will ask me about her body. I didn't pay much attention to her body though. Her face was so nice to look at that I didn't even bother about the body.<br><br>So beautiful. I kinda admire her looks. </div></blockquote>try the mac in boon lay now.. got a new staff there too.. very chio and cute....always see guys trying to peep and talk to her at the counter.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
