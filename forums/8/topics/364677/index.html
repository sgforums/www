              <p>'Leadership - everyone has it'....but they failed to add, except them (the academic achievers.</p>
              <p>There is more to leadership than just books alone or sports alone. It's the ability to motivate and lead a group of people to achieving better results, be it in sports or academic achievement.</p>
              <p>Brains or Brawns, who is a better leader? Best is of course is one who have both in equal measure, failing which, I must say having brains would make a better leader, BUT only if he/she has other prerequisites of good leadership abilities. If not, then brains alone is as useless as milk that had been spilt.</p>
              <p>However, academic achievements is not a requirement in life. Happiness is, and that is to be who you really want to be. Some excel in sports and should be allowed to be trained in that field. Others who excel in arts should be encourage to follow their dreams and be the best that they can be.</p>
              <p>A society cannot exist alone with scholars. It needs all kinds of diverse fields together to make a nation great.</p>
              <p>And do tell them ( the academic achievers ) they are wrong. You do them injustice by calling them academic achievers, for they displayed naivety if not utter stupidity. Leadership is rare in the real world and not everyone has it. Only pompous fools lay claim to it.</p>

              <p>I personally feel it doesn't take much to lead people here, especially in docile SIngapore, here people respect titles and ranks, so all management falls on the onus of the leader. So people will do pretty much what you say. I can easily lead people here, but prolly not in Brisbane where colleagues take initiative and constantly question your decisions. I cant say about other places.</p>
              <p>I might agree with "leadership everyone has it" since there are LOTS of leader-ship training classes even for 8 year olds HAHA!!! Weird.</p>
              <p>But if you take your local leaders and plant them elsewhere in the
              world, it depends. How well u perform as a leader depends on how well
              you gell with whoever it is you are leading.</p>
              <p>But its not about academics. It's about building rapport.</p>
