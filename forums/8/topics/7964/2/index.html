He has also stated his intention to spend more time with his country.<br><br>And Keegan, the man who bought the former Blackburn star to Newcastle for Â£15 million, believes that his now ex captain has what it takes to become England supremo.<br><br>He said: 'I don't think it would be a surprise to anyone if Alan Shearer ends up being where I am England manager.

            <div class='col-md body'>England was never convincing during the qualifers, warm-up, actual Euro 2000 matches.<br>Keegan was not using his famous tactics he employed while he was a manager at Newcastle.<br><br>Fast, attacking football was what he did with Newcastle. He doesn't have shortage of strikers in his world cup team, he jolly well should get more attacking players for the last game. He nevered solved his left midfield problem, that was a big mistake. From where I read, "Keegan should always remember a left-midfielder should be using his left leg". He doesn't even know that, how can he actually gel the team and win any matches at all.<br></div>

The Spanish penalty was a little dubious though, didn't really catch the reason for it, the tugging wasn't that malicious in my opinion. But my heart went out for the Yugoslavians as they played well despite 10 men, and it is a good thing that at least they qualified for the quarter finals.<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No point harping on whose's fault it is, whether Nigel did right to punch the ball or whether Campbell have a future as a mannequin. Point is, if you played well as a team, we wouldn't have to go into the post mortem of deciding if the second goal was the goal keeper's fault or not. Hell, from all the matches i have seen, most notably England's ones, we are know that 1 or 2 goals down simply means NOTHING!!!! And to think they compliment the English on playing with their hearts out and giving their all. Yeah right! When the Romanians equalised in the second half, the bloody players looks like crying and giving up liao!!!<br>On second thoughts, maybe they are too overwhealmed by the opposing teams. Fatality was written all over their face...<br>Nay, on third thoughts, if Slovenia can rise above their tag of underdogs's underdogs and draw with Yugoslavia, being overawed by your opponents just doesn't cuts it.<br><br>Why the hell should i go on and on. I think we should know what's so wrong with their teams and their state of football craft in general. Catch the reviews written by the columnist at soccernet, rather well written and i agreed with what they wrote.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>
