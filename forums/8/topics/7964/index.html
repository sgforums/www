            <div class='col-md body'>I agree. England's performance is appalling. Couldn't believe that the 11 players are actually professionals. Reminds me of us amateurs going up there playing. I would tend to disagree that Nigel Martyn played awfully. He had quite a good game, making lots of vital saves to keep the scoreline respectable. Imagine had it been David Seaman, I wouldn't be surprised if the scoreline was something like 5-2. The humiliation to the English fans would be unthinkable. The English defence was most disturbing. World class defenders which such high profiles as Martin Keown and Sol Campbell. I would have expected them to do better, but alas, that would not be the case. How many times have we seen the English defence caught sleeping??? And the midfield, what is Paul Ince still doing in the first team lineup??? Can see him just walking as the Romanians push the ball to the English defence. And furthermore, the basic elementary techniques of passing the ball correctly to ur team mate, where is that?? I can easily count the number of successful passes there had been by an English player.<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>And what is Shearer still doing in the starting lineup??? It is a good thing that this is the last of his games for England. He was ineffective as a striker, and from what I see, the defenders didn't even bother to spare a player to manmark him like they did for Owen. To think Owen was substituted with Heskey instead of Shearer, what is this??? Owen was neither tired nor ineffective. He was quite lively in attack today and he should not have, at all, been taken out. All the while, the England team has been playing as if a draw would suffice. And a draw was not what they got. All I can say is, England deserved to lose the game, I am extremely disappointed with the players, and they played with absolutely no techniques. They are just like little kids playing against professionals. And now to see how the fans of the little kids react to this loss.<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

Kevin Keegan is a brianless fellow....... never seems to make the rite decision.........<br><br>English Clubs better stop importing foreign players lar...... all of them keep improving but the English themselves didn't. Or, they did better concentrade on youth development, like what S'pore did, hahaha....... GOAL 2010 ....... think they need more yrs than s'pore do.........<br><br>Its a good thing England never get the draw......can't imagine them going into the quater final..... think if they do, which ever team who meet them will be laughing mad, cos as what we say 'kio teo'.<br><br>Well Germany also another flop this yr...... really speechless abt these 2 'brothers' ...... dunnoe how they got into the top 4 the last Euro.......<br><br>Okie my apologises if i sound frustrated but i really am........ arrgghhh~! Think i better start predicting how many English fans would be killed today. Any guesses?<br><br>BTW, never watch the match, haha....heng ah. Does romania deserve the last min penalty? Or the referee purposely wants england to get out of the competition soon...... maybe, cause of the fans.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh well, beside the issue of whether england played well or not, or whether they deserves to make it into the quarter finals...i think the belgiums and dutch can now rest in peace, with most of the english fans going back home via dunkirk. Hiak, to think i catch the news diligently for some good old rioting and mass chaos  :p<br><br>As for the game itself...i think i was written all over straight from the start that england will lose the match. Technically, they far far inferior to the romanians and the english's midfield is pratically non existent. For god's sake, they can't even string a proper pass the their possession techniques' *shudder* horrendous. It would indeed be unfair to the romanians if they fair to qualify...still have no idea why ppl keep on insisting that they have the best league in the world and perpertual cup favourites. Forget it man, and this is only the european teams they have to face...<br><br>By the way, wonder if the english hooligans will have a last "bash" before going home.  :p<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>fellow soccer diehards of sgforums, i am sad to bring to you the following piece of news..<br>:~~~~~~~~~(<br><br>From soccernet.com:<br><br>"Kevin Keegan has tipped skipper Alan Shearer to become an England coach of the future.<br><br>Shearer has said he will not be going back on his decision to retire from international football at the age of 29, having gained 63 caps and scored 30 goals for his country.<br><br>Shearer will now concentrate on life in the Premiership with Newcastle United, where he is being groomed to succeed Bobby Robson as manager. He has also stated his intention to spend more time with his country.<br><br>And Keegan, the man who bought the former Blackburn star to Newcastle for Â£15 million, believes that his now ex captain has what it takes to become England supremo.<br><br>He said: 'I don't think it would be a surprise to anyone if Alan Shearer ends up being where I am England manager. He has all the qualities."</div>
