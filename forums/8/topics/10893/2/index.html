            <div class='col-md body'>HA HA HA, talk about deja vu! Somebody here apparently has leg trouble as well, though to much lesser degree as compared to mine. I really must get a scanner and scan myself in crutches and a knee brace as well! Don't worry pal, I know ALL the inconveniences of not having two good legs, it's easy to identify. And yes, I'll have to sit out the rest of my NS life at home doing absolutely nothing too.<br><br>SO just in case anyone else has forgotten, poor KTE here is also a temporary bai kah ok? I also cannot go out, because it's so darn inconvinient to get around anywhere in crutches. A lot of things I also cannot do. Wah liew, we're the bai kah brothers man, HA HA HA!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. That explains alot of things my friend. Speaking of signatures, People are really getting into the swing of amusing things recently: Saw a topic asking who is attached and who is not. Given the medium of the forum, coupled with the apparent anonymity of the users partaking in it, I wonder how true the answers will be. There were however, two guys with super-long signatures... those things were a fairly interesting read, but they got a little tricky to scroll past. What say you?</div>

Hey, you know how long this kind of injury takes to heal or not? Wah liew, I have been in crutches for two months already, and a few days ago the doctor told me that for another month "no weight on the right leg", which means another month on crutches! ARGH!!!<br><br>Aiyah, if I got two good legs also I cannot cheong lah. I dance like a robot like that, no sense of rythem, aiyah cannot lah. Makan outings can lah, but still rather inconvenient.

At least your injury is not as bad as mine. But you still have to go to work? Wah liew, SAF really bloodsuckers sia!

That Ding guy also damn sia suay.<br><br>Right now, yar lar, on Attend C indefinately. Go doctor for check-up every month, just to get MC only. Extend extend extend, until I also don't know lah. I hope that the SAF will discharge me. After all, they give me desk job also no use, by the time I fully recover, my NS more than half over already. Sevice vocation only two years what right?
