            <div class='col-md body'>The most important distinction between<br>western and eastern philosophy is that<br><br>1) Western philosophy intellectualises<br>too much. Too many logical demarcations.<br>Too many romanticizations of our world<br>(teleological argument for god for example).<br>Too many preconceived (intended) conclusions.<br><br>2) Eastern philosophy, on the other hand, is<br>to be lived. That simple. Which is why it is<br>common for eastern philosophical treatise to<br>be expressed in terms of artistic creations,<br>like poetry, paintings, tea ceremony,<br>swordsmanship and calligraphy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we have to see the tradition from which both philosophies come from. Western philosophy is responsible for a taxonomy of the sciences via Aristotle. As such the programme of critical questioning and emphasis on empiricism has a long a history as western philosophy itself.<br><br>Then comes along Derrida in the 20th cent with his deconstructionism. now it seems meanings are unstable and language is unreliable, all of western philosophy is built unpon a very arbitrary logocentrism. The implications are horrific. Unstable meanings mean no real truths, only truisms. Creative readings of any text will reveal how some ideas signified by any binary system are 'privileged' over others. If it is correct to saying meaning is generated by the difference, then some differences will be given priority over others, whose meanings are 'deferred'. Meanings are inherently unstable and so will inevitably 'slip' when exchanged. There can be no 'presence' of stable meaning when communication takes place. So Derrida subverts any claims a philosopher might make about permanent truths somehow lying outside or beyond language.<br><br>Hence, how do we know knowledge?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terence,<br><br>I am not answering your question, just came<br>back from work. Am quite tired to think of<br>an intelligent reply. Anyhow, here are some<br>comments.<br><br>Derrida is something new to me, but<br>deconstructionism (of values) was carried<br>out by more individuals other than Derrida.<br><br>Nietzsche immediately comes to mind. In<br>Die Frohliche Wissenshaft, his deconstruction<br>of values came as a shock to fellow<br>academics. But Nietzsche uses too much<br>imagery in his work, though the theme<br>addresses the common man, the manner of<br>expression however, does not. Most people<br>will not understand Nietzsche's grand<br>message.<br><br>How do we know knowledge? my my, that simple<br>question almost encompasses everything that<br>philosophy comes to represent, yah?<br><br>[This message has been edited by ngkaihoe (edited 13 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ngkaihoe,<br><br>I agree. Nietzsche didn't gain his reputation for being the grandfather of postmodernism for nothing. Successive modern writers, especially french, have been so influenced by him i.e. Satre, Derrida, Foucault. The imagery Nietzsche employs has been aptly nebulous enough for multiple interpretation, which of course suits the postmodern agenda.<br><br>To expand on the problematics of Nietzsche's discourse, even the Ubermensch in 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra' has never been conclusively agreed upon. A superior being? A conceptual destination for social evolution? A super-class? A personal ideal? What about his Will to Power? Metaphysical? Biological? Socio-political? The list goes on. (I personally prefer Schopenhauer's 'The World as Will and Idea. Its more romantic, comprehensive and less filled with agendas) As a result, not only for this example, but for the entire spectrum of Nietzschean philosophy there has to be an internal dialect. In otherwords, turn his discourse upon itself and compare and contrast. For example the Ubermensch seems to make sense only when juxtaposed against the Overman (representative of the hatred Nietzsche had for mediocrity).<br><br>There are lots i like about Freddie but even more i disgree with. I read you are into Street Philosophy. Care to elaborate? Where did you study philosophy?<br>cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nietzsche's Will To Power, from the way I<br>understand it, is purely pscychological.<br><br>Will to Power, represents the psychological<br>tendency to subjugate the reality to a<br>"reality" which is conducive for the<br>individual to live in.<br><br>Like for example, people who believe in God,<br>_not_ because there is really a god, but they<br>_want_ to feel the presence of God. So that<br>their existence will not be that lonely, and<br>with the belief in God, they can go on with<br>the psychological exercise of slowly<br>subjugating themselves to believe in<br>an afterlife, in an attempt to extend their<br>lives beyond their biological bodies.<br><br>From the viewpoint of Nietzsche's will to<br>power, christian faith is the result of a<br>psychological exercise to extend itself<br>and make themselves "happier" in a given<br>environment - the Will to Power.<br><br>Thanks, comments please.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, may have to disagree with you on this pal.<br><br>christian morality to nietzsche was the revenge of the weak against the strong. the former were down-trodden, and old freddie felt that christian morality was an invention they employed to extert for themselves some sense of superiority. the tennets of christian teaching removed the weak from the 'game', in fact, it changed the rules entirely such that the weak could claim vis-a-vis religion some semblance of revenge against those who oppressed them. as such the famous 'herd mentality' was formed which of course freddie despised. the 'will to power' best manifested in the ubermensch, breaking rules and values, being beholden to neither ideology nor persons and is the antithesis to christian morality.<br><br>cheers.<br>comments pls?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terence,<br><br>And is this not psychological in nature?<br><br>Christianity teaches that the meek shall<br>inherit the kingdom of god.<br><br>The religious connotation is not as important<br>as its psychological connotation, if you are<br>looking at the sociological effects of<br>christianity.<br><br>To equalize whatever inequalities that they<br>have received, they have forced themselves to<br>accept the idea of the meek shall inherit<br>the kingdom of god. In the face of<br>oppression, they fantasise that their<br>oppressors will burn in hell and they meet<br>their holy father in heaven.<br><br>And thus, christianity, socially and<br>psychologically manifests itself as a<br>terribly vindinctive theology/philosophy.<br>Even though christ would have probably<br>turned in his grave (which he did, HAHAHAH)<br>at such a vindinctive interpration of His<br>words.<br><br>I think there is a misinterpration of the<br>will to power and Ubermensch here though.<br>Will to Power is the psychological tendency<br>to equalize whatever inequalities. Ubermensch<br>is an appeal from Nietzsche that men should<br>look beyond all the present social values and<br>prejudices and carve out a path for himself.<br><br>Nietzsche's Ubermensch is not purely anti-<br>christianity (the social entity, with<br>distinction from it being a religious entity)<br>but anti mediocrity. Nietzsche spits on<br>slave morality-system like Hinduism and<br>Buddhism too.</div>
