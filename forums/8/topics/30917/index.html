            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday, I was on board a bus going home. As it was just after office hours, the bus was crowded all the way to people standing on the front door steps.<br><br>Anyway, I have seen with my very own eyes 6 people when alighting at the last stop, in their hurry to get down the bus, tap their EZ link card at the front door of the bus.<br><br>Instead of getting a refund back on their cards, they are charged more and the card reader displayed "New Ride".<br><br>this is because the card reader is still in Entry mode and will charge money instead of refund money when you tap yourcard to get out.<br><br>So for these 6 people, their bus ride should only be $0.63. They tap to board the bus, the bus charged full price of $1.80 to be refunded later when they tap to alight.<br><br>Once reach their stop, the are squeezed at the front, and tap the reader in ENTRY mode. Instead of getting a refund so that they pay only $0.63 for the bus ride, they are charged $1.80 for another new ride.<br><br>So a simply $0.63 bus ride they had to pay $1.80 + $1.80 = $3.60 for it!! They have overpaid 6 times the original price of the bus ride!<br><br>Imagine how much extra pocket money SBS is collecting from all these "errors". My bus ride alone yesterday, 6 people were charged extra this way. Imagine how many busses in Singaopore operating at peak hours multiplying this with at least 6 people per bus overcharged for their bus rides.<br><br>Reminder:<br><br>1. Only tap your EZ link card at the reader WHEN YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF that the reader is in EXIT mode.<br><br>2. Do not, NEVER tap your card to alight at a reader in ENTRY mode. Instead of getting a refund, you will be charged a New Ride at FULL PRICE.<br><br>3. When bus crowded and you must alight at front door, INSIST the bus driver change the front readers to EXIT mode and TELL YOU which reader to tap, before tapping. (The bus driver will only change ONE reader to EXIT mode in front. Find out which one.)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the same situation happened to me abt 2 months back lor. i was with a group of friends n there were abt 6-7 of us. when we reach our stop, my friend tap the reader at the bus entrance so i thought the bus driver change the reader mode liao lor. i was the last one to alight and after i tapped the card, to my horror i saw the words "new entry"!<br>i feel that sometimes the bus driver muz take the initiative, especially when as much as 6 pple get down, he could have switch the mode by the time the 2nd person alighted.<br><br>Gimme the farecard system anytime man!</div>
