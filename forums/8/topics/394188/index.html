              <p>This is the impression that I get when I visit courts today.</p>
              <p>I saw 1 retail staff guy standing there zhou bo. I approach him ask him how much does it cost to install office 2007 on my labtop.</p>
              <p>He replied asking me to go and ask the IT guys over there. What I saw him pointing in that direction was many other retail staff who are standing there and zhou bo too so I am wondering which is the IT guy that he is talking about when I see a group of zhou bo staff standing there.</p>
              <p>So I just walk over there and ask the group of guys standing there how much does it cost to install office 2007 on my labtop. They give me the same reply again that to approach the IT guys over there. This time they pointed to me to a different direction from what the 1st guy pointed to me.</p>
              <p>I couldn't even bother to go to the other direction to ask anymore. They are zhou bo stand down there and don't even bother to bring me to where the so call IT guys are.</p>
              <p>I just walk out of courts. They simply sucks. Tomorrow I will go to challenger and ask them</p>
