            <div class='col-md body'>I just could not understand and have the following questions (highlight in Red).<br><br>This was what "the bunny" said<br><br>"This morning, while I was sleeping in the bus, a woman suddenly yelled<br><br>"You molester! Why did you touch my legs? I'm going to call the police!"<br><br>The yell broke the silence and woke me up. I saw a lady in business suit approach the bus driver and told him what happened. According to the lady, an indian guy sitting next to her touched her legs. She was however, not the first victim. <span style="color: red;">How did you know she's not the first??? </span><br><br>The bus driver seems unwilling to drive to the police station. I wouldn't say he's terrible to do that but then he might have considered the fact that there are people on the bus who needs to go for work.<br><br>The lady was of course furious about it but no matter how much she've said, no action was taken on the molester. NO ACtiON. <span style="color: red;">Are you there to listen to what they've said???</span> A middle age lady sitting near the exit door kindly advised her to call the police instead of making a scene in the bus. The lady refused to listen and continued babbling about how wrong the molestor was. <span style="color: red;">So why did she not call the Police??? </span>After that, I realized that a girl/lady was molestered by this indian guy as well but she kept quiet. <span style="color: red;">If she kept quiet, how did you know she was molested??? </span>The babbling continued and more facts came out. It seems that the indian guy, who touched her leg, slowly shifted his hands up and attempted to touch ahem ahem. <span style="color: red;">Did you see it???</span> That's when the lady stood up and yelled.<br><br>At the next bus stop, the driver let passengers to board the bus so the back door was opened as well. The molester escaped! The lady attempted to stop him but couldn't. I was like watching a drama show there -_- . I was quite guilty that I didn't lend a hand to help but on second thought, I couldn't have stopped him as well. I don't have the strength to. You can say this is a fact of mine or an excuse. Whatever but I didn't help and the molester just ran off after his pervertic acts.<br><br>The aunties sitting beside me started saying that it wasn't the first time the molester did this. I was wondering why didn't she said this earlier. If she witnessed this before, she should have warned the passengers or call the police to catch the molester immediately. Oh, by the way, it's two aunties.<br><br>Notes: The molester admitted what he has done. <span style="color: red;">You mean the molester told you???</span> There are witnesses in the bus. I don't have a handphone with me at that time but someone or those victims should have made the call. I don't know how the police is going to track the bus or how the molester is going to be retained in the bus until the police come... but this is what the bus driver and a middle age auntie told the lady to do.<br><br>I tried to make this look like an account. Sorry if there's any grammer mistakes or watsoever.<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Bus 242.<br>Molester escaped at the SHELL petrol station bus stop.<br>Time was 7+++ am. Told you I don't have hp with me... I don't have watch as well.<br>Everybody living around jurong west area taking bus 242, please be beware of an indian guy. AND make report if you're a victim please -_-. Dont' let him escape again. I don't remember his looks ok... because I was kinda frightened by what happened. So dramatic.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">I'm just surprised that one who had no watch, no handphone, could write with so much vivid details, could not remember the bus registration number and more importantly did not raise a finger to help the molested lady. What's more, it happened 7++ in the morning where the bus should be packed with passengers but none bothered to help. And now, with this mindless and selfish account claiming that the driver did not help, have you thought that he might be sacked.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> Poor guy if SBS is to take drastic disciplinary action against him.

If ts really wants to be helpful, be constructive and perhaps go to the Police and give a description. If by not doing anything on board is right and saying the driver did not help, well if that's her way of so called justice, be it.  But all I wish to say is when you start writing something negative about someone, think of what consequences it might bring. In this case, I would say this whole article by ts may inform others what's happening but if everyone behaves like ts, no amount of writing here will nab the perpetrator. Like what you said No Action Talk Only. Think from another angle, if the driver is sacked because of this article, is it fair?</div>

By looking at my so-call description, can u even imagine how he look?!!!!!<br><br>I don't even have hp or camera with me to take photo of tt molester...<br>reason being my phone is thrown and my sim card was broken. This is off topic. -_-<br><br>Oh well. I don't believe people on the bus don't have hp and hp with camera with them... it was morning and people are taking bus to their workplace... and it's not like there're more students than adults. Most students taking 242 are juying secondary and xin nan primary de. So after that stop, most of the passengers are adults.<br><br>If I call the police... what can they do when I tell them. An indian molested two ladies on bus. Facial features? I don't remember. i only know he has big eyes... You know indians usually have big eyes.<br><br>Yar, I feel guilty for not helping. The girl listening to mp3 beside me wasn't even bothered about it. We're sitting next to the exit. I'm sitting near the window.<br><br>Like no link.. lolx...<br><br>Can police come up with a CG image of an indian guy when the only description I provided is ... He is an indian with big eyes. Are they going to draw out an anime indian character????!!!!<br><br>If I really do nothing about it, I won't be here giving warnings.<br>Would I even bother to tell people there's this person who always aroud jurong west area molesting ladies????? ......<br>Would I bother?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
