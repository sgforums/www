Why did you touch my legs? I'm going to call the police!"<br><br>The yell broke the silence and woke me up. I saw a lady in business suit approach the bus driver and told him what happened. According to the lady, an indian guy sitting next to her touched her legs. She was however, not the first victim.<br><br>The bus driver seems unwilling to drive to the police station. I wouldn't say he's terrible to do that but then he might have considered the fact that there are people on the bus who needs to go for work.<br>The lady was of course furious about it but no matter how much she've said, no action was taken on the molester. NO ACtiON. A middle age lady sitting near the exit door kindly advised her to call the police instead of making a scene in the bus. The lady refused to listen and continued babbling about how wrong the molestor was. After that, I realized that a girl/lady was molestered by this indian guy as well but she kept quiet. The babbling continued and more facts came out. It seems that the indian guy, who touched her leg, slowly shifted his hands up and attempted to touch ahem ahem. That's when the lady stood up and yelled.<br><br>At the next bus stop, the driver let passengers to board the bus so the back door was opened as well. The molester escaped! The lady attempted to stop him but couldn't. I was like watching a drama show there -_- . I was quite guilty that I didn't lend a hand to help but on second thought, I couldn't have stopped him as well. I don't have the strength to. You can say this is a fact of mine or an excuse. Whatever but I didn't help and the molester just ran off after his pervertic acts.<br><br>The aunties sitting beside me started saying that it wasn't the first time the molester did this. I was wondering why didn't she said this earlier. If she witnessed this before, she should have warned the passengers or call the police to catch the molester immediately. Oh, by the way, it's two aunties.<br><br>Notes: The molester admitted what he has done. There are witnesses in the bus. I don't have a handphone with me at that time but someone or those victims should have made the call. I don't know how the police is going to track the bus or how the molester is going to be retained in the bus until the police come... but this is what the bus driver and a middle age auntie told the lady to do.<br><br>I tried to make this look like an account. Sorry if there's any grammer mistakes or watsoever.<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Bus 242.<br>Molester escaped at the SHELL petrol station bus stop.<br>Time was 7+++ am. Told you I don't have hp with me... I don't have watch as well.<br>Everybody living around jurong west area taking bus 242, please be beware of an indian guy. AND make report if you're a victim please -_-. Dont' let him escape again. I don't remember his looks ok... because I was kinda frightened by what happened. So dramatic.<br><br>That's the end.<br></div></blockquote><span style="color: green;">242? damn.. gonna catch some molester  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span></div>
