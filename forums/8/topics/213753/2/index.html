If an alien civilisation has developed the technology to warp-jump (oh yes they dont travel across space like we think they do, they Jump from Point to Point), then it is also logical to assume that species has also overcome diseases on their homeworld, but the viruses here CAN kill them, if they havent already discovered how to protect themselves against it (after years of visiting the Earth conducting experiments).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>theres another theory that says the aliens we encounter are from a higher dimension which is right here but imperceptible to us. For those who don't really understand what I'm trying to say I'm gonna give a nice example. Imagine theres Player A and Player B in MapleStory. Now Player A is in Aquila Server, Channel 1 and Player B is in Aquila Server, Channel 2. Both of them are standing by the taxi in Henesys Town. When Player A switches from Channel 1 to Channel 2, Player B will see Player A suddenly appearing beside him next to the taxi! This may be how these alien visitors elude us, by switching between alter-realities to avoid detection and capture by Terran forces.</div>
