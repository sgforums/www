We r not alone.<br><br><img src="http://www.ufocasebook.com/phoenixmain.jpg"><br><br>Summary: UFO cases with multiple witnesses, photographic and video evidence carry the heaviest weight to those who remain on neutral ground. One of the best of these is the Phoenix, Arizona lights case of 1997. Supported by many photographs and videos, this fantastic event is still discussed and analyzed today. A large, unknown object sitting over a major city? It really happened.<br>The Lights Appear: March 13, 1997 was the onset of this extremely compelling account of various and sundry phenomenal lights which moved over the state of Arizona. These lights, though referred to as the "Phoenix Lights," were actually witnessed in at least five other cities. Phoenix has the distinction as the first Arizona city to report the unknown light sources, which were initially spotted over Superstition Mountains, east of the city, at about 7:30 PM.<br>Six Points of Light: The first reports indicated an object of six points of light, immediately followed by a report of eight connected lights, with a separate ninth, which moved in unison with the eight. The formation was seen again over the Gila River just before 10:00 PM. In a matter of minutes, the enormous, lighted structure had made its way over the southern part of the city of Phoenix. At this time, literally thousands of people witnessed the object or objects.<br><br>More Than One Mile in Length: The enormous object was extremely low, and mountainous areas could be seen behind the craft in pictures, therefore giving photographic experts scale to approximate the elevation from the ground, and the distance from the camera. This would enable an estimate of the craft being a whopping one mile or more in length! The color of its lights were described as "blue-white," to "yellow-white," to "amber</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At the same time , Another gigantic alien mothership was seen.<br><br><img src="http://www.ufoindia.org/images/press/phoenix-vcraft.jpg"><br><br>Another group of witnesses reported the largest craft of all, which was reportedly to be over 3 kilometres wide. This massive craft is known as the "Big Black Triangle".<br><br>This gigantic craft was first seen at close range over north Phoenix between 8:30 and 8:45 P.M. where the key witnesses (real estate people who subdivided the area) estimated its size to be as much as 3.2 kilometres wide as its wingtip lights fell over streets that are 2.8 kilometres apart. Its flight path brought it low to the ground (about 2,000 feet) where it was seen to not only have dozens of lights along its leading edges, but also a row of windows wherein the silhouettes of "people" were observed! At some point further south, other witnesses reported that they saw nothing but the row of windows with silhouetted beings as all the other lights were turned off at this point. Soon after the craft was seen by a family travelling on Interstate-10 freeway from Tucson to Phoenix.<br><br>To estimate the size of this object, consider the following testimony from this family. The witnesses, who were travelling in their car on I- 10 near Casa Grande said the object was so large that they could see one "wing tip" of the object from the left window of their car, and the other "wing tip" from the right. They estimated they were driving at approximately 130 kilometres per hour, and they remained under the object for between one and two minutes as it moved in the OPPOSITE direction! They emphasized how large the object was as it blocked out the sky over their car. They say that the ship was large enough for a C5-A Galaxy or "Condor" troop transport plane (the largest conventional aircraft known) to land upon it! The craft had definite structure to it, and a flat-blue black colour like that of a shotgun barrel. They also reported seeing rectangular "panel-like" structures on the underside of the craft.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An another interesting aspect to the Phoenix Lights case is that despite several witnesses who say at least 6-8 pairs of F-15 fighters from the nearby LAFB were scrambled to intercept these gigantic UFOs, the Air Force denies it. LAFB public relations people have attributed the strange lights in the video to be "flares" dropped by an Air Force aircraft. However, all experts agree that the characteristics of flares are very different from what was seen on that night. No flares can last for as long as the lights over Phoenix did. Also, flares emit smoke trails as they drop, and they do not stay at a stationary altitude. This announcement clearly indicates an attempt to block the truth. The LAFB also denies that they received calls that night of strange occurences over the Phoenix skies. But telephone records of scores of people clearly indicate otherwise. They called LAFB and reported these sightings.<br><br>Despite thousands of witnesses, videotape aired on CNN and the clear cover-up by authorities, this case was virtually blocked out from the print media, until USA Today did a front page article on this on June 18, 1997.<br><br>What really happened that night? Why is there a cover-up? Why is the media not helping in getting to the bottom of this case?<br><br>One thing is for certain, the Phoenix Lights sightings are humanity's clearest indication, so far, that we are not alone!</div>

The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, will establish without any doubt the reality of these phenomena, according to Dr. Steven M. Greer, director of the Disclosure Project which hosted the event. http://www.disclosureproject.com<br></div>
