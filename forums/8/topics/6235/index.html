            <div class='col-md body'>I cannot help but wonder why I am in this state again. Why is it that most of the girls that attract me are already attached?<br><br>I find you attractive, kind, cheeky and lots of fun to be with. Yet I have also seen how happy you are in your relationship, and I have felt how much you love him. I have seen how much he means to you, and how much you mean to him.<br><br>I would rather have myselfed flogged than cause a ripple in such a loving relationship, one that is so warm, one that has nutured, coerced and shaped you into the beautiful woman that you are now.<br><br>Everytime I see a loving relationship like yours I have to ask if there is anything wrong about me that precludes me from enjoying similar bliss. I can no longer blame the lack of fortune for this loneliness, because ultimately it is my actions that bring about what happens to me. There are pressures to get into relationships, some justified, some not. Yet the greater the pressure, the more I do not want to settle for anyone who happens to come by. Because there is no such thing as someone for one to settle for.<br><br>I am sad because I have fell for you, someone so unachievable through decent means.<br><br>I would love to believe that I can be content enough to be your friend, to maintain our friendship as it is, keeping my intentions honourable., but I would be asking a lot from myself. Since I cannot bring myself to leave as yet, I promise I will remove myself if I find that I am crossing this line.<br><br>As it is, I cannot tell you all this, because I do not want to bring doubt into your relationship. That is why I am writing this letter to you, Ms. X, and to no one, at the same time, for you cannot know who I am, nor can I send this letter to you.<br><br>Perhaps I am destined to suffer this type of misery, but such is my life. So be it.<br><br>With much love,<br>WB<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I seriously don't agree with what USABOI has to say about this.<br><br>I thought that there was supposed to be som ekind of unwritten respect for other people's relationship...Because if a person tries hard enuff he can pretty much break up any relationship..except maybe those super strong ones which we know most people dun have...<br><br>There are and always will forever be someone better than the one who is with you. Always...and you will most likely meet them throughout the course of your life while you are attached...but it doesn't mean you should jump on whoever is best that comes along for you...nor does it mean that just because you are better than another guy you should go and take someoen else away from him.<br><br>I refuse to believe that claimt hat everything can be broken so go ahead and break it if it benefits you...<br><br>what kind of thinking is that??????!!!!<br><br>I can seriously tell you how you can break off a strong realtionship...just black mail one of them and put them into circumstances that will eventually destrtoy their marriage or what have you...then jump in when the girl is most vulnerable...<br><br>Pure evil and not a thing real men would do..but the act of cowardice.  shoot me down if you will but i defend the right of common decency and respect.<br><br>where did the thought for the other party got go..where is the consideration?  of how they feel...??...and if everyone thot like that then people might as well not bother to get attached  or married inthe first  place..just go run around porking everythign you see....<br><br>rubbish....If she is going to be yours and she is attached, it will happen of it's own accord...you force it and you win a false victory...someone else can force it from u...and it neevr ends and there can never be any kind of security or consolation...<br><br>WB, be her friend...if she was meant to be yours then so be it...if your causign problems then i hope that you have the common deceny and heart to know when u are causing more apin than good for someone else because of your own selfishnes???...The girl suffers too when she has to make these kinds of decisions...where in the world did we lose our sense of humanity..<br><br>ok i[m off subject and sure to get killed for it so i stop...<br><br>bye bye...<br><br>WB....take heart in that you will fiund someone...or maybe you just ahppen to liek attached girls..a fetish maybe...dunno..just an afterthoguht<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would have to agree with what Firewire says as well.<br><br>But I'm not such an honourable person. I support his view because I am selfish. Personally, I would hate for someone to come into my relationship with my GF. Call it insecure, call it worthless, but I just don't want this type of unneccesary interuptions.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I totally expect shit to happen somewhere along the way, but if I had a choice, no thanks.<br><br>Morals shmorals. When you are in the heat of things you find whatever reasons to justify what you are doing. So, WB, I do hope you are able to remain as a friend like you promised.<br><br>BTW, you didn't mention if she feels the same way, because if you knew that, then the dynamics change. I suppose its different to be rejected because she treasures the relationship enough not to keep it, and another to reject you because she doesn't like you. Sorry, but that has to be said.<br><br>Just another comment on what Firewire said. I don't quite agree that you will always come across someone better. I think you will always come across someone new, and it will seem to be better because I think people crave excitement and novelty. Sadly, I believe that is too true in terms of romance.<br><br>Hope everything turns out right. For everyone.</div>

If tht gal is faithful to u..nothing really can change or shake her heart.<br><br>It's good also tht u can see how strong the love is and also a test of time for both of u..  Not even to mention tht the gal haven;t wear a ring.. Even if she has, she can even  change her heart, rite? I got see this b4....A love for ten year and even wear rinbg alredy also can change..(tht's my sis...but not her fault)<br><br>But if u really wanna try to "snatch" other gf..please play it gentlemenly..Win like a gentlemen and lose like one.. At least, the gals' bf will start to be anxious and scare of her gf being snatch away and will try to win her back and it's really good if u see it in a correct way.<br><br>Then u will knoe how mcuh your bf will treasure u...:-) At leat tht will add some "excitment" to long relationship...U got to else no one will treasure anything...<br><br>From :<br>Just a neutral party</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't really know this is good or bad but I agree 2 Patie in some way. WB should do what he feel he should do &amp; 2 step into a relationship as a third party or not also is determine by him &amp; him onli. The girl end up with WB or stay with her guy is not for WB 2 determine. Its determine by the girl. The onli thing that WB can do is try but of course, he can don't try as well. But the ultimate decision is still the girl. There R risks in anything U do. Big or small. But if WB handle it properly, I don't think there will be much unhappiness going aroung btw the three of them. I mean the unhappiness can always reduce 2 the minimum. No matter what, its WB's decision. ^_^ Any suggestions? Comments?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm... discuss about a similiar topic in another forum sometime back. *laffs* now, I see all the ink in people coming out. finally I see the wisdom of tet. *winks* I always believe you to be smart.<br><br>Ok, time to flex my braincells, hmmm, I half agree with fire, and half agree with tet.<br><br>Wirie<br>Bro, I understand the pain of having your love one taken away, thus I understand your sentiments. But I'm different, I see that my gal have found a better man, and that's a very practical reason for her. Maybe I'm a logical person myself, but even that took me sometime to figure this out. I too, will go after a woman who is aready attached. (not married) In fact, I have done it quite a few times, to no sucess though. *smiles* But what I feel is that, I have achoice and so does she. My choice is that I choose to think that I can make her happier than she aready is presently with her bf. And thus I choose to win her heart. But then again, she too have the choice of judgement, the ability to choose herself and judge herself as to whether I make a better companion to her in life. That's her call, not mine. But to go to the extremes like youe said, e.g. balckmailing, that I would not do, even in a man like me, I have the basics of a gentleman, not a hypocrit. As for the other guy, well, he can choose to compete or drop out from the fight, if he drops out, it just shows how much he cares, if he does not, then we shall see where it take us three. If the girl happens to decide that I'm better, that is in case, I think that the guy should gracefully let go, just like I did/will, (I'm not just preaching here, it actually happen to me, though it's difficult.) If not. I would think of the guy as a selfish man. Why? Would you not give up your happiness for your love one's? Would you not see that the gal is ultimately not for you, and that the one for you will just come along later? These questions surface to me, after my breakup, and help me to think through things. It's not that I dare not fight, just that I know she has made a choice. Thus, being objective helps in my thinking.<br><br>tet:<br>Yes the guy would have missed a perfectly good chance to find his wife, if he is just to give iot a miss. As explain above to wirie, I agree that affairs of the heart cannot be judge by morals and honor, ironically, I feel that logic plays a big part in the thinking process for me. Maybe it only help me to get voer my break up, but it did help me. I too believe in going all out to get your happiness, only you know what you want in life, and even if you know, no action means being stagnant. Thus my theroy in life is the go getter attitude, but of course, like I state above too, I still play by the rules, and may the best man wins.<br><br>And of course if you still lose out in the end, move on, theres no growth without failure, and dun be a sore loser, what will be will be.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm..i think we still got to go back to one question...Why are we always looking for a bf or gf all these while? some even changing and changing gfs or bfs...<br><br>The main aim is to find a person who love us and two hearts can be happy together. In life, we are lawyas looking for someone better and better.. i think that if u think the person who is attach can be your future wife or will make u happier ..there's no wrong in going after her even if she got bf or whtever.<br>Most important is tht we can find soemone who love us and we can be happy.  isn;t tht wht LOVE is all abt? Else we won't need to take so much time looking for a bf or gf. And there won't be so much broken hearts ard if the first one suit us. Don't u think so?? hmmm..wondering agian....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm..... personally, I'm with FireWire. Granted that, yes, competition is indeed good (in a sense.) but when you think about it this way, the relationship would have settled into a stable, yet monotonous situation. (eg. The guy is no longer as romantic, or devotes as much time to the gal as it was initially in their relationship.) And the girl would very very definitely be tempted by erm... newer/fresher interests.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>That's not to say that there aren't any loyal girls who devote themselves to their guys of course.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> The guys would, indeed tighten their act, but with typical guy behavior, suspicion, and insecurity would add to their anxiety, and there are chances that they would actually destroy their own relationship.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> (dunno how it works, but its true....)<br><br>Basically, I understand how it feels, since I had my first relationship cut out from under me by my then best friend.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Bottom line of consequence ? The guy whom you stole the girl from would either :<br>a) Hate you for the rest of his life. (I did that...)<br>b) Hate the girl too. (I did that too...)<br>c) Go all out to make both your lives miserable, since the girl didn't care enough for him (In his opinion of course.), and you're the scum who stole his girl, so you basically deserve to die. (in his mentality.) (Same, did that.)<br>d) Commit suicide. (No Guts.)<br>e) Kill the girl, then himself. (Didn't have the guts to pull it off either.)<br>f) Turn to unsavory vices. (Drugs, Stealing, etc etc.) (Erm... some, but not these. Mostly, drowned myself in games, computer games, good stuff.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br><br>Sounds pretty immature, but hey, people are still like that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Of course, there <strong>ARE</strong> those who would just nod, go thru a coupla weeks of pain, tears, and what not, and go thru life as it was, but not many people are like that. Most would have poured so much into the relationship, that such a thing is almost unthinkable. Some just snap!, and that's it.<br><br>But then again, I'm the pessimistic sort....   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>But of course, if I'm <strong>THAT</strong> crazy about the girl, even after a year of trying to <strong>NOT</strong> think about her in a "more than friends" situation......<br><br>Heck, I'd go after her anyway, just to give myself a chance, and gamble on that big <strong>MAYBE</strong>, but I'd probably be insecure for the rest of my relationship, since if I could do it, someone else could definitely do it, unless I'm really that great a guy that no sane girl would dump. (Highly improbable......   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">)<br><br>I wonder if I make any sense...... *ponders*<br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rulakir (edited 18 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haiz..reading this thread..sure did evoke memories...<br>if U pple dun mind..me like to tell a story...<br><br>About a couple of mths ago...(ard last oct), a girl came to know a guy from the chatrm. Both of them turned up to a gathering...(let us call her W, the leading guy be X)<br><br>W out of fun suggested the gathering the nite b/f..and turned up late...she went w/o expecting anything other than to have fun..<br>Lest than W expected..that her fun turned out to be so fun that W and X..became friends very fast. W enjoyed chatting with X..and same for X..who enjoyed W's company.<br><br>However, things are not meant to be..when W need to go overseas...X finally told her abt his dilenma..he knew a gal b/f he knew W..he is confused cuz..he like W..although X knew her for a two wks..whereas..he knew the other gal for yrs.<br><br>W was shocked and wanted to "disappear" from his life..cuz she dun wanna come between them..X..couldn't let W go at that pt of time..yet he couldn't come to a decision..<br><br>W left ...for overseas..and during the trip..X told her that things is impossible bet. the gal and him..(the gal found out abt W)...W thought things would be fine bet. her and X..W want to take things slow...as she is very confused and unsure..<br><br>The blow came..when X emailed her..confessing that he is confused and felt guilty ..towards the other gall(though they were not steads..)<br><br>W was very upset..(devasted)..<br>but as time passes..wounds heal..<br><br>they are still friends..and w still has her fingers crossed hoping..things will turn out differently...<br><br>Okie..I know my story-tellign sucks..and I tried to keep it short..<br>actually the whole chunks of the story would be inner struggles with feelings, morals, desires, emotions, .....<br><br>so...the moral behind the story is..love hits U when U least expect it..and sometimes one can't help it and can't control their feelings..but sad to say..there is always pressure to conform to social expextations, morals, .....opportunities sometimes..only knock once..once U lose it..U migth lose it forever...<br></div>
