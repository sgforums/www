            <div class='col-md body'>After some thinking, I came up with more variations to the same views.<br><br>I will have to  agree that you should go ahead to go for something you really want. In this case a girl. Things might not turn out the way you want it, which I perfectly acknowledge.<br><br>The thing is, there is much more to the situation than the question of "what if she was meant for you and you didn't make a move and you will never know?"<br><br>Speaking from personal experience, in retrospect, there are some things which I would have liked to remain ignorant of. But this is life, and that is not an option, because you can't reverse your decisions or knowledge. Basically, sometimes never knowing is good.<br><br>There is also the question of whether you can accept the rejection when it happens. Speaking for myself, I will have problems getting over it, although I do do so eventually. What I'm not sure about is whether people know they will be able to handle it. I suspect they don't, I suspect they refuse to think about it. Its like acting on impulse to a certain degree.<br><br>I think what I'm talking about goes back to the same reasoning, that you have to think for yourself, not just what you might be losing out on, but what you might be encountering after that hard fight.<br><br>For me, I see myself having problems in certain stages. But since I'm abnormal, the problems will not be the same for someone else.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 18 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hihi<br><br>I jus posted a similar topic too.<br>I guess from the reaction most pple are against watever I did lor.<br><br>Anyway to make the story short, I got to know am attached ger and we became very good frenz and along the way I told her how I felt and she broke off wif her BF later. I admit I do feel guilty abt what I did( coz I used 2 adhere by the "unwritten rule"). I mus say I really tried hard not to come into their relationship (which in the 1st place was already rocky) But she was so special dat i jus couldn't.<br><br>I wonder if u guyz/gers out there had experienced similar situation *sighz*<br><br>LOVE is such a mysterious FORCE<br><br>to WB: I feel dat if ur heart tells u dat she is the one, den dun gif up.<br><br>Hope u all dun flame mi, I'm not those bastard who like to play wif ger's feeling</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmmmmmmm......<br><br>After much thot abt this thread...I have finally decided to reply...<br><br>There is no right or wrong when it comes to feelings...It can be rt for you, but wrong for others, or the other way arnd...and it does takes two to clap, so even if the guy wants the girl, the girl herself must be willing to do so too.<br><br>I can't tell you that going after someone you like is wrong because she already has a bf, but this is your happiness involved..your life...and you make your own life...I don't want to say something here that can mislead or cause any trouble at all...<br><br>I just want to share with you guys how I, myself see this situation.<br><br>I believe it is right to go after for your own happiness, but to me, as long as my happiness doesn't involve other's pain and suffering.<br><br>If I was you, WB.  I will take firewire's advice and be her friend, not to push things.  If it was meant to be then someday it will.  Think abt it...If you tell  her how you feel now and she doesn't feel the same way then how?!  Things will become very awkward for you guys.  OKie, what if she does feel the same?  Do you think she will break-up with her bf to be w/  you?!  And if she does...will you be happy? What goes arnd comes arnd my dear...Can you put yourself to think that you have hurted someone else because you wanted this girl?!<br><br>On the safe side, if you come her dear friend, you won't be taking so much risk.  She will also be there for you, and she will also know that you will be there for her.  If in any case that the girl and her bf does break up then tell her how you feel, then she might feel that you are very sincere abt the relationship and the way she feels.  Like I have said before, if it was meant to be then someday it will be, but if not then there is really no point in forcing things rt?!  Sometimes when someone gets push too hard then they will just rebel.<br><br>I am just merely stating what i feel towards this situation, has no hard feelings toward anyone or anything...<br><br>I feel like such a hypocrite...<br><br>*walks away slowly....*<br><br>[This message has been edited by NaiveGirl (edited 18 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, seems that the answers here are broken down into two categories:<br><br>1. People who agree(but dun want to admit)that it is ok to come between another relationship.<br><br>2. People who believe in morale and principles beyond emotions.<br><br>I might have missed out on one or two graoups but it's basically down to this two..<br><br>You see...In this life, we will have strong urges and strong emotions...What make su s mature is that we don't follw these urges and emotions every time they strike our fancy.  There has to be some sort of self control involved...and I think that this is what the principles and morales provide in situations like this: a form of self assessment before any action is taken...allowingthe person to think first about what he/she is doing, who is involved, how it willl affect everyone involved and why it is important or not important to do or nto do what he is considering....<br><br>An immature person would just go right ahead and do it without thought or consideration. You can alwasy call it passion, but we all know that it isn't.  Passion has some form of control i belief...some form of personal "editing" and follows a principle of some sort....lots mroe but dun think will write about passion here..yet.<br><br>Being impulsive and just doing without thinking basically just means that that person already isn't really even ready for that relationship he i strying to get in the frist palce.  How can he/she hope to handle a relationship if he/she can't even control, even in a little bit, their own impulses?...and what next....next time someone else comes into the picture then the chances are quite high then that they can be taken away....<br><br>How fragile is that relationship...I know that it's been said millions of times befor euntil we almost disregard it ...but if someone leaves another relationship for you cna you really be sure they won't leave you also....<br><br>On the other end is the person who is considering leaving or staying...They also need to have some form of maturity in their thinking to be able to know if they need to go or if they need to stay.  their's is actually the most important factor in this whole matter.  Their decision, no matter which one, will hurt someone...It's unavoidable.  So it does take a man or a woman of some developed level of maturityt o know how best to handle it.  Although we would like to say that we should follow our hearts...in real life, it's your head you should be follwing...when you r feeligns are too much involved, then it becomes uselss as a guiding light.<br><br>What the person needs to do is to know who is involved here and not only that...he must understand that these people are involved.  There must be some kind of recognition that his isn't the only voice or the onli feeling involved...to make a decision based on his own feelings is very greedy and very selfish.  Would i trust someone like that?...definitely not!....<br><br>The mark of your character is most important for this crucial person in the trio....The character must be of sufficient strength to be able to make the correct decision....corrrect being relative here because it can be correct either way....I have to rethink about this character bit and get back to writing about it later....<br><br>Let's face it people...most of the replies here are from 20+ age group I think...and we are definitely not children or teenagers anymore.  We have to take responsibilty for our actions.  The easiest thing to do is to shirk this responsibilty and chalk it up to "following your inner emotions because it's correct".<br><br>at this age, we should already have developed a high sense of what is right and what is wrong...what should be and what shouldn't be done...while, of course, maintain ing some manner of flexibilty so that one doesn't get trapped into thinking from a box.<br><br>The key word here is responsibility...YOU have to be resonsible for whatever happens!...then you must take the consequences and deal with them.  Nothing more immature and wasteful than to just ignore other peoples feelings and teh after effects of what you have done.<br><br>Time to start thinking with our heads...our teenage years of unaccoutnability are over...It's time to ask yourself tehse important questions.....<br><br>This especially applioes to people who have been untruthful or deceptive about themselves to gain someone else trust and eventually their heart....I hold the "victim" not responsible by the fact that they ahd no idea of what was going on....Would they have fallen for a person had they known about another party?...If yes then both party are responsible, but if one party was deceptive about themselves then the victim isn't in the worng because they were pretty much duped into feleing the way they do without knwoing what lay in store for them.<br><br>again, the criotical thing here is that the person responsible take charge of his own actions...be a man(or a woman) with some sense and sensibility...with some heart and ultimately a person with enuff maturity to know what he is doing....If he/she is doing it for personal gain in pursuit of their own happiness regardless of whoo else is hurt....we all deem them selfish immature little teenagers.<br><br>hmmm...noone will hold us accountable...so we must do that ourselves....I thought we were at an age where we should already know to do this...regardless of whether our emotions are involved or not....<br><br>if something happend because of natural friendship then it's fine..i dun disagree at all, but through deception or unwillingness to reveal important and relevent information, i think that it is the wrong method already...one without thought for anbody but themselves...the kind i wrote about in the earlier posting...and now this one....<br><br>This is what i am preaching that a person shouldn't do...everything about principles becomes important here.....<br><br>You can win someones heart in two ways:<br><br>1. through natural means...grew from friendship and personal understanding which developes into tsoemthing more...<br><br>2. throught deception and withholding of information for the other person involved...Teh sneaky way to someones heart...the wrong way...you may get htem, but do you really deserve it int he first place?..do you even understand what is happening?...i wonder...<br><br>so the ends do not justify the means....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Naivegirl...From what i gather of your post, it seemds that you are a very sensible person...and at the same time reveal that you mihgt also be involved witht his type of situation by context of the the last few words "feel like such a hypocrite"...<br><br>Anyway i wouldn't really know about what is happening for you, but the fact that you hold yourslef accountable and admitting to yourself that something is wrong already tells us that you are matured in thinking.<br><br>You sound trapped. (chalk all this analysation to my great analytical skills...i told you i can tell things by what people write..even if onli a few sentences...and people dun beleive me...hmpf).<br><br>AS i was saying to another perosn quite recently, whatever situation you are in, it is important to understand what is happening and then to acknowledge it in some form...not to just pretend that it doesn't exist.  Your acknowledgement tells us somethign already.<br><br>you sound trapped.<br>your principles and belief are being tested.<br>you are failing the test.<br>you post here in an attempt to help someone else from failing that same test.<br>you have a conscience.<br>you understand what is happening.<br><br>I won't pretend to know what you ar egoing through, even though I have had my very MANY shares of being in a triangle....<br><br>i can give you this advice though, useless as it may be:<br><br>whatever problems you encounter, if you are sincere enuff and your heart is finally strong enuff to accept something, then tehre is always a window open through which you can escape.  But most times it is clouded by your emotions and that makes it difficult to tell where you should go because you only have your emotion as a guide.  When you finally do see the window, I hope that you can finally go through it.  I have this need to beleiev that people want to do the right thing, but it's just that many cannot see alternatives or break away from their own intentions or emotions...good or bad...<br><br>WB-hope that you have a clearer idea of what is going on now..not that you didn't in the first place...but i hope that we opened your eyes a bit more.<br><br>dumdumone: I think that you are an honorable guy. it was her decision and not your prodding that was the critical factor in her relationship ending.  Her heart is with you because she loves you enuff to be with you and now you know this through and through becuase you didn't have to force it...Any other way and there would be a shadow of a doubt of her feeling stowards you now and int he future.  Correct?<br><br>you won fair and square is the best way to say it.  this is what chasing your happiness is.  Beleieving that it can happen and making it happen through the principle of non-intereference(or not chasing her)....although your friendship with her was already a bit tainted in that you liked her so it is suspect..kekekk....<br><br>But the gist of it is there.  You respected people enuff to not force it or go about it the decietful way.<br><br>I applaud u....mainly becuase many people would have done otherwise.<br><br>i'm sur epoeple will diagre woth me on this...hehehe...scared tet come break my arms...<br><br>Tet: i told u I'm an old man already...:-)  where got i still think so young anymore???..heheheheh</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to Firewire:<br><br>Thanx for wat u said anyway.<br><br>No doubt dat I din use any deceit but somehow deep in my heart, I still feel guilty. I jus can't seem 2 tell myself dat wat I did was 100% right. But wat I do know wat I did was wat I truly believed in, not something dat is of a spur of the moment. Sometime when I am chatting wif my gf now, we would both touch upon this again and we would both be quiet. It hurts both of us (the guilt dat is) and I guess its something I will have to learn 2 accept and deal wif.<br><br>WB : Think hard and thorough on wat u wan.

            <div class='col-md body'>Really spend a lot of time reading thru most of the replies... gosh... you guys/gals can really write!<br><br>Rulakir: Totally agree with you... thinks WB is writing to someone who reads this forum <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> There aren't a lot of gals who participate actively in this forum, are there?<br><br>WB: I'm really touched by what you wrote.<br><br>Okay, my SOLUTION !!! My suggestion is to read this book by Jeffery Archer "The Prodigal Daughter". The main female character was loved by 2 guys, one her husband, the other her childhood friend. Basically, the childhood friend came first, but the lady was deeply in love with her husband. And the childhood friend loved her for the rest of his life, be her best friend and advisor.<br><br>In short, be her trusted best friend. Dun try to break them up because you won't benefit (well, I dun think you will). Even if you succeed, this won't be a gentlemanly act. BUT, if she does break up with her bf, then go ahead  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Best of luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why is it that only when matters of the heart are concerned, morals does not matter?? what's the justification?<br><br>when u first realise that u have fallen for the girl rite at the beginning, u should start to restrain yourself from falling for her deeper...by not controlling your feelings (when they are least strong) in the first place, that's where u r wrong. some pple may say "but their relationship is already rocky". I think that this is just an excuse. If things are rocky for them, why not wait till they have settled their problem before entering the picture?? they may be able to solve the problem and be more loving than ever, if not for the appearance of a third party.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sparkle: Things are easier said than done. Especially for this kind of things. When you try harder to refrain from falling further in love with that someone, you will find yourself falling deeper. You will find this true when you experience it.<br><br>For matter pertaining to love and relationships, you can only follow your heart and take the risk. I'm not trying to say that you shouldn't think before you act. It's just that your heart will usually give you the best answer.<br>Basically, that's what I do when I encounter this kind of things.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sparkle:<br><br>Why restrain/surpress love, when it is supposed to be free. I choose to love, and by loving, I know that love is not bound to return. When you give love, give generously, when you recieve love, be appreciative. That has been my philosophy. Appreciating one's love, does not meant aceepting it, it just simply means acknowledging it. I have written in one of my poems before, the following:<br><blockquote><br>For love is not to order,<br>For love is not to fate,<br>I walk with you by honour,<br>for love is ours to create.<br></blockquote>With the above, I express my thoughta that, love is a choice, you decide whether to love another, or to stay with your present. It might seem selfish, but where mine happiness is concern, I think I'll choose logic over emotions. But of course, honour still play a big part in my life, I would not go to extreme ways to get her, if she is going to find out that I was the hammer that broke them up in the first place, where could I find my place in her again? Like Shervon99 said, I would love to play the part of the best friend or advisor, always loving her in another way, if the best way cannot be done. And that is a great honour itself. Love is created in another form, the form of true friendship. Do you not always say love thy friends?<br><br>Worm:<br>Why not ask yourself this question then? How do you judge worth? Could you not be her final one? And could you confrim your eternal happiness with your present? There are no absolute, yes, she might leave you just like she did him, but that's only to look for the true one for her life. It is not selfish, it is just human nature. To sacrifice your own happiness for your love one, yes, is admirable, but will this sacrifice be ultimate? Maybe, meaning he might be the one you spent the rest of yourlife with, and then again maybe not, another might come along, and all the same you start a new relationship. The only difference is whehter you fear the consequencs and the comments and looks of others. If you can ignore all that, then I call it being true to yourself.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong></div>

I do not know if this helps, but I've been thinking, that what I've been hearing from the victims are sounds of hurt and pain. I dun know, but I dun call myself a victim, though the woman I once love alot is now no longer with me due to a third party. I dun because, I feel that I am also a participant in the relationship, nobody is a victim, we are just a part of a bigger circle in life. From my post you might think that I am the bad guy who goes around stealing other people gf, but the truth is far from that. My experiences taught me a new perspective to view the issue from, maybe it's just me, I can't tell, but the thing I learnt is that ,if she is still with me right now, I will most probably never be able to provide for the happiness she is having right now.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">"From the moment I was born, every step I took was to be with you."</div></blockquote>How do you know that you are the one? How can you tell? In my case, I was not the one, just a passing cloud in her life, and as such, I came to terms that in life there are no absolute, not even when you think it is so, it is forever changing, so if you dun grab the moment it will just pass, and you will not even have the chance as a participant.<br><br>Of course, I felt hurt, I feel anger, I felt betrayed, but those emotions are but again passing clouds, my wounds have healed, maybe a scar or 2 might be left behind, but so what? If we go about life fearing hurt, why do we have to live at all? Since you do not know, then why not find out? Hurt to me will become experiences, they are what made me the person I am, they are after all, part of my life. Now, I am free to find another, in fact after some thoughts, I felt fortunate that it did not drag for too long, the logical me tells me that was the ending for us, and it was meant to end this way.<br><br>I too felt happy, that I have the chance to love her, and love her I am still, but in another way, I could not forget the happy moments her smile, her voice, I think of her once in a while, but just to remind me of the happiness, the hurt and pain, was lost somewhere along the way in my life, it is too much of a baggage to carry it all my life. I have to make space for another. And that will be for the one. We might meet again another day, but I hope that it will be with smiles of friendship.<br><br>You will end up at some destination, but you have yet know the way, nor do you know what is it, but that does not hinders me from giving my best in a relatioship. Life is too short for that, how can another love you, if you do not give enough love? On the contrary, if the love have passed, live on, time does not wait, another will come and you will finally reach your destination.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Callan, you pointed out some good points, but I don't think its fair to say that the people view themselves as victims.<br><br>I read often that some people understand that they have to suffer in order for the people they care for to be happy. I have no idea whether this type of view is valid. All I can say is that I can understand how they feel.<br><br>You are right about not seeing yourself as a victim. I think its important not to forget this part of your life, because after all, the person that you have been with has given you some pretty happy moments. As part of that relationship, you have grown to what you are now, the super buaya that you are (joking.)<br><br>I guess what I'm saying is that from my point of view, accept what has happened as part of your emotional developement. Whether you want to see the experience from an optimistic point of view or not, its up to you. Well, just echoing Callans thoughts.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 21 February 2000).]</div>
