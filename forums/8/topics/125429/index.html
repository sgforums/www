            <div class='col-md body'>For Tea<br><br>Deodorize your feet. Boil three or four Lipton Flo-Thru Tea Bags in one quart of water for ten minutes. Add enough cold water to make a comfortable soak. Soak your feet for twenty to thirty minutes, then dry and apply food powder. Do this twice a day until odor is under control. Then continue twice a week to keep odor under control. Tannin, which can be found in tea, is a drying agent.<br><br>Dye graying white fabrics. If Clorox bleach won't whiten a graying white garment, soak the item in hot, strong brewed Lipton Tea until it is a shade darker than you desire. Then rinse in cold water and let dry.<br><br>Highlight brown hair. Rinse red or brown hair with brewed Lipton Tea for golden highlights.<br><br>Relieve sunburn pain. Pat your sunburn with wet Lipton Flo-Thru Tea Bags.<br><br>Accelerate the germination of grass seeds. Mix two tablespoons of cold, strong brewed Lipton Tea into each pound of seed, cover, and set in the refrigerator for five days. Before sowing, spread the seed to dry for a day or two on newspapers on the garage or basement floor.<br><br>Deodorize stuffy rooms. Mix one quart brewed Lipton Tea and four tablespoons ReaLemon, strain through a Mr. Coffee Filter, and store in empty spray bottles.<br><br>Soothe a sore throat or laryngitis. Drink brewed Lipton Tea with ReaLemon or SueBee Honey.<br><br>Invigorate house plants. Water ferns and other houseplants once a week with a weak, tepid brewed Lipton Tea.<br><br>Polish black lacquer. Wash black lacquer pieces with strong brewed Lipton Tea, then wipe dry with a soft cloth.<br><br>Help relieve diarrhea. Drink plenty of Lipton Tea and eat toast. The tannin in tea is reported to be helpful in cases of diarrhea, while its liquid replaces fluids lost by the body.<br><br>Soothe tired eyes. Place Lipton Flo-Thru Tea Bags soaked in cool water or lukewarm water over your eyes for at least fifteen minutes.<br><br>Soothe a burn. Apply wet Lipton Flo-Thru Tea Bags directly to the burn, or secure in place with gauze.<br><br>Stop gums from bleeding after having a tooth pulled. Press a cool, moist Lipton Flo-Thru Tea Bag against the cavity with your finger.<br><br>Fix a broken fingernail. Cut a piece of gauze paper from a Lipton Flo-Thru Tea Bag to fit the nail, coat with Maybelline Crystal Clear Nail Polish, and press gently against the break. Then cover with colored nail polish.<br><br>Clean varnished woodwork. Cold Lipton Tea is a good cleaning agent for any kind of woodwork.<br><br>Tenderize meat. Add equal parts strong brewed Lipton Tea and double strength beef stock to a tough pot roast or stew. The tannin in tea is a natural meat tenderizer.<br><br>For Coffee<br><br>Dye fabric brown inexpensively. Soak the fabric in a bucket of strong black Maxwell House Coffee. This technique is also a good way to cover up an unremovable coffee stain on a white table cloth.<br><br>Fertilize a garden or houseplants. Work Maxwell House Coffee grounds into the topsoil.<br><br>Repair scratched woodwork. Mix a teaspoon instant Maxwell House Coffee with two teaspoons water. Apply to the scratch with a cotton ball.<br><br>Start a charcoal fire. Remove the top and bottom of an empty Maxwell House Coffee can and punch a few holes in the sides of the can. Stand the can in your barbecue grill, fill it with charcoal briquets, add lighter fluid, and light. When the coals glow, remove the hot can with tongs and set in a safe place.<br><br>Prevent dampness in closets. Fill an empty Maxwell House Coffee can with Kingsford Charcoal Briquets, punch holes in the plastic cover, and set on the floor in the back of the closet.<br><br>Repel ants. Sprinkle dried Maxwell House Coffee grounds outside doors and cracks. Coffee deters ants.<br><br>Relieve a hangover. Drink a couple of cups of Maxwell House Coffee. Coffee acts as a vasoconstrictor, reducing the swelling of blood vessels that causes headache.<br><br>Spread grass seed or fertilizer. Punch holes in the bottom of an empty can of Maxwell House Coffee, fill with grass seed or fertilizer, cover with the plastic lid, and shake the can as you walk through your garden.<br><br>Transport live fishing bait. Keep worms in a Maxwell House Coffee can filled with moist coffee grounds.<br><br>Keep toilet paper waterproof while camping. Carry a roll of toilet paper inside an empty Maxwell House Coffee can.<br><br>Protect baby tomato plants. Remove the top and bottom from Maxwell House Coffee cans, place a can over each plant, and step on the can toset firmly in the soil. Remove cans when plants are a few weeks old.<br><br>Grow better melons. Raise melons off the ground by resting them on top of upside-down empty Maxwell House Coffee cans pushed into the soil. The metal cans accumulate heat, making the fruit ripen earlier and repelling insects.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
