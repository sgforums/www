            <div class='col-md body'>2 months no wonder.<br>the early part of any relationship is call the honeymoon phase.<br>This is the sweetest part of any relationship and you will enjoy the best time with him but there is a catch in this phase any bad points about each other is erased and you will try to cover it up even it appeears.<br><br>No one really can gauge how long is the honeymoon phase can last but it will end when you 2 finally realise that there is some bad points in each other. Like snoring, smoking, gambling and many more. If you wish to go further you must accept each other faults.<br><br>For your case I believe the honeymoon phase for you 2 is over and he is thinking whether is good to continue on.<br><br>My suggestion is for a one week break. To let both side think it over. I understand is hard for you but is no point in holding on to a guy who no longer loves you. He may just be waiting for a new girl to come along and using you for a standby.</div>
