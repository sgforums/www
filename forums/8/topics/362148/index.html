              <p>I suppose Singlish is a form of colloquialism. It creates a friendly atmosphere. However, speaking in Singlish has got its disadvantages. For example, when forced to speak in formal English (job interviews), stuttering and stammering will increase. If it goes beyond the interviewer's acceptable standard of non-fluency, then there is a chance you're out.</p>
              <p>Futhermore, Singlish is only understood by people in Singapore. It has got zero value out of Singapore.</p>
              <p>After seeing my side of the arguement, are you convinced to speak in proper English? If you feel that it sounds peculiar to speak proper English in the Singaporean slang/accent, speak like the natives!</p>
              <p>If you have got a pro Singlish point of view, you are welcome to join in the debate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have heard people saying it gives a sense of national identity. However, to make Singlish a form of national identity is almost the same as making littering a form of national identity. Speaking Singlish reflects badly about the education you have received and should you make that a form of national identity? Bad education? Instead we should use good things to give us a sense of national identity. For example by being kind.</p>

              <p>By speaking Singlish you are limiting how high your standard of English can go. I suppose at times when you think you are speaking English you are not actually speaking proper English. Perhaps your audience did not know also so they did not correct you.</p>
              <p>For example, the overly used "with regards to" is wrong. The correct way is "with regard to".</p>
              <p>This is the problem with media. They repeat the wrong things so many times that after some time, nobody bothers to think otherwise. Repetition. That is what the media uses. If you use the power of repetition in your studies then it would help you a lot after knowing how powerful it is.</p>
              <p>Another example: "Irregardless" does not exist in proper English. It should be "Regardless".</p>

              <p>How you connect Singlish with littering?</p>
              <p>Singlish = bad education. What speaking you? Education is very wide ok, includes science,  mathematics, history, and social sciences and what not. Singlish or any other speak you develop your own.</p>
              <p>You want to speak like Queen of England and call yourself a Singaporean?</p>
              <p>You know what is national identity or not. When Singaporean talk and ABC talk and you cannot tell the difference, you will be proud izzit?</p>
              <p>Look kiddo, if you cannot Singlish, go do Afro-American rap, or the Texas drawl, or the Ozzie lingo or what ever that would swell your noggins.</p>

              <p>Because of the educational system and the english media, and government usage, most people will get their language mixed up and bastardised into singlish, unless they put in extra effort.</p>

              <p>I suppose Singlish is a form of colloquialism. It creates a

              (job interviews), stuttering and stammering will increase. If it
              goes beyond the interviewer's acceptable standard of non-fluency,

              <p>Futhermore, Singlish is only understood by people in Singapore.

              <p>After seeing my side of the arguement, are you convinced to
              speak in proper English? If you feel that it sounds peculiar to

              the natives!</p>

              <p>I have heard people saying it gives a sense of national

              almost the same as making littering a form of national identity.
              Speaking Singlish reflects badly about the education you have
              received and should you make that a form of national identity? Bad
              education? Instead we should use good things to give us a sense of
              national identity. For example by being kind.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">&gt;&gt; Singlish can be defined as a variety of English with a standard set of grammatical rules and specialized set of vocabulary. Singlish is maintained at this equilibrium, without the risk of it turning into a creole in the near future due to the enforcement of teaching Standard English in our education system. I too agree that being too used to speaking Singlish can cause us to stutter and stammer. This is where we can do our part: If you would like Singlish to be accepted by our society, let all of us have a positive view on Singlish and speak more of it and once it is codified in the future, Singlish will become the standard language.</p>

You also have many other things to compare with instead of "littering" which our society now has a negative connotation. In the scientifically linguistic point of view, strictly there is no such thing as "good" and "bad" language, as all connotations are man-made, thus it is on the socio-linguistic level that people's acceptance to language is measured. So well, time will tell.  :-)</p>
