            <div class='col-md body'>I think alot of guys might have encounter such an incident whereby he tell the girl he is interested in her after knowing her for sometime, only to be told she only treat him as a goodfriend or brother.<br><br>How do gals classify guys into such categories? Why is that they can tell the guy they find him nice, but just can't think of him as a boyfriend, what's the difference? Does that mean that if he is a goodfriend now, he will not be able to be her boyfriend?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well,,i talked abt this in one of the topic b4....Well, if u wanna go after teh gal..u must let them knoe "in advance" ..else when times goes by...it will only be friendship...unless the gal is already attracted to u in the first place...else u wait long long also only friend friend....<br><br>Well, It rather hard for a gal to accept a guy after knowing for sometime as their status is only friend or good friend...U got to apply wht i hve mentioned above to let them knoe first and start monitoring u... But if the gal is treating u as good friend to such an extend tht they are willing to shar eiwth u things they don't share with other pples...The chnace of going after them is still pretty high....Firstly they have a good impression of u and a good feeling of u...It's depend on how u go after them...<br><br>Even if they said they treat u as good friend...u still can go after them until they give up and accept u... I don't really think tht these things are fix once someone treat u as friend..i has to depend on how u r gonig to go after the gal...and wht thing u got to " offer" her to make her change her mind abt u...Anyway, good luck to those having such prob. HOpe all of u success in chasing after the person u like.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello...this topic is basically very very simple...cos one girl had explained the whole thing to me before...so I will attempt to do it now !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I will first define the terms. Good friend means she can tell you lots of stuff about her EVERYDAY life...but prob not her personal life. Brother means she can relate to you all her PERSONAL problems plus talk to you on an equal level. Boyfriend is rather self-explanatory...she likes you !! ok..here goes..<br><br>I found out that the best time to chase a girl IF YOU FIND OUT YOU BOTH CAN CLICK is in the window period of 1 to 3 months. After this period and you do not show romantic inklings, she will tend to take you as a brother or a good friend.<br><br>A girl told me that if a guy confides to a girl too much and she also confides in him too much, then she would tend to treat him as a brother rather than a boyfriend. SOmehow the mystery of not knowing someone THAT well would keep a girl interested in a guy romantically. This has happened to me before and I have ended up with a lot of girls who treat me like their brother or "Uncle Agony" so to speak !<br><br>Thus, it is better to express your feelings for her when you get to know her about 2 to 4 weeks and you think you are interested. Otherwise, she might get snatched (gosh !) or else she might start to lose interest.<br><br>Good luck people !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
