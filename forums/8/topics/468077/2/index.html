              The death of Margaret Thatcher has made an unlikely top 10 hit out of Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead, 74 years after it first appeared in the soundtrack to The Wizard of Oz.</li>
              <li class="byline" style="border-collapse: collapse; overflow: visible; display: block; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;"><br></li>
              <li class="byline" style="border-collapse: collapse; overflow: visible; display: block; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">Propelled by a campaign on Facebook, the song is number 10 in the midweek charts, published on Wednesday, and is on course to be one of the top three sellers by the end of the week. </li>
              <li class="byline" style="border-collapse: collapse; overflow: visible; display: block; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;"><br></li>
              <li class="byline" style="border-collapse: collapse; overflow: visible; display: block; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">There has been a surge in downloads of the song, which has been appropriated by the former prime minister's critics since her death on Monday, aged 87.
                       
                      While many people were mourning her loss, others were quick to celebrate.</li>

              <li class="byline" style="border-collapse: collapse; overflow: visible; display: block; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;"><br></li>
              <li class="byline" style="border-collapse: collapse; overflow: visible; display: block; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">There was also a small increase in sales for a 1961 cover version of the song, sung by Ella Fitzgerald, which just nudged into the top 150. </li>
              <li class="byline" style="border-collapse: collapse; overflow: visible; display: block; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;"><br></li>
              <li class="byline" style="border-collapse: collapse; overflow: visible; display: block; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">The Official Charts Company said the Garland version of the song was around 5,000 sales away from a place in the top three selling singles of the week.

              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">Her ideology that everyone can have it all affected poor families and single parents. My parents split in the late 80s due to financial pressures. We're from south Wales. It was hard. No money, no jobs. My mum, as a single parent of 3 under 10, relied on DSS payments. Once everything was paid she was left with £6 a week to feed and clothe us all on. We had to walk a mile and a half round trip to pick up a government issue food parcel which we would have to walk home though the estate in a buggy. Mum started work when I was 11. I did chores, got my sisters up for school, babysat, and didn't lead the life of a kid. Mum had three jobs and still we struggled. At 12 I started going out to work to help support myself. I worked 20 hours every weekend for 50p an hour. By the time I was 14 I was skipping a day at school each week, earning £30 a week for 35 hours while also still being the second parent. Thatcher stole my childhood and my future. I never realised my full potential, just scraping GCSEs and a lame uni degree. At 12 I vowed that my kids would never go through this and that I would do what I could for others. I'm now a ward councillor in the area that I was brought up in and am doing just that.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">My parents bought their council house, a solid cared for building. This gave my parents new wealth they never had due to ill health, in spite of working hard. My mother longed to live in a private house – she felt stigmatised in council. She was motivated by Thatcher because of the female lead. My father voted labour and was a union rep. He lost his job at BAC (Concorde) and used the redundancy money to pay off the mortgage. His next job was as a law court receptionist, poorly paid at less than my mother (a nurse) earned. I am openly gay and I heard tales of police entrapment and Section 28. Thatcher divided the family. Fortunately Section 28 was repealed but a decade was lost to me and to younger others growing up at that time.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">If I were to sum up one memory of Thatcher, it's that she took away our milk. Our free milk at school that we so desperately needed. As impoverished kids coming from a very working class background (so working class that nobody actually had a job) our milk each day was essential for nutrition. For many, it really was the only meal of the day. The closure of the local mine in a small Scottish town was hell for the community. Not just the loss of jobs, but the loss of aspiration and I remember the poverty of hope. The shackling of the human spirit. I remember blaming it all on Thatcher. Looking in retrospect as an adult, perhaps people ought to have borne some individual responsibility and found a way out of the poverty. But I never saw this happen. I associated Thatcher's policies as a child as being the best that the UK govt would ever give Scotland. I became a Scottish nationalist. I still loathe the Tories - probably because of Thatcher and what she did to our local town.</p>
              <h2 style="padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 1em; line-height: 17px; border-color: #999999; border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: dotted; clear: left; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dotted; background-position: 0% 100%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">Sarah Cadge, 34, North East</h2>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">I was two months old in May 1979. I grew up in the mining communities of the North East and witnessed first hand the devastation that her dogmatic and aggressive approach to politics and policy wreaked on the traditional industries and the people who supported and relied on them. I had extended family who were directly involved in the miners strike but what will never leave me is seeing fellow classmates at age five and six who lived without lifes basics and essentials including food and shoes because that hideous women picked a fight to get her own back for the strikes of the 1970's under Heath. There may have been ideology around her general approach, but the treatment of the mining communities in Britiain was a personal vendetta that is truly unforgiveable. Her politicisation of the police in that period led directly to the disgraceful attitudes and actions in the police and politics that we have finally seen laid bare in the Hillsbrough Independent Panel Report. The women was a disgrace. I always ensure I vote, but I will never ever vote Tory. Where necessary will always vote tactically to avoid a Tory win.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">I grew up in Haringey and her policies had a massive impact at the time. Most people hated her. All the kids I grew up with in Wood Green were political, because of the way in which she governed. Financially my family probably were better off, but the community in which my dad's family grew up in north London has disappeared. The main thing I want to say is that Thatcher defined me as a person. I hated her, even though I was so young. But that taught me to fight and shout and be heard. I'm not going to let someone get away with it if they are that obsessed with private profit over public good. Also, the urban environmental movement developed during her period and it is this cause that I work in today. It may not have happened without the hatred of her.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">I lived on a terrible council estate in northern England. Thatchers policies in finance deregulation, windfalls from banks/building societies, share ownership in utilities/BT and so forth were unheard of opportunities… all opportunities my single mum took. We had little money but we participated and it was enough. She got a mortgage due to this money and deregulation policies (she had been refused as a single woman two years before!), we moved to a better area. We moved out of poverty into middle class life. I went from nearly getting expelled from primary school with poor grades/behaviour through to a top five university and a profitable professional life. Thatcher's legacy is most keenly felt in attitude, one I carry to this day. I am one of Thatchers children, an unlikely one from a Northern council estate… but I made good on her ideology of entrepreneurship, free market, choice for the individual pushing for themselves... I saw the winter of discontent, the unelected undemocratic union leaders that switched the power off at 7pm on a week night! Equally I saw Thatcher fight that ransoming, become globally important… the lesson being that the progress my family made was through Thatcherism not socialism. It was amazing.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">In the early part of Thatcher's reign I worked in the engineering industry on Merseyside, the jobs disappeared, I left engineering but was a fish out of water for 20 years. One evening in Liverpool I witnessed a sight that will be with me to my dying day. Miners came knocking on the doors of the people of Huyton, a place in the outskirts of the City of Liverpool. Proud working men, gaunt with hunger and with their families and communities being starved out in Thatcher's "Great Britain" were forced to knock on the doors of strangers for food. At that moment I knew I'd never even consider voting for a party that inflicted such misery on human beings and almost 30 years later their faces remain indelibly etched on the minds of those that helped. Thatcher left the North of England and Scotland to managed decline, her policies were divisive and she created conflict at home and in Ireland with bombing after bombing. Her own kind couldn't wait to get rid of her yet they now fall over themselves in fake admiration; we all know what she was.</p>
              <h2 style="padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 1em; line-height: 17px; border-color: #999999; border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: dotted; clear: left; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dotted; background-position: 0% 100%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">Anonymous, 41</h2>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">My parents were teachers during Thatcher's reign. They were dedicated, passionate, hard-working and talented. They did not deserve what happened to them. Our family gradually saw our standard of living decline because their salary was so low. They went out on strike because they saw it as the last resort. Thatcher refused to negotiate with them. Their profession was demonised and abused by the Thatcher government and the likes of the Daily Mail. As a kid I saw the personal effect it had on my parents. They are the least militant people I know, but just got tired of being kicked around. I was and remain proud of them, for the way they strove to make a difference in children's lives, while receiving very little reward. I hated all that Thatcher stood for. Her government demoralised teachers and I can never forgive her for what she did to my parents.</p>
              <h2 style="padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 1em; line-height: 17px; border-color: #999999; border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: dotted; clear: left; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dotted; background-position: 0% 100%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">Anonymous, 55</h2>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">I was a single parent-to-be when I got the opportunity to buy a council house. That got me on the ladder and I never looked back. Years later I started my own business, though I almost went under when interest rates reached 18%. I didn't vote Tory as I felt they trampled on the weak. She may not have been a feminist but having a woman leader who was a strong role model was positive for women in business. For me Margaret Thatcher was a contradiction in terms but I am extremely financially secure because she believed in people bettering themselves and afforded ordinary people the chance to do so.</p>
              <h2 style="padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 1em; line-height: 17px; border-color: #999999; border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: dotted; clear: left; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dotted; background-position: 0% 100%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">Wendy, 65, Scotland</h2>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;">I lived near Edinburgh during the Thatcher period and witnessed first hand the plight of mining communities around the city. The piketing outside Bilston Glen remains impacted. Driving past the mine there were a few men standing outside the gates, warming their hands over a fire. No police, no violence just the same scene that you could have witnessed for days. Approximately 20 minutes later I drove back again and this time the area was mobbed by police attacking protesting miners. A line of police next to the road to allow what little traffic there was to pass, and those police behind the protestors. The police at the front wore shoes, those at the back wore boots, and no insignia. Do you remember the discussions as to whether the army were being used as there were insufficient police to man the picket lines and control or instigate the violence?</p>

              <p>You say you read much on U.S.</p>
              <p>Anyone who knows even the slightest bit of history of U.S. and China knows that U.S. is the no.1 aggressor and killer.</p>
              <p>You are white washing the warcrimes of the U.S. and biased against China.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">In 1958 I wrote the following:</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">'There are no hard distinctions between what is real and what is unreal, nor between what is true and what is false. A thing is not necessarily either true or false; it can be both true and false.'</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I believe that these assertions still make sense and do still apply to the exploration of reality through art. So as a writer I stand by them but as a citizen I cannot. As a citizen I must ask: What is true? What is false?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Truth in drama is forever elusive. You never quite find it but the search for it is compulsive. The search is clearly what drives the endeavour. The search is your task. More often than not you stumble upon the truth in the dark, colliding with it or just glimpsing an image or a shape which seems to correspond to the truth, often without realising that you have done so. But the real truth is that there never is any such thing as one truth to be found in dramatic art. There are many. These truths challenge each other, recoil from each other, reflect each other, ignore each other, tease each other, are blind to each other. Sometimes you feel you have the truth of a moment in your hand, then it slips through your fingers and is lost.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I have often been asked how my plays come about. I cannot say. Nor can I ever sum up my plays, except to say that this is what happened. That is what they said. That is what they did.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Most of the plays are engendered by a line, a word or an image. The given word is often shortly followed by the image. I shall give two examples of two lines which came right out of the blue into my head, followed by an image, followed by me.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The plays are <em>The Homecoming</em> and <em>Old Times</em>. The first line of <em>The Homecoming</em> is 'What have you done with the scissors?' The first line of <em>Old Times</em> is 'Dark.'</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">In each case I had no further information.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">In the first case someone was obviously looking for a pair of scissors and was demanding their whereabouts of someone else he suspected had probably stolen them. But I somehow knew that the person addressed didn't give a damn about the scissors or about the questioner either, for that matter.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">'Dark' I took to be a description of someone's hair, the hair of a woman, and was the answer to a question. In each case I found myself compelled to pursue the matter. This happened visually, a very slow fade, through shadow into light.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I always start a play by calling the characters A, B and C.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">In the play that became <em>The Homecoming</em> I saw a man enter a stark room and ask his question of a younger man sitting on an ugly sofa reading a racing paper. I somehow suspected that A was a father and that B was his son, but I had no proof. This was however confirmed a short time later when B (later to become Lenny) says to A (later to become Max), 'Dad, do you mind if I change the subject? I want to ask you something. The dinner we had before, what was the name of it? What do you call it? Why don't you buy a dog? You're a dog cook. Honest. You think you're cooking for a lot of dogs.' So since B calls A 'Dad' it seemed to me reasonable to assume that they were father and son. A was also clearly the cook and his cooking did not seem to be held in high regard. Did this mean that there was no mother? I didn't know. But, as I told myself at the time, our beginnings never know our ends.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">'Dark.' A large window. Evening sky. A man, A (later to become Deeley), and a woman, B (later to become Kate), sitting with drinks. 'Fat or thin?' the man asks. Who are they talking about? But I then see, standing at the window, a woman, C (later to become Anna), in another condition of light, her back to them, her hair dark.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">It's a strange moment, the moment of creating characters who up to that moment have had no existence. What follows is fitful, uncertain, even hallucinatory, although sometimes it can be an unstoppable avalanche. The author's position is an odd one. In a sense he is not welcomed by the characters. The characters resist him, they are not easy to live with, they are impossible to define. You certainly can't dictate to them. To a certain extent you play a never-ending game with them, cat and mouse, blind man's buff, hide and seek. But finally you find that you have people of flesh and blood on your hands, people with will and an individual sensibility of their own, made out of component parts you are unable to change, manipulate or distort.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">So language in art remains a highly ambiguous transaction, a quicksand, a trampoline, a frozen pool which might give way under you, the author, at any time.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">But as I have said, the search for the truth can never stop. It cannot be adjourned, it cannot be postponed. It has to be faced, right there, on the spot.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Political theatre presents an entirely different set of problems. Sermonising has to be avoided at all cost. Objectivity is essential. The characters must be allowed to breathe their own air. The author cannot confine and constrict them to satisfy his own taste or disposition or prejudice. He must be prepared to approach them from a variety of angles, from a full and uninhibited range of perspectives, take them by surprise, perhaps, occasionally, but nevertheless give them the freedom to go which way they will. This does not always work. And political satire, of course, adheres to none of these precepts, in fact does precisely the opposite, which is its proper function.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">In my play <em>The Birthday Party</em> I think I allow a whole range of options to operate in a dense forest of possibility before finally focussing on an act of subjugation.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>Mountain Language</em> pretends to no such range of operation. It remains brutal, short and ugly. But the soldiers in the play do get some fun out of it. One sometimes forgets that torturers become easily bored. They need a bit of a laugh to keep their spirits up. This has been confirmed of course by the events at Abu Ghraib in Baghdad. <em>Mountain Language</em> lasts only 20 minutes, but it could go on for hour after hour, on and on and on, the same pattern repeated over and over again, on and on, hour after hour.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>Ashes to Ashes</em>, on the other hand, seems to me to be taking place under water. A drowning woman, her hand reaching up through the waves, dropping down out of sight, reaching for others, but finding nobody there, either above or under the water, finding only shadows, reflections, floating; the woman a lost figure in a drowning landscape, a woman unable to escape the doom that seemed to belong only to others.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">But as they died, she must die too.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Political language, as used by politicians, does not venture into any of this territory since the majority of politicians, on the evidence available to us, are interested not in truth but in power and in the maintenance of that power. To maintain that power it is essential that people remain in ignorance, that they live in ignorance of the truth, even the truth of their own lives. What surrounds us therefore is a vast tapestry of lies, upon which we feed.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">As every single person here knows, the justification for the invasion of Iraq was that Saddam Hussein possessed a highly dangerous body of weapons of mass destruction, some of which could be fired in 45 minutes, bringing about appalling devastation. We were assured that was true. It was not true. We were told that Iraq had a relationship with Al Quaeda and shared responsibility for the atrocity in New York of September 11th 2001. We were assured that this was true. It was not true. We were told that Iraq threatened the security of the world. We were assured it was true. It was not true.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The truth is something entirely different. The truth is to do with how the United States understands its role in the world and how it chooses to embody it.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But before I come back to the present I would like to look at the recent past, by which I mean United States foreign policy since the end of the Second World War. I believe it is obligatory upon us to subject this period to at least some kind of even limited scrutiny, which is all that time will allow here.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Everyone knows what happened in the Soviet Union and throughout Eastern Europe during the post-war period: the systematic brutality, the widespread atrocities, the ruthless suppression of independent thought. All this has been fully documented and verified.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">But my contention here is that the US crimes in the same period have only been superficially recorded, let alone documented, let alone acknowledged, let alone recognised as crimes at all. I believe this must be addressed and that the truth has considerable bearing on where the world stands now. Although constrained, to a certain extent, by the existence of the Soviet Union, the United States' actions throughout the world made it clear that it had concluded it had carte blanche to do what it liked.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Direct invasion of a sovereign state has never in fact been America's favoured method. In the main, it has preferred what it has described as 'low intensity conflict'. Low intensity conflict means that thousands of people die but slower than if you dropped a bomb on them in one fell swoop. It means that you infect the heart of the country, that you establish a malignant growth and watch the gangrene bloom. When the populace has been subdued - or beaten to death - the same thing - and your own friends, the military and the great corporations, sit comfortably in power, you go before the camera and say that democracy has prevailed. This was a commonplace in US foreign policy in the years to which I refer.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The tragedy of Nicaragua was a highly significant case. I choose to offer it here as a potent example of America's view of its role in the world, both then and now.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I was present at a meeting at the US embassy in London in the late 1980s.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The United States Congress was about to decide whether to give more money to the Contras in their campaign against the state of Nicaragua. I was a member of a delegation speaking on behalf of Nicaragua but the most important member of this delegation was a Father John Metcalf. The leader of the US body was Raymond Seitz (then number two to the ambassador, later ambassador himself). Father Metcalf said: 'Sir, I am in charge of a parish in the north of Nicaragua. My parishioners built a school, a health centre, a cultural centre. We have lived in peace. A few months ago a Contra force attacked the parish. They destroyed everything: the school, the health centre, the cultural centre. They raped nurses and teachers, slaughtered doctors, in the most brutal manner. They behaved like savages. Please demand that the US government withdraw its support from this shocking terrorist activity.'</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Raymond Seitz had a very good reputation as a rational, responsible and highly sophisticated man. He was greatly respected in diplomatic circles. He listened, paused and then spoke with some gravity. 'Father,' he said, 'let me tell you something. In war, innocent people always suffer.' There was a frozen silence. We stared at him. He did not flinch.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Innocent people, indeed, always suffer.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Finally somebody said: 'But in this case "innocent people" were the victims of a gruesome atrocity subsidised by your government, one among many. If Congress allows the Contras more money further atrocities of this kind will take place. Is this not the case? Is your government not therefore guilty of supporting acts of murder and destruction upon the citizens of a sovereign state?'</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Seitz was imperturbable. 'I don't agree that the facts as presented support your assertions,' he said.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">As we were leaving the Embassy a US aide told me that he enjoyed my plays. I did not reply.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I should remind you that at the time President Reagan made the following statement: 'The Contras are the moral equivalent of our Founding Fathers.'</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The United States supported the brutal Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua for over 40 years. The Nicaraguan people, led by the Sandinistas, overthrew this regime in 1979, a breathtaking popular revolution.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The Sandinistas weren't perfect. They possessed their fair share of arrogance and their political philosophy contained a number of contradictory elements. But they were intelligent, rational and civilised. They set out to establish a stable, decent, pluralistic society. The death penalty was abolished. Hundreds of thousands of poverty-stricken peasants were brought back from the dead. Over 100,000 families were given title to land. Two thousand schools were built. A quite remarkable literacy campaign reduced illiteracy in the country to less than one seventh. Free education was established and a free health service. Infant mortality was reduced by a third. Polio was eradicated.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The United States denounced these achievements as Marxist/Leninist subversion. In the view of the US government, a dangerous example was being set. If Nicaragua was allowed to establish basic norms of social and economic justice, if it was allowed to raise the standards of health care and education and achieve social unity and national self respect, neighbouring countries would ask the same questions and do the same things. There was of course at the time fierce resistance to the status quo in El Salvador.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I spoke earlier about 'a tapestry of lies' which surrounds us. President Reagan commonly described Nicaragua as a 'totalitarian dungeon'. This was taken generally by the media, and certainly by the British government, as accurate and fair comment. But there was in fact no record of death squads under the Sandinista government. There was no record of torture. There was no record of systematic or official military brutality. No priests were ever murdered in Nicaragua. There were in fact three priests in the government, two Jesuits and a Maryknoll missionary. The totalitarian dungeons were actually next door, in El Salvador and Guatemala. The United States had brought down the democratically elected government of Guatemala in 1954 and it is estimated that over 200,000 people had been victims of successive military dictatorships.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Six of the most distinguished Jesuits in the world were viciously murdered at the Central American University in San Salvador in 1989 by a battalion of the Alcatl regiment trained at Fort Benning, Georgia, USA. That extremely brave man Archbishop Romero was assassinated while saying mass. It is estimated that 75,000 people died. Why were they killed? They were killed because they believed a better life was possible and should be achieved. That belief immediately qualified them as communists. They died because they dared to question the status quo, the endless plateau of poverty, disease, degradation and oppression, which had been their birthright.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The United States finally brought down the Sandinista government. It took some years and considerable resistance but relentless economic persecution and 30,000 dead finally undermined the spirit of the Nicaraguan people. They were exhausted and poverty stricken once again. The casinos moved back into the country. Free health and free education were over. Big business returned with a vengeance. 'Democracy' had prevailed.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">But this 'policy' was by no means restricted to Central America. It was conducted throughout the world. It was never-ending. And it is as if it never happened.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The United States supported and in many cases engendered every right wing military dictatorship in the world after the end of the Second World War. I refer to Indonesia, Greece, Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, Haiti, Turkey, the Philippines, Guatemala, El Salvador, and, of course, Chile. The horror the United States inflicted upon Chile in 1973 can never be purged and can never be forgiven.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Hundreds of thousands of deaths took place throughout these countries. Did they take place? And are they in all cases attributable to US foreign policy? The answer is yes they did take place and they are attributable to American foreign policy. But you wouldn't know it.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It never happened. Nothing ever happened. Even while it was happening it wasn't happening. It didn't matter. It was of no interest. The crimes of the United States have been systematic, constant, vicious, remorseless, but very few people have actually talked about them. You have to hand it to America. It has exercised a quite clinical manipulation of power worldwide while masquerading as a force for universal good. It's a brilliant, even witty, highly successful act of hypnosis.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">I put to you that the United States is without doubt the greatest show on the road. Brutal, indifferent, scornful and ruthless it may be but it is also very clever.</span></span></strong> As a salesman it is out on its own and its most saleable commodity is self love. It's a winner. Listen to all American presidents on television say the words, 'the American people', as in the sentence, 'I say to the American people it is time to pray and to defend the rights of the American people and I ask the American people to trust their president in the action he is about to take on behalf of the American people.'</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">It's a scintillating stratagem. Language is actually employed to keep thought at bay. The words 'the American people' provide a truly voluptuous cushion of reassurance. You don't need to think. Just lie back on the cushion. The cushion may be suffocating your intelligence and your critical faculties but it's very comfortable. This does not apply of course to the 40 million people living below the poverty line and the 2 million men and women imprisoned in the vast gulag of prisons, which extends across the US.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The United States no longer bothers about low intensity conflict. It no longer sees any point in being reticent or even devious. It puts its cards on the table without fear or favour. It quite simply doesn't give a damn about the United Nations, international law or critical dissent, which it regards as impotent and irrelevant. It also has its own bleating little lamb tagging behind it on a lead, the pathetic and supine Great Britain.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">What has happened to our moral sensibility? Did we ever have any? What do these words mean? Do they refer to a term very rarely employed these days - conscience? A conscience to do not only with our own acts but to do with our shared responsibility in the acts of others? Is all this dead? Look at Guantanamo Bay. Hundreds of people detained without charge for over three years, with no legal representation or due process, technically detained forever. This totally illegitimate structure is maintained in defiance of the Geneva Convention. It is not only tolerated but hardly thought about by what's called the 'international community'. This criminal outrage is being committed by a country, which declares itself to be 'the leader of the free world'. Do we think about the inhabitants of Guantanamo Bay? What does the media say about them? They pop up occasionally - a small item on page six. They have been consigned to a no man's land from which indeed they may never return. At present many are on hunger strike, being force-fed, including British residents. No niceties in these force-feeding procedures. No sedative or anaesthetic. Just a tube stuck up your nose and into your throat. You vomit blood. This is torture. What has the British Foreign Secretary said about this? Nothing. What has the British Prime Minister said about this? Nothing. Why not? Because the United States has said: to criticise our conduct in Guantanamo Bay constitutes an unfriendly act. You're either with us or against us. So Blair shuts up.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The invasion of Iraq was a bandit act, an act of blatant state terrorism, demonstrating absolute contempt for the concept of international law. The invasion was an arbitrary military action inspired by a series of lies upon lies and gross manipulation of the media and therefore of the public; an act intended to consolidate American military and economic control of the Middle East masquerading - as a last resort - all other justifications having failed to justify themselves - as liberation. A formidable assertion of military force responsible for the death and mutilation of thousands and thousands of innocent people.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">We have brought torture, cluster bombs, depleted uranium, innumerable acts of random murder, misery, degradation and death to the Iraqi people and call it 'bringing freedom and democracy to the Middle East'.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">How many people do you have to kill before you qualify to be described as a mass murderer and a war criminal? One hundred thousand? More than enough, I would have thought. Therefore it is just that Bush and Blair be arraigned before the International Criminal Court of Justice. But Bush has been clever. He has not ratified the International Criminal Court of Justice. Therefore if any American soldier or for that matter politician finds himself in the dock Bush has warned that he will send in the marines. But Tony Blair has ratified the Court and is therefore available for prosecution. We can let the Court have his address if they're interested. It is Number 10, Downing Street, London.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Death in this context is irrelevant. Both Bush and Blair place death well away on the back burner. At least 100,000 Iraqis were killed by American bombs and missiles before the Iraq insurgency began. These people are of no moment. Their deaths don't exist. They are blank. They are not even recorded as being dead. 'We don't do body counts,' said the American general Tommy Franks.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Early in the invasion there was a photograph published on the front page of British newspapers of Tony Blair kissing the cheek of a little Iraqi boy. 'A grateful child,' said the caption. A few days later there was a story and photograph, on an inside page, of another four-year-old boy with no arms. His family had been blown up by a missile. He was the only survivor. 'When do I get my arms back?' he asked. The story was dropped. Well, Tony Blair wasn't holding him in his arms, nor the body of any other mutilated child, nor the body of any bloody corpse. Blood is dirty. It dirties your shirt and tie when you're making a sincere speech on television.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The 2,000 American dead are an embarrassment. They are transported to their graves in the dark. Funerals are unobtrusive, out of harm's way. The mutilated rot in their beds, some for the rest of their lives. So the dead and the mutilated both rot, in different kinds of graves.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Here is an extract from a poem by <a style="border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: transparent; color: #307598;" href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1971/index.html">Pablo Neruda</a>, 'I'm Explaining a Few Things':</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Let me make it quite clear that in quoting from Neruda's poem I am in no way comparing Republican Spain to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. I quote Neruda because nowhere in contemporary poetry have I read such a powerful visceral description of the bombing of civilians.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I have said earlier that the United States is now totally frank about putting its cards on the table. That is the case. Its official declared policy is now defined as 'full spectrum dominance'. That is not my term, it is theirs. 'Full spectrum dominance' means control of land, sea, air and space and all attendant resources.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The United States now occupies 702 military installations throughout the world in 132 countries, with the honourable exception of Sweden, of course. We don't quite know how they got there but they are there all right.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The United States possesses 8,000 active and operational nuclear warheads. Two thousand are on hair trigger alert, ready to be launched with 15 minutes warning. It is developing new systems of nuclear force, known as bunker busters. The British, ever cooperative, are intending to replace their own nuclear missile, Trident. Who, I wonder, are they aiming at? Osama bin Laden? You? Me? Joe Dokes? China? Paris? Who knows? What we do know is that this infantile insanity - the possession and threatened use of nuclear weapons - is at the heart of present American political philosophy. We must remind ourselves that the United States is on a permanent military footing and shows no sign of relaxing it.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Many thousands, if not millions, of people in the United States itself are demonstrably sickened, shamed and angered by their government's actions, but as things stand they are not a coherent political force - yet. But the anxiety, uncertainty and fear which we can see growing daily in the United States is unlikely to diminish.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I know that President Bush has many extremely competent speech writers but I would like to volunteer for the job myself. I propose the following short address which he can make on television to the nation. I see him grave, hair carefully combed, serious, winning, sincere, often beguiling, sometimes employing a wry smile, curiously attractive, a man's man.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">'God is good. God is great. God is good. My God is good. Bin Laden's God is bad. His is a bad God. Saddam's God was bad, except he didn't have one. He was a barbarian. We are not barbarians. We don't chop people's heads off. We believe in freedom. So does God. I am not a barbarian. I am the democratically elected leader of a freedom-loving democracy. We are a compassionate society. We give compassionate electrocution and compassionate lethal injection. We are a great nation. I am not a dictator. He is. I am not a barbarian. He is. And he is. They all are. I possess moral authority. You see this fist? This is my moral authority. And don't you forget it.'</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">A writer's life is a highly vulnerable, almost naked activity. We don't have to weep about that. The writer makes his choice and is stuck with it. But it is true to say that you are open to all the winds, some of them icy indeed. You are out on your own, out on a limb. You find no shelter, no protection - unless you lie - in which case of course you have constructed your own protection and, it could be argued, become a politician.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I have referred to death quite a few times this evening. I shall now quote a poem of my own called 'Death'.</p>
              <blockquote style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">

              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em;">Was the dead body naked or dressed for a journey?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em;">What made you declare the dead body dead?<br>Did you declare the dead body dead?<br>How well did you know the dead body?<br>How did you know the dead body was dead?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em;">Did you wash the dead body<br>Did you close both its eyes<br>Did you bury the body<br>Did you leave it abandoned<br>Did you kiss the dead body</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">When we look into a mirror we think the image that confronts us is accurate. But move a millimetre and the image changes. We are actually looking at a never-ending range of reflections. But sometimes a writer has to smash the mirror - for it is on the other side of that mirror that the truth stares at us.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I believe that despite the enormous odds which exist, unflinching, unswerving, fierce intellectual determination, as citizens, to define the <em>real</em> truth of our lives and our societies is a crucial obligation which devolves upon us all. It is in fact mandatory.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">If such a determination is not embodied in our political vision we have no hope of restoring what is so nearly lost to us - the dignity of man.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">In 1958 I wrote the following:</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">'There are no hard distinctions between what is real and what is
              unreal, nor between what is true and what is false. A thing is not
              necessarily either true or false; it can be both true and
              false.'</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I believe that these assertions still make sense and do still apply
              to the exploration of reality through art. So as a writer I stand
              by them but as a citizen I cannot. As a citizen I must ask: What is
              true? What is false?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Truth in drama is forever elusive. You never quite find it but the
              search for it is compulsive. The search is clearly what drives the
              endeavour. The search is your task. More often than not you stumble
              upon the truth in the dark, colliding with it or just glimpsing an
              image or a shape which seems to correspond to the truth, often
              without realising that you have done so. But the real truth is that
              there never is any such thing as one truth to be found in dramatic
              art. There are many. These truths challenge each other, recoil from
              each other, reflect each other, ignore each other, tease each
              other, are blind to each other. Sometimes you feel you have the
              truth of a moment in your hand, then it slips through your fingers
              and is lost.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I have often been asked how my plays come about. I cannot say. Nor
              can I ever sum up my plays, except to say that this is what
              happened. That is what they said. That is what they did.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Most of the plays are engendered by a line, a word or an image. The
              given word is often shortly followed by the image. I shall give two
              examples of two lines which came right out of the blue into my
              head, followed by an image, followed by me.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The plays are <em>The Homecoming</em> and <em>Old
              Times</em>. The first line of <em>The Homecoming</em> is
              'What have you done with the scissors?' The first line
              of <em>Old Times</em> is 'Dark.'</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">In each case I had no further information.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">In the first case someone was obviously looking for a pair of
              scissors and was demanding their whereabouts of someone else he
              suspected had probably stolen them. But I somehow knew that the
              person addressed didn't give a damn about the scissors or about the
              questioner either, for that matter.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">'Dark' I took to be a description of someone's hair, the hair of a
              woman, and was the answer to a question. In each case I found
              myself compelled to pursue the matter. This happened visually, a
              very slow fade, through shadow into light.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I always start a play by calling the characters A, B and C.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">In the play that became <em>The Homecoming</em> I saw a
              man enter a stark room and ask his question of a younger man
              sitting on an ugly sofa reading a racing paper. I somehow suspected
              that A was a father and that B was his son, but I had no proof.
              This was however confirmed a short time later when B (later to
              become Lenny) says to A (later to become Max), 'Dad, do you mind if
              I change the subject? I want to ask you something. The dinner we
              had before, what was the name of it? What do you call it? Why don't
              you buy a dog? You're a dog cook. Honest. You think you're cooking
              for a lot of dogs.' So since B calls A 'Dad' it seemed to me
              reasonable to assume that they were father and son. A was also
              clearly the cook and his cooking did not seem to be held in high
              regard. Did this mean that there was no mother? I didn't know. But,
              as I told myself at the time, our beginnings never know our
              ends.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">'Dark.' A large window. Evening sky. A man, A (later to become
              Deeley), and a woman, B (later to become Kate), sitting with
              drinks. 'Fat or thin?' the man asks. Who are they talking about?
              But I then see, standing at the window, a woman, C (later to become
              Anna), in another condition of light, her back to them, her hair
              dark.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">It's a strange moment, the moment of creating characters who up to
              that moment have had no existence. What follows is fitful,
              uncertain, even hallucinatory, although sometimes it can be an
              unstoppable avalanche. The author's position is an odd one. In a
              sense he is not welcomed by the characters. The characters resist
              him, they are not easy to live with, they are impossible to define.
              You certainly can't dictate to them. To a certain extent you play a
              never-ending game with them, cat and mouse, blind man's buff, hide
              and seek. But finally you find that you have people of flesh and
              blood on your hands, people with will and an individual sensibility
              of their own, made out of component parts you are unable to change,
              manipulate or distort.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">So language in art remains a highly ambiguous transaction, a
              quicksand, a trampoline, a frozen pool which might give way under
              you, the author, at any time.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">But as I have said, the search for the truth can never stop. It
              cannot be adjourned, it cannot be postponed. It has to be faced,
              right there, on the spot.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Political theatre presents an entirely different set of problems.
              Sermonising has to be avoided at all cost. Objectivity is
              essential. The characters must be allowed to breathe their own air.
              The author cannot confine and constrict them to satisfy his own
              taste or disposition or prejudice. He must be prepared to approach
              them from a variety of angles, from a full and uninhibited range of
              perspectives, take them by surprise, perhaps, occasionally, but
              nevertheless give them the freedom to go which way they will. This
              does not always work. And political satire, of course, adheres to
              none of these precepts, in fact does precisely the opposite, which
              is its proper function.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">In my play <em>The Birthday Party</em> I think I allow a
              whole range of options to operate in a dense forest of possibility
              before finally focussing on an act of subjugation.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>Mountain Language</em> pretends to no such range of
              operation. It remains brutal, short and ugly. But the soldiers in
              the play do get some fun out of it. One sometimes forgets that
              torturers become easily bored. They need a bit of a laugh to keep
              their spirits up. This has been confirmed of course by the events
              at Abu Ghraib in Baghdad. <em>Mountain
              Language</em> lasts only 20 minutes, but it could go on for
              hour after hour, on and on and on, the same pattern repeated over
              and over again, on and on, hour after hour.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>Ashes to Ashes</em>, on the other hand, seems to me to be
              taking place under water. A drowning woman, her hand reaching up
              through the waves, dropping down out of sight, reaching for others,
              but finding nobody there, either above or under the water, finding
              only shadows, reflections, floating; the woman a lost figure in a
              drowning landscape, a woman unable to escape the doom that seemed
              to belong only to others.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">But as they died, she must die too.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Political language, as used by politicians, does not venture into
              any of this territory since the majority of politicians, on the
              evidence available to us, are interested not in truth but in power
              and in the maintenance of that power. To maintain that power it is
              essential that people remain in ignorance, that they live in
              ignorance of the truth, even the truth of their own lives. What
              surrounds us therefore is a vast tapestry of lies, upon which we
              feed.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">As every single person here knows, the justification for the
              invasion of Iraq was that Saddam Hussein possessed a highly
              dangerous body of weapons of mass destruction, some of which could
              be fired in 45 minutes, bringing about appalling devastation. We
              were assured that was true. It was not true. We were told that Iraq
              had a relationship with Al Quaeda and shared responsibility for the
              atrocity in New York of September 11th 2001. We were assured that
              this was true. It was not true. We were told that Iraq threatened
              the security of the world. We were assured it was true. It was not
              true.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The truth is something entirely different. The truth is to do with
              how the United States understands its role in the world and how it
              chooses to embody it.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But before I come
              back to the present I would like to look at the recent past, by
              which I mean United States foreign policy since the end of the
              Second World War. I believe it is obligatory upon us to subject
              this period to at least some kind of even limited scrutiny, which
              is all that time will allow here.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Everyone knows what happened in the Soviet Union and throughout
              Eastern Europe during the post-war period: the systematic
              brutality, the widespread atrocities, the ruthless suppression of
              independent thought. All this has been fully documented and
              verified.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">But my contention here is that the US crimes in the same period
              have only been superficially recorded, let alone documented, let
              alone acknowledged, let alone recognised as crimes at all. I
              believe this must be addressed and that the truth has considerable
              bearing on where the world stands now. Although constrained, to a
              certain extent, by the existence of the Soviet Union, the United
              States' actions throughout the world made it clear that it had
              concluded it had carte blanche to do what it liked.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Direct invasion of a sovereign state has never in fact been
              America's favoured method. In the main, it has preferred what it
              has described as 'low intensity conflict'. Low intensity conflict
              means that thousands of people die but slower than if you dropped a
              bomb on them in one fell swoop. It means that you infect the heart
              of the country, that you establish a malignant growth and watch the
              gangrene bloom. When the populace has been subdued - or beaten to
              death - the same thing - and your own friends, the military and the
              great corporations, sit comfortably in power, you go before the
              camera and say that democracy has prevailed. This was a commonplace
              in US foreign policy in the years to which I refer.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The tragedy of Nicaragua was a highly significant case. I choose to
              offer it here as a potent example of America's view of its role in
              the world, both then and now.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I was present at a meeting at the US embassy in London in the late
              1980s.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The United States Congress was about to decide whether to give more
              money to the Contras in their campaign against the state of
              Nicaragua. I was a member of a delegation speaking on behalf of
              Nicaragua but the most important member of this delegation was a
              Father John Metcalf. The leader of the US body was Raymond Seitz
              (then number two to the ambassador, later ambassador himself).
              Father Metcalf said: 'Sir, I am in charge of a parish in the north
              of Nicaragua. My parishioners built a school, a health centre, a
              cultural centre. We have lived in peace. A few months ago a Contra
              force attacked the parish. They destroyed everything: the school,
              the health centre, the cultural centre. They raped nurses and
              teachers, slaughtered doctors, in the most brutal manner. They
              behaved like savages. Please demand that the US government withdraw
              its support from this shocking terrorist activity.'</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Raymond Seitz had a very good reputation as a rational, responsible
              and highly sophisticated man. He was greatly respected in
              diplomatic circles. He listened, paused and then spoke with some
              gravity. 'Father,' he said, 'let me tell you something. In war,
              innocent people always suffer.' There was a frozen silence. We
              stared at him. He did not flinch.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Innocent people, indeed, always suffer.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Finally somebody said: 'But in this case "innocent people" were the
              victims of a gruesome atrocity subsidised by your government, one
              among many. If Congress allows the Contras more money further
              atrocities of this kind will take place. Is this not the case? Is
              your government not therefore guilty of supporting acts of murder
              and destruction upon the citizens of a sovereign state?'</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Seitz was imperturbable. 'I don't agree that the facts as presented
              support your assertions,' he said.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">As we were leaving the Embassy a US aide told me that he enjoyed my
              plays. I did not reply.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I should remind you that at the time President Reagan made the
              following statement: 'The Contras are the moral equivalent of our
              Founding Fathers.'</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The United States supported the brutal Somoza dictatorship in
              Nicaragua for over 40 years. The Nicaraguan people, led by the
              Sandinistas, overthrew this regime in 1979, a breathtaking popular
              revolution.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The Sandinistas weren't perfect. They possessed their fair share of
              arrogance and their political philosophy contained a number of
              contradictory elements. But they were intelligent, rational and
              civilised. They set out to establish a stable, decent, pluralistic
              society. The death penalty was abolished. Hundreds of thousands of
              poverty-stricken peasants were brought back from the dead. Over
              100,000 families were given title to land. Two thousand schools
              were built. A quite remarkable literacy campaign reduced illiteracy
              in the country to less than one seventh. Free education was
              established and a free health service. Infant mortality was reduced
              by a third. Polio was eradicated.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The United States denounced these achievements as Marxist/Leninist
              subversion. In the view of the US government, a dangerous example
              was being set. If Nicaragua was allowed to establish basic norms of
              social and economic justice, if it was allowed to raise the
              standards of health care and education and achieve social unity and
              national self respect, neighbouring countries would ask the same
              questions and do the same things. There was of course at the time
              fierce resistance to the status quo in El Salvador.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I spoke earlier about 'a tapestry of lies' which surrounds us.
              President Reagan commonly described Nicaragua as a 'totalitarian
              dungeon'. This was taken generally by the media, and certainly by
              the British government, as accurate and fair comment. But there was
              in fact no record of death squads under the Sandinista government.
              There was no record of torture. There was no record of systematic
              or official military brutality. No priests were ever murdered in
              Nicaragua. There were in fact three priests in the government, two
              Jesuits and a Maryknoll missionary. The totalitarian dungeons were
              actually next door, in El Salvador and Guatemala. The United States
              had brought down the democratically elected government of Guatemala
              in 1954 and it is estimated that over 200,000 people had been
              victims of successive military dictatorships.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Six of the most distinguished Jesuits in the world were viciously
              murdered at the Central American University in San Salvador in 1989
              by a battalion of the Alcatl regiment trained at Fort Benning,
              Georgia, USA. That extremely brave man Archbishop Romero was
              assassinated while saying mass. It is estimated that 75,000 people
              died. Why were they killed? They were killed because they believed
              a better life was possible and should be achieved. That belief
              immediately qualified them as communists. They died because they
              dared to question the status quo, the endless plateau of poverty,
              disease, degradation and oppression, which had been their
              birthright.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The United States finally brought down the Sandinista government.
              It took some years and considerable resistance but relentless
              economic persecution and 30,000 dead finally undermined the spirit
              of the Nicaraguan people. They were exhausted and poverty stricken
              once again. The casinos moved back into the country. Free health
              and free education were over. Big business returned with a
              vengeance. 'Democracy' had prevailed.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">But this 'policy' was by no means restricted to Central America. It
              was conducted throughout the world. It was never-ending. And it is
              as if it never happened.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The United States
              supported and in many cases engendered every right wing military
              dictatorship in the world after the end of the Second World War. I
              refer to Indonesia, Greece, Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, Haiti,
              Turkey, the Philippines, Guatemala, El Salvador, and, of course,
              Chile. The horror the United States inflicted upon Chile in 1973
              can never be purged and can never be forgiven.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Hundreds of thousands of deaths took place throughout these
              countries. Did they take place? And are they in all cases
              attributable to US foreign policy? The answer is yes they did take
              place and they are attributable to American foreign policy. But you
              wouldn't know it.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It never happened. Nothing ever happened. Even
              while it was happening it wasn't happening. It didn't matter. It
              was of no interest. The crimes of the United States have been
              systematic, constant, vicious, remorseless, but very few people
              have actually talked about them. You have to hand it to America. It
              has exercised a quite clinical manipulation of power worldwide
              while masquerading as a force for universal good. It's a brilliant,
              even witty, highly successful act of
              hypnosis.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">I put to you that the United States is without
              doubt the greatest show on the road. Brutal, indifferent, scornful
              and ruthless it may be but it is also very
              clever.</span></span></strong> As a salesman it is out on its own
              and its most saleable commodity is self love. It's a winner. Listen
              to all American presidents on television say the words, 'the
              American people', as in the sentence, 'I say to the American people
              it is time to pray and to defend the rights of the American people
              and I ask the American people to trust their president in the
              action he is about to take on behalf of the American people.'</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">It's a scintillating stratagem. Language is actually employed to
              keep thought at bay. The words 'the American people' provide a
              truly voluptuous cushion of reassurance. You don't need to think.
              Just lie back on the cushion. The cushion may be suffocating your
              intelligence and your critical faculties but it's very comfortable.
              This does not apply of course to the 40 million people living below
              the poverty line and the 2 million men and women imprisoned in the
              vast gulag of prisons, which extends across the US.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The United States no longer bothers about low intensity conflict.
              It no longer sees any point in being reticent or even devious. It
              puts its cards on the table without fear or favour. It quite simply
              doesn't give a damn about the United Nations, international law or
              critical dissent, which it regards as impotent and irrelevant. It
              also has its own bleating little lamb tagging behind it on a lead,
              the pathetic and supine Great Britain.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">What has happened to our moral sensibility? Did we ever have any?
              What do these words mean? Do they refer to a term very rarely
              employed these days - conscience? A conscience to do not only with
              our own acts but to do with our shared responsibility in the acts
              of others? Is all this dead? Look at Guantanamo Bay. Hundreds of
              people detained without charge for over three years, with no legal
              representation or due process, technically detained forever. This
              totally illegitimate structure is maintained in defiance of the
              Geneva Convention. It is not only tolerated but hardly thought
              about by what's called the 'international community'. This criminal
              outrage is being committed by a country, which declares itself to
              be 'the leader of the free world'. Do we think about the
              inhabitants of Guantanamo Bay? What does the media say about them?
              They pop up occasionally - a small item on page six. They have been
              consigned to a no man's land from which indeed they may never
              return. At present many are on hunger strike, being force-fed,
              including British residents. No niceties in these force-feeding
              procedures. No sedative or anaesthetic. Just a tube stuck up your
              nose and into your throat. You vomit blood. This is torture. What
              has the British Foreign Secretary said about this? Nothing. What
              has the British Prime Minister said about this? Nothing. Why not?
              Because the United States has said: to criticise our conduct in
              Guantanamo Bay constitutes an unfriendly act. You're either with us
              or against us. So Blair shuts up.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The invasion of Iraq was a bandit act, an act of blatant state
              terrorism, demonstrating absolute contempt for the concept of
              international law. The invasion was an arbitrary military action
              inspired by a series of lies upon lies and gross manipulation of
              the media and therefore of the public; an act intended to
              consolidate American military and economic control of the Middle
              East masquerading - as a last resort - all other justifications
              having failed to justify themselves - as liberation. A formidable
              assertion of military force responsible for the death and
              mutilation of thousands and thousands of innocent people.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">We have brought torture, cluster bombs, depleted uranium,
              innumerable acts of random murder, misery, degradation and death to
              the Iraqi people and call it 'bringing freedom and democracy to the
              Middle East'.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">How many people do you have to kill before you qualify to be
              described as a mass murderer and a war criminal? One hundred
              thousand? More than enough, I would have thought. Therefore it is
              just that Bush and Blair be arraigned before the International
              Criminal Court of Justice. But Bush has been clever. He has not
              ratified the International Criminal Court of Justice. Therefore if
              any American soldier or for that matter politician finds himself in
              the dock Bush has warned that he will send in the marines. But Tony
              Blair has ratified the Court and is therefore available for
              prosecution. We can let the Court have his address if they're
              interested. It is Number 10, Downing Street, London.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Death in this context is irrelevant. Both Bush and Blair place
              death well away on the back burner. At least 100,000 Iraqis were
              killed by American bombs and missiles before the Iraq insurgency
              began. These people are of no moment. Their deaths don't exist.
              They are blank. They are not even recorded as being dead. 'We don't
              do body counts,' said the American general Tommy Franks.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Early in the invasion there was a photograph published on the front
              page of British newspapers of Tony Blair kissing the cheek of a
              little Iraqi boy. 'A grateful child,' said the caption. A few days
              later there was a story and photograph, on an inside page, of
              another four-year-old boy with no arms. His family had been blown
              up by a missile. He was the only survivor. 'When do I get my arms
              back?' he asked. The story was dropped. Well, Tony Blair wasn't
              holding him in his arms, nor the body of any other mutilated child,
              nor the body of any bloody corpse. Blood is dirty. It dirties your
              shirt and tie when you're making a sincere speech on
              television.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The 2,000 American dead are an embarrassment. They are transported
              to their graves in the dark. Funerals are unobtrusive, out of
              harm's way. The mutilated rot in their beds, some for the rest of
              their lives. So the dead and the mutilated both rot, in different
              kinds of graves.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Here is an extract from a poem by <a style="border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: transparent; color: #307598;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1971/index.html">Pablo
              Neruda</a>, 'I'm Explaining a Few Things':</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Let me make it quite clear that in quoting from Neruda's poem I am
              in no way comparing Republican Spain to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. I
              quote Neruda because nowhere in contemporary poetry have I read
              such a powerful visceral description of the bombing of
              civilians.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I have said earlier that the United States is now totally frank
              about putting its cards on the table. That is the case. Its
              official declared policy is now defined as 'full spectrum
              dominance'. That is not my term, it is theirs. 'Full spectrum
              dominance' means control of land, sea, air and space and all
              attendant resources.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The United States now occupies 702 military installations
              throughout the world in 132 countries, with the honourable
              exception of Sweden, of course. We don't quite know how they got
              there but they are there all right.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The United States possesses 8,000 active and operational nuclear
              warheads. Two thousand are on hair trigger alert, ready to be
              launched with 15 minutes warning. It is developing new systems of
              nuclear force, known as bunker busters. The British, ever
              cooperative, are intending to replace their own nuclear missile,
              Trident. Who, I wonder, are they aiming at? Osama bin Laden? You?
              Me? Joe Dokes? China? Paris? Who knows? What we do know is that
              this infantile insanity - the possession and threatened use of
              nuclear weapons - is at the heart of present American political
              philosophy. We must remind ourselves that the United States is on a
              permanent military footing and shows no sign of relaxing it.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Many thousands, if not millions, of people in the United States
              itself are demonstrably sickened, shamed and angered by their
              government's actions, but as things stand they are not a coherent
              political force - yet. But the anxiety, uncertainty and fear which
              we can see growing daily in the United States is unlikely to
              diminish.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I know that President Bush has many extremely competent speech
              writers but I would like to volunteer for the job myself. I propose
              the following short address which he can make on television to the
              nation. I see him grave, hair carefully combed, serious, winning,
              sincere, often beguiling, sometimes employing a wry smile,
              curiously attractive, a man's man.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">'God is good. God is great. God is good. My God is good. Bin
              Laden's God is bad. His is a bad God. Saddam's God was bad, except
              he didn't have one. He was a barbarian. We are not barbarians. We
              don't chop people's heads off. We believe in freedom. So does God.
              I am not a barbarian. I am the democratically elected leader of a
              freedom-loving democracy. We are a compassionate society. We give
              compassionate electrocution and compassionate lethal injection. We
              are a great nation. I am not a dictator. He is. I am not a
              barbarian. He is. And he is. They all are. I possess moral
              authority. You see this fist? This is my moral authority. And don't
              you forget it.'</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">A writer's life is a highly vulnerable, almost naked activity. We
              don't have to weep about that. The writer makes his choice and is
              stuck with it. But it is true to say that you are open to all the
              winds, some of them icy indeed. You are out on your own, out on a
              limb. You find no shelter, no protection - unless you lie - in
              which case of course you have constructed your own protection and,
              it could be argued, become a politician.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I have referred to death quite a few times this evening. I shall
              now quote a poem of my own called 'Death'.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">When we look into a mirror we think the image that confronts us is
              accurate. But move a millimetre and the image changes. We are
              actually looking at a never-ending range of reflections. But
              sometimes a writer has to smash the mirror - for it is on the other
              side of that mirror that the truth stares at us.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I believe that despite the enormous odds which exist, unflinching,
              unswerving, fierce intellectual determination, as citizens, to
              define the <em>real</em> truth of our lives and our
              societies is a crucial obligation which devolves upon us all. It is
              in fact mandatory.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">If such a determination is not embodied in our political vision we
              have no hope of restoring what is so nearly lost to us - the
              dignity of man.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.25em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2005/pinter-lecture-e.html">http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2005/pinter-lecture-e.html</a></p>
