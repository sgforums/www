            <div class='col-md body'>Hello i am not posting this is Uncle or Aunty Agony because i just need opinions.<br><br>I've got a crush on this girl whom i've know for half a year. At first we didnt talk much, until once, she needed help on her project write up and the dateline was near due. On the day before the dateline, her writeup was rejected. I hear about that in class and i offered my help and thats how we started talking more.<br><br>Well, not really talk more but i started noticing her persence. At that time just treat her as a normal friend, and she is a very very shy person, so seldom talk to me too. Even up till now, when i am talking to her, i noticed she doesnt really look into my eyes, like dont know where to look like that.<br><br>So the last PC show, i saw her working for a certain company, and i was working there too. I got her phone number from a common friend to disturb her. After the PC show, we began chatting alot more on MSN.<br><br>Once after the PC show, she wanted to get a certain electronic product, and i was too, looking to buy one. So we decided to purchase one online together. Our MSN chats became more often its like whenever she is online or i am online, we would chat. Still, she still pretty shy in person and when talking to me, still dont dare to look into my eyes.<br><br>Everytime we are online, we would play MSN games together. There was even once we play for 8 hours straight.<br><br>We've got a few common friends, but there is something which i dont understand. Her good friend, whom i also know told me they like to gossip, and their gossiping includes me. Of course good things and bad things all included. Once, my friend told me they were talking about me being too "gentle" almost like a girl, like gay. (WTF?)<br>I told her and she just kept laughing, and defended herself. Saying its just exchanging of opinions la etc etc and gave lots of reasons to support why they said that.<br><br>Once we went out for movie with another 2 friends. As usual, she dont really talk much to me in person, but, my friend actually mentioned that they actually wanted to catch the movie alone, but its her who said to ask me along.<br><br>Everytime i helped her with something, she would say she owe me a drink, but dont wanna treat me, lol, and now she owed me like more then 10 drinks.<br><br>I tried asking her out, on the context of treating her to food coz she helped me with something, just 2 of us. Well, she didnt agree. Abit sian la, but i was thinking, if she agree, what if very awkward? She might just be thinking of that too.<br><br>So we became quite close friends, who mostly chatted online, and when chatting in person she does not dare look at me and that is very awkward.<br>Ok i got a HUGE crush now, but i am not receiving signals from her, or maybe i cant catch her signals.<br><br>Her birthday is next week, had many ideas up my mind, but the thing is, i am unsure to let it carry on flowing like this, or try another major step forward. I am taking into consideration that she is a very very shy person so any weird thing might just scare her off.<br><br>What do you forumers think?? thanks.. wow long post.<br></div>
