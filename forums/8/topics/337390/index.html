              <p>A Chinese national studying in Singapore is said to have posted derogatory comments about Singapore on a public internet forum.</p>
              <p>In the postings, the China student slams Singapore for being a "s**t society" with prostitutes roaming the streets of Geylang.<br> <br> The STOMP (The Straits Times Online Mobile Print) user who reported
              this incident to the website says he was infuriated when he read the
              posts.<br> <br> The STOMPer said, "He comments on his trip to Geylang and talks about girls from his country working in jobs he deems immoral."<br> <br> In the forum posts, the China student also describes the experience of
              driving through Geylang as akin to viewing animals in the zoo.<br> <br> He writes, "'Thai and Vietnamese prostitutes can be found in
              Singapore's legal brothels, while Chinese prostitutes will stand by the
              road. From eight to nine o'clock, they will line the street from start
              to end. Driving past them is like driving past animals in a zoo."<br> <br> In another post, he displays a photo of 2 "study mamas" with the caption "Study mamas - This s**t society".<br> <br> In another photo captured of some working girls who are his
              school-mates, the ex-student expresses his awkwardness at chancing upon
              his classmates working in Geylang.<br> <br> "These girls are from my school. I've bumped into school mates here
              many times before, how embarassing! Once again, i despise this "s**t"
              society."</p>
              <p>He also makes derogatory comments about the nationality, size, and
              race of the prostitutes in other posts as well, prompting the STOMPer
              to wonder, "What kind of foreign students are studying in Singapore???"<br> <br> Some Singaporeans on the forum have reacted strongly to his insults.
              One offended forum member replied by saying, "take a look at your
              country first", while another called for more restraint and sensitivity
              when posting comments on issues concerning "nationalistic pride".<br> <br> This is not the first time Singaporeans have been riled by comments posted by foreign students.<br> <br> In an earlier case, a foreign scholar was lambasted in the AsiaOne
              forum for rejecting a local scholarship because of an "extremely ugly"
              female who was in the same scholarship tour.</p>

              <p>this is not the 1st time this had happened and i m sick n tired of it. these ah tiongs come pollute our land with their nonsense, spitting everywhere, talking as if they own the land, cycling as if they still in that country of theirs, the list goes on n on n on... yes i agree there r some good ones, 1 in 10? or 1 in 100? take a walk around geylang. even if u take away the pros, u jus take into consideration the male tiongs. look at the mess n nuisance they make daily. check out all the neighbourhood parks n viod decks. they drink, they make noise, they litter, they leave. who clean up the mess? our poor cleaners. vomits, leftover foods, everything!</p>
              <p>our country is fast turning into a mini china. n our dear leaders r not doin anything abt it. u pay tax to maintain ur country n create a happy living environment. instead, we pay tax to feed these pests. if they r indeed talents, prove it. where is the prove? jus good in maths and chinese is talent? jus be the worst in ur sport in ur own country is talent?</p>
              <p>think abt it guys... take a look ard. think of ur daily routine.</p>
              <p>1. morning take bus, tiongs as bus drivers n fellow commuters. <br>2. reach office or school, tiongs as colleagues or classmates<br>3. aftnoon lunch, tiongs serve u coffee n clean table<br>4. evening take bus home, same as morning bus<br>5. reach home watch tv, tiongs news again. or worse, tiong acting on tv</p>
              <p>i admit i m extreme. but its all bcos i m infuriated that all out hard work in building this country to wat it is today is goin to b destroyed by pests we let in w/o serious consideration. if u watched the movie Troy, u will get the full picture. let them in, they will do wat they do best.</p>

              <p>Moral of the story:</p>
              <p>MOE needs to increase the monthly allowance in scholarships so
              that these students do not need to go Geylang to work part time for
