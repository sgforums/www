              <p>1. After the allowance that they are receiving from the Gov for studying here...that is s**tty comment. Do we really need to give to these unappreciative people?</p>
              <p>2. Working in the red light zone....hey ain't that what your national specialised in? That is the reason why our Gov welcoming your fellow villagers and cat them under Foreign Talent.</p>
              <p>3. please do not take it as an insult when you see them standing by the roadside coz:</p>
              <p>- If they stay back with the other nationalist in the golden house...then they will complain of not having business.</p>
              <p>- They are a natural bloodsuckes and greedy when come to money so by standing by the street....they get to advertise themself more, promoting themselves to the consumer, marketing themselves to be the world leading product.</p>
              <p>- All these they did it with pride and dignity and proud to be a China product as compare to others who hide and shy. That is why China have 3 trillion in national reserver while Vietnam and others are struggling to survive.</p>
              <p>4. These are the people that have done China proud and you as a fello Chinaman...you should be proud of them for their contribution in this s**t society.</p>

              <p>A Chinese national studying in Singapore is said to have posted derogatory comments about Singapore on a public internet forum.</p>
              <p>In the postings, the China student slams Singapore for being a "s**t society" with prostitutes roaming the streets of Geylang.<br><br>The STOMP (The Straits Times Online Mobile Print) user who reported this incident to the website says he was infuriated when he read the posts.<br><br>The STOMPer said, "He comments on his trip to Geylang and talks about girls from his country working in jobs he deems immoral."<br><br>In the forum posts, the China student also describes the experience of driving through Geylang as akin to viewing animals in the zoo.<br><br>He writes, "'Thai and Vietnamese prostitutes can be found in Singapore's legal brothels, while Chinese prostitutes will stand by the road. From eight to nine o'clock, they will line the street from start to end. Driving past them is like driving past animals in a zoo."<br><br>In another post, he displays a photo of 2 "study mamas" with the caption "Study mamas - This s**t society".<br><br>In another photo captured of some working girls who are his school-mates, the ex-student expresses his awkwardness at chancing upon his classmates working in Geylang.<br><br>"These girls are from my school. I've bumped into school mates here many times before, how embarassing! Once again, i despise this "s**t" society."</p>
              <p>He also makes derogatory comments about the nationality, size, and race of the prostitutes in other posts as well, prompting the STOMPer to wonder, "What kind of foreign students are studying in Singapore???"<br><br>Some Singaporeans on the forum have reacted strongly to his insults. One offended forum member replied by saying, "take a look at your country first", while another called for more restraint and sensitivity when posting comments on issues concerning "nationalistic pride".<br><br>This is not the first time Singaporeans have been riled by comments posted by foreign students.<br><br>In an earlier case, a foreign scholar was lambasted in the AsiaOne forum for rejecting a local scholarship because of an "extremely ugly" female who was in the same scholarship tour.</p>

              <p>completely agree. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>my mum told me she say a china slut actually fighting with another woman simply because the china slut refused to apologize after stepping on other peoples' toes, still can argue indignantly..on the MRT of course</p>
              <p>and its true, the higher ups had known about the melamine contamination (is it even the right word? it was done on purpose leh..), but decided to leave it the way it was because "they had expectations to live up to" by being the hosts of 2008 olympics. even the olympics in itself had some hiccups, like the girl who was singing blablabla..</p>
              <p>but it seriously made me question whether these assholes had any morals - they willingly took the risk of endangering their own citizens' health and wellbeing just to show the world "what the chinese can do", simply because many ang mo countries were skeptical about china actually being a host- bad air quality, lack of emergency exits in hotels (<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">), and even basic safety etcetc</p>
              <p>AND EVEN AFTER HAVING MELAMINE INCIDENT..</p>
              <p>they pointed fingers at japan for the tainted cup noodles incident, which was like "wtf are u trying to divert attention lol"...this is not the sole incident..cheena also pointed fingers at the US for not signing the kyoto protocol to cut down greenhouse gas emissions, saying that "china is developing at a rapid pace as compared to the US".</p>
              <p>as to number 4, i can tell everyone confidently that the prostitutes are not only out to make money for the sex- some actually copy down the address from your NRIC while you are not looking and show up in front of your doorstep to blackmail you. don't think that i am copying the details of the 9pm chn8 show ok. it happened to one of my relatives, and it fucked his entire family up big time. bottomline is, being prostitutes, your job is to just fuck, get money, and fuck another guy again, yet many choose to shatter families just to get more money...a prostitute fucks around 15+ guys a day (statistics from geylang clinic, i've got contacts there), and they can easily earn about close to 1k a day, which is A LOT..</p>
              <p>seriously, i am ashamed to be looked upon as chinese (associated with PRCs) when i travel <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
