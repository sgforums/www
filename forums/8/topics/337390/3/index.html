              <p>As a gal, i would say that it is a basic of supply and demand, if Singapore uncles do not patronise geyland, slowly the supply will be gone. You can blame the pros here messing up the society but you also hv to ask our local uncles to refrain from patronising them. Are they willing to let go?? If not, can't blame people call us shit society. If yes, you can by all means kick whoever said that we are in a shitty society.</p>

              <div>Prostitution is probably the oldest profession in the world and exist in every country. Just as in other countries, there are men here who needs them. We have had locals, Malaysian, Thai, Indonesian &amp; Filipinas providing this kind of service for a long time. As Donkhead pointed out, they should just do their job and move on to the next Tom, DICK or Harry. But these cock suckers from China are using a different strategy. They target older men, stick with them like a leech, with intention to hustle them of their money.</div>
              <div>There's a Chinese saying, which goes something like: "The hero finds it hard to pass the beauty". These fcuking China girls knows that and exploit it. When they got these men by their balls, their heart &amp; mind will follow. We can only blame some of these older folks for being naive.</div>
              <div>Honey, I disagree with your comment that we can't blame people for saying we're a shitty society just because our men keep patronising these Geylang 'animals'. (that's what the Chinaman is calling them)</div>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">This guy is saying, wherever Chinese from China go, they create a shitty society. I’m beginning to understand why some western countries have a strong resentment when Chinese set up a community in their county.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">As a frequent traveler to China, </span></span><span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">I find most Chinese to be obnoxious, uncultured, selfish, impolite &amp; inconsiderate people. You probably noticed that too among the Chinese nationals in S'pore. Following are some of my observations, of their behaviour &amp; bad habits:</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>1.<span>   </span></span></span><span>Unhygienic. Hawking (clearing the throat and spitting out phlegm) is very common, sometimes in front of others who are eating and even spitting in swimming pool and on the tennis court.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>2.<span>   </span></span></span><span>Rude. Not apologizing when bumping into others and hardly a word of appreciation when you help them.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>3.<span>   </span></span></span><span>Fear of loss of face, and would not admit even when they know they are in the wrong</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>4.<span>   </span></span></span><span>Materialistic and money minded, especially their women. You are their friend as long as they think they can get something back in return. They would do anything over money. (In recent years, more serious criminal cases in S’pore, involves Chinese from China) Many S’pore men have been sucked dry (not just literally) of their savings by Chinese women</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>5.<span>   </span></span></span><span>Take advantage of people at every opportunity. Very common to see conmen &amp; tricksters cheating foreigners &amp; fellow countrymen (usually poor folks) of their money.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>6.<span>   </span></span></span><span>Aggressive, unreasonable and violent behavour, resulting in quarrels and sometime fights over small matters.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span><span>7.<span>   </span></span></span><span>Very corrupted &amp; unscrupulous business people. Business deals would never be successful without going under the table. Contracts terms are breached or dishonored unashamedly. Look what some of their people did, to profit from sales of milk powder, at the expense of innocent babies. I have a feeling their top dogs knew about this fiasco before the Olympics but kept quiet about it. (ref item 3 above)</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #000000;">With the influx of Chinese coming to S’pore and most of them being arse holes, how can you not expect a shitty society.</span></span></p>

              <p>Chinese and Overseas-Chinese are very different.</p>
              <p>Christians say to each other "Peace be with you", they see you at peace, they leave you in peace and be glad. If they want to talk to you, they say "hello" or "hi" and it is your freedom whether you want to befriend them and they respect it. This is to me, the Good and the Light.</p>
              <p>But the Chinese motto is "I want to irritate you", they see you at Peace, they will come and harrass and irritate you, when you ignore them and continue with your life, they will continue their harrassment until you give them a respond ( be it an angry shout) and they will feel very glad because they acheived their goal of irriating you. To me this is evil. It is very sad to see them become this way. It is indeed very sad.</p>
              <p>I am harrassed by them and am still is, they ruined the peace in my life, they let the dogs bark and sound the car hore continuously or everytime you passby. They want to make me depress and end my life.  </p>
              <p>Overseas-Chinese chose the Light, they may not be christians, but they live with the good values.</p>
              <p>Chinese can still change and be saved by teaching the correct values in schools, to begin with they should teach they young that the correct value is not to lie, and discourage lying because if they whole community is lying, their minds are confused and devils looms in the community. The ten commandments in the bible is the most simple and basic values to make your society a good place to live in. Just my 2 cents.</p>
              <p>I may not be able to live long.</p>

              <p>Hey, even in NTU PRC's attitudes are also just as shitty. Every time there's free buffet after some recruitment talk by some company, All of a sudden a bunch of PRCs will flock to the place and eat the free food. They cut queues and do shit stuff like that as well. At least the worst ugly singaporeans will still at least attend the talk even if they ultimately have no interest in joining the company.</p>
              <p>PRCs always like to pot call the kettle black. Honestly most of the time, I always emphasise that I am Singaporean and just because I am chinese, do not associate me with anything from PRC.</p>
              <p>I am not so sure about PRCs speaking bad about us behind our backs but I won't be surprised if they actually do so, seeing that even their best brains have so little class. Really, I feel most/all of them speak english in such a fake, indecipherable accent that is neither amusing nor comprehensible.</p>

              <p>But the Chinese motto is "I want to irritate you", they see you at Peace, they will come and harrass and irritate you, when you ignore them and continue with your life, they will continue their harrassment until you give them a respond ( be it an angry shout) and they will feel very glad because they acheived their goal of irriating you. To me this is evil. It is very sad to see them become this way.

              <p>Overseas-Chinese chose the Light, they may not be christians, but they live with the good values.</p>
              <p>Chinese can still change and be saved by teaching the correct values in schools, to begin with they should teach they young that the correct value is not to lie, and discourage lying because if they whole community is lying, their minds are confused and devils looms in the community. The ten commandments in the bible is the most simple and basic values to make your society a good place to live in. Just my 2 cents.</p>

              <p><br>Read his entry, praising about christianity throughout and concluded with ten commandments as basic values to impart.</p>
              <p>But I beg to differ.</p>
              <p>The first 4 of the Ten Commandments are basically about revering to the God as revealed in the Bible. I don't think everyone has to subscribe to what the Bible says. So for a person who do not believe in the Bible, the first 4 of the Tene Commandments will be redundant.</p>
              <p>The remaining 6 values can be easily found in any other orthodox religions. In fact, the remaining 6 are pretty common sense. You can easily find these in Lao Tzu and Confuscius' writings in regards to morality which are non-theism in nature, which I think more suitable in a secular society.</p>

              <p>The Chinese find out things about me and use them to attack me psychologically and mentally. They know where I work and harrass me at my workplace and play they same song over and over again till I cant concentrate at work. They also play those songs near my place just to let me know of their presence and creating these kinds of psychological and mental distress. They live upstairs and opposite my unit, when I switch on the lights and make a turn, at that precise moment when I touch the switch, they sound the car horn or make all kind of noise,  just to let me know such harrassment are directed at me. At night, they will drop something heavy to create a very sudden and loud bang which causes psychological and mental shock to me and in the middle of the night, they sound the car alarm so that I cannot sleep well at night. They want me to have a mental breakdown, go crazy and sent to a mental hospital. They are treating me like their enemy.</p>
              <p>In the past, I thought that China and Chinese are good people, now I am not so sure, they are making me hate them and their country.</p>
              <p>Now I cover up my windows and avoid all Chinese.</p>
              <p>Perhaps Westerners are better people.</p>
