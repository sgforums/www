If u read M@a's book on "A brief history of the Psychology of Real Men" chapter 67 article 213 line 21, you will see that<br><br>"The law of <span style="font-style: italic;">courship function </span>(Fc) the male courtship function, in relation to the female courtship function is paradoxically inversed. i.e. the Males look for other girls to give off the impression they have many choices and are not tied down to simply 1 choice (let this 1 chouice by girl X). Hypothetically if the male were to continually overly focus his attention on girl X, to the female courtship function of girl X, he would appear as weak. And in appearing weak or submissive to her soley, her attraction for him would be greatly reduced if he did not give the impression that she is not the only thing in the world to him."<br><br>ofcourse this law works both ways, females not dwelling on guys makes them all the more attractive to guys, which is why many GUYS are hard to shake off from girls <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>So while explaining from the law of courship function, cutepixie.. u are subconciously unaware that in behaving the way u say he does, the guy actually makes u more attracted to him by looking for other girls. Likewise, if u were to go out with other guys, u would be more attractgive to ur guy who likes u. Relax. Many girls are unaware of it, so are guys, its human instinct courtship/<br><br>Also.. if u read chapter 23 on Economics of Courtship (also in the same book btw). Article 18 states<br><br>"The law of increasing <span style="font-style: italic;">courship utility </span>(CU) states that members of both sexes will rationally seek to maximise their CU regardless of whatever happens."<br><br>Cutepixie.. u see..This means that guys will seek to maximise their enjoyment of courship with girls whenever they get the chance to do so. For nice guys, they will in most cases try and do this while they are uncommitted to any relationship, same thing with girls. So in ur case, while the girl does not show him her feelings, regardless, the male has not given up, he is just maximising his CU by going out with other girls.. eventually he will go out with you when the girls he currently goes out with stop wanting to see him.<br><br>Regards<br><br>M@A<br>Author of books, authorised by the Weird TV psycologists Bureau and Sex in the City, check out his works:<br><br>"How to make men want what they don't think they want what they want"($57.66)<br><br>"How to make women want what theyd on't think they want what they want"<br>($57.66)<br><br>"A brief history of the psychology of Real men"<br>($75.50) +free tampons for female buyers<br><br>"A brief history of the psychology of Real women"<br>($76.50)<br><br>"M@a's official guide on How to be a Man 1st edition"<br>($34.44)<br><br>"M@a's official guide on How to be a Man 2nd edition"<br>($50.30<br><br>"M@a's official guide on How to be a Man 3rd edition"<br>($75.50)<br><br>"M@A's 80 ways to be a JERK" pocket book<br>($7.90)<br><br>Other Documentaries by M@a, in association with Weird TV and BBC productions and national Neographic:<br><br>"Human courtship behaviour"<br><br>"Human sexual intercourse documentary"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Her fault mah, never show any sign that she is interested, guy don't want to make himself a pest.  Of course take her no sign of attraction as rejection lor, otherwise what, keep trying till get a rejection right in the face and spoil the friendship?  He just took the no sign of attraction as a hint that she wanted to remain as a friend, I wouldn't say he is wrong to do that.  You want the guy to keep trying must as least show sign u are considering him mah.</div>
