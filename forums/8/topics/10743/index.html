            <div class='col-md body'>read an article in yesterday's Lianhe Wanbao, about a pretty girl who killed herself over a failed relationship because she just can't let go.<br><br>she was the mistress of some married rich guy in his 40s or 50s [she knew he's married when they were together] while she's only 30 this year, she was ditched 2 years back and had to be on medication since. she was beautiful and had no lack of suitors and yet she loved only him, is love really that blind?<br><br>pure speculation here, i've no idea why she decided to die, perhaps she made a final attempt to get him back and was rebuffed and couldn't take the blow or did she think that committing suicide, he'll feel contrite and guilty and realised what he has lost and pine for you? er, wake up, it's been 2 years, he has moved on [probably to other young gullible gals] ... so should she actually.<br><br>but the fact is he ditched her 2 years back, would her death affect him? probably. but will he be guilty all his life? not likely.<br><br>to die in this manner in the name of love, i think it's extremely not worth it and if i may say so, extremely stupid.<br><br>perhaps i've never loved as she has and i don't understand but i hope that should i be ditched in future, i've the strength and character to learn to let go and get on with life for there are many other possibles out there. perhaps i may not love the new him as much but then again, i may be surprised, i may love the new him much more than the one i thought i love most.<br><br>life is unpredictable, why cut it short when your turn is not up yet?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the problem is love doesn't lasts, okay, i admit it, i'm cynical about love.<br><br>if love is love and lasts, then there won't be so many breakups and affairs going on. how many truly find true love? given enough time, most love palls, familiarity sets in and contempt creeps in. maintaining a love relationship is such a tough thing to do and to just give it all up simply because the other don't love you in return, that's so ... i don't know the word for it. and there's a BIG possibility that someone else may come along to fill that void sometime in the future.<br><br>like everyone else, i hope to find someone to love truly and who loves me back but should i love him and he doesn't love me, why should i kill myself? i'm loved by others and it's no one's loss but mine and those who care for me should i decide to end it all.<br><br></div>
