However, even after so many years there has been no move from the British Government to return back the invaluable treasures that had been looted and taken out from India. Unofficial estimates put the value of these treasures at billions of dollars today. On behalf of my fellow countrymen I request you to please initiate the returns of the valuables that were taken by the British during their imperialistic rule in India. These valuables include, but not limited to, innumerable gold and silver coins, priceless diamonds, invaluable and irreplaceable historical artifacts, gold and silver jewellery and ornaments and many others. Just to give an example, when the British imperialistic army conquered the Nagpur province of India in the nineteenth century they looted diamonds, gold, silver, semi-precious stones, jewellery etc. that was auctioned for 3.5 crores (35,000,000) IR. This money was then used to set up the Lord's Bank in England! The present value of that <strong>amount alone is a few billion dollars</strong>. This is just one example and we are prepared to submit details of other cases for your consideration.<br><br>Our request is not without precedent in the modern world. Just a few weeks ago Italy has been made to return a significant and invaluable historic artifact that had been brought out from Ethiopia during the colonial rule. Germany has been made to pay back millions of dollars that had been acquired by its conquering armies during the second world war. As the international world realizes some of the mistakes that had been made by previous regimes, subsequent governments have taken necessary steps to make up for those mistakes. We hope and request that your Government take the necessary steps to return the assets looted from India. The Indian people look towards you to uphold the values that you have yourself supported in recent times.<br><br>Sincerely,</div>
