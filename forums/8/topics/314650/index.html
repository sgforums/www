              <h2 id="headline">Sect Members: Brainwashed or Believers?</h2>
              <h3 id="dek">Experts Question Whether Polygamist Sect Members are Victims of Brainwashing</h3>
              <p>Between hysterical sobs, the women of the Yearning for Zion Ranch in
              rural Texas tearily pleaded Monday for the return of their children
              from state custody, but at the mere turn of a phrase, those tears
              mysteriously, uniformly stopped.</p>
              <p>When conversations with reporters shifted away from the 416
              children in state custody toward touchier subjects surrounding the
              mysterious religious sect, the overflowing emotions were quickly
              replaced with blank stares and terse replies.</p>
              <p>Clad in conservative prairie dresses, hair back in buns and
              tight braids, the women stuck to monotone, emotionless responses in
              declining to answer reporters' questions concerning allegations of
              plural marriages and sexual assault within the sect.</p>
              <p>Asked whether 14- and 15-year-old girls get married on the
              compound, a tight-lipped woman who would only give her first name,
              Marilyn, gave what appeared to be a rehearsed response.</p>
              <p>"We are talking about our children now," she said, shaking her head, unwilling to stray from the subject of her children.</p>
              <p>The shift to blank-faced denial was jarring in both its
              immediacy and consistency. Not a single one strayed from the script, an
              impressive display of solidarity, if a bit peculiar to the outsiders
              granted unprecedented access to the members of the Fundamentalist
              Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.</p>
              <p>To outsiders, everything about these people is strange � from
              the way they dress to the way they talk and especially the way they
              live. To the uninitiated, it may even appear that these women must be
              brainwashed to live within the confines of the isolated, controlled
              sect.</p>
              <p>Questions about rumored child brides, teen pregnancies and men
              assigned multiple wives garnered stoic expressions and a relentless
              determination to defend the sect's lifestyle.</p>
              <p>"Do you know the definition of Zion?" responded Marie, when
              asked by a reporter what life within the sect's gate is really like.
              "Heaven on Earth."</p>
              <p>It's an extreme statement, and the women of the sect have begun
              to realize that their devotion to their lifestyle is unusual to those
              on the outside.</p>
              <p>So, are these women just fanatically, independently
              religious, or are they victims of something more sinister, like mind
              control?</p>
              <p>Mental health professionals told ABCNEWS.com that it may all depend on how you define brainwashing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Brainwashed or True Believers</h4>
              <p>"Just because they are different doesn't mean they've been
              brainwashed," said H. Newton Malony, a senior professor of psychology
              at the Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, Calif. "Brainwashing
              occurs when a person is physically incarcerated in order to believe
              something."</p>
              <p>As far as we know, said Malony, these women and children � and
              even men, for that matter � have not been held against their will, but
              rather, have grown up in the sect and have become socialized to its
              customs.</p>
              <p>"Are these woman just parroting strong pleasure or is this a
              strong religious conviction?" asked Malony. "I doubt it; they grew up
              in this [environment].</p>
              <p>"This is just an example of a different culture," added Malony.</p>
              <p>But Joe Szimhart, a cult information specialist for more than 25
              years, told ABCNEWS.com that even true believers can be brainwashed.</p>
              <p>"I have no doubt that they've been brainwashed," said Szimhart.
              "Just because it's different doesn't mean it's wrong, but there are
              levels of being different.</p>
              <p>"Any common definition of brainwashing or of a totalistic cult
              is when someone is involved in a self-sealing belief system," said
              Szimhart. "They see themselves apart from the rest of the world, and
              elitist, and think that everything outside is evil."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Without Access, Little Evidence</h4>
              <p>Nancy Ammerman, professor of the sociology of religion at Boston
              University and author of "Bible Believers: Fundamentalists in the
              Modern World," also discourages the labeling of the West Texas
              polygamists as victims of brainwashing.</p>
              <p>"Brainwashing is actually extraordinarily rare," said Ammerman.
              "It implies that the person has literally lost the ability to think
              independently and to make choices.</p>
              <p>"We really don't have any evidence that anything even vaguely
              resembling that is going on with this particular group or with most
              religious groups," Ammerman told ABCNEWS.com.</p>
              <p>"What you see is people, who have spent their lives
              talking to only each other, now suddenly talking to reporters and
              people on the outside," said Ammerman. "They develop a group jargon and
              a particular posture. Their gestures, their language, is all going to
              look like each other because they are so tied to each other.</p>
              <p>"That's not because someone has forced them to do that � it's
              simply coming out of living together in a relatively isolated kind of
              situation where they're not interacting with a lot of people," added
              Ammerman. "You'd find the same thing if you interviewed clustered
              nuns."</p>
              <p>According to Szimhart, one can be socialized and brainwashed.</p>
              <p>"When you're looking at the fundamentalist Mormons within an
              American society, you have to look at it within the context of
              reasonable human behavior," said Szimhart. "They've been socialized in
              an extreme way.</p>
              <p>"When I exit counsel someone, I see a person waking up, their
              brain function begins to expand and integrate to a wider frame of
              reference," said Szimhart. "They don't necessarily lose their belief in
              Jesus, they just have a more sophisticated belief."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>If You Can Leave, It's Not Mind Control, Some Say</h4>
              <p>While experts may argue that the members of the West Texas sect were
              born into the lifestyle and know no other way to exist, what about
              those who join cults like The Family and The Moonies later in life?</p>
              <p>"Many of them were looking for a kind of meaning for life in
              their 20s, and found it in the influence of the group," said Malony,
              who has counseled members of several religious groups during and after
              their involvement.</p>
              <p>"There are new religious movements, which are examples of what
              we would call high demand religious groups," explained Malony.
              "Scientology, for example."</p>
              <p>"But as far as we know, nobody is forced to become a
              scientologist, and although there is a lot of pressure to stay, once
              you're in, you can always leave," he said. "It only becomes
              brainwashing when a person is physically held against their will."</p>
              <p>But in his own counseling experience, Szimhart said he's
              seen individuals join cults as a result of their naivete, not because
              they were incarcerated.</p>
              <p>"Someone convinces a group that what they're saying is the
              truth, and the group is too naive to question it properly," said
              Szimhart. "[Getting brainwashed] is like having an illness or a
              sickness."</p>
              <p>Texas authorities took the 416 children into state custody for
              what may become the largest child abuse custody battle in the nation's
              history, stemming from a reported phone call from a teen girl claiming
              she had been beaten and forced into marriage with a 50-year-old man.
              The members are now clamoring to get their children back.</p>
              <p>But before a trial is held, the sect is free to exist � no
              matter how foreign and bizarre their customs may seem to the general
              public.</p>
              <p>"[The Yearning for Zion Ranch] is a religious community that,
              like many other religious communities, has a chosen way of life that is
              different from mainstream American culture," said Ammerman. "Until they
              step over the line of the law, American culture and American
              constitutional law protects their right to do odd things in the name of
              religion.</p>
