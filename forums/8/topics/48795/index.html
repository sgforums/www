            <div class='col-md body'>Today around lunch hours I was on my way to take a train at a MRT station and there was this man walking with the help of clutches approaching me. He asked if I am a Christian and I said yes and later on he ask if i can spare 5 min hearing him out coz he's suicidal. Of course i agreed and went with him to one of the benches at the platform and hear him out.<br><br>He showed me his pink IC and a letter from a government organisation and explained that he is unemployed due to his spinal accident and have tried many companies but no one wants to employ him. He then ask if I have 20 bucks to give him. No doubt i pity this man but i also cant help but to be cautious about such things given the fact that con-man do exists in this world. I told him i do not have such amount but is willing to bring him to my church which is a better position to help him not just short term but long term....he refused and walked away and look for someone else.  Am I right to do that or should i just give him the money???<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are wise to be cautious...since there are alot of conman around.  Basically he might just be playing on Christians' sympathy, since you say he ask you whether you are Christian.<br><br>Since you offered to bring him to your church but he refused, tat's his own choice liao...so relax and know that you didn't compromise your faith.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah i agree with wat u say but sometimes ppl think christians r ppl who claimed to pray for others only without really offering practical and tangible help (ie. financial, welfare etc). I am not discrediting the power of christian prayers infact i believe in that more than anything else but at times we need to provide direct help and assistance and dont give the excuse to pray and shun the responsibity. Infact Jesus did instruct us to care for the widows and fatherless and ppl in difficulties because what we do to these our brethren we did it to Him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if i am in your position, i would have done the same, or maybe offer him $10.<br>It's not that we are heartless, but we really do have to be cautious with our money. I have certain doubts in the man:<br>1) why must he ask whether you are a Christian?  Can't help feeling that he's probably planning that if the person he approach is a Christian, then he'll ask for more money cuz he probably knows Christian are encouraged to help others.<br>2) why $20? shouldn't he just accept any amount tothat a kind soul is willing to offer?<br><br>I suppose the best and most we can do for him is to pray for him. Our Father will knows whether or not he is genuinely in need and will provide for him accordingly</div>

He asked if I am a Christian and I said yes and later on he ask if i can spare 5 min hearing him out coz he's suicidal. Of course i agreed and went with him to one of the benches at the platform and hear him out.<br><br>He showed me his pink IC and a letter from a government organisation and explained that he is unemployed due to his spinal accident and have tried many companies but no one wants to employ him. He then ask if I have 20 bucks to give him. No doubt i pity this man but i also cant help but to be cautious about such things given the fact that con-man do exists in this world. I told him i do not have such amount but is willing to bring him to my church which is a better position to help him not just short term but long term....he refused and walked away and look for someone else.  Am I right to do that or should i just give him the money???<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> you have glorified Him.
