            <div class='col-md body'>My grandma died 2 years ago. She is such a nice lady and always dote all her grandson. She have 3 daughters n 3 sons. My mother is the youngest n the one who always visit her. From young, I always tag along with my mother. A kind and joyious person who show great care to her child n grand child.<br><br>When she pass away 2 years ago, i took a week leave to attend her waking. Though she has a "nie"(inside) grandson, but he never come. Only my uncle came. tat's pretty sad. Her daughter-in-law refuse to come, not even 1 day for the waking. We were very angry as when they need help($$), they will come n find my grandma. Now when she is gone, they all run away.<br><br>*sign* how I miss her cooking during CNY, tat smile on her face, and the things she have done. Now I put a photo of her in my wallet to remember this grandma who is always in my heart<br><br></div>
