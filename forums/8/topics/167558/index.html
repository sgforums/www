            <div class='col-md body'>Tora! Tora! Tora!<br><br>1) Japanese 'kate' torpedo bombers bear down on warships crowding Pearl Harbor - including seven battleships and over 100 heavy and light crusiers, destroyers and auxillaries. Zero fighters join in the fray.<br><br>2) Swarms of 'Kates' pound Ford Island's battleship row. Smoke pours from 'Nevada', northernmost of the battleships. One torpedo has ripped a vast hole in its port bow. Minutes earlier, a Marine band on board was standing to attention, waiting to raise the colours at 8am, Some bandsmen notice aircraft diving at the other end of Ford island and heard muffled explosions - but dismissed them as an unusually realistic exercise. Then, as they struck up 'The Star - Spangled Banner', a plane skimmed low over the harbour. It dropped a torpedo, then peeled off over 'Nevada', the rear gunner firing on the band, but only shredding the US flag. It was a 'kate'. The band only ran for cover when the last note had sounded.<br><br>3) 'Arizona' explodes like a fireworks display after its forward aummunition hold got hit. It has been struck by torpedoes, then by a bomb from a high-level 'kate'.<br>At least six torpedoes have smashed into 'West Virginia'. It sinks slowly to the harbour bottom. 'Oklahoma', hit several times, begins to kneel over. 'California' is struck twice.<br><br>4) 'Maryland' and 'Tennessee' protected from torpedoes by 'Oklahoma' and 'West Virginia', have been hit by bombs from high-level 'Kates'. Burning debris from 'Arizona' also starts fire on 'Tennessee'.<br><br>5) The eighth battleship 'Pennsylvania' is in dry dock. It survives the first strike relatively unharmed, but in the second at 8.40am, becomes the focus of attack. Bomb after bomb screams down, but its luck holds: only one hits.<br><br>6) By the end of the attack, seven of the US Pacific Fleet's eight battleships are badly damaged, but only 'Arizona' and 'Oklahoma' will never sail again. Most shore-based navy and army aircraft have been destroyed, but other damage is remarkably slight. Shore installations have little or no damage; the crusier and destroyer losses are unimportant; the submarines are unscathed. Above all, the aircraft carriers are untouched; and lived to fight another day.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>not to forget 2 ships were out on morning patrol that day. the japanese missed the oil storage places and repair docks. It could have caused massive damage and cripple the entire US navy in southeast asia but it didn't. A mistake on US part is because their schedule of operation is always the same, resting on sunday and timings for petrolling of the seas. The japanese picked the morning because most of the ships will still be in the docks. Before these incidents, the blacks were all treated as low-rank workers, like working in kitchens and working as cleaners. After a brave black(forgot wats his name) used a machine gun to take down a few japanese planes, he was awarded a medal and the blacks then are "upgraded" to be able to learn how to use artillery and became soldiers as well...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The typical conspiracy theory is that America know the Japs are coming but still they do nothing. They want a valid reason to inspire their American citizens to enter WWII using this incident. The main target was the aircraft carriers but yet on that day all were out of harbor.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, not exactly a conspiracy theory, but conspiracy theories are sometimes discoveries and a smoking guns.. note the below. Ignorance and refusal to believe anything like that could happened, is just human nature. Such stories are shoff off as conspiracy theories, but Iraq war came true.<br><br>I remember post 9/11, when people with good standing, voiced their concern about iraq un- involvement and oil affiliation, they were described as unpatriotic and tin-foil hats. France and Germany was made mockery of.<br><br>Well, declassifed information leading up to The Tokin Gulf Incident , that started the US involvement into the Vietnam War, did not happened. It was fabricated and used as a reason for war, that wasted 50,000 american lives and countless casualties to Vietnemese and US veteran alike.<br><br>Pearl Harbour is another. It appears the US baited and forced Japanese to react to sustain their economy and industries it seems, to conditions it's population to support the war, in Germany and Asia pacific. Every similar, to tactics used in Mexico conquest, that they lost a few states to US, namely florida, texas and afew others. And familar circumstances in 9/11.<br><br><blockquote>On October 7, 1940, Lieutenant Commander Arthur McCollum of the Office of Naval Intelligence submitted a memo to Navy Captains Walter Anderson and Dudley Knox (whose endorsement is included in the following scans). Captains Anderson and Knox were two of President Roosevelt's most trusted military advisors.<br><br>The memo, scanned below, detailed an 8 step plan to provoke Japan into attacking the United States. President Roosevelt, over the course of 1941, implemented all 8 of the recommendations contained in the McCollum memo. Following the eighth provocation, Japan attacked. The public was told that it was a complete surprise, an "intelligence failure", and America entered World War Two.<br><br>This memo, which proves that the government of the United States desired to lure Japan into an attack, was declassified in 1994. It took fifty years for the truth about Pearl Harbor to be revealed. </blockquote><strong>The 8 page memo</strong><br><blockquote>The memo<br><br>0p-16-F-2 ON1 7 October 1940<br>Memorandum for the Director<br><br>Subject: Estimate of the Situation in the Pacific and<br>Recommendations for Action by the United States.<br><br>1. The United States today finds herself confronted<br>by a hostile Germany and Italy in Europe and by an equally<br>hostile Japan in the Orient. Russia, the great land link between<br>these two groups of hostile powers, is at present neutral, but<br>in all probability favorably inclined towards the Axis powers,<br>and her favorable attitude towards these powers may be expected<br>to increase in direct proportion to increasing success in their<br>prosecution of the war in Europe. Germany and Italy have been<br>successful in war on the continent of Europe and all of Europe<br>is either under their military control or has been forced into<br>subservience. Only the British Empire is actively opposing by<br>war the growing world dominance of Germany and Italy and their<br>satellites.<br><br>2. The United States at first remained coolly aloof<br>from the conflict in Europe and there is considerable evidence<br>to support the view that Germany and Italy attempted by every<br>method within their power to foster a continuation of American<br>indifference to the outcome of the struggle in Europe. Paradoxically,<br>every success of German and Italian arms has led to further<br>increases in United States sympathy for and material support of<br>the British Empire, until at the present time the United States<br>government stands committed to a policy of rendering every<br>support short of war the changes rapidly increasing that<br>the United States will become a full fledged ally of the British<br>Empire in the very near future. The final failure of German<br>and Italian diplomacy to keep the United States in the role of<br>a disinterested spectator has forced them to adopt the policy of<br>developing threats to U.S. security in other spheres of the world,<br>notably by the threat of revolutions in South and Central America<br>by Axis-dominated groups and by the stimulation of Japan to further<br>aggressions and threats in the Far East in the hope that by these<br>mean the Unites States would become so confused in thought<br>and fearful of her own immediate security as to cause her to<br>become so preoccupied in purely defensive preparations as to<br>virtually preclude U.S. aid to Great Britain in any form. As a<br>result of this policy, Germany and Italy have lately concluded<br>a military alliance with Japan directed against the United States<br>If the published terms of this treaty and the pointed<br>utterances of German, Italian and Japanese leaders can be believed,<br>and there seems no ground on which to doubt either, the three<br>totalitarian powers agree to make war on the United States,<br>should she come to the assistance of England, or should she<br>attempt to forcibly interfere with Japan's aims in the Orient and,<br>[2]<br>furthermore, Germany and Italy expressly reserve the right to<br>determine whether American aid to Britain, short of war, is a<br>cause for war or not after they have succeeded in defeating<br>England. In other words, after England has been disposed of<br>her enemies will decide whether or not to immediately proceed<br>with an attack on the United States. Due to geographic conditions,<br>neither Germany nor Italy are in a position to offer any<br>material aid to Japan. Japan, on the contrary, can be of much<br>help to both Germany and Italy by threatening and possibly even<br>attacking British dominions and supply routes from Australia,<br>India and the Dutch East Indies, thus materially weakening<br>Britain's position in opposition to the Axis powers in Europe.<br>In exchange for this service, Japan receives a free hand to seize<br>all of Asia that she can find it possible to grab, with the<br>added promise that Germany and Italy will do all in their power<br>to keep U.S. attention so attracted as to prevent the United<br>States from taking positive aggressive action against Japan.<br>Here again we have another example of the Axis-Japanese<br>diplomacy which is aimed at keeping American power immobilized,<br>and by threats and alarms to so confuse American thought as to<br>preclude prompt decisive action by the United States in either<br>sphere of action. It cannot be emphasized to strongly that<br>the last thing desired by either the Axis powers in Europe<br>or by Japan in the Far East is prompt, warlike action by the<br>United States in either theatre of operations.<br><br>3. An examination of the situation in Europe leads<br>to the conclusion that there is little that we can do now,<br>immediately to help Britain that is not already being done.<br>We have no trained army to send to the assistance of England,<br>nor will we have for at least a year. We are now trying to<br>increase the flow of materials to England and to bolster the<br>defense of England in every practicable way and this aid will<br>undoubtedly be increased. On the other hand, there is little<br>that Germany or Italy can do against us as long as England<br>continues in the war and her navy maintains control of the<br>Atlantic. The one danger to our position lies in the possible<br>early defeat of the British Empire with the British Fleet falling<br>intact into the hands of the Axis powers. The possibility of<br>such an event occurring would be materially lessened were we<br>actually allied in war with the British or at the very least<br>were taking active measures to relieve the pressure on Britain<br>in other spheres of action. To sum up: the threat to our security<br>in the Atlantic remains small so long as the British Fleet<br>remains dominant in that ocean and friendly to the United States.<br><br>4. In the Pacific, Japan by virtue of her alliance<br>with Germany and Italy is a definite threat to the security<br>of the British Empire and once the British Empire is gone the<br>power of Japan-Germany and Italy is to be directed against the<br>United States. A powerful land attack by Germany and Italy<br>through the Balkans and North Africa against the Suez Canal<br>with a Japanese threat or attack on Singapore would have very<br>serious results for the British Empire. Could Japan be diverted<br>or neutralized, the fruits of a successful attack on the Suez<br>Canal could not be as far reaching and beneficial to the Axis<br>powers as if such a success was also accompanied by the virtual<br>elimination of British sea power from the Indian Ocean, thus<br>[3]<br>opening up a European supply route for Japan and a sea route for<br>Eastern raw materials to reach Germany and Italy, Japan must be<br>diverted if the British and American ( ) blockade of Europe<br>and possibly Japan (?) is to remain even partially in effect.<br><br>5. While as pointed out in Paragraph (3) there is<br>little that the United States can do to immediately retrieve<br>the situation in Europe, the United States is able to effectively<br>nullify Japanese aggressive action, and do it without lessening<br>U.S. material assistance to Great Britain.<br><br>6. An examination of Japan's present position as<br>opposed to the United States reveals a situation as follows:<br><br>Advantages Disadvantages<br><br>1. Geographically strong position 1. A million and a half men<br>of Japanese Islands. engaged in an exhausting war<br>on the Asiatic Continent.<br><br>2. A highly centralized strong 2. Domestic economy and food<br>capable government. supply severely straightened.<br><br>3. Rigid control of economy on 3. A serious lack of sources of<br>a war basis. raw materials for war. Notably oil, iron and cotton.<br><br>4. A people inured to hardship 4. Totally cut off from supplies<br>and war. from Europe.<br><br>5. A powerful army. 5. Dependent upon distant overseas<br>routes for essential supplies.<br><br>6. A skillful navy about 2/3 6. Incapable of increasing<br>the strength of the U.S. Navy. manufacture and supply of war<br>materials without free access to U.S. or European markets.<br><br>7. Some stocks of raw materials. 7. Major cities and industrial<br>centers extremely vulnerable to air attack.<br><br>8. Weather until April rendering direct sea operations in the<br>vicinity of Japan difficult.<br><br>7. In the Pacific the United States possesses a very strong<br>defensive position and a navy and naval air force at present<br>in that ocean capable of long distance offensive operation. There<br>are certain other factors which at the present time are strongly<br>in our favor, viz:<br><br>A. Philippine Islands still held by the United States.<br>B. Friendly and possibly allied government in control of the Dutch East Indies.<br>C. British still hold Hong Kong and Singapore and are favorable to us.<br>D. Important Chinese armies are still in the field in China against Japan.<br>E. A small U.S. Naval Force capable of seriously threatening Japan's southern supply routes<br><br>[4] already in the theatre of operations.<br><br>F. A considerable Dutch naval force is in the Orient that would be of value if allied to U.S.<br><br>8. A consideration of the foregoing leads to the conclusion that prompt aggressive naval action against Japan by the United States would render Japan incapable of affording any help to Germany and Italy in their attack on England and that Japan itself would be faced with a situation in which her navy could be forced to fight on most unfavorable terms or accept<br>fairly early collapse of the country through the force of blockade.<br>A prompt and early declaration of war after entering into suitable<br>arrangements with England and Holland, would be most effective<br>in bringing about the early collapse of Japan and thus eliminating<br>our enemy in the pacific before Germany and Italy could strike<br>at us effectively. Furthermore, elimination of Japan must surely<br>strengthen Britain's position against Germany and Italy and, in<br>addition, such action would increase the confidence and support<br>of all nations who tend to be friendly towards us.<br><br>9. It is not believed that in the present state of<br>political opinion the United States government is capable of<br>declaring war against Japan without more ado; and it is barely<br>possible that vigorous action on our part might lead the<br>Japanese to modify their attitude. Therefore, the following<br>course of action is suggested:<br><br>A. Make an arrangement with Britain for the use of<br>British bases in the Pacific, particularly Singapore.<br><br>B. Make an arrangement with Holland for the use of<br>base facilities and acquisition of supplies<br>in the Dutch East Indies.<br><br>C. Give all possible aid to the Chinese government of Chiang-Kai-Shek.<br><br>D. Send a division of long range heavy cruisers to the Orient, Philippines, or Singapore.<br><br>E. Send two divisions of submarines to the Orient.<br><br>F. Keep the main strength of the U.S. fleet now in the Pacific in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands.<br><br>G. Insist that the Dutch refuse to grant Japanese<br>demands for undue economic concessions, particularly oil.<br><br>H. Completely embargo all U.S. trade with Japan, in collaboration with a similar embargo imposed by the British Empire.<br><br>10. If by these means Japan could be led to commit an overt act of war, so much the better. At all events we must be fully prepared to accept the threat of war.<br><br>A. H. McCollum<br>CC-0p-16<br>0p-16-F<br>File<br>[5]<br>0p-16-F-2 ON1 7 October 1940<br><br>Summary<br>1. The United States is faced by a hostile combination of<br>powers in both the Atlantic and Pacific.<br><br>2. British naval control of the Atlantic prevents hostile<br>action against the United States in this area.<br><br>3. Japan's growing hostility presents an attempt to open sea<br>communications between Japan and the Mediterranean by an<br>attack on the British lines of communication in the<br>Indian Ocean.<br><br>4. Japan must be diverted if British opposition in Europe is<br>to remain effective.<br><br>5. The United States naval forces now in the Pacific are<br>capable of so containing and harassing Japan as to nullify<br>her assistance to Germany and Italy.<br><br>6. It is to the interest of the United States to eliminate<br>Japan's threat in the Pacific at the earliest opportunity<br>by taking prompt and aggressive action against Japan.<br><br>7. In the absence of United States ability to take the<br>political offensive, additional naval force should be<br>sent to the orient and agreements entered into with Holland<br>and England that would serve as an effective check against<br>Japanese encroachments in South-eastern Asia.<br>[6]<br>Comment by Captain Knox<br><br>It is unquestionably to out general interest<br>that Britain be not licked - just now she has a stalemate<br>and probably cant do better. We ought to make it certain<br>that she at least gets a stalemate. For this she will probably<br>need from us substantial further destroyers and air reinforcements<br>to England. We should not precipitate anything in the<br>Orient that should hamper our ability to do this - so long as<br>probability continues.<br><br>If England remains stable, Japan will be cautious<br>in the Orient. Hence our assistance to England in the Atlantic<br>is also protection to her and us in the Orient.<br><br>However, I concur in your courses of action<br>we must be ready on both sides and probably strong enough<br>to care for both.<br>D.W.K.<br>Re your #6: - no reason for battleships not<br>visiting west coast in bunches.<br></blockquote></div>
