            <div class='col-md body'>Tell you my very strange dreams &amp; things happened later:<br><br>1.  Dream of I following a triger in a deep forest. The "Tiger" was walking in front &amp; I was just following behind for a long period. I woke up. Next day kanna ToTo small amount.<br><br>2.  Dream of I urinating into a pool of shits in a shitting hole. The more I urine the more shit it's comming out of the shit hole. The day after, I was offered a highly paid contract job.<br><br>3.  Dream of a "Empty Golden Coffin". It just moved towards me. Then rotated counter clock-wise. The cover float open. I peak inside. It was empty. Then wake up. Nothing unusal happen later.<br><br>4. Dream of... of maybe not dream it's actual happenings. I was talking to a ghost. He was asking me to pass a massage to his relatives. I told him If I was going to do that, "your" relative is going to think I am mad or it's a con-man. He insisted I help him. I rejected him a few times. Worst is.... my girlfriend sleeping beside me heard all the words I spoken clearly. She wakes me up. I told her I was dreaming. Then when back to sleep. This man came again to talk about passing massage again. Again I rejected. My girlfriend wakes me again afraid something is happening to me. I told her I am dreaming I was talking to someone. Same I went back to sleep the third time again same man. Again I reject. This time "he" goes away. My girlfriend stay up all night dare not sleep because she heard all my words, she feels like another person is in the room that I am talking to. Nothing happened later.<br><br>5.  Dream of a old lady came to me. Telling me, "I will take you to a place in hell. To feel &amp; hear what it's like there. But you cannot open your eyes to see them because if you do so, you will be absorded into that space. You must hold my hands tight &amp; ignore all other people around you. If you follow them you will be there forever." She hold my hands &amp; we went. I heard people crying from pain, begging people or the officials there. I smell burning. Also felt many hands trying to take hold on my hands. I swept their hands off. The old lady hold my hands very tight. It was about 30mins. That area is pretty warm. Meaning there is fire or heat. Those crys in pain is very terrible. Then I felt I was walking over a wooden bridge. Then the old lady told me, "I am bringing you back up." Then after a while I wake up. Nothing happened later.<br><br></div>
