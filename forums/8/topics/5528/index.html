            <div class='col-md body'>I was just wondering if there was any difference in the way girls et guys study after reading one of the postings.<br>Since this is the exam period, figured it would be a good time to ask.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What's the difference? Girls tend to be more focused than guys and seems more gan jiong when exams are really near. Guys on the other hand are restless and fidgit more trying to fing a good posture to study(like me lah!). No matter how one studies, its the results that matters.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A three per sex defination of how guys and gals study for their exam<br><br>Female<br>------<br><br>The good: Always on focus of whats happening in classes and knows how to study smart. Notes and worksheets are always in place properly when needed to refer to them. When the exam periods draws closer, they will either spend their time in school doing revision after revision on new questions found from external sources of study and they will be the ones that visit the teacher the most to answer their queries. Forms the most organized study groups(quiet, consistant and helpful with each other)<br>By this time they probably had finished a few "Ten year series" or anything like that.<br><br>The bad: Wants to study and improvise and study badly but lacks the determination to do so, claims to be studying at home while infact they are away partying somewhere out there. Its true, i have a few of my younger friends in secondary school who requested help from me in their revisions and disappears keeping me waiting for their arrival. I hope its just a small minority of them.<br><br>The ugly: Well you get the idea, doesn't care at all although you tried to convince them its for their own good to study but nothing goes in their head.<br><br>Male<br>----<br><br>The good: Notes are organized but almost never in good condition, they will be at home most of the time doing their studying.<br><br>The bad: Memorizes a few answers from certain subjects and tries to show them off to their friends, constantly asking people how much they have progressed in their studies. They are the major distraction factor, they form study groups and chatter all the time, decides to go off somewhere to have fun soon after they seat down to study.<br><br>The ugly: 'Huh? Exam? Last friday??'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO, I will have tend to agree that girls work harder. Guys are more haphazard. But that is a general and sweeping statements, like everything that is normally said here(yup, I just did it again!) But ultimately, it does not matter, does it now? All I know is that me and some guy friends, once outta NS, we have that drive to perform better for the exams.. and I have grades to prove them... but that is not needed here or now. But apparently, (here comes another sweeping statements) guys who are lazy, stay lazy, and guys do seem to perform better in more ways than one, at least it seems in the university... I guess NS kick some shit into our brain.<br>My 2 cents worth.<br><br>The gas that comes from a certain hole</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this reminds me of something...<br><br>i know this person (a girl) who doesn't like what she is studying, but can really study REALLY hard. she can memorise textbooks by the chunk, believing the memorising and practicing past year series is the way to go to exams. doesn't like it, but can go way of their way for something they don't like. thinks that anything that doesn't contributes to her grades is totally irrelevant and is a total waste of time...<br><br>this is quite different from my way of studying...<br>quite the opposite, i can study things purely out of interest. a unrelated subject, if i find sufficient interest in it, i can goto the library and read up books on the subject, spent lotsa time doing this, and often at the expense of my tutorials.<br>iam quite an interest-driven person. if i dun like a particular subject/module, that's it. likely it's going to a not-so-nice grade. cannot really force myself to study something i dun like.<br><br>kinda admire these ppl, who can go against their liking and force themselves to do things. i dun have that kind of determination. incidentally, i seem to find this phenomem more predominate in girls than guys.<br><br>is this just a concidence?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah! I agree that guys tend to be more interest driven when it comes to learning. I myself can't imagine myself studying business or economics. I'll be bored to death.<br><br>Gals tend to concentrate more on the current. In other words, their main aim is to get the grades for exams coz' with them, jobs will come looking for you.<br><br>But from a guy's point of view, I study not for the grades, but how I can apply what I've learnt in a future job which I've been eyeing for so long. My target is a satisfying job, not the grades. Of course, if I do well, better still!<br><br>But of course, there are minorities from the opposite sex in each category, i won't argue with that.<br><br>Correct me if i'm wrong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
