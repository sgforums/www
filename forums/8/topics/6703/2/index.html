            <div class='col-md body'>Atti..Bangkok is a nice place. A lot of temples in and around the city areas. When you are there..try to find time to visit the Grand Palace (Take you almost 2 to 3 hours to cover the whole place). It is very quiet and still..you could hears the sound of the wind-chimes. And try to take boat ride along the Chao Phraya river...and stop by the Wat Arun (Temple of Dawn)at the side of the river for a visit. There is also the four-face Buddha (Patpom) situated at the junction of a busy street..with the Bangkok Transit System (BTS) crossing over it. To get cheap buys from the city..you could go to Mah Boon Krong..1 station away from the Central station...or you could drop by Chinatown..or the weekend market. For the upmarket products..go to World Trade Centre or Siam Centre. I don't want to go further as it will spoilt your funs in exploring this City yourself. The minus factors are that the weather is very hot..the roads are dusty and congested.<br><br>Chiangmai..I have never been there. Maybe you could provide me with a field report on that place when you come back.<br><br>Enjoy your trip!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Littleman, Holland is definitely a nice place, hahaha, but it is also one of the notorious places whereby sex and weed is legalised too...... you can get to visit those sex museums (I have never heard of it elsewhere) and smoke grass without fearing the police giving u problems. Of course, I don't do all that lah....hehehe.....<br>And I just came back from trip round Scotland, and I must say the place is BEAUTIFUL......u must know some scots though, and watch the movie Brave Heart and Rob Roy, to really appreciate the history of Scotland (maybe not so much of Rob Roy, but no harm watching). Edinburgh is beautiful, just exploring the castle will take you one day, and lots of other stuff to do there, worth every pounds and pences there. But I wouldn't recommend Glasgow though, nothing much really extraordinary if you are on a tight budget. It is just like your regular London streets with lots of shops cramped side by side.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Atti..I just post the reply from the other thread to here. It is appropriate.<br><br>Ya!..there is a Dreamworld in Bangkok. I dun know about the other Dreamworld you are referring to. If you flip through the classified adv. for Holiday..you can see it is being included for the 5 days tour of Bangkok and Pattaya. But that will be for the last day..when you are on your way back from Pattaya to Bangkok. There is a man-made snow playground inside there..where you can slide down the snow covered slope.<br><br>For your 1 to 1.5k  budget..I think New Zealand is out. You will never enjoy it thoroughly. Why not choose a Bangkok and Hong Kong package. Stay 2 days in Bangkok and 3 days in Hong Kong. For exchange rates of 21 times for Thai Baht and 4 times of Hong Kong dollars..it is values for money. Anyway..Hong Kong is almost similar to Singapore..you can choose to tour the place yourself without a guide.<br><br>Think about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Atti..5 places of interests in Bangkok? Hmmm..one man's meat is another's poison.<br><br>I just give you what I thought as interesting.. you decide for yourself..okie?<br><br>Four-face God(Buddha). Try to pay a visit to the god. It is located at a busy junction of the city. The Bangkok Transit System runs across it.. overhead. You can buy all the necessary items for praying to the god from the stalls inside the compound. You can also get the dancers in Thai traditional dance costumes to dance for you while you pray (720 bahts for 8 dancers..maximum). I was told the best time to do it is after 8pm (Singapore Time 9pm).  Behind the compound is the Sogo Department Store. Opposite it.. is the World Trade Centre..where you can buy your upmarket products cheaply at the Zen Department Store..or Isetan. Across the road..directly is Planet Hollywood. Walk 10 minutes..you will reach Siam Centre. Another upmarket shopping centre..but a bit expensive than the rest I just mentioned. Walk another 15 minutes or you can take the train from the station(Central) to  another..will be Mah Boon Krong shopping complex. Here you can find bargains of all kinds.<br><br>Dreamworld. Yes..a definite. Beside many amusement park items..like Man-made snow slope.. water-slide(prepared to get yourself wet..and I meant very wet)...roller-coaster..etc..there are also the Thai girls..especially those girls manning the booths...hahaha. Mind you..they are very beautiful and friendly. The problem is few can speak English.<br><br>River Boat Ride along the Chao Praya river..on a long bow boat. They will bring you to the villagers who lived along the side of the river. Watch some of them sell their goods on their riverboats. Stop by the "San Poh Kong" temple..where you can feed the fishes with breads sold by the boatman. There is a saying that when you feed a fish that is all white..luck will fall on you..heehee..it is up to you to believe. Stop at the Wat Arun (temple of Dawn) to admire the ancient Thais workman's splendour. The last time I was there..it was under restoration. You could get a blessing from the Chief Monk (quite old) in there. Outside the temple..you could get your photo taken with one or two very young girl(12 year-old)in traditional Thai costume.<br><br>Grand Palace. Yes..like I mentioned earlier...it will take you 2 to 3 hours to cover the whole of the Palace. Before you enter the Palace..you must be in proper attires. Guy must be in long pant and wearing shoes. Girl must be wearing a sleeve blouse..no bare-back or the likes. The skirt must cover their knees. Slippers or sandals are not allowed. If you are not properly dress..you are requested to go to the main office to get yourself dress-up. They have clothing there for you to change..with a deposit(refundable on return). Inside the Grand Palace..there are many things to see(I let you explore it yourself)...one of them is the Jade Buddha. The face of the Buddha is a very big Jade. You are not allow to take picture of it..like in some other places of the Palace too. I managed to captured it with my video cam from outside the temple by zooming it to 12x.<br><br>Silom and Patpong. Silom is a stretch of road where you can find "pasar malam" everynights except on Wednesday. It is where you can find stalls selling cheap Thai's products like T-shirts..soap carving etc etc. Patpong is connected to Silom. It is a sleazy place..with alot of "Lau Wai"..foreigners (westerners) hanging there. It is a road..like Bugis..where you can get faked Rolexes (with 3..4 or 5 matchsticks) and other imitation branded goods. The place is full of Agogo Bars..the type where you see girls dancing on stage wearing very little clothings. Be careful..most of those waitresses and dancers are Aids infected. If you are there for the experience..that is alright. Don't let it be a hindrance to your vacation...hahaha.<br><br>Okie..that's 5 already. The Thai's Tom Yam soup and the rice are just..superb! The seafood cheap and fresh. Just a reminder...never..never patronise the stallholders along the road side. They are very dirty. Like I said before...the roads are dusty and congested. So you can imagined the amount of carbon monoxide and dirts spewed out from the motor vehicles passing by them.<br><br>That's it...and don't forget that the weather there is very hot.<br><br>Bye!</div>
