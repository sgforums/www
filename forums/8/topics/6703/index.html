            <div class='col-md body'>Atti, here's my suggestion :<br><br>First of all, backpacking does not mean you need lots of leg power. Basically as a backpacker, you are just like a nomad, you go where you like and when you like it, in short, the ultimate "free and easy".<br><br>[China]<br>I toured 13 provinces of china and 19 cities in 3 months and only spent $3000 inclusive of airfares.<br>China is cheap and good. Places like Tibet, Dunhuang, Huang Shan, Hua Shan, Beijing, Xi'an, Luoyang, Xinjiang etc are really worth touring.<br>Please dun think that you should go China only when you old and haggard.<br><br>[Hawaii]<br>Aloha ! I spent 2 weeks there in 1998. Spent about $3000 inclusive of airfare. But i stayed in 3 star and above hotels. Hence if you stay in cheaper ones, it will be more affordable.<br>The Waikiki Beach is a perfect place to relax, Sunset at Kailua Kona is the best I have ever seen. Go to The Big Island to watch live volcano spurting boiling lava (Puu Oo' Vent)at night or walk into the crater of the volcano itself at the Volcano National Park, feel the power of nature right at the heart of the volcano, warning : IT'S AWESOME<br>Or go to Maui to enjoy the moon-like landscape -- you'll never forget. Until now, Hawaii is still the best place to relax for me. Mahalo !<br><br>[Spain]<br>Hola ! In Europe spain is still considered cheap but dangerous (lots of pickpockets) Go to Barcelona to enjoy the wierd-looking but beautiful architecture designed by the famous Spanish Architect, Antoni Gaudi. Don't miss, please please please don't miss the Sagrada de Familia. Take at look at the Olympic Stadium and try the famous Pun of Spain. Take a train to Madrid, the capital of Spain, to enjoy the spanish bull-fighting.<br>Or to Monserrat, the place where images of the Virgin Mary was witnessed.<br><br>[Scotland]<br>Scotland is the home of William Wallace, you'll know him if you'd watched Brave Heart. Go the Stirling where his battle with the English was won at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. Or just stay at Edinburgh, climb the Calton Hill or Archer's Foot during sunset to view the whole of Edinburgh in sunset, dun forget to bring your camera !! Edinburgh itself is already worth a few days and once there, you won't want to leave ! If you go during New Year, laggi best, join in the World Biggest Street Party, Hogmany, on Princes Street, Edinburgh. Or make a trip up to Glasgow and enjoy the real Scottish city. Up North a bit, you'll reach the Highland. See the numerous breathtaking Loches and Glens. So pure and untouched. Spend some time at Glencoe to get yourself lost in the beauty of nature, maybe do some pony-riding. Or go further north to Loch Ness, perhaps you can see a Monster in the Loch. There are over 2000 castles in Scotland, choose carefully which to go.<br><br>Hope this helps, if you need more info about these countries or other countries, i'll be most willing to help.<br><br>Cheers !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;Hey littleman, think your name suggest otherwise ......<br><br>i am little, physically, hehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>but me not the oldest around, Colette and Prodigal older i think.<br><br>&gt;&gt;well i have considered hawaii b4...... but is 2 weeks a little bit too long to stay there? cos i think except the beach there, not much other things to see.<br><br>You are VERY wrong. Hawaii consists of 7 Islands (the 8th one is emerging due to volcanic activities) Except one of the 7 islands which is privately owned (YES ! privately owned!), all other 6 islands have their own places of interest. But the 3 most worth visiting ones are Oahu (Honolulu and Waikiki itself), The Big Island (also called Hawaii Island) and Maui.<br><br>On Oahu itself, yes nothing much besides Waikiki Beach and the blow-hole near Diamond Head. But The Big Island is different, the National Volcano Park itself will take you 2 to 3 days ! The park is very huge and it is really fun to walk in the park cos it is made up of solidified lava (black) and you can still see steam coming out from the ground, red hot lava pouring into the sea ... see the eruption at night !!! Really beautiful !!! Maui is worth another 3 days.<br><br>&gt;&gt;what's the procedure or anything special to do with F&amp;E tour or not?<br><br>There are many F&amp;E "packages" in the papers nowadays. Wat the tour agencies do is, they will book the hotels and air ticket for you. Sometimes they may have simple activities like bring u to certain places of interest but for most of the time you are on your own. If you dun like these "pre-planned" F&amp;E packages, you can go down to any agency and tell them your plan and see if they can try to book the hotels you wanted in the country you selected. (Note : they don't book Youth Hostels and cheap skate hotels) Hence basically, you are just making use of the agency to book accomodation and airfare. Note : they do earn commission from there.<br>When I just started backpacking, i do that just to play safe. After some experience, I now do everything myself, booking of accomodation and airfare etc.<br><br>But be very careful, some agencies cock up one, when you reach that country then they tell you they cannot book the hotel you wanted ! It happened to me !! We almost went to court becos of that. So my advice is, dun go to this agency .... Anand*<br><br>&gt;&gt;hmmmm.......china so cheap? only 3k in 3 mnths? think can consider .......<br><br>But dun expect to stay in 3 star hotels and eat in restaurants. That time I stayed in youth hostels and eat by the road (but the food damn nice !)<br><br>5 yuan to 1 sing dollar. The noodle only cost 1.50 to 2.00 Yuan (30 to 40 cents!!)<br><br>&gt;&gt;what abt other countries like switzerland and japan? any infor on them? thanks .......<br><br>Switzerland is an expensive place. One of the most expensive in Europe in fact. If you are going in Dec, it will be winter, very cold leh, your baggage will also be heavy cos of all the thick clothings. Unless you want to go ski lah, then mai tu liao. Remember to buy the Switzerland chocs.<br><br>Japan ... never been there. Cannot comment. But it is not too easy to travel there i heard cos nobody understands english ! Not backpacker friendly lah, that's what holds me back to travelling there.<br><br>&gt;&gt;so as a general conclusion.....do u think 2k is a too little for a tour to NZ?<br><br>2K for a week ... it all depends how you spend there, eat wat and sleep where. It might JUST be enough. But if you wanna rent a jeep to increase mobility ... quite difficult lah, the airfare how much liao ? Unless you can get some lobang for airfare lah. Like I always do ... find those pple with Mileage ... they may be willing to sell you at a low price.<br>But NZ and Australia should be nice in Dec, spring - summer season right ??<br>I personally think 1 week is not enuff lah ... dunno you lah, but 1 week very rush leh. The country very big leh, move from one place to another place takes a lot of time, not like singapore, Changi to Jurong less than an hour.<br><br>Wherever you plan to go, please do plan your trip before departing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FireIce,<br><br>yes, of course i am willing to help  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>3K for 1 month ? Enuff.<br><br>China is a BIG country. When I travel from Shanghai (east) to Dunhuang (west), the journey is already longer than across the whole of Europe. So you may find yourself spending a lot of time getting from one place to another if you do not plan your route properly.<br><br>I will advice you spend time in Yunnan. IN Yunnan, you can visit these places :<br><br>Dali (3 days)<br>Lijiang (3 days)<br>Xing Ping (2 days)<br>Xishuang Banna (3 days)<br>Zhongdian (2 days)<br>Kunming (3 days)<br><br>After that take a plane to Chengdu (Sichuan) and coach. In Sichuan, go see<br><br>Dafo<br>Er-mei Shan<br>Panda bear ! (they come from Sichuan)<br>Jiu Zai Gou<br><br>Other places which I think are worth visiting are :<br><br>[Dunhuang]<br>Go see Mo Gao Ku and the desert (yes ! desert ! which is part of the Silk Route) Enjoy the camel riding  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[Xinjiang]<br>a place full of muslims, pple are not the Han Chinese, very interesting place. Go see Tian Shan.<br><br>[Xiahe]<br>Gansu Province, this place not many pple know, only the ang mohs go, but the Labrang Monastry is worth a visit, it is one of the 3 most important Lama Monastry outside Tibet. If you go there, remember to see the grassland too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[Inner Mongolia]<br>but please, go to the REAL grassland, not the touristy ones.<br>Enjoy the pony-riding in the wide grassland  and the sunrise !!<br><br>[Louyang]<br>See the first temple in the whole of china, Bai Ma Si, the place where Tang San Zang lived. Go see Song San Shaolin Temple, the Tower Graveyard (Ta Lin) is VERY nice.<br><br>[Xi'an]<br>Terracota Army (Bing Ma Yong) Get a guide to explain to you. That time, i met a student who studied Terracotta Army in her university and she wanted to brush up her english hence she gave me a free 3 hours guide  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>There are a lot more places lah, cannot go into everyone here, you decide where you wanna go then i focus down ok ?<br><br>People are frenly ? Yup, generally. But the northern chinese are well-known for being violent, they dun hesitate to fight with you so be careful.<br><br>Backpacking in China is not very easy too. You must be able to tolerate the low hygiene and long hours of travelling. My longest journey was a 58 hours train-cum-coach ride. Dun expect the train to be air-coned and coaches to be smooth rides.<br><br>Generally, i think you should go to Yunnan, air tickets to Kunming is very cheap nowadays. 300 - 500 only and it is still the province i love most. Will go again  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
