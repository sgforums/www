            <div class='col-md body'>Abt neglecting your friends. There are 2 kind of senario here.<br><br>1st senario- Time management: During a week after deducting from work, studies, sleep, housework....etc. U have abt... let say, 6 hrs left of free time left. Before u attached, u will normally spent most of the time wif your friends. however, when u r attached, u have to split ye time between ye pals and ye bf/gf. So the solution is either to gave up some other activities to make space or intro ye gf/bf to ye pals so that u can go out wif both together.<br><br>2nd Senario, BF/GF Control: Here, the bf/gf dun like it when u spent time wif your friends, thinking that they are "bad influence" or they dun wan u to go out wif friends of the opposite sex. It is very common in guys, they dun like their gf pals, esp those who go pubbing often or who are very happening. I have seen several cases like this.<br><br>There might be more reasons. But these are wat i can come up wif now at this wee hrs. Gotta go zzz soon, got morning class later. Will post again if is think of other senarios. Hope it helps.<br><br>Jerrick<br>"Brain cells come and go but fat cells live forever."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>John &gt; very true.. at least you still have your friends when your gf leaves : )<br><br>but how in the world do you strike a balance ? with all the work and stuff . my ex and i have only weekends for each other.<br><br>the funny thing is that girlfriends dun really like to go out with your friends( not trying to make a sweeping statement. Maybe they feel awkward or perhaps they just want to spend the time along with you.. and not in the company of your friends.<br><br>I dun think there can be a solution to this..<br>except that she's gotta be really understanding about it... which is kinda hard.. going out with your friends might just leave her to think that friends are more important than her ( which is quite true : ) )<br><br>so what say the rest ?<br><br></div>
