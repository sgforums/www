            <div class='col-md body'>Here's a tip for all of you'll who are now doing your O levels..<br><br>STUDY HARD<br><br>then get into JC<br><br>then STUDY HARD<br><br>then go overseas like me.<br><br>WHY? -Because after I graduate, then I serve, 90% chance you will become officer. What benefits: 1) Higher pay 2) The lease on your life the government have is only until 40. Those army guys all have to go back reservist up till 50 yrs old. Imagine.. you're fat, and old.. how to tahan army life again??<br><br>Now young, 20yrs old, easy for you to say that army training is easy.. wait till you're 50 yrs old, then get called for reservist.. no matter what sure fail one... then u really kenna man ...<br><br>Of course if you go overseas got its benefits and pitfalls lah.. grad liao, you want migrate then migrate lo.. but you'll lose your citizenship which isn't worth it la duh.. then if u go good unis, you not only enhance your job prospects, but options are open internationally.. of course if you go to shit unis (be it uk, us,canada or aus) ... then u're fucked up wherever u end up ... e.g. university of reading (uk).. thats why i say study hard..<br><br>Anyway thats what i say la .. u wan u can do the other way like some me friends .. do NS first.. then after NS finish le then go overseas study, then after that migrate there.. get to keep your citizenship tooo ..... but then you'll have to suffer army @ 17 &amp; 18 .. w'end cannot chiong with ur platoon mates.. then yea lo .. damn sian la ... and you get lower pay as well ..</div>

Problems occur throughout our lives not only NS...you can say NS prepares you for the REAL WORLD. No shit. If you disagree on this point i can safely say you are not even worth the 450 dollars.
