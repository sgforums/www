I heard of the army doing all the ISO certification which on paper is good for the army. But look at the dunking incident. Shouldn't an exercise that concerns life and death be properly monitored?? Where is the leadership in monitoring this? Are all the ISO for show only?<br><br>Yes, as i had said before, we are doing our best to leave <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

You are concerned about both the physical place and the relations. On the other hand, I am concerned about both lives and relations. I much prefer my friends and relatives to live than to waste their life defending physical properties not owned by us. Basically, I followed the attitude of "if i am not a major share-holder of a company, why should I work so hard?".<br><br>Like I said in my other posts, talk to the taxi drivers, ask them how life is.
