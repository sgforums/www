On the first hint of war, we will sell our flat, even for $20 K is ok. Then use all the money to get out ASAP! The choice is of course ours. You and your family can stay and protect the properties of the rich. Perhaps they will reward you with some $1 medals or something.<br><br>To me, I prefer to want my brother to live.<br><br>You might advocate that our fore fathers, including mine and yours have spent blood and sweat building Singapore. And thus the act of running away can be counted as disloyalty to the forefathers. I don;t think so. I think my ancestors will rather us protecting the blood line than wasting our lives. If our forefathers are really so loyal, they wouldn't "run away" from poverty in their old homeland to singapore. They should have stayed on to support their old homeland!<br><br></div>
