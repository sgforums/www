            <div class='col-md body'>It makes me sad to see so many christians lining up to take a bash at other religions, above all Buddhism. Many a time, these people are people who blindly follow the bible and base their conclusions upon hearsay or from the mouths of people who are mistaken themselves about the truth of Life. We never get a fair hearing.<br>These people are just like people who have based their judgements that love is a brainwashing event, that love 'unfairly' tries to raise itself as the highest emotion, baesd on hearsay from the mouths of people who don't know what love is themselves, and who have never really fallen in love themselves. and they would say that love is a fallacy, that it ain't real, that its just a perfectly created ideology.<br>that's the way they are talking abt other religions here. and it wouldn't be a fair court hearing in today's context even.<br>(hmm.. ever wondered why court trials are known as 'hearings'? it's to give the case at hand , a hearing, the judge is not interested in talking and talking, but abt listening to the case.) and these people are only interested in talking and talking and they never really sit down and listen without interrrupting.<br>and then there are those here who ask for proof, for this and that. question, how do we see material proof for love? but we know it exists right? how do we see that love exists? by marriages? what abt the skyrocketing divorce rates then? love cannot exist, right? no! it does, the father who gave his life to save his drowning child, only to drown himself. the spouse who went through the risky transplant op to save his dying wife. love exists. we dont need proof. we know it does. its part and parcel of life!<br>and it needs no god to give us love! just look at the world around you. it may be messed up now cos of the fiddling that we've done to it, but its initial design was perfect! look at the hydroglogical cycle, that renews and is meant to run forever! there has to be a Designer! the dozens of muscles that click and work together to help u dribble a ball in soccer, did that happen by accident? no, a Designer did that! and that Designer, is Nature.<br>all that i ask, is of these people, to take some time out, to sit down with some friends from other religions, not to quarrel, but to peacefully listen to them tell you why they are Buddhists, Muslims or Taoists.<br>All the religions' gods' love, power and faithfulness are not dependent on the performance of His followers.<br>Sure there are good and bad followers.<br>that is the same with any family (with good and bad children), but that doesn't make the Father any less loving, and any less real.<br>Most people hate Christians. But one day, I met Direction. and experienced Him for myself. And i found that some christians are really stubborn people who refuses to believe in religious harmony, and their aim is to put down other religions. take some time out to listen to some sgforumites tell you why they hate christians. and i pray that you will find the same too, in your lifetime.</div>
