            <div class='col-md body'>This might just be the right way to teach your kids..<br><br>Dr. Arun Gandhi, grandson of Mahatma Gandhi and founder of the M.K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence, in his June 9 lecture at the University of Puerto Rico, shared the following story as an example of nonviolence in parenting:<br><br>"I was 16 years old and living with my parents at the institute my grandfather had founded 18 miles outside of Durban, South Africa, in the middle of the sugar plantations.<br><br>We were deep in the country and had no neighbors, so my two sisters and I would always look forward to going to town to visit friends or go to the movies.<br><br>One day, my father asked me to drive him to town for an all day<br>conference, and I jumped at the chance.<br><br>"Since I was going to town, my mother gave me a list of groceries she needed and since I had all day in town, my father ask me to take care of several pending chores, such as getting the car serviced.<br><br>When I dropped my father off that morning, he said, 'I will meet you here at 5:00 p.m., and we will go home together.'<br><br>"After hurriedly completing my chores, I went straight to the nearest movie theatre. I got so engrossed in a John Wayne double-feature that I forgot the time. It was 5:30 before I remembered. By the time I ran to the garage and got the car and hurried to where my father was waiting for me, it was almost 6:00.<br><br>"He anxiously asked me, 'Why were you late?' I was so ashamed of<br>telling him I was watching a John Wayne western movie that I said,<br>'The car wasn't ready, so I had to wait,' not realizing that he had already called the garage.<br><br>"When he caught me in the lie, he said: 'There's something wrong in the<br>way I brought you up that didn't give you the confidence to tell me the<br>truth. In order to figure out where I went wrong with you, I'm going to walk home 18 miles and think about it.'<br><br>"So, dressed in his suit and dress shoes, he began to walk home in the<br>dark on mostly unpaved, unlit roads. I couldn't leave him, so for five-and-a-half hours I drove behind him, watching my father go through<br>this agony for a stupid lie that I uttered. I decided then and there that I was never going to lie again.<br><br>"I often think about that episode and wonder, if he had punished me the<br>way we punish our children, whether I would have learned a lesson at all.<br>I don't think so.<br><br>I would have suffered the punishment and gone on doing the same thing.<br><br>But this single nonviolent action was so powerful that it is still as if it happened yesterday.<br><br>That is the power of nonviolence."<br><br>------------------<br>insanity..<br>loves io..<br>eternity..</div>
