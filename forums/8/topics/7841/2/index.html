            <div class='col-md body'>Well, at this era, quite interesting to see all the replies given by the guys. And the last reply was quite interesting too. Guys think that their wives must remain virgins. But what about the ladies?? Do you think your husbands must remain virgins as well?? I mean, it wouldn't be fair for a guy to expect his wife to be a virgin if he himself isn't. The proportion of virgins to non-virgins will just not be right. Imagine, a room of 2 guys and 2 gals who have lived their entire life with only each other. 1 guy lost his virginity to the first gal, but married the second virgin. So what would the second guy be left?? Hehehe, weird analogy, but u know what i mean, hehehe<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me, the important thing is not whether the girl is a virgin or not. The most important thing is to be open and honest. Perhaps, for those of you who watched Ally Mcbeal would know what I'm talking about. Like her, I think you should tell your partner the truth before he/she find out for himself/herself.<br><br>If he marries you and find out that you're not a virgin, that's bad. The guy would feel cheated and never trust the woman anymore. If you tell him, well, he may not love you anymore, and you'll be left alone. But if he doesn't mind, then both of you would be closer.<br><br>In the first place, if you haven't lost your virginity, then there would be no such complication. If you'd already lost your virginity, then, I think you should be brave enough to face the truth. I'm saying that you tell everyone that you lost your virginity, what I'm saying is that, maybe you tell him during appropriate times. Maybe like when he ask you, or when you feel the relationship is going to lead to a marriage and then you say that you did something bad in the past....ask if he mind....he would usually reply no, he won't mind and ask you what is it...then you can break the news to him. Watch his reaction and you know the results.<br><br>Whatever it is, don't hurt each other.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you(referring to anyone, not to any certain person) are a person who likes to screw around, why expect your future partner to be a virgin? You win some you lose some. If everyone screws around there won't be many virgins left to marry is there? Bottom line: Don't screw around. If you EXPECT(but not necessarily cannot get) a virgin wife.<br><br>------------------<br>"If a picture paints a thousand words, then why can't I paint you?
