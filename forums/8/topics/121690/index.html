            <div class='col-md body'>Sight-reading basically means to play a piece accurately on sight...tempo, notes and all...<br><br>I believe it'spart of ABRSM's piano examination...at least when I did my exams with ABRSM there was a category which held marks in sight-reading.<br><br>Sight-reading takes practice. You need to be familiar with the notes on the score and be able to read them instantly...at the same time your fingers should be able to coordinate itself well enough with itself and the keyboard so that you can play the notes as you identify them, without looking down at your hands... i.e. you need some spatial awareness with the keyboard and your fingers as well...<br><br>If you follow the grades in piano conscientiously...probably by grade 6 or 7, you should have no problems with it at all...</div>
