Why?!<br><br>Cuz, it's the ugly nature of human.  To put down what they envy or can't have?  It's might be jealousy...it might be for the mere fact to seek for attention...or maybe just to spike up our normal simple life?!  Only those culprit will know the reason and of coz people does certain things for a different reason.<br><br>The forum and IRC is pure entertainment to some people.  To see how people here react towards a certain minor gossip is damn funny.  You should know what I am talking about.<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>

See with your heart &amp; mind, and not with your eyes.<br><br>I'm only lucky that my hunch are pretty accurate everytime.<br><br>Not to worry Naive, admist all these, I'm one of those who can attest to your innocence.<br><br>I've now too much time on my hand *Luffs*, was pondering over everything that i could remember and this came to my mind. It's an ongoing never-ending issue and, yes, up till now.<br><br>It's disheartening. Is popularity really dat important that you have to put others down?<br><br>I feel apologetic too. I knew it but I couldn't help. They had themselves trapped. I'm aware of not being in their good books too. I have to learn to keep quiet and let them learn the hard way. Helpless. I am so when people come running back to me.<br><br>A lot have left becoz of all these. Dun. It wun help. And by doing that, are u letting them get away with what they want? Instead, learn to survive. Stick to your guns &amp; guts.<br><br>By putting up this topic, I've anticipated the potential danger dat i'll be putting myself in. But what the heck! To hell wif it! It's not as if i never kena all these b4! But I wun be as hurt as u ppl simply becoz I'm doing sumting dat u all r not, to protect myself. Betrayal is never sweet.<br><br>To those devils, I'm telling u... I wun say, I wun tell and I wun show it. Dun try ur bloody tricks on me. U can even give up tinking abt it. Save ur efforts. By the way, ur tricks are damn fucking stupid and brainless. U dun even command enuff respect from me to be manipulated by such toopidity. It's either u go get ur brain from the fridge or flush ur head in the toilet bowl to wake urself up. Go practise for a few more yrs b4 u want 2 play wif me. So what if u managed to win others over? I'm not the least bothered &amp; impressed. Ur urge and the amt of time u can afford to climb it up to the top on irc realli shows what a life u have.  And how long do u tink u can last? Retribution does exist. May u not die a horrible death.<br><br>Even now, there's another unwary victim out there. I, very much, wanted to give you a heping hand but it's beyond my ability. U had escaped to fall into the hands of another predator.<br><br>I understand and feel your pain. I'm deeply saddened by all these. Be assured dat u r not the only one and there'll be ppl who understand. U dun nit to gain the trust and likings of all, u'll only nit one to really know &amp; understand u and ultimately, stand by u. Dat's is more than enuff to pull you through. In a dark tunnel, a glimpse of light is a glimpse of hope.<br><br>------------------<br><strong>The Three Wonders Of Women</strong><br>1.
