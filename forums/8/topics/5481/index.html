A lot of times, i heard stories about how this girl is mistreated by the guys but how about the guys that are mistreated? We are suppose to be strong and be so called like a man. Heh, we are human beings too!<br><br>Gals always say how guys don treat them well and this and that. But sometimes guys are just built that way, the 2 sexes are different. It is not right to apply your rules to ours...<br><br>gals....sigh... how i love them and hate them ...<br><br>in 50/50 situations, gals win out most of the time.<br><br>the above is just an opinion of mine<br>any comments?</div>

If you notice woman pay more for their haircuts.<br><br>But when it come to emotions and stuff they say they need more. They are weaker..blah blah blah..well so much for being equal isn't it.<br><br>So is this really fair? No but that is life..woman you cannot live with them you cannot live without them..Cheers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yup!<br>killjoy : the case where in australia the woman fought for equal hair cut prices is something i know...<br><br>You probably heard about some insurance companies charging higher premiums for men compared to women... It might be statistically true that men is of higher risk on the road but i am sure there are safer male car drivers around compared to women.<br><br>the same applies to the women i feel, more women tend to have longer hair too...<br><br>but nowadays, women just seem to complain about everything and guys just have to swallow most of whatever thrown at them...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's just a case of women exercising their rights to be indecisive on a mass scale.<br><br>They really have no idea what they are asking from people or society.  If they wan't to be equal to men, then get a sex change for christs sakes!!!<br><br>We men get it far worse than women, but they can still complain more about inequalitites. In the west, we have laws to prrotect women against everything u can dream of...No laws protecting men...Fact.<br><br>women think that they have gained major concessions in attaining equality, but how wrong they are.  It only goes to illustrate the point that they are inferior to men because they can't protect themselves.  The fact that they need laws to protect them means that they can't be trusted to do important things for themselves.(And I'm sure they'd love to be able to pay the same kind of insurance that men pay...sarcasm intended).<br><br>That is one of the reasons I came to Singapore, because I'm afraid some idiot women's rights activist is going to sue me for talking to her "funny".  Whatever the hell that means.  Men are the endangered sex in todays world.  Everything we do, we do for women.  Even the law favors women.  Even if everything says that the man is right, the probability of her winning anyway is very high.  Even punishment for women is lighter than for men....yet we get the blame for all the evils of the world.<br><br>Let's look at the shopping malls, can't we pickett and call strikes becasue we don't like the fact that all shopping malls the world over caters to women?  Ever notice that about 1/20 of the malls are reserved for menswear?  hmmm...I seriously doubt that they would strike so that they can have equal amount of shopping sapce as men....I seriously doubt it.<br><br>It's all bullshit...That's why I hate feminists...They care nothing about equality for women...they only want what is for them and their elite group that is with them.  U know that any women that is against them is usually target for them also?  Noone is safe from feminism, not even females....it has become a cult...and as with all cults, should be destroyed with extreme prejudice!!!!<br><br>I personally believe in tresting women properly, but htey are still women, and we should treat them as such....u wouldn't treat ur grandmother like ur drinking buddy would u?  She's ur grandmother and should be treated as such....anything else is just plain disrepectful.<br><br>Same with women...treat them well.  Just remember that they are fundamentally very different from us, and no matter how much we *try* and make those differences equal, it will never even come close.<br><br>U can't make dogs and cats similar.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah... out of topic here, but man are charged higher premiums for insurance  because male drivers tend to drive further than women and so their vehicles are more prone to breakdowns. Something like our computers (fortunately we dun have to insure that, hehehehe). statistically, their accident rates are almost the same.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Exactly.  A lot of things that would seem unequal are just really superficial things...<br><br>cutting hair: It is perceived that women have longer hair and their hair styles are usually harder to cut...hence they pay more...In a lot of cases it's not true, but the rules are still there.<br><br>Driving: Most men don't drive like idiots but we get charged more for insurance...and what's the diff. really when ur driving further?  Women crash just as often as men sometimes for even sumber reasons than men, but the accident rate is bsically the same...I think...and we shouldn't be charged more.<br><br>Pubs/Discos: Oh how unfair it is.  I don't care what the reasons are, but I hate that I have to pay and women get in for free and then there's the women's night where they can get sloshed for free the whole night and get in for free....I'm sure they would want to pay also - sarcasm intended...:-)<br><br>Malls:  True that men don't buy clothes as often as women, but there are some that do.<br><br>My point is that sometimes these inequalities are just practical reasons and nothing more.  Sometimes it is because of sex issue, but noone is going to fight for men's rights...<br><br>To go down the list of such things as hair-cuts etc.. is a waste of time.  It proves nothing and gains nothing for anybody...yeah, maybe they get to pay $5-$10 less.....oh cool:-p<br><br>How about that disco thing....If we were equal as women, I'd be saving anywhere from $100-$300 every time I go to disco or pub...<br><br>...things that make u go, hmmmmm.....<br><br>:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree totally that man and women is never equal...<br><br>In australia recently, there is this judge who said that women have to be partially responsible for domestic violence... the reason = women nag too much and when the man cannot take it anymore, he will resort to physical violence...most men is not built to talk back like woman...(well, the idea is something like that)<br><br>hehe, so what do you people think of such a argument?!</div>
