Isn't it more exciting and productive to challenge them face to face? Replacement will occur if nothing is done to compete with them. Local scholar giving up just like that?<br><br>Once again, the session is F.O.C. and its for your own goods. No need to force yourself to contribute 10% of your salary. Hitsquad, don worry. Go join them anytime from 9am till 9pm daily at NTU library. ok?

As for why I want to meet up with Hitsquad is that personally I want to take a look at him, and also meet up with him and his pastor. I want to let his pastor see whatever he has posted and see what his pastor said. maybe in this way, his pastor can guide him better.

I want to let his pastor see whatever he has posted and see what his pastor said. maybe in this way, his pastor can guide him better.
