              <p>LOL, then don't get with the girl in the first place.</p>
              <p>I have an idiot "friend" who was in a relationship where his girlfriend bruised him up by pinching and scratching. The guy deserved it. He's an imbecile. He should've controlled his sexual urges are remained single. Instead, he let his dick control him, and got into a sexual relationship. What a dumbass.</p>
              <p>No I don't feel sorry for him at all. He put himself in this situation.</p>
              <p>Now he desperately wants to break up with her but is afraid she might do something to him. Well, its ALL his fault. Again, that stupid dickhead should've kept his mister where it belongs -- in his pants.</p>
              <p>Prior to his relationship, I warned him to stay a virgin, because the relationship is not worth the agony. He said "dude, I'm a heterosexual guy, I'm horny, I need pussy". My response was "do as you wish, but do remember the consequences of your actions".</p>
              <p>Now he's asking me for help in breaking off with that girl.</p>
              <p>My advice for all males, is, don't get into relationships with anyone -- girl or another guy. Its dangerous.</p>
