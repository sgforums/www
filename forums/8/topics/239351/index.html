            <div class='col-md body'>I have studied before in SIM, even though for only 6 mths, and I am currently an MDIS student studying Mass Comm. I changed schools because I realised i couldnt do well in my course at SIM.<br><br>In terms of organization, SIM is MUCH better than MDIS. To me, SIM is more organized, u know who to look for if u need enquiries to be answered. Sometimes, they pass u ard in MDIS from 1 person to another, and ur problem never gets solved. Also MDIS apparently do not take suggestions from students seriously. Me and my classmates have feedback many times about a few issues, but it never got answered. Also, my friend had the unforutunate experience of paying her school fees, only to have MDIS lost her cheque.<br><br>Actually, if I am not wrong, SIM offers UOL, as well as RMIT degress in business. From my experience in RMIT degree in Biz Admin(I think they change the course name already, but its still business related), the lecturers are dedicated, and they have experience in their field.<br><br>And if food is an impt factor to u, SIM definitely is the better choice. They have 2 cafeterias. 1 is like a typical food court, while the other operates a little similar to Marche, where they give u a card to chop, and u order watever u like and pay later. Both are air-conditioned, which explains why they tend 2 be crowded during lunch time, as Ngee Ann Poly students will also come to SIM to eat there. MDIS reminds me of a secondary school canteen. It is rather small, and has ard 4-5 stalls only, excluding drinks and fruits stall. And did I mention that during breaks from lectures, SIM provide coffee, tea and snacks?<br><br>Study-environment wise, SIM again is the better one. It is a conducive place 2 study, and has a lot of benches all over the school that lets u study. As for MDIS, other than a few study benches at the canteen, the other place 2 study is at the library.<br><br>In terms of sports facilities, MDIS wins out as it has a gym, tennis court, badminton courts, table tennis tables, a basketball court and a small field for soccer. You will need to pay for the facilities used though. SIM doesn't have these, if not wrong, u have 2 go Ngee Ann to use their facilities. Charges I am not sure.<br><br>Anyway, MDIS is going 2 have a open house next sat 17 March. SIM will hold an EA Games exhibition 16 and 17 March, so u can go there and look around, and enquire about the courses available.<br><br>Sorry didn't provide u much in terms of education and which 1 is a good education prospect for u, but i personally think that the whole package makes a good school.</div>
