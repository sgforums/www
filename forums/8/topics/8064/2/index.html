Well, it is the way how life goes, as u go on longer and longer, the wounds on your heart will heal, perhaps leaving a small scar, but the pain will grow lesser and lesser, till one day, you wake up and realize that it's finally over....

            <div class='col-md body'>actually i think all the advice in the world won't be of much help. we all have our own ways of coping with loss. telling someone who is sentimental at heart not to think of the past and to keep herself busy is only advice. it's only words. it may not work for her cos she won't be able to not think abt the past. she's just not built that way. you have to find your own way of coping.<br><br>the traditional way of getting over someone is to acknowledge the loss and the hurt and pain. talk abt it to a good fren or have a good cry abt it. but this could go on indefinitely depending on how much you are the kind to brood. after a while you have to tell yourself when enuf is enuf. ppl often don't want to stop brooding cos they are afraid that once they stop, they'll actually succeed in forgetting the person. and that scares them. but you have to understand you never forget someone. only the feelings will pass away. and those feelings should be reserved for someone more worthy of them. don't sell yourself short or fool yourself into thinking that that person was your whole world. they never are. they are only a part of your world that didn't work out. in other words, have enuf self-respect to know that you deserve another chance at happiness.<br>and that there has to be a time when you tell yourself to stop thinking. stop brooding. and start living.<br><br>ppl will say that you should try to keep yourself busy. or to find faults in the other person. or to ask yourself whether you really loved the person after all. you can do all these if it works for you. you can even tell yourself that you deserve someone better or that you are now free to look for a new and maybe better love. you may not want to believe that there is someone else out there who is more right for you. but believe me, there is more than one right person for everyone.<br><br>i think what would be good would be for you to identify the source of the hurt. why are you feeling the way that you do? did the hurt come from being betrayed or because he left you for someone else? is the pain because your love wasn't returned or because things just didn't work out even tho you really tried? sometimes it's more a matter of our pride being wounded or our egos being bruised than because we really loved the person. sometimes we are hurt that the other person didn't seem to love as much as we did. or to put in enuf effort. whatever it is, be clear abt the reasons why you're nursing a broken heart. cos it will help you to understand yourself better and hopefully to improve things in your next r'ship.<br>and if you feel that that person was truly the love of your life (when we are heart-broken, we usu think that anyway), and you still care for him, then wish him the very best and wish him happiness, even if it means he will not be with you. it is not easy to be this giving. but what is good abt it is that it is good for your soul. because you will not harbour any ill-feelings or resentment towards the other person. and you will then understand the meaning of love.<br><br>finally, be positive abt meeting someone new. and be with that person for the right reasons. not just because you are feeling lonely. you have to be fair to the other person too. being positive and happy will certainly increase your chances of meeting someone special. but if you're sad and brooding all along, you'll most likely not be the most attractive person. just some thoughts of mine. hope they will be of some help.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

U only loved the woman at the time when you are together.

            <div class='col-md body'>prodigal - we all find it hard to practice what we already know deep down inside. that's what makes us human. i have done so many things i know i shouldn't have. and lost a lot along the way. the spark you are looking for to make you believe again may well come from the right woman. then again it could come from any woman. and in this you have to be careful. to have that spark ignited by the wrong woman will have you losing that belief again if things go wrong. and you may lose that belief for good. so perhaps you have to find that belief even before you meet that woman. i know it's tough. but where there is hope there is life. the day we stop hoping is the day we die.<br><br>on a lighter note, you may want to read chapter 5 of "The Consolations of Philosophy" by Alain De Botton. the book is a light-hearted and humourous look at how some philosophers would advise us on handling everyday problems. chapter five has schopenhauer (of all ppl) telling us how to mend a broken heart. an interesting, witty and insightful read.<br><br>fireice - i know of this woman who got separated from her husband and she was in such pain she had to take drugs and anti-depressants so she could get over the pain. coming from her, she said that the way to get over the little waves of memories is to banish them the moment they creep up upon you. just busy yourself with some other thought or do something else to distract yourself.<br><br>from my own experience, the thinking and the memories are normal but counter-productive. in thinking abt the past you do one of two things. firstly, you may wonder what on earth you did wrong or what you could have done to make things better. you start to blame yourself. or else you will focus on the other person and feel bad that he didn't put in enuf effort, didn't do this, or couldn't do that and you'll start to hate the other person. in both cases you end up hating someone. either yourself or the other person. and these negative emotions will either turn you into a bitter, cynical person or it will affect your self-esteem. and no amount of thinking abt the past will be of any good except to make you feel worse. so what's the point? try to force yourself to think of other things when you feel those memories coming back. you will never forget those memories. it's just that when you recall them next time, the feelings will no longer be attached to those memories (at least not as strongly). right now, focus on healing. once you are healed those feelings will no longer haunt you. and then you will know you are over him. and yes i know you prob don't really want to get over him. but you deserve to be happy too. and some day you will find someone who will take good care of your heart and the feelings you have given to him, and he will know how to cherish them. but until that day, do try to smile okay? your future bf would prob want to rem the day he met you that you were smiling as sweetly as you could. and it would be that smile that would capture his heart and make him fall in love with you over and over again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ray gave quite a complete answer actually, and I agree there is no perfect recipe for this.<br><br>Scars are what results from hurt we get. Instead of ointments, we have our good friends and family to relief ourselves of the pain. And instead of appropriate clothings and bandages to cover the wound, we use work and other activities to help us forget the pain.<br><br>Whatever it is, don't feel the bitterness or bear any grudge. For it is like a knife, the harder u press, the deeper the wound will be. So don't blame anyone for the failure of the relationship. It is better to cherish those sweet memories that you still hold.

It will be hard picking up the pieces, and u may get cut by the pieces too. Putting it in place, scars still remain. However, the mirror if fixed properly, may become more resistant to breaking. But a mirror tat is hastily fixed will be more susceptible to breaking when dropped. In fact, the broken pieces become more pieces, so it is harder to fixed back. But just take your time... it is still possible to paste everything back in place. You just need to try.<br><br>------------------<br>Sometimes I wish I never knew you, for then I will never know such a special person exists in this world...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Stephen Hill, who came to Singapore recently, tells his true life story......<br><br>"The darkness was deafening. In my drug-crazed, deathly condition came the voice inside me urging, "This is it, Steve."<br>Am I awake or asleep? I wondered. Am I alive or dead? Is this real, or am I halluciÂ­nating?<br>Slowly, my body began to go into conÂ­vulsions. Yes, this must be real! IÂ’m going to die, I thought. Just let it happen like everyÂ­thing else in your life. Let death come.<br>The thoughts of dying, of suicide, had daily filled my mind for months. Thinking of getting off the painful treadmill of my life (jail.. .confusion.. . hatred... loneliness.. .hurt and misery) brought the slightest hope and comfort. Drugs no longer offered any high; they could barely fog out the anguish anyÂ­more, even momentarily. Hope, love or conÂ­cern for others had long gone from me. Yes, death surely would be a relief.<br>But itÂ’s not happening like I planned, I thought. ItÂ’s supposed to be peacefulÂ—a reÂ­lease. Why is this horrible cloud of blackÂ­ness and pain engulfing me?
