            <div class='col-md body'>Just finished seeing the movie.Shymalan's 2nd best work has to be this movie. It is so full of emotion. I feel the morale of the film is something different, that everyone in this world who is perceived to be handicapped or lacking in some way is not what it really seems. Bruce Willis overcomed his fear of water  and Samuel Jackson was capable of terrorism and i think this movie has some messages in the light of terrorsim like how like minded people could brainwash u to do things.Maybe if we could help those around us , we could be superheroes too.<br>The eerie cinematography and sadly music. The Indian director is quite good<br>Shymalan should come out more such stories in the future.</div>
