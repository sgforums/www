There are quite a few parallels which I could draw during the time when the movie was released. Eg. Bush trying to justify the Iraq war by telling his people of the WMD in Iraq and generally playing on the fear and paranoia of the public. Other examples are the legendary strict regulatory laws of our country like censorship/chewing gum. Will these good intentions result in negative repercussions????? This is one point which i was kept thinking.</div>
