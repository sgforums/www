            <div class='col-md body'>Gladiator is generally enjoyable, as many of you have already mentioned. But here I'd like to highlight some problems I had with the stylistic aspects of the movie, which is equally evident in many films in recent years. I wonder if any of you share similar sentiments.<br><br>During the battle scenes, I find myself struggling to understand what the hell was going on. Ridley Scott employs extreme close-ups and quick cuts that make me very disoriented. Individual shots of fighting whiz by so fast that before my mind could digest one movement, another one is flying past my eyes. I'm just not able to visualise, for example, where the chariots are in relation to the gladiators, thanks to Scott's lack of concern for spatial clarity. I'm not sure how many chariots there were or how they toppled, except for the very first one. Until I got the answer from a newsgroup, I was also unsure of why a certain gladiator was fighting alone in the first ringfight we see, when all of them are supposed to be shackled in pairs. All this swirling confusion kinda makes the action difficult to appreciate. A lot was said about how the action cinematography was borrowed from Saving Private Ryan, but in that movie at least I always knew who was where and doing what to whom.<br><br>Other examples of movies that have been mangled by this over-frenetic style include G.I. Jane (also directed by Scott) and all the Bruckheimer flicks, like The Rock, Con Air and Armageddon. The last was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.<br><br>Another odd thing that you may or may not have noticed is that despite the violence mentioned, we get to see very little of it. Most of the time we just get to hear the crunch as weapons hit flesh, but the camera is focused on the attacker instead. When we do get to see the actual impact, it jerks by so quickly it's over in an instant. How unsatisfying.<br><br>And to top it all off, we cinemagoers are chastised for watching it - "Aren't you entertained?! Isn't this what you came to see!?"</div>

If he posed a real threat, surely the Caesar will think of assassinating him when all his attempts at killing him at the gladiator fight fails. (Surely, there are many self-serving scums out there, and he can easily hire one to kill Maximus. As you see, accidents happens during training ... So the Caesar's name won't be smeared. And there is another way to kill him, put him in a fight vs 5 hunger tigers and give him a single (almost broken) weapon.)<br></div></blockquote>Because if there was an assasination attempt, Commodus would be the first one to be under suspicion. And with the condition at the time, Maximus had many friends, and he was considered a hero, not to mention something like a star in the arena. Imagine the uproar that would happen if people discovered that he died under mysterious circumstances....<br><br>And Quintus (the senator who schemed with Commodus against Maximus) also suggested that Commodus should hold back:<br><br><blockquote><br>"There's this kind of sea snake...<br>It will sink to the bottom of the sea, and it will pretend that it is dead. It will not even move when its enemies bite pieces off its body..."<br></blockquote>and then at that moment Commodus caught on and said:<br><br><blockquote><br>"Ah yes...<br>So we shall act like that sea snake... we shall lay quiet while our enemies bite pieces off our body... and then at the right moment... <strong>WE SHALL STRIKE!!!</strong>"<br></blockquote>------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Two roads diverged in a wood, and I --<br>I took the one less travelled by.<br>And that has made all the difference</span><br>-- Robert Frost - <strong>The Road Not Taken</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Quisling:<br><strong>During the battle scenes, I find myself struggling to understand what the hell was going on. Ridley Scott employs extreme close-ups and quick cuts that make me very disoriented. Individual shots of fighting whiz by so fast that before my mind could digest one movement, another one is flying past my eyes. I'm just not able to visualise, for example, where the chariots are in relation to the gladiators, thanks to Scott's lack of concern for spatial clarity. I'm not sure how many chariots there were or how they toppled, except for the very first one.</strong><br></blockquote>actually, I think that's the whole point. Scott was most probably trying to depict the confusion and adrenaline of a battle and/or a gladiator fight in the arena<br><br><blockquote><br><strong>Until I got the answer from a newsgroup, I was also unsure of why a certain gladiator was fighting alone in the first ringfight we see, when all of them are supposed to be shackled in pairs.</strong><br></blockquote>eh?<br>which bit was this?<br><br>and can you also tell us the reason why?<br><br>thanks!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><br><strong>All this swirling confusion kinda makes the action difficult to appreciate.

            <div class='col-md body'>I've got to admit that this is really a bloody good movie. Russell Crowe really got into his role, and Ridley Scott's directing really shines through.

            <div class='col-md body'>Reply to LiQuid<br><br>To explain my point further, let's examine other films that depict the wild madness of battle.<br><br>Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan accomplished that aim, wouldn't you agree? Yet we, the audience, know exactly what is going on. We know where the characters are in relation to each other.<br><br>How about a crucial scene in Born On The Fourth Of July? Oliver Stone showed us, with great clarity, how Ron Kovic got disoriented in the field and thus made a tragic mistake. At no point are we wondering, "err... how on earth did that happen?" or worse, "what was that?!"<br><br>Or how about that other movie that Gladiator has been compared to by some - Braveheart? Mel Gibson's camera stood away from the battle, never indulging in tight close-ups, lightning pans and quick cuts. Yet we do still get the point - that war is indeed a frightening orgy of blood.<br><br>If the cinematography in Gladiator is meant to disorientate the audience in order to make us feel the confusion of battle, then I suppose the same can be said for those ludicrously filmed fights in our very own Return of the Condor Heroes. Yes, I'm referring to those notorious dizzying fights that viewers complained about.<br><br>The gladiator scene I spoke of was the very first ringfight that Maximus was involved in. One of the gladiators chopped off the arm of his dead partner to free himself of the burden. But I missed that part, and so did all my friends. I'm guessing that you did as well?<br><br>"I can think of one possible reason to do this, namely to cut down on the number of actors that need to be employed in the battle scenes. I mean, if the audience is really confused, how would they notice that there's actually only 20 or so extras?"<br><br>Budgetary constraints were practically non-existent in Gladiator. Did you know that for the opening scene, they burned down an entire English forest marked for deforestation? And that Scott employed hundreds of Hell's Angels to play the Germanic tribesmen? In any case, that's still a poor excuse to mess with our senses.<br><br>Actually, it is Ridley Scott's personal style. Watch the equally confusing final battle in G.I. Jane and the similarities will become painfully obvious. His brother Tony has the same predilection, evidenced in Top Gun, Days of Thunder, et al.<br><br>This testosterone-laden style, partly labelled as MTV-esque, has gained great popularity among younger directors of late. Other notables include Simon West (Con Air) and the numero uno, Michael Bay (Bad Boys, The Rock, and the worst offender of them all, Armageddon). For another sterling example, don't miss the upcoming Gone In 60 Seconds. Do tell me how it is, as I'm staying far, far away from it.<br><br>"Remember that they were aiming for a PG movie. So I think they purposely did that."<br><br>For your information, Gladiator is rated R in the US and not PG or even PG-13. With that rating the relative timidity is surprising, and not a few Singaporeans were led to believe that we were cheated of an unedited version. I felt cheated too, but my wrath is aimed at Ridley Scott. I wish he could have been less sneaky, less frantic.<br><br>That said, there are many other redeeming qualities in the movie. But the primary element in Gladiator is clearly the fighting, and poor handling pulls it down a couple of notches in my book.</div>
