            <div class='col-md body'>KTE, LiQuid,<br><br>it probably appears to you that I'm too hung up on one issue or another. Like you, I tried to enjoy the movie. Hey, I love a good bloody epic anyday.<br><br>Unlike you, I didn't enjoy the movie as much because half the time I was straining to see and comprehend just what the hell was going on in the battles.<br><br>I wasn't looking for any 'depth' in the movie, as you said. I merely gave an in-depth analysis of why I think the battle scenes sucked, stylistics-wise. There is a difference.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't let the urgency of this movie fool u into 'die-die' must get tickets.<br><br>As mentioned, the scenes are frantic enough. Try watching (ok, imagine... i'll do everyone the fav &amp; help save $) it from Row 1.<br><br>I know,... a bit dumb... that makes the entire movie more frantic, more nauseous, &amp; higher chance of missing certain essential scenes.<br><br>Exactly how did Maximus escape from his death sentence? I know he asked for soldier's death, or something like that... and the other fella tried to jab him with the sword down his neck... and after that? Can anyone elaborate? Both my friends &amp; I weren't too dazzled by the fast pace that we all have our versions to that scene, at least.<br><br>------------------<br>Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret. -- A.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ixion: Ok here is what happened. There were altogether 4 soldiers, if I am not wrong, escorting Max to somewhere deserted to kill him. Two remained on horseback, and the other two led him away to a spot.<br><br>Max's hands were tied behind his back ( already tied? Can't remember ) and he was told to kneel. He did ask for a good clean death, a soldier's death. There was one soldier in front of him and another behind him.<br><br>The one behind drew his sword and pointed it at the back of Max's neck. He then raised it to plunge it down into Max's neck. But whilst his hands were still up, Max drew up forcefully and smashed the back of his head into the soldier's face. ( Strange, how did he know when exactly to do that? Plus the sword was pointing down, he could have smashed his head into the sword and killed himself! ) They struggled, and Max somehow managed to use the sword to cut himself free and kill that soldier.<br><br>The other one tried to draw his sword but it was frozen in its scabbard. Then Max killed him. One of the soldiers on horseback heard the commotion, got down from his horse and ran to the scene. The other remained on horseback.<br><br>After killing the third soldier, Max confronted the fourth one on horseback ( He must be crazy! In real life, Max would have been killed no doubt! ) and killed him. So much for that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I notice this tread b4 i saw the show, decide against ebtering b4 i watch it. Dont want you ppl to reveal to much. I agree this is a nice show with great effect and all but to rival show like braveheart, I personally feel there is something lacking. I feel his opponent too weak..doesnt really give you the scene he had beaten maximas.<br><br>The point about not killing him at the beginning of the show, He could but he wants to be seen as the hero and but by killing the gladiator will make him even worst in the eyes of the people</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But for the battle scenes, Braveheart is still better. And Braveheart has more depth somehow than Gladiator. Just my opinion.</div>
