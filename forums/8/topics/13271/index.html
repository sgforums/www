It was<br>recruiting able-bodied Malays as life-time "field operators" in Indonesia, Malaysia and<br>Singapore.<br>Updated on Jan 14, 2002<br><br>Original report "Intrigu'ing or Dangerous?"<br><br>Six days after news of the terrorist arrests in Singapore, <a href="http://www.harimau.org" rel="nofollow">www.harimau.org</a>  (Malay for<br>"tiger"), a suspicious recruiter of Malay "field operators" in Singapore, Malaysia and<br>Indonesia, had its access blocked by the government.<br><br>A check into the site showed the last update on its database took place on Jan 6, 2002.<br><br>It announced on its main page that "the organisation had difficulty in accessing and<br>updating Harimau's own website due to the tight security cordon being implemented."<br><br>Carrying a postal address in Johor, the anonymous operators did not say which authorities<br>had blocked its access - whether Singapore or Malaysia.<br><br>However, readers can still read its previous contents. The only difference is that it cannot<br>post new materials into it or remove old ones.<br><br>The site still carries this headline on top: "Overthrow the PAP. Down with PAP's<br>marginalisation and discrimination practices against all Malays."<br><br>The new announcement continued: "Please keep visiting our web site as a show of<br>support. The counter will record all web site hits. The counter is an indicator that Harimau<br>still have your support.<br><br>"Meanwhile may Harimau respectfully suggest that surfers visit <a href="http://www.fateha.com" rel="nofollow">www.fateha.com</a>  for news<br>and comments on Malay/Muslim issues.<br><br>"Harimau will resume maintaining its web page once Harimau has resolved certain issues<br>that Harimau had with the Authorities that be.<br><br>"Harimau condemns the terrorist actions carried out by United States Of America and its<br>Allies on Afghanistan."<br><br>In the context of modern day Asean cooperation, a visit into it makes intrigu'ing reading.<br><br>Among its anti-Singapore articles, it openly appealed for able-bodied men (aged 19-35) to<br>join a nine-month training at a base camp before being assigned to Harimau-linked Groups<br>located in various countries.<br><br>Applicants with military background will be highly considered, it added.<br><br>It added: "It is almost certainly not recruitment to join a triad, but it has one clandestine<br>characteristic of the Mafia when it declares that acceptance and membership are for life.<br>'The organisation is your family'"<br><br>Further checking into its wehsite showed its Registrant was:<br>The Asian Self Help Movement (Harimau4-DOM)<br>Lot 293, Kampung Punggai<br>Pengerang, Johor 81620<br>Malaysia<br><br>Domain Name: Harimau.

It proclaims<br>itself as a website for Singaporean Muslim news.<br><br>One article posted on Jan 12 - the day access to harimau.com was blocked - condemned<br>the detention of the 13 terrorist suspects under the Internal Security Act (ISA) a week ago.<br><br>Most Singaporeans, it said, "have jumped at the revelation" (Not clear what is meant). The<br>article went on:-<br><br>"The 'revelations' are merely government claims... what is missing thus far, is the<br>accused's defence.<br><br>"It is worrying when the government is not made to defend its accusation. A system where<br>an accusation is sufficient opens the way for abuse.<br><br>"If the government is confident of its evidence, then it should allow for it to be challenged in<br>court. If we agree that the government does not have to make a case, then why bother<br>have the courts at all?"<br><br>A check into it showed its registrant as follows:<br><br>Mohamed Shariff, Zulfikar (FATEHA2-DOM)<br>Blk 322 Tampines St 33 #02-142<br>Singapore 520322<br><br>Seah Chiang Nee (Original article posted on Jan 12.)<br><br>------------------<br>God made this world with laws, such as that of gravity, the disobedience of which will lead to serious consequences. Similarly He made the world with moral/spiritual laws as well, such as that the disobedience of which will prove eternally costly. Therefore, let the God who so loved the world that He gave us His only begotten son, Jesus Christ, heal your hurts in the way that He knows best. While it may not be in your ways, trust that He who made you and I, knows the best way, His way.
