            <div class='col-md body'>Fucking erotic, man!<br><br>Nice lesbian piece!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by keyi:</div><div class="quote_body">Lily spread her legs and reclined on her bed. The<br>music pulsed deeply, going into her very essence, causing her<br>erotic mood to become highly sensorial. Her fingers traced<br>the smooth lines of her body. Using a knife to cut away her<br>panties seemed more erotically stimulating that simply<br>removing them or masturbating through the soaked cloth. She<br>arched her back and tried to rip open her bra by thrusting<br>her enormous breasts forward. Through the material of her<br>bra you could see her enormous tits and the dark subcircle<br>around them. They were very wet from her secretions. Then<br>she massages her breasts with her left hand, while her right<br>hand is lying gently and unmoving upon her thigh. Under the<br>smooth caresses and fondling, her elegant breasts dilate as<br>she sighs and smiles, she is beginning to come. Her bosom is<br>so awe inspiring through her bra that one wonders how one<br>could bear it if seen unclad! Suddenly the door opens and<br>her roommate walks in.... and stares. Lily makes no<br>attempt to cover herself whatsoever. She spread her legs<br>further apart and gently touched her fingers to her genitalia<br>and brought some of the flowing juices up to her tongue. "Hi<br>Linda", she said, and arched her back with a scream of pain<br>and ripped open her bra! The things stood almost straight<br>out, rare for someone who has 'em that enormous. And on the<br>end of those immense nipples there was a clear fluid seeping<br>that somewhat resembled semen. Linda was gaping in<br>astonishment, partly because she had never seen her stripped<br>before, and the other reason being that of the alien fire she<br>felt racing through her body. Unconsciously she touched<br>herself through her jeans, as she always did whenever she<br>felt like it -- she had done so in front of Lily many<br>times, and had even got off when Lily was in the room<br>watching, however nothing ever developed beyond watching each<br>other masturbate through their cloths. Now, however it was<br>looking like that might change. Linda closed the door, and<br>walked over to Lily, and stood by her. They looked at each<br>other a long time, and finally Linda pulled off her t-shirt<br>to reveal her own chest. She never wore any support even<br>though she was fully developed (ripe?). She sat on the edge<br>of the bed and leaned over next to Lily, and could feel<br>heat from her, and smell her seductive bodily scent. Lily<br>started masturbating herself again, this time more directly,<br>with the back of her index finger against her slit, pointing<br>up while her second finger was inside her vagina searching<br>for perhaps the famed Graffenburg Spot(1), while the other<br>fingers were stroking her labia and inner thighs. She<br>reached out and brushed her hands across Linda's nipples,<br>eliciting a cry of something best described as a frantic<br>purr! Linda stood up and ripped off her jeans, showing off a<br>drenched pair of red silk panties. As she quickly exposed<br>the remaining parts of her she revealed that she was not new<br>to the world of orgasmic pleasures. The flesh around her<br>cunt was very enlarged and distended, one would like to think<br>from thousands of hours of personal self pleasuring<br>activities. She climbed onto the bed and kneeled next to<br>Lily, and spread her thighs. Then she took several fingers<br>of both hands and unfolded the lips of her (words fail me<br>here), and you could see the innermost parts of her vagina...<br>talk about pink! Suddenly they were in each other's arms,<br>laughing and crying at the same time. Their breasts were<br>matched, nipple to nipple, and were pressed and rubbed<br>together with the natural lubrication supplied by Lily.<br>The size of their cunt's was very helpful in getting good<br>contact, and soon they were reaching an orgasm together. Now<br>that the initial built up tension was released, they calmed<br>down to talking and masturbating each other.<br><br>This one.. erm... *coughs*<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

All those work she had to do at work tired her out completely.. She didn't want to cook her dinner that night.. Instead she went to a new pub down at the corner of the road.. It sure looked like an exiciting place.. She reversed her car into the lot nearest to the entrance to the place.. "Damnit! That f**k er" she cursed as a guy in black walked behind while she was parking her car..<br><br>Clad in a skimpy halter top and a really short skirt, Joyce, a woman in her early 30s definitely looked stunning.. More like in her early 20s.. Her long, wavy dark brown hair matched her eyes.. They looked just right on her..Into the pub she went, she was amazed by the amount of hunks hanging out at the new bar.. She was pleased to find that she might get a guy for tonight.. Heads turned to look at her.. She glanced around and she noticed this really cute guy drinking with his buddies.. Oh.. Damn!! He has a girl with him.. Look at the way she's clinging herself onto him.. That b!tch .. *curses* She proceeded on and went to sit at the bar in front of the not-so-bad looking bartender.. A couple of guys offered her drinks.. she declined.. still hoping that that cute guy would come over.. "Geeez, why am I so silly? Why would a young kid like him want an old lady like me when he has the young bimbos around him?" she sighed to herself..<br><br>The young kid plopped into the empty seat beside her.. She was surprised and couldn't believe it.. He was buying her a drink! "I caught you checking me out when you came in............."<br><br>He led her to the couch and laid her on her back, tossing her skirt up casually as he did so. Her thighs were lovely...rounded and firm...with a sweet hint of virginality in her pose. He looked for a long moment...then raised the belt. She watched him...trusting but apprehensive...and excited beyond anything she had ever felt. Surely he wouldn't...please God...let him. He brought the belt down in a moderate arc...the stroke landing across the front of her thighs with a sharp sting. He placed two more there...both dangerously near the junction of her thighs...and watched her face. She closed her eyes...and in doing so admitted defeat. The sensations and possibilities were too strong...he would win this time. She would give in...she always did eventually, but he had won quickly because of this different approach. She opened her legs wide...and felt his hands gently slip her panties down her legs. His weight was a welcome sensation...and he made love to her as he always did...generously and thoroughly, spending extra time with every place he knew would stimulate her. When the release finally came she knew that whatever unknown costs there were in it, she was<br>right in letting it go on.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
