            <div class='col-md body'>^_^ I been visiting sggirls for quite a while in the past &amp; is kinda interesting. Its very refreshing but too bad it had 2 be close done due 2 lack of time &amp; support. I'm thinking of recreating the site again. As I am in the course of IT (Graduating Soon ^_^ &amp; so R my friends who R keen 2 recreate the site), I would like 2 try but without resources (in the sense of pictures). I need U pple out there 2 give some support &amp; get more materials &amp; send it 2 me. I think I can create the site. This time, it will not be sggirls onli, its going 2 include sgguys as well. Its an suggestion, what do all of U think? Any comments?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to clarify a point ...<br><br>It is NOT illegal to take photos of people in the streets and post them up. Even without their consent. Period. This is abt being in public domain.<br><br>What can be construed as an crime is when the pictures thus taken lowers the subject's estimation in the jury of his peers. This is part of the libel suit.<br><br>Now the onus is on your lawyer to prove that (if you are the prosecuter) and vice versa.<br><br>The storm in a teacup that occured for the previous incarnation of SG Girls was that the average straight-jacketed SG person in the street was asked to give an informed legal opinion of the site (of which they are inadequate to do so).<br><br>I'm not saying you can do whatever you want, even with public domain pictures, as there is societal backlash against it ... and once there is a sufficient pressure/momentum the judiciary will have to make a populist sentence.<br><br>What I am essentially saying is that ...<br>YOU CAN TAKE A PHOTO OF ANYONE YOU WANT AND POST IT UP.
