            <div class='col-md body'>I provoke you? It is you a kampong pig who provoke people in other topic. Just look at how many people are scolding you in the speaker corner and this topic. It simply prove that you are a real petty kampong pig. Do I have nothing in the first place? Oh no no no, at least I have a Singapore IC. And that is something a lot of kampong pig wanted and of cause that include you a damn petty kampong pig. HAHAHAHAHA. A pleasure for you? You sure or not? Every one who flame you you also enjoy the pleasure. Since you enjoy the pleasure, I wouldn't mind lowering myself to entertain a kampong pig. HAHAHAHAHA<br><br>If you really so brave. Show me your courages. Don't talk big here. Got gut post your anti-Singaporean post here like what you posted in speaker corner. You go open a thread and post your comment about f*** up Singapore. Provided you got guts! But I don't think you got any! HAHAHAHAHA<br><br>This is my world! Of cause this is my world. This place belong to Singaporean. Wonder what a kampong pig doing here. Shitting here is it? HAHAHAHAHA. You asking me to get out? HAHAHAHAHA. I should be the person asking that damn petty kampong pig to f*** off from this place. Typical Malaysia pig!<br><br>You saying you don't hate Singapore? HAHAHAHAHA. The greatest joke I ever heard from you kampong pig! In speaker corner you present yourself as if Singaporean damn f*** up damn lousy. Yet now you can say you don't hate Singapore. Just treating it as a country. HAHAHAHAHA. So which is your real truth feeling? HAHAHAHAHA. You are a hyprocrite. Nothing but a hyprocrite.<br><br>Singapore is not suitable for pig. F*** back to your kampong ot rear pig. At least I proud of my country. Seeing a kampong pig scolding my country I am at least doing what I as a Singaporean should do. Not like those pigs friend who still refuse to wake up. Your Singaporean friends not like me. Of cause they only know how to suck up to a kampong pig. If I have a friend like you, I will tell you to f*** off from this place straight in your face.<br><br>Don't talk about guts with me if you don't have. As I already said. Open a thread and post your anti-Singaporean post here if you got guts. But from what I seen in your reply. I can say a small petty kampong pig surely have no guts.<br><br>Of cause you are bombarded by many people . You know why? I bet you wouldn't know. Just think why so many people against you? Why aren't there so many people against me? I don't even know those other people who flame you. You don't know I tell you, because you are a petty person. The moment you decided to flame Singapore, you should know that any Singaporean would flame you.<br><br>Walking pass a kampong pig? Eee, don't make my vomit. Pig should be inside pig farm. Why is there a stinking pig doing here? Why is the pig so thick skin and come to a place which doesn't belong to pig?<br><br>Don't think you can make me suffer or making me furious. You are nothing and you are not the least capable to do so. Wake up, don't think you can make me furious. Try harder if you wanted me to get furious. HAHAHAHAHA. You seems to enjoy thinking I am furious? HAHAHAHAHA. You must be damn naive, that is what I can say. Really, damn naive. HAHAHAHAHA<br><br>Kampong pig piss off? Of cause the person being scolded "kampong pig" must be damn furious. HAHAHAHAHA<br><br>HAHAHAHAHA you finally admit you are a kampong pig. Oh no no no as a Singaporean we eat pig. But we don't eat pig shit. Pig shit is only for those kampong pig. HAHAHAHAHA<br><br></div>

Regardless whether a person is nice or not, he is still not allowed to flame a country citizen. Imagine it is me who flamed his country and his fellow citizen. How would he react? Than if we were to argue using many many bad words, how would you all viewers react?<br><br>There is indeed many negative points about Singapore. Just like there is many fault in every human beings. But who is happy when their bad points are being pointed out. I can tell you not many people are able to take negative feedbacks.<br><br>It does matter a lot how a person present himself in his post. If a person present himself as a speaker. Speak with proper manner, I am sure all this unnecessary misunderstanding wouldn't have occured. Just like if anybody think that Malaysia had already done a lot for us, Malaysia, had already been very kind to us etc etc, that is simply a person point of view. I wouldn't go and flame a person just because his opinion is different from mine. It all matters on how the person present himself.<br><br>I personally don't flame a person because of his nationality. I don't think highly of myself just because I am born is Singapore. If a Malaysian who was brought up properly, able to think properly, present himself properly, I still respect the person. Regardless his nationality.<br><br>This before I speak! HAHAHAHAHA. You should ask him to think before what he speak!Judging from what he posted in speaker corner. I don't see any proper upbringing or any manner of presenting himself. Do I need to show any respect to this type of person?<br><br>naivegirl:<br><br>As I already mention above, I had nothing against him, definitely not because he is from Malaysia and most important not because he is of other races.<br><br>Don't judge a person from what he posted? If you know a person, definitely you think of the good point of a person. If you don't know the person at all, by judging from what he posted is the best way to know a person. I personally do not know him at all. Judging from what he posted in speaker corner. It reflect to me he is anti-Singapore. Just look at how many people is flaming him just because of the 2 posts he posted.<br><br>Yes he is not wrong to defend his country. Than am I wrong to defend my country also? Just read carefully who started to call names and uses nasty stuff. You should go read carefully why can't we treat it as a proper debate. Just by reading how he presented himself, do you think we can debate peacefully?<br><br>I personally don't enjoying seeing all this type of unnecessary quarrelling too. Imagine if all of us keep quiet and let him enjoying all the sarcastic comment he made on us. How would you feel?<br><br>fireice:<br><br>Of course I hope this place should be treated where there is no religion, no race, no nationality. Just read what he posted. Do you think we as a Singaporean can keep quiet about it? In real life things are not perfect. There are bound to be conflict regardless where you are.<br><br>To all:<br><br>Does it mean that if a person is your friend, you all regard him as a nice person means he can post whatever he like? He can flame whoever he like?<br><br>Does it mean that regardless he is right or wrong you all will still side him? If that is the case, best is I make friends will all sgforums people. In that case I can scold whoever I not happy with.</div>

I can tell you that those forumites there that defended Snafu all have met him in real life and apparently Snafu is worth it for them to spend the time and engery to defend.  A friend indeed.<br><br>Is he really anti-singapore?!  I am sure that he is more mature than to play with this anti-spore or anti-m'sian thing.  Should one spoil person spoil all the others?!<br><br>Sure, you have your rights to your opinion and Snafu does too.  Why take what you read in the forum so seriously?  Read it with a pinch of salt and you will enjoy it more.<br><br>You are not wrong for defending your country.  I am saying that both are at fault here.  But the thing that irks me the most is that if this arguement started in Speaker's Corner shldn't it stay there?  All I can see here is that you guy are flaming Snafu for posting things that are not related to the two countries.  Will this arguement happen everytime Snafu post in a thread?  I sure hope not.  It not only spoil your mood to post, but others like me also.<br><br>I am not asking you to stop flaming him or anything, all I am asking is for you to keep one thread separate from another.  Why bring the arguement to this thread?<br><br>AngelDark...<br><br><blockquote>but i will remember it, and try to change their way of thinking from their perspective, to thinking in our perspective...</blockquote>In life, you can't stop what other needs to say, for it's their mouth and not yours.  You can never change what other thinks, for it's their mind and not yours.  There are two side to every story.  You need to learn to be more open-minded.

            <div class='col-md body'>angeldark:<br><br>What you mean by he is correct? There is no definite correct or wrong in the issue he posted. Actually in many topics there is no definite correct or wrong. Most of the problems arise due to a person attitude and ways of presentation. Just read the post posted by him in the first place. What do you think? Please make your comment on that in your next reply.<br><br>Yes you are right, there are many bad point in every country. Althought we all agree that, but do you see us posting it out. Scolding this person scolding that person? We don't openly say a lot of things although we have the thought.<br><br>Does it mean that if he is your friend means he can speak whatever he like and you will still support him? 1 person have to look at things in a general point of view and not just because he is your friend means you side him regardless he right or wrong. A person willing to speak up him mind, I believe there are even more people willing to speak up their mind in this forum. But can you all except their opinion? You are the type who can't even accept those kopitiam 1 liners post as what I notice a few months ago in your post and you now telling me speaking up their mind.<br><br>If I don't judge by the character the person post here, than how you think I should judge? Judge from what you and naivegirl said? No, definitely not! As I already said, you can't side a person regardless he is right or wrong just because he is your friend.<br><br>Yes you can say you don't like Singapore. That is your opinion. You present yourself in a proper manner, present yourself well. I will still take it as your opinion. I wouldn't go flame you for that.<br><br>Why don't you all come and understand me in this case? As I already said in my previous post, it matters a lot in the way a person present himself in their post. There is also many post I don't agree with, but do I flame everybody?<br><br>There are people saying about the bad points, don't forget there are also people saying the good points. So now which is which, which is true? Or are you going to tell me he is correct?<br><br>naivegirl:<br><br>*smile back*<br>Back to topic. You all met him in life you know him, you all defend him. So my question is does it mean that you all will defend him regardless he is right or wrong as what I posted in angeldark reply? I have not seen him personally before. From what he posted I can say he is anti-Singapore. If a person who don't have this type of thinking, do you think he will post this type of comment?<br><br>Is he really matured enough as what you said? From my point of view, he is childish. Just trying to be another attention seeker like many people in this forum.<br><br>Of course I also wish to read it with pleasure. With this type of people using all those provocative words, you think I can enjoy reading?<br><br>Well I do agree with you that some of us are wrong to bring up the matter from speaker corner to this post. It do spoilt people mood to post here. It is a mistake of my part.</div>

I don't agree with certain things that he does and been saying  BUT I do know for the fact .. among all the ex- Malaysia PM ... He have done a lot for OUR country and I do thank him for that... for watever you ppl. have to say about him .... you have the rite to do so ..... but you were never close of being in his shoes or even in ur OWN PM shoes.... let alone to sit down and have a chat with both of them....
