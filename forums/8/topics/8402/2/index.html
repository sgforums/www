            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Revey,<br><br>To be able to see ghosts, is not easy in actual Chinese occult. First of all, the person must have the "Third Eye", or the other way is to spill black dog blood over the eye, followed by a yellow paper. I think I have said that once during one of our cookouts..<br><br>It is not easy to encounter ghosts or be possessed. To be possessed, the ghost need to disarm the protection of your human body, and it is highly difficult. One must understand, a person have what is called 3 "Hun" and 7 "Po", the first being the 3 fires which is a triangle, formed by your head and both shoulders and the second being the seven physical points where your physical body could be killed, if any of the 7 deadly acupoints were activated. For example, the temple is a vulnerable point. A person who loses either one of these two features, would become brain dead or vegetable. A ghost feeds by fear of human. In fact, humans should not fear ghosts at all.<br><br>I have the chance to see an exorcism when I was young, when I was running around Chinatown as a kid, and a good fortune teller taught me all these skills of divination and exorcism for free. He told me that to stop the ghost from controlling a body, one must take the wooden chopsticks (Plastic won't work, because wood is said to possess the spiritual property of trapping souls) and click on the middle of the finger of the person whom he possessed. Then do the negotiation by offering incense sticks and also possible rituals to help the soul reincarnate.<br><br>To know whether you are in good luck or bad luck for the day, use a turtle (a proper one) shell and put three hexagram coins. Use the I-ching and calculate the shape of the hexagrams and u know your luck for the day.<br><br>So, don't worry about being possessed, unless u are in the worst hour of your horoscope. The constellations would affect your luck cycle. All these need a lot of explanation. Anyway, there are just some algorithms and are non-scientific, so I won't expect people to believe it. But it is just a school of thought.<br><br>Anyway, whether you believe what I said (since I am no longer using these knowledge, as I am now doing science), is up to you. Just remember, if you have done nothing wrong, no ghost would possess you.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yes, forget one thing, one should never turn back with the head if an unfamiliar voice called. If you want to turn, turn your whole body, so the 3 points which form the triangle of fire would force the ghost to elsewhere. The other thing is that it is a myth about people stepping into burned incense. What one should never do is to break the fire when the paper are burning, that's all. Once everything is burned, it is alright, since the physical materials things to be transferred into the astral plane (as in the realm of ghosts).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dearest Naivegal,<br><br>Well, for your knowledge, the seventh month is only one of the times where the strength of the negative energy "yin" being stronger, because of some astronomical reasons. There is another time in the year, which the Chinese used to visit the graves of their loved ones and present offerings and it is called "Chin Ming" festival, and it is normally in April of the year, but it is normally on the 2nd or 3rd month of the year.  These are the only times where humans can have interactions with ghosts...<br><br>Can ask Revey to tell you how good I am in such things....hehehehhe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> If it is supernatural stuff, I can protect u much better than any guy here.... hahahahah<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read of a fire that broke out in the mental ward of a hospital in England in 1903. There were 300 men and women in what they called an insane asylum. Fifty perÂ­ished and 250 were literally pulled out of the fire. The descriptions of the way those mental patients behaved throughout the rescue graphically reminded me of the way insane sinners behave when others try to receive salvation through Christ. The similarities are chilling.<br><br>Some of the inmates laughed at the mention of fire. Only fools or the mentally infirm could laugh at a calamÂ­ity like that. Fools make a mock at sin. Only those who are morally insane would dare to trifle with the fire of sin. Some of those inmates laughed, just as many unbelievers will mock the preacher who tries to save them from a house of sin engulfed in satanÂ’s flames. In Acts 17 the BiÂ­ble says that when Paul preached the gospel of Jesus Christ to the philosophers on MarsÂ’ hill, some mocked, others hesitated, and others believed. They were basiÂ­cally saying, "That stuff about Christ rising from the dead is a bunch of malarkey. You must be out of your mind." Others said, "We will hear you again on this, Paul." When the apostle left, the Bible also says that some believed and followed him (see Acts 17:22-34).<br><br>Some of the those mental patients in England laughed as the hospital was burning down. Some said they would not leave their bed in the night and go out. They were afraid to leave their safety zone even if it meant they would lose their lives. Many unsaved people prefer the pleasures of their condemned state to the joys of salvation. The reason I like this story is because these people in the mental ward had people who cared about them. The rescuers risked their lives to save them, even though these patients sometimes fought and cursed them. Sinners are just like that. They are "spiritually" inÂ­sane. When you try to help them, they may curse you. ThatÂ’s insane; thatÂ’s crazy.<br><br>If you try to help them overcome chronic alcoholism, they will tell you with defiance, "ItÂ’s my life. I can do what I want with it. Now leave me alone!" ItÂ’s insane. The parallels between the mental patients during that fire and the unsaved are countless. The rescuers found some of the patients hiding under their beds. How many people are hiding under their fluffy beds of religion hopÂ­ing that the flames of hell wonÂ’t burn them? Their refuge of lies said, "Peace and safety, but only sudden destruction awaited them. How many are hiding from the truth? They hope that maybe they will make it to Heaven, but they just canÂ’t believe thereÂ’s a hell. So every day we find these persons huddled under religion telling themselves, "There just canÂ’t be a fire." God says there is a fire.......<br><br><a href="http://www.yesweb.f2s.com/praise/truth.htm" rel="nofollow"> Continue to read "Pulled From The Fire by Stephen Hill"..... </a><br><br>I'm about to touch on something that may be sensitive to some people out here in my next few posts.....please do not get angry with me....for it's God words. Listen!<br>I do not care what do you think, or what religion you have.....but hope you can take my next few post seriously.....I'm sure God will change your live.....I'm very sure!<br>But please open your heart.....do not let your little mind get constrained...Human minds are so tiny at times.....there are so many things humans don't understand.....<br><br>Many prefer to hear lies rather than the truth. Many choose not to believe the truth. When it's the truth, they think it as a big lie. I tell you now.....There are only 2 choices. Many will choose a the broad, easy path, but not many will choose the narrow, hard path.<br><br>Do not be surprised when it's the time to face the judge and you beg for a second chance. It's too late to say....hey everything in the Bible is true!<br>I tell you.....it's very fair. Everyone will be given more than chances to choose. You have the full freedom to choose! Noone will be left out! Therefore there is no way you can deny! Do not be surprised even those tribes on very isolated island.....God has made known to them through nature. God's our creator....he's our father. Just imagine you are the father of your children, but they do not believe you are the father. They do not believe there is a father at all! How would you feel? God can take your life any time right now, but God does not. For he so loved you, he does not force you to believe in him. He lets you believe as what you believe. You choose to go against him, he does not blame you at all. But he still cares for you and wants you to go back to his side. Everyone will be given the chance to choose!<br><br>But God warned you again. There is only 2 choice and you make your choice.<br>I will talk about heaven &amp; hell, &amp; what's the near future in my next posts. You may be surprised.....&amp; come to senses about hell fire.....<br><br>Once again, I would like to clarify....I'm not against anyone or religion here. And I'm not bringing any religion here but I'm bringing you the relationship between you &amp; God, our creator.<br>So, I will not flame or reply any one's posts, unless you need some help.<br>Have a nice blessed day! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
