Well Mr. PoopooMoon, all I can say is, ur actions are a disgrace to the faith. I really wonder what you are trying to proof poo, I really wonder. Are you simply trying to pick an argument just for the sake of having one??? That is such a sad case pooface, really sad excuse....aiyah, forget it, u will just snuff all these off, how typically pooish, only give the faith a bad name.
