            <div class='col-md body'>Hahahaha, Colette, I am sure u are braver than that. Have you ever had any experiences with the supernatural??? What are they supposed to look like???<br><br>Naive, sure. The 7th month is simply a month of the lunar calender whereby it is believed that all hell breaks lose. Commonly known as the Month of the Hungry Ghosts, the gate of hell opens up on the first day of the 7th lunar month and the spirits are allowed a month of feasting and revelry in the world of the living. To ensure that the ghosts enjoy a pleasant "vacation", lavish feasts are set out, paper hell money are burnt for their use, chinese wayang shows are performed for the dead. The climax of the Hungry Ghost month is the 15th, which is also known as the Chung Yuan Jie, when great sacrificial feasts are set in the temple and priests pray for the dead. Whether or not one believe in the existence of the supernatural, you will never fail to feel the festivities, especially in the Chinatown area. It is supposed to be bigger where you are now.<br><br>Anyway, there was this one foggy night whereby I walked back home all alone along this quite street. With the burning hellpaper money flying all around, it really makes the ambience appropriate for a scary setting.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

God has <strong>never ever</strong> judged me, but you *in great distaste*, a mere forumite who doesnÂ’t even know me personally at all, actually had the audacity to comment and judged me? so darling poopooMoon, was your action Christian-like?<br><br>by the way, iÂ’m a handful and God knows it only too well. iÂ’m not your typical Christian who merely sprouts love-your-neighbours-as-yourself type of  platitudes and have no actions to back up their actions and there are simply just some neighbours who are more lovable than others. take you for example, much as i try to be tolerant, iÂ’ve just reach the end of my rope for you, so i guess itÂ’s open season now and i wonder if this could get any uglier? oh, i digressed. what i meant to say is that iÂ’m the type of Christian who strives very hard to be Christ-like but fails most of the time, i cuss and swear when the occasion demands it or rather when i feel that the occasion demands it and most of all i donÂ’t suffer fools lightly.<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 21 July 2000).]</div>
