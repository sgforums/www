            <div class='col-md body'>Juz another day. I post today to actually tell you I got sick of the arguement and will call it a draw. Doesnt mean u have won.<br>It's just a draw. I can jolly well go on the arguement with you all the way.<br><br>Juz want to tell you that I'm not an unreasonable person. When I first joined the forum, there were many people were blaspheming the name of God, mocking and laughing at Christianity.<br>I couldnt stand their rude ways and joined in to defend the name of God.<br>I tried to explain to them nicely at first, but they saw me stand firm in the defence, they threw vulgarities at me, saying things like Jesus made love to me that's why I convert to Christian.<br>They say I was overzealous, proud, fake-christian, evil, satanist, black sheep, and all other things you can imagine.<br>Juz because they dislike God, and they saw me defending him, they tried all the methods to make me angry so then they will say<br>"I thought Jesus told you to love your enemies?? You never obey him! You're bad!"<br>Even though I never flame other religions, they still accused me of that. When I got pissed off, they threw vulgarities at me and saying things like if I shouldnt be angry because I am a Christian etc.<br>They are juz making use of my belief so that they can throw more flames at me without me flaming them back.<br><br><strong>  I had my purpose of argueing with you here in the first place</strong>. U joined them while I was argueing with them, and you didnt even understand the situation at all. All of sudden u started flaming me back there when I am already so frustrated with them, yet you are a Christian yourself and you do that to me.<br><br>Dont tell me u flamed me because I was intolerable, black sheep and not Christ-like.<br>Juz look at yourself, so intolerable, the way you judged me, curse me, hated me, are you Christ-like??? Are you tolerable??<br>I juz wanted you to have a taste of being accused of breaking promise, bad-Christian, black sheep, not Christlike and yet shouldnt be angry because of being Christian etc.<br><br><strong> We are both the same okay, intolerable and not Christlike. You shouldnt be telling me how I should behave when you yourself are like that. </strong><br>Also If I can be totally like Christ, I would be the one dying for you on the cross instead.<br>I just wanted to lure u into a trap, so that you will have a taste of how I was feel like when I was flamed and accused of things I did not do.<br>So now you know my purpose huh?<br><br>If we can really be Christ-like, there wouldnt be fighting between Christians and Muslims in Indonesia. All the Christians there would be dead by now. They were being attacked, raped, killed and their houses burned, you expect them not to get angry and fight back?? And would you tell them not to fight back because they are Christians???<br>We are all human. We are not Christ. We all have our limits in tolerating such things.<br>Though being Christlike is what we should do I agree with you. But just look at the situation in Indonesia. What if you're among them??<br><br><strong> That's my purpose of argueing with you, to let you understand my situation back there.</strong><br><br>And I say again,<strong> you can still post to me of course, but stop pinpointing at me if you dont want to start another arguement</strong>. I think we're both tired. Juz call it a draw.<br><br>That's all I got to say. so here ends,and I say GoodBye to you.<br><br>[This message has been edited by poopooMoon (edited 26 July 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>poopooMoon,<br><br>i donÂ’t know if you remember but iÂ’ve told you before in another thread that the way youÂ’re going about defending the name of God is more detrimental to the faith than beneficial. youÂ’re too confrontational and religion being the ultra sensitive matter that it is, your rigid stand, threats and inflexibility donÂ’t endear you to the rest of the forumites.<br><br>religion is a very private thing, itÂ’s good that you want to share the faith but you canÂ’t just simply shove it down other peopleÂ’s throats. youÂ’ve to remember that this is multi-racial and multi-religion Singapore, people of other faiths donÂ’t take kindly to being told that what they have believed all their lives is all wrong so rudely and bluntly and that theyÂ’re going to hell if they donÂ’t believe in our God. sharing your faith is one thing, to run down other peopleÂ’s faith is another.<br><br>most of the people who visits this forum are pretty reasonable people, i believe if you present your case in a reasonable way, there would have been no flaming at all. iÂ’ve posted numerous posts on religion before and iÂ’ve never been attacked like the way you were, have you ever given it a thought as to the reason? mainly because iÂ’m tolerant. personally i believe that thereÂ’s only one God and i believe that my behaviour is a better witness of my faith than my words, people are usually more apt to believe you if your behaviour is consistent with your talk. it doesnÂ’t take a day or a few posts to convert a person, that person has to be looking for God too, and when the time is right, as Christians, we show them the way. and even if we share our experiences with God and yet they appear unmoved, so be it, one day when the timing is right, God will handle the rest.<br><br>i donÂ’t know if you noticed that iÂ’ll flame a forumite without hesitation if he or she is foolish enough to annoy me in other matters but i never flame him or her pertaining to religion, i try to cool the matter by appealing to their reason and i donÂ’t respond in kind to them, exchanging heated posts do more damage than keeping quiet. if you donÂ’t mind me butting my nose in, i would suggest that you learn to write in a more humble way, thereÂ’re times to be arrogant but religious matters is not one of them.<br><br><blockquote><br>I had my purpose of argueing with you here in the first place. U joined them while I was argueing with them, and you didnt even understand the situation at all. </blockquote>are you talking about this thread or some other thread weeks ago? if itÂ’s the latter, donÂ’t you think youÂ’re a little petty to have kept track? because in this thread, i truly lost patience with your intolerant views and holier-than-thou attitudes. and what i did in that other thread was to cool off the situation, if i didnÂ’t step in then, you would have done more damage to the public opinion of Christianity by non-Christians.<br><br><blockquote><br>All of sudden u started flaming me back there when I am already so frustrated with them, yet you are a Christian yourself and you do that to me.</blockquote>if i remember correctly, before i rebuked you in that thread, i hinted to you that you should cool down, calm down and back off but you didnÂ’t, between seeing my God/faith reviled and you toasted, who do you think iÂ’ll choose? anyway, you were doing it all wrong.<br><br><blockquote><br>Dont tell me u flamed me because I was intolerable, black sheep and not Christ-like.<br>Juz look at yourself, so intolerable, the way you judged me, curse me, hated me, are you Christ-like??? Are you tolerable??</blockquote>i flamed you precisely because you are intolerant. iÂ’m intolerant, highly intolerant in fact. even when i flirt, if iÂ’m not happy with my flirtees, i sometimes flame them too. even among familiar forumites, i *bish or kokz* them if they try to be funny with me, much less you when youÂ’re so intolerant of others.<br><br>i never hated you, i donÂ’t know you other than some of the posts of yours which i happen to come across. itÂ’s easy to judge you because youÂ’re so predictable pertaining to your views on religion.<br><br>poopooMoon, just because iÂ’m a Christian doesnÂ’t mean i donÂ’t judge people. in an ideal world, all of us would live peacefully together but this is not a perfect world. i believe in Christ, i strive to be Christ-like but iÂ’m also human, iÂ’ve human tendencies. annoy me long enough and you will get smacked, at least iÂ’m not one of those who smack people for no rhyme or reason.<br><br><blockquote><br>I juz wanted you to have a taste of being accused of breaking promise, bad-Christian, black sheep, not Christlike and yet shouldnt be angry because of being Christian etc.</blockquote>iÂ’ve explained my stance on my replies to you, please read them again for a fuller picture. as a recap, since you wrote you donÂ’t own a modem at home, that would mean that youÂ’re never going to log on to this forum after office hours. well, that would mean 2 things: i donÂ’t reply and you would think youÂ’ve won or youÂ’ll continue to insult me during office hours and iÂ’ve to hold my peace? er, colette is no fool and i donÂ’t suffer fools lightly.<br><br>and er, since when have i written that a Christian shouldnÂ’t be angry? did you read the posts i wrote regarding the guy who was shot dead by the police a couple of months back? i was more than angry in that thread.<br><br>youÂ’re a little strange, you seem to think that as a Christian, all negative feelings are not meant to be expressed or experienced, thatÂ’s total bullshit. the book of psalms shows me that iÂ’ve every right to feel every type of emotion, be it negative or positive. itÂ’s how i handle the negative that is crucial, not my expression of such feelings.<br><br><blockquote><br>We are both the same okay, intolerable and not Christlike. You shouldnt be telling me how I should behave when you yourself are like that. </blockquote>sorry to burst your bubble, weÂ’re very different, very very different.<br><br><blockquote><br>Also If I can be totally like Christ, I would be the one dying for you on the cross instead.</blockquote>kindly just read your own post again, thatÂ’s a totally wrong and tasteless thing to write.<br><br><blockquote><br>I just wanted to lure u into a trap, so that you will have a taste of how I was feel like when I was flamed and accused of things I did not do.</blockquote>if youÂ’re referring to the fact that i replied to you again after posting i wonÂ’t reply to you until you access the forum from your home, what would you have done if iÂ’ve kept silent? you would have taunted me the next day during office hours and how long am i supposed to be taunted before i reply? that was your strategy, wasnÂ’t it? in such an inane situation and with such a lousy excuse, surely you donÂ’t expect me to buy it and be a sitting duck for you to taunt? for you not to have a modem at all, your pc must be at least 5 to 10 years old, if iÂ’m not wrong and er, since when does pc ever last that long? unless youÂ’re using a Mac, theyÂ’re long lasting. so, i donÂ’t see my reply to you as breaking my word.<br><br><blockquote><br>So now you know my purpose huh?</blockquote>your purpose still elude me, all i see is that youÂ’re trying to do damage control and regain some credibility.<br><br><blockquote><br>If we can really be Christ-like, there wouldnt be fighting between Christians and Muslims in Indonesia. All the Christians there would be dead by now. They were being attacked, raped, killed and their houses burned, you expect them not to get angry and fight back?? And would you tell them not to fight back because they are Christians???</blockquote>er, do you even read your Bible? do you know of the wars in the Bible? holy wars are the most unholy of all and no, i wouldnÂ’t tell them not to fight back. fanatical religious men are the most fearsome because they believe that theyÂ’re fighting for their God and that gives them supernatural faith and stupidity too sometimes.<br><br>if you think about it, Christianity, Judaism and Islam all share the same forefather: Abraham. itÂ’s a joke that Christians and Muslims are killing each other as our ancestors are actually step-brothers. whatÂ’s all this fighting about? power and greed.<br><br><blockquote><br>We are all human. We are not Christ. We all have our limits in tolerating such things. Though being Christlike is what we should do I agree with you. But just look at the situation in Indonesia. What if you're among them?? </blockquote>i would try to be tolerant and keep to my faith and definitely i wonÂ’t be telling them that theyÂ’re going to burn in hell if they donÂ’t believe in my God.<br><br><blockquote><br>That's my purpose of argueing with you, to let you understand my situation back there.<br><br>And I say again, you can still post to me of course, but stop pinpointing at me if you dont want to start another arguement.
