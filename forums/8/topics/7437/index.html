            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, I had a very bad day today because of an irritating job interview. As I have near four months long summer holidays, I started to manage looking for a summer job this week. Just want to get some working experiences and make some money for a summer tour. so i just apply some simply clerical jobs, never think it is too difficult to get one. *sigh*<br><br>I made an appointment for interview this morning. The company is quite far from my home, it took me more that one hour bus trip to there in this early morning. A clerk gave me an application form and I filled it in. One of an item is about language skills, there are three choices for the English spoken language: good/ fluent/ fair. I chose "fair". I waited for more than twenty minutes after hand in the form to them. Then a woman came in and sat down. The woman is very casual dressed, just like an office auntie, (at least that was her first impression to me). She talked to me in Cantonese (I am not a Singaporean, we here don't speak English quite often). She said, " you can only speak fair English? errr, then I think you are not very suitable for this job, we required someone speak English fluently." I spoke to her politely in English: "errr, I wouldn't say I can speak excellent English, but no problems in communication, and I donÂ¡Â¦t mind you speaking English to me or give me some tests see if I can meet your requirement." She stopped a while and with a bit embarrasses, but she kept speaking Cantonese to me. " errr, most of our clients are foreigners, their spoken English is quite different form us. It is not easy for you to catch what they mean, so I am really sorry about that." haha, I wanted to laugh, it sounds like I haven't met any native speakers. As she SINCERELY said, "I am really sorry about that", no point for me keep showing my fair English.<br><br>I am very angry and feel truly hurt by that hell company. My English standard was disqualified by someone who can't speak any English (maybe she don't bother speak her excellent English to me). I feel I was fool like an idiot. Okay, I know that my English is not good enough, if she tested me and said I couldn't meet her requirement. That's fine, no any complaints about it. I took more that one hour bus trip to there for the interview, how can they just ask an office auntie to disqualified me and " da fa" me in that way? I think I at least deserve a serious interview and a bit respect.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, you can always apply another job, why get so worked up? Think of it this way, it's their loss, not yours.<br><br>Anyway, it's true, you just cannot be too modest. Don't exagerate also, just be as accurate as possible, and if you really think your English is fair, then, maybe you don't deserve the job?<br><br>Anyway, if you can't take the interviewer's attitude, then if you have to deal with clients with this kind of behaviour, how??<br><br>I think you have to learn to be more tolerant. Don't expect everyone to show respect...maybe the interviewer is not tactful.<br><br>Anyway, hope you know what I'm trying to tell you. All the best for your job hunting.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, there could be a multitude of reasons as to why they decided not to employ you. A lack of proficiency in English might not be the true cause of their rejection of your application.<br><br>They could've lied to you for a couple of reasons:<br>1) they are looking for a local for the job?<br>2) they were trying to hide to truth from you which might hurt you even more?<br>3) you are overqualified, and they are afraid that your wage demands will exceed what they are prepared to pay?<br><br>In any case, don't get too upset over an interview, it's impossible to succeed in every one of them.<br><br>That lady might look like an auntie, but that doesn't mean sh isn't someone in the management level, or the lady in HR department. Some bosses dress rather casually to work.<br><br>So.. cheerios! All the best for your next interview and your final year studies!</div>
