Then, why go through so much trouble and act so dramatic? Cry? Haha...what a joke! You are seeking "justice" here is it?<br><br>Are you contradicting yourself by saying that posting outing in a private forum does not mean that any Tom, DIck or Harry can join? So, just what is the purpose of you posting this thread? Furthermore, LDF did not post any thread to notify anybody to attend their outing. What you read is neither an invitation nor thank you thread. Please get your facts right once again. I wouldn't want to disgrace myself this way if I were you. Anyhow complain without factual evidences.<br><br>Last but not least, who is the sour one here? Did we get even? No! Read the 2 threads with similar title, namely, yours and mine. Who is the one trying to get even here? Which is the more hostile thread? I think the answer should be clear to you.</div>
