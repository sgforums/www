              <p>Following the success of the movie Ip Man, I will be producing a new movie on Bruce Lee.</p>
              <p>This will be the storyline. Hope all of you will support the movie</p>
              <p>1. When Bruce Lee was a kid he often get bullied. He didn't knew that people at that time were already using guns. So he decided to learn martial arts to defend himself.<br><br>After learning wing chun, he thought he was very powerful and went to fight with his enemies but they easily beat him up.<br><br>2. Than he realised that people were already using guns and no longer using martial arts.<br><br>So he went to buy a gun to scare his opponent only to realise that he did not buy any bullets for the gun. So once again he got beaten up by his enenmies.<br><br>His enemies tell him to leave china or else they will kill him. He have no choice but to go to America.<br><br>3. At America, he tried to teach wing chun to earn money. But because his wing chun skills was very lousy nobody wanted to learn from him.<br><br>He came out witha idea. He created a fake martial art call Jeet Kund Do and lied that it is the best martial art in the world.<br><br>But still nobody wanted to learn from him.<br><br>4. He came out with another genuis plan. He decided to join martial art competition but he knew that he will definetly get defeated because his skills sucks.<br><br>He decided to pay money to his opponents to pretent to lose to him so that he can get the championship.<br><br>Thus, Bruce Lee became famous once he started winning martial arts competition and many students flocked to him to learn his fake martial arts.<br><br>5. 1 day he met some directors who are gays. He decided to have sex with him in order for him to act in their movies.<br><br>Thus, Bruce Lee became even more famous and richer than before.<br><br>6. His teacher Ip Man was very angry that Bruce Lee teach fake martial arts. Ip Man fought with Bruce Lee and beat him up until he end up in hospital.<br><br>7. Bruce Lee paid moeny to hire some highly skilled shaolin monks to beat Ip Man up until Ip Man died.<br><br>He brided the doctor to say that Ip Man died of throat cancer when in fact Ip Man was killed by Bruce Lee and the shaolin monks.<br><br>Until today everybody thought that Ip Man died from throat acncer.<br><br>8. Bruce Lee found out that his wife Linda had an afair with Ip Man. He was very angry and beat up Linda.<br><br>Linda in turn poisoned Bruce Lee and he died</p>
