He take time to learn what is troll, clone, virgin and arsenal football players but he don't want to learn what is a girl for many years of his life. Don't tell me football channel advertisement all guys -.- and when he see some girls(even though he doesn't know they are girls), he won't feel attracted to them? His sex hormones is failing him. I think he's gay, and i think he's just a clone. He can say he will not lie becuz of his father bla bla bla, but in the world of internet, its guilty unless proven innocent</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what man... of course he knows what a girl is... like in how a ger is different from a guy... of course he has teachers and aunties and they are women... but of course what he means is that he does not have, if not intimate, much experience with girls to enable him to have a successful relationship with them.... and he was hoping that people will give him some useful insights...<br><br>instead, he gets slammed... bo liao... if you cannot give him some insights, also no need to slam him right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
