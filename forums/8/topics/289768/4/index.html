            <div class='col-md body'>You guys believe such a ridiculous claim? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If we lived in some society where women are confined to their homes, it's more believable. But please, this is Singapore, the moment you walk out of your house to go to school, you're bound to bump into a school girl or a mum taking their kids to school.<br><br>Also, I doubt that there's any primary/secnodary school in Singapore with only male taechers. Even if that's true, I highly doubt all the canteen store holders are male.<br><br>Don't tell me you've never been to a hawker centre or a convinience store, or even passed by one.<br><br>Even then, textbooks used in schools have dozens of pictures of females. They're also mentioned all over in English passages.<br><br>AND, if you're in an all-guys school as you claim to be, SURELY other students would talk about girls all the time. I would know, because I was in an all-guys school for 11 years.<br><br>Just think about the sure absurdity of this guy's claim. Try living a day and going to school, work, or out to eat, without seeing a single female (pictures included).

But please, this is Singapore, the moment you walk out of your house to go to school, you're bound to bump into a school girl or a mum taking their kids to school.<br><br>Also, I doubt that there's any primary/secnodary school in Singapore with only male taechers. Even if that's true, I highly doubt all the canteen store holders are male.<br><br>Don't tell me you've never been to a hawker centre or a convinience store, or even passed by one.<br><br>Even then, textbooks used in schools have dozens of pictures of females. They're also mentioned all over in English passages.<br><br>AND, if you're in an all-guys school as you claim to be, SURELY other students would talk about girls all the time. I would know, because I was in an all-guys school for 11 years.<br><br>Just think about the sure absurdity of this guy's claim. Try living a day and going to school, work, or out to eat, without seeing a single female (pictures included). It's impossible. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>Point taken. I appreciate the disrecepencies you found in my explanation.However, because i was too dumb then to know about it, and basicly, i have been faulted for not going to sex ed.Besides, my father didnt simply have the time, he works night shift and needs all the rest he can gets.<br><br>Basicly, if i were a clone, i would have left straight after posting and not bothering about this fictictious post.But this is a real plea for help.I just am too nervous on being on a forum for a first time, thats why the mixed feeling<br><br>Cheers.
