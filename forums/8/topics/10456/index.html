            <div class='col-md body'>Jason : From the post that are coming in all is not lost yet. This forum meant something to me and I suspect many of the forumites. Lesson are learn through mistake and wisdon is taught through exprience. What you see now is some unhappy people, for those which are reasonable answer them. Never ignore problems as it will only get bigger. For those here to create trouble name pubbing, firemoon and all we can put them aside. Cause there is no way to please them and they reasoning is limited. I believe Tet, firewire's demands are not very unrealistic, maybe you should look into it.<br><br>Tet : I understand how you feeling but give him time to sort things out. I am sure he will know what to do know.<br><br>colette : nice to know what you have bottled up inside you. And I hope to have your support to end this flaming<br><br>All those who are agianst the flaming: Peace it the way. I have also heard complains of people going into sgclub to distrube. please dont the difference between us and lamers is we have class.<br><br>All those who are pro flaming: Dont get burn. and for those guttless freaks why dont you indentify yourself. firemoon, cupid mivec and pudding. I am a reasonable man and i am willing to listen but please dont use lame terms languages. we sit down have a chat.</div>

But this is a fact of life. Although you are young, promising indeed, but age is never an excuse for errors and ignorance should never be used as a tool. Stop rebuffing people's complaints as nonsense. Stop giving excuses that they are unreasonable. You yourself will know whether or not it is unreasonable. And the balance you have to maintain for this forum, both as a business entity and as a hub for the conglomeration of people you know, that is crucial, for such net activities, which is your focus, is very people orientated.
