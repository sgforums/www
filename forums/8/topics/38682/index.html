            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &gt;Excerpts from<br>&gt; &gt;No U-Turn Syndrome (NUTS)<br>&gt; &gt;Chaotic Thoughts from the Old Millenium<br>&gt; &gt; by Sim Wong Hoo<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Introduction<br>&gt; &gt;Whats is NUTS? NUTS is when you want to do something and you seek approval<br>&gt; &gt;of a higher authority. When there is no rule saying that you can do such a<br>&gt; &gt;thing, then the standard answer is NO ...<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;In the US, when there is no sign on the road, it means that you can make a<br>&gt; &gt;U-turn. When the authority do not want people to make U-turns, they will put<br>&gt; &gt;up signs to tell you not to make U-turns.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;In Singapore, it is the reverse. When there is no sign on the road, you are<br>&gt; &gt;not allowed to make U-turns. When the authority allow you to make U-turns,<br>&gt; &gt;then they will put up signs to give you that right.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The two different systems serve the same purpose - to better manage the<br>&gt; &gt;traffic. They may look quite similar, just coming from different direction,<br>&gt; &gt;but the social repercussion is significant.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;In Singapore, the no U-turn without sign culture has permeated every level<br>&gt; &gt;of our thinking and every segment of our life. This no U-turn has created a<br>&gt; &gt;way of life that is based on rules. When there is a U-turn sign or when<br>&gt; &gt;there is a rule, we can U-turn. When there is no sign, we cannot U-turn.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;When there is no rule, we cannot do anything. We become paralyzed.<br>&gt; &gt;I call this "no-rule=no-do" phenomenon - the "No U-Turn Syndrome" or NUTS.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Singapore has prospered under a rule-based system for many years. When we<br>&gt; &gt;were at a lower level of development, we needed many multi-national<br>&gt; &gt;companies to come to Singapore to invest. What these MNCs needed were a very<br>&gt; &gt;reliable group of managers and workers who could follow exactly the rules<br>&gt; &gt;set by corporate headquarters overseas. Since they did not want their<br>&gt; &gt;overseas subsidiaries to innovate anything, they wanted us to stick closely<br>&gt; &gt;to the rules, no funny deals, no crazy ideas. They were here to teach us,<br>&gt; &gt;not to listen to ideas from us.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The efficiency and no-nonsense style of the Singapore government is<br>&gt; &gt;well-known. It has brought us prosperity and a good life. A rule-based<br>&gt; &gt;system is essential here too to get everybody to toe the line.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;But the world has changed. And it is changing faster and faster. So fast<br>&gt; &gt;that the rules that were set yesterday are no longer valid and cannot serve<br>&gt; &gt;our new needs. It is not a matter of setting new rules to meet the new<br>&gt; &gt;situation because by the time new rules are formulated, they would already<br>&gt; &gt;be out ofdate. It is a matter of how to survive and prosper in environments<br>&gt; &gt;where they are no rules.It is a matter of how to live with ambiguity. Things<br>&gt; &gt;are no more black or white, things are in shades of gray. How do we deal<br>&gt; &gt;with them?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;What is NUTS?<br>&gt; &gt;NUTS is when you want to do something and you seek the approval of a higher<br>&gt; &gt;authority. When there is no rule saying that you can do such a thing, then<br>&gt; &gt;the standard answer is NO.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;What is wrong with this? There is nothing wrong if we choose to be stuck in<br>&gt; &gt;the old world of our own where nothing changes.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;To meet the challenge of the new world, to meet the challenge of rising to a<br>&gt; &gt;knowledge-based economy, we have to innovate like mad. How can we innovate<br>&gt; &gt;when we need to obey rules to innovate? Innovate means to create things out<br>&gt; &gt;of nothing, it means moving into uncharted territories where there are no<br>&gt; &gt;rules.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;How can you innovate when you have to get approval of somebody who looks at<br>&gt; &gt;a rule-book first?<br>&gt; &gt;Such is the syndrome of NUTS. NUTS is everywhere in the society including<br>&gt; &gt;schools, offices, hospitals, parks, factories and even in our homes. Yes, in<br>&gt; &gt;Creative (Singapore) too. Here are some hilarious examples, they make you<br>&gt; &gt;want to laugh and cry at the same time. I am sure you can tell me more.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;NUTS #2-"Creative Resource"-needed approval?<br>&gt; &gt;When our corporate headquarters were completed in 1997, we needed to give it<br>&gt; &gt;a name. The placeholder name was Creative Technology Centre. Made sense, but<br>&gt; &gt;it was a boring name that everybody had. I wanted a special name, because we<br>&gt; &gt;are "creative". So the usual names like, "Creative Building, Plaza, Complex,<br>&gt; &gt;House..." were suggested on the name list. I rejected all of them. Finally<br>&gt; &gt;we came out with a very good name, "Creative Resource" - the source of all<br>&gt; &gt;creativity - and everybody loved it.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;But wait, before we could go ahead, we had to submit the building name for<br>&gt; &gt;approval. What! I was shocked. I needed somebody else"s approval for the<br>&gt; &gt;name of my own building. By some faceless committee that I did not even know<br>&gt; &gt;existed. Imagine having the name of your baby being approved by somebody you<br>&gt; &gt;do not know.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Hey, that is the regulation. OK, we submitted and no prize for guessing the<br>&gt; &gt;right answer. The answer was NO. The reason given was that the name was not<br>&gt; &gt;"Centre, Plaza, Building, Complex, House etc..." There was actually a list<br>&gt; &gt;of approved names in the rulebook and we were only given the impression that<br>&gt; &gt;we could name our own building.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;I nearly jumped through the roof when I heard the answer. It was a very<br>&gt; &gt;typical case of NUTS. "Resource" was not in their rule book, hence the<br>&gt; &gt;standard answer was NO. I was not going to give up on this right. So we<br>&gt; &gt;fought back and wrote letters to appeal. Finally, after a long process, our<br>&gt; &gt;name was approved. Whew!<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;NUTS #3 - Cannot sing Singapore songs!!<br>&gt; &gt;While we were preparing for the opening ceremony of Creative Resource, we<br>&gt; &gt;wanted to have a lot of creative fun. We prepared a lot of performances by<br>&gt; &gt;our own staff. We were very fortunate to have invited the Prime Minister, Mr<br>&gt; &gt;Goh Chok Tong to grace the event. We wanted to show him the best creativity<br>&gt; &gt;in us.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The opening fanfare idea was to have a big group of kids running into the<br>&gt; &gt;building, singing a medley of Patriotic Singapore Songs. It was going to be<br>&gt; &gt;very delightful. After the songs were arranged and recorded, at the last<br>&gt; &gt;moment, someone in the team decided that we actually needed to seek approval<br>&gt; &gt;from the authority because of copyright issues. The answer came back was of<br>&gt; &gt;course a NO.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;There was no rule to say that you could do a medley of Singapore songs.<br>&gt; &gt;There was a rule that said we could sing the Singapore song in special<br>&gt; &gt;celebratory occasions like ours, so this was allowed.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Our people started to panic, because there was no time to change the<br>&gt; &gt;recordings. They sought my advice. They were thinking of canceling this<br>&gt; &gt;delightful fanfare and disappointing the kids, from our Creative O<br>&gt; &gt;child-care centre, who had practiced so hard for this event.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;I asked them why they had thought of seeking approval for a private function<br>&gt; &gt;especially when the answer could be a No. they were afraid that the TV<br>&gt; &gt;stations were there filming and it might have constituted a copyright<br>&gt; &gt;infringement!<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;There were a few NUTS at work here. First it is my own staff who were NUTS,<br>&gt; &gt;they were toeing the line so tightly that they felt the need to seek<br>&gt; &gt;approval for a private function that was not controversial at all. I was<br>&gt; &gt;sure that the PM would give his 100% endorsement. Then we had the NUTS at<br>&gt; &gt;the approval side who looked at the rule book and said No.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;I asked them to go ahead and just do it, even violating the rejection<br>&gt; &gt;letter. Some of my NUTS staff must have freaked out. I told them I would<br>&gt; &gt;bear the full responsibility. If I had to pay a $2000 fine, I would pay it.<br>&gt; &gt;In the worst, worst case I might go to jail for it - that would be<br>&gt; &gt;interesting too.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;In fact, the PM in his impromptu part of his speech also said, to move<br>&gt; &gt;forward, we would have to "just do it". It was a timely message.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;NUTS #4 - No Title<br>&gt; &gt;Recently, Creative had just spent a few million dollars investing heavily in<br>&gt; &gt;a company. The key person in the company was needed urgently to launch a new<br>&gt; &gt;".com" project that could be worth a lot more in the future. In the era of<br>&gt; &gt;the Internet, timing is everything.<br>&gt; &gt;Then suddenly, he told me that he needed to go for reservist during the<br>&gt; &gt;critical period. This meant that his whole team could be crippled because<br>&gt; &gt;his leadership was not there. I told him that there should not be a problem,<br>&gt; &gt;as he could always apply for a deferment. In fact, the Deputy Prime Minister<br>&gt; &gt;has told me in the Technopreneur 21 committee that, reservist duties should<br>&gt; &gt;not hinder Technopreneurship because the affected reservist could apply for<br>&gt; &gt;deferment and it would be considered favourably.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;So the staff wrote a letter to apply for deferment. It was rejected. I told<br>&gt; &gt;him to write an appeal, mentioning Creative"s involvement and all the<br>&gt; &gt;relevant and valid reasons for such critically needed deferment. It was<br>&gt; &gt;still rejected and we were running out of time.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;I guess I had to step in. I wrote the letter personally again, citing all<br>&gt; &gt;the reasons and the ".com" time-critical factors. It was still rejected. I<br>&gt; &gt;was very upset by this. It was already the last working day before he had to<br>&gt; &gt;go in-camp.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;I had to call the officer personally. I identified myself, including my role<br>&gt; &gt;in the Technopreneur 21 committee and appealed for the fourth time. The<br>&gt; &gt;answer was still NO. after all the reasons were given, the answer was still<br>&gt; &gt;NO. Well, they had liberalized then - if you were a new employee of a<br>&gt; &gt;company, the deferment would be allowed. I argued strenuously that the key<br>&gt; &gt;person was more than a new employee. He was a new employee of a company for<br>&gt; &gt;which we had spent millions to acquire. No! An acquisition does not<br>&gt; &gt;constitute the equivalent of a new employee. A new employee IS a new<br>&gt; &gt;employee. Period. The rule book never said that the people in a new<br>&gt; &gt;acquisition are new employees. Therefore they are not "new employees",<br>&gt; &gt;regardless of the fact that their employee status are the same in principle.<br>&gt; &gt;It does not matter if you are Sim Wong Hoo or the T21 chairman. NUTS is<br>&gt; &gt;NUTS.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;It almost drove me NUTS!<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Fortunately, I heard from some people that I would get a better chance if I<br>&gt; &gt;were to call the unit Commanding Officer. I asked for his name and phone<br>&gt; &gt;number and the officer obliged. I managed to track down the CO on his<br>&gt; &gt;handphone at the very last minute. The CO was an understanding man because<br>&gt; &gt;he was also a reservist and in the computer line. The deferment was finally<br>&gt; &gt;granted<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;NUTS #5 - Creative NUTS<br>&gt; &gt;We had our equal share of NUTS in Creative and they really drove me NUTS<br>&gt; &gt;because they actually happened right on my head, the CEO of the company.<br>&gt; &gt;Such is the persistence and universality of NUTS.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;First example, the time I needed some CD-ROM replicated for some last-minute<br>&gt; &gt;projects. I knew I had time because, we had an in-house CD-ROM replication<br>&gt; &gt;plant and it would have taken less than one day to finish the job,<br>&gt; &gt;especially my small little job of a few hundred pieces.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;But when my assistant came back, she told me helplessly that they needed a<br>&gt; &gt;one-week lead-time. I almost jumped off my chair. This was a rush job for<br>&gt; &gt;the CEO and they just threw back their standard lead-time at me, it was<br>&gt; &gt;clearly written in their rule-book that the standard lead-time was one week<br>&gt; &gt;- for a rush job. So one week was what you would get even if you were the<br>&gt; &gt;CEO of the<br>&gt; &gt;company, even if your job was very important.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;I asked them who set the rules? They were the ones who set the rules! I was<br>&gt; &gt;amazed how NUTS they were. Then change the rules, I told them.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Finally they did it for me in two days.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;There were several of such examples within Creative. And the managers<br>&gt; &gt;sometimes fought with me because that was the only way they could ensure the<br>&gt; &gt;quality of the products. Quality is good when we are shipping products to<br>&gt; &gt;customers. But when we need to rush, it is always during the early stages of<br>&gt; &gt;engineering run, where we need a lot of samples to test. Quality then<br>&gt; &gt;becomes secondary and time is primary. Staff with a NUTS mentality would not<br>&gt; &gt;have the flexibility to do such a switch, unless you make another rule. And<br>&gt; &gt;you can only live within the new rules.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;NUTS #6 - More Creative NUTS<br>&gt; &gt;The second example in Creative has to do with customer support. Creative<br>&gt; &gt;pride ourselves as a company that provides the best technical support. All<br>&gt; &gt;our staff know that. We have 400 people in Oklahoma USA, just listening to<br>&gt; &gt;phone calls alone. We have a small technical/customer support team in<br>&gt; &gt;Singapore serving only the small Singapore market. The team is hardworking<br>&gt; &gt;and dedicated to the company. In general, their service is good and<br>&gt; &gt;efficient - when there are rules.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;There was once when I received a customer"s letter addressed to me<br>&gt; &gt;complaining about our customer support department (CSD) with regards to a<br>&gt; &gt;missing CD from our product. Our CSD insisted that the customer get the CD<br>&gt; &gt;from his dealer who sold him the PC with our product. And the customers<br>&gt; &gt;attached the letters of exchange. It was such a minor issue but I felt<br>&gt; &gt;customer satisfaction was most important. So I wrote a small note and asked<br>&gt; &gt;them to give him the CD and be done with it. CD-ROMs are very cheap anyway.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;A few weeks later, I received another letter from this furious customer<br>&gt; &gt;complaining that our CSD wanted to charge him like $15 for the CD because it<br>&gt; &gt;was the responsibility of the dealer to give it to him. And he attached even<br>&gt; &gt;more letters for me to read.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;I was very upset this time because, what could have been a very simple and<br>&gt; &gt;pleasant customer support issue, costing the company less than $1 for the<br>&gt; &gt;CD-ROM if people in CSD had just given it to him in the first place, now<br>&gt; &gt;potentially cost the company a bomb:<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Firstly, the CSD"s time to write all those letters of exhange, they are way,<br>&gt; &gt;way over $1. But because of NUTS, our CSD people did not see it. They are<br>&gt; &gt;just trying to follow rules when there are no rules in such situation.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Secondly, the CEO"s time. I had to read about ten letters two times to<br>&gt; &gt;figure out the gist of it all. It must have cost the company thousands of<br>&gt; &gt;dollars. And even after my first instruction to just give him the CD-ROM,<br>&gt; &gt;they still went into a cat and mouse chase to try to ask him to pay $15.<br>&gt; &gt;Someone in CSD probably set the rule that if a customer wanted an extra<br>&gt; &gt;CD-ROM, it would<br>&gt; &gt;cost him $15 - that is it, regardless of the plight of the customer.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Thirdly,the most expensive part - the harm it had done to our brand name. A<br>&gt; &gt;potentially unhappy customer would hurt the company way beyond the customer.<br>&gt; &gt;He would tell all his friends not to buy from the company.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;But people with NUTS mentality could not see beyond the rules. They could<br>&gt; &gt;not see that a $1 CD-ROM was much, much cheaper than their own time, their<br>&gt; &gt;CEO"s time and the value of the brand name.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;I had to call all the three persons involved in this case to my office and<br>&gt; &gt;explain to them very slowly about our principle of customer support. You<br>&gt; &gt;could not fault them for dedication, they were trying to make an extra $15<br>&gt; &gt;for the company. Not seeing the big picture of how much more it would cost<br>&gt; &gt;the company. I had told them that for us, the customer"s interest is always<br>&gt; &gt;in the #1 position. I told them that they were the "customer"s advocates" -<br>&gt; &gt;they had to be fighting with me for their customer"s interest, rather than<br>&gt; &gt;the other way round.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Finally, told them to call up the customer directly, apologize and give him<br>&gt; &gt;the CD-ROM he wanted and ensure that the customer was 100% satisfied. If the<br>&gt; &gt;customers are not satisfied - we should not take their money.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;We are moving faster and faster into many uncharted territories, where there<br>&gt; &gt;are no rules. We do not want to be paralyzed by waiting for the rule to be<br>&gt; &gt;formulated before moving - it will be too late. We have to discard our NUTS<br>&gt; &gt;mentality and learn to live in a new world where there are no clear rules.<br>&gt; &gt;Not that it will be a cowboy lawless land. There will be broad guiding<br>&gt; &gt;principles such as common goals, objectives and basic integrity to follow.<br>&gt; &gt;The rest, we have to look at the big picture and decide what is the best way<br>&gt; &gt;to do a job, to achieve our goals.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Sim Wong Hoo<br>&gt; &gt;Excerpt from "No U-Turn Syndrome (NUTS)"<br>&gt; &gt;Chaotic Thoughts from the Old Millennium</div>
