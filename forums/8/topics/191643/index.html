Society shouldn't overshadow anyone's life.<br><br>Anyways, u also said yourself: "unless you are biogenetically made to prefer guy"<br><br>and thats the problem isn't it? Most gays biogenetically LIKE guys. So why shouldn't they be gay? Any why shouldn't they be gay because society discriminates against them? Society should not stand still, it should progres. How would society further progress towards enlightenment if people submit to society's prejudices instead of challenging and fighting it?<br><br>Anyway, the reason society is so prejudiced against gay, is not because man is prejudiced. There is a very simple reason. Society has more gay people that anyone realises. Prejudice arises when a large number of gay people cannot accept that they're gay, and turn homophobic.<br><br>I'll ask u a question:<br><br>What sort of straight man gets sexually aroused by male homosexual porn films?<br><br>The answer would be: homophobic men.<br><br>This is not an empty claim. Numerious studies have been done with regards to the source of homophobia. I'll show u all one below:<br><br>A journal from National Center for Biotechnology Information:<br><br><strong>IS HOMOPHOBIA ASSOCIATED WITH HOMOSEXUAL AROUSAL?</strong><br><br>by Henry E. Adams, Ph.D., Lester W. Wright, Jr., Ph.D. and Bethany A. Lohr<br>Department of Psychology, University of Georgia, Athens 30602-3013, USA.<br><br>Abstract:<br><br>The authors investigated the role of homosexual arousal in exclusively heterosexual men who admitted negative affect toward homosexual individuals. Participants consisted of a group of homophobic men (n = 35) and a group of nonhomophobic men (n = 29); they were assigned to groups on the basis of their scores on the Index of Homophobia (W. W. Hudson &amp; W. A. Ricketts, 1980). The men were exposed to sexually explicit erotic stimuli consisting of heterosexual, male homosexual, and lesbian videotapes, and changes in penile circumference were monitored. They also completed an Aggression Questionnaire (A. H. Buss &amp; M. Perry, 1992). Both groups exhibited increases in penile circumference to the heterosexual and female homosexual videos. Of the 2 groups, 80% of the homophobic men showed an increase in penile erection to male homosexual stimuli as opposed to only 33% for non-homophobic men. The groups did not differ in aggression. <span style="color: red;">Homophobia is apparently associated with homosexual arousal that the homophobic individual is either unaware of or denies.</span><br><br></div>
