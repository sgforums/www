Maybe u angry with Ngee Ann cause u not happy with ur course dept or something. All I know my dept has the best lecturers ever.<br><br>Peace,<br>SpookyKid<br><br>Love is the Dance of Eternity</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I you think so badly of the wardens. Than how you think of the policemen patrolling along the street? How you think of bus drivers attitude inside the bus? I think the attitude of those policemen and bus drivers are worst than the warden. Have you been NS? Than how you think of the attitude of officers as compare to wardens?<br><br>If you think the food sucks, than don't go to that stalls. There are plenty of stalls in NP. Why torture yourself by going to those stalls?<br><br>NP ripped you off? How about NUS and NTU. I think they are sucking your blood and breaking your bones if you study there.<br><br>If you want to say NP sucks, you prove to me their teaching is lousy, the lecturers are lousy, facilities lousy.<br><br>------------------<br>It takes a hour to like someone, it take a day to love someone and take a lifetime to forget someone<br><br>[This message has been edited by millennium (edited 14 June 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WELL, i've juz went thru all of the comments from the differnt people,and i think those of u wwho r in Ngee Ann Poly,and do not like their policies, should come together and speak out to the HEAD PRINCIPAL,especially about the Wardens. They serve NO real purpose,i see them as ,OLD FARTs, who go around like BLOODY Chee HONG,looking at the young Ladies,who dress nicely and DROOL at them........Infact there is one incident i can recall ,when i was there having my lunch with some friends,and the Bi-spectacle warden(look around u cant miss him,he got curly type hair) was looking at a group of girls,in spagetti strip(i dont know what u call them)drooling at them,when they gave himm the look ,he then was not happy and GaVE THEM a warning letter.  That Bloody PERvert of a GUy actually after drooling for about 10 minutes at the group of girls,gave them a warning letter and told them to put on a jacket and also a letter.......I mean they serve no purpose ,but keep the seats in their little office warm....so i think Ngee Ann Poly should rid the poly of the warden system....As for lecturers,well i shall not mention namess but some are total and urterly useless... They should not be in the teaching profession in the first place...F**kers,some juz come in for the lectures,read ,word for word from the lecture notes and when asked a question,juz reads out the same thing from the lecture notes,not explaining with examples to make the students understand the topics,also there are times during the practical session when the lecturer are suppose to be teaching,they disappear for the whole 2 hour lessons and only reappear 10 minutes b4 the lesson end and asked student whether they got any problems,all student not being able to do a thing of course says no,and the lesson is over.....BASTARDS i tell u...........THIs is what Ngee ann hires Useless lecturer and useless wardens,...And let me Tell u about the Student Union now, the Bastards and Bitches who run it,Students who think they are better then the rest......just because they r given a post higher up to other students......Bunch of Snobs should wake up and realise that they are no better then the rest.......AND TO THOSE GOING FOR THE FOC camp be wary of all those S.L.s who are all wolf and crocodiles ,who prey on you ,juz to get a DATE on Saturday nite................bunch of perverts....Onli reasons to join the Student leaders are just to get to know year one female freshmen and male freshmen,......sick.......F**king sick<br>SO BE VERY WEARY WHEN going to Ngee Ann POly!!<br></div>
