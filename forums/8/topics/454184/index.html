              <p>The cane was really scary!</p>
              <p>When i was 7 years old i failed my maths quiz. My mother very angry and cane me. I have marks all over my body. <br>After which, i added laxative to her coffee. However, the laxative wasn't concentrated enough to make have diarrhea.</p>
              <p>When i was 7 and a 1/2 years old, i cheated in my english spelling test and my mum was informed. I was caned. <br>After which, i mixed more laxative into my mum's milo. I think she got diarrhea</p>
              <p>When i was 9 years old, i was involved in a fight with my primary school friend. The discipline master called my mum and i was caned.<br>After which, again, i mixed laxative into the curry she cooked. I make sure everyone got diarrhea, and make sure she got blamed.</p>
              <p>When i was 10 years old, i was caught mixing laxative into the huge container of chendol dessert during a buffet held by my primary school. <br>I got caned again.<br>After which, i mixed laxative into my mum's green bean dessert as well.</p>
              <p>It takes a long time for my mum to realise that everytime i got caned, she would get diarhhea.</p>
              <p>When i was in secondary school, i was involved in a fight and i insulted the discipline master's parents. I was caned by him<br>After which, i didn't mix laxative into his drink, i dripped a generous amount of super glue onto his car's windscreen wiper, i didn't know if it worked or not.<br><br>I shall add on to this list when i recall more caning memories</p>

              <p>My mom used to buy those really thin ones.</p>
              <p>She said it was because the thin ones sting when struck and the skin would welt up shortly after. And when people saw the welts they would know I was a naughty boy.</p>
              <p>She had initially wanted to use those bamboo sticks for hanging clothes to whack me but said that I would suffer internal injuries or broken bones and she would be arrested</p>
              <p>Anyway I remember my brother used to rush to those canes and hide them else where whenever my mom got mad to protect me from those vicious beatings but being the smart lady that she was, she had an alternative cane on stand by ......</p>
              <p>When those canes started to get splintered ends either through wear and tear or( due to my clever plan of cutting them with a scissors so they would not hurt as bad) she would grab anything and hum tam me, mostly cloth hangers ...</p>
              <p>Did these canning make me a better boy? No...infact I grew more resistant to the pain and got even worst........</p>

              <p>I heard my friend comment that the hubby would stand holding the
              cane and whoosh it around if the 7 year old son doesn't want to do
              his maths homework. </p>
