(gd thing is heÂ’ll always pay me once his pay comes.) my disposable income is lower than him, but lucky thing is, I dun spend much, so I usually hav enuf to lend him.<br><br>I did bring up nicely to him abt spending so much on the camera, lens, accessories and bags. His reply was, Â“ I may die anytime. If dun try nw, when wan to tryÂ”<br><br>I was quite disappointed when I heard that. IÂ’m nt desparate to settle dwn. Juz that I felt that weÂ’r alrdy in our 20s.. shld start planning for the future alrdy, esp in such a fast-paced Singapore.<br><br>He mentioned in the past, his ex made a lot of noise when he was into fishing. At that point, I didnÂ’t understand how bad it was, and I casually remarked that she shldnt be unreasonable coz fishing isnÂ’t a bad thing (if u compared to wasting money on drinking. No offense to drinkers out there.)<br><br>But nw, IÂ’m starting to see a bigger picture. And I sort of understand y she was unhappy abt it.<br><br>And since he started buying the camera stuff, the idea of joint acct was slowly put aside. Problem is, nt that I very gian his money. Its becoz he has a study loan to repay. So IÂ’m wondering how long itÂ’ll take for us to start saving up for our future. Coz the loan amt isnÂ’t small. After saving for that, then can save for future.

            <div class='col-md body'>TS, you can go ask tamago about camera thingy. But for entry level shooter, I think it's kinda useless to spend sooo much money on acc and equip unless your bf is taking some course in polytechnic/uni about digital imaging etc...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Y_Shun:</div><div class="quote_body">i think hor if she really did this, the relationship ending soon already...</div></blockquote>First of all , she has no guarantee that she is going to marry him. So I think a joint account is really out of the question. Joint accounts happen when you establish trust .In their relationship , with him spending on photography stuff and overspending - it is going to end already! sooner or later she will resent him for spending money on his stuff and he will resent her for showing unhappiness.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you love and he loves you as well, this situation wouldnt have arises.<br><br>Let him be what he wants to be. As long as at the end of the day, he is back in your arms, is enough already. From what you mention, he is a very responsible guy. He pays you and the loans back.<br><br>This camera thing is just a phase. Sooner or later, like fishing, the craze in him will be over. Be thankful he is not spending his time alone without you knowing what he is doing. example, girls or clubs or wadever bad.<br><br>So yeah, learn the art of zendo and just let everything be as it is. Do not tense yourself. Cos if you do, you will tense him up as well and more problems will arise.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
