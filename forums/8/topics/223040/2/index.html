            <div class='col-md body'>Hi littlepea,<br><br>Well you should just not transfer extra money to the join account. One word, no money he cannot buy. Also if he does not save then transfer less to the joint account , safe in your own account.<br><br>If he say - Â“ I may die anytime. If dun try nw, when wan to tryÂ” - don't worry people who so say this one alway last one to die !!!  Tell him that if he may die anytime, there is more reason for him to save, so you got money to buy him a nice coffin, grand funeral.<br><br>Well if overspending in photography beyond his limit , it is addiction.  So what it is not drinking .... still it bring problems .<br><br>He got a study loan to pay somemore..... !!! One thing this one you have to put your feet down, he must put a certain money into the joint account, and that one is use for saving and family. His photography come from his own saving that is if he have it .<br><br>If he does not understand it, then forget it , let him go .... no matter how much you love him, sometime if like what he say, anytime can die - that time without even money for food and coffin, what is there love to talk about .<br></div>

I too too take up fishing  then photography .... and it will get more expensive <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  . Face the fact, if you do not put a stop to it , it will get worst ... it is call addiction.<br><br>With study loan, he already overspend .... you may just have to put a stop to it now, and if needed walk away if he does not . Face the fact ... if now with study loan he overspend ... later how with study load + house load + marriage bill then bady bill ?  You think if he cannot handle it now, with other bills coming in he can handle it and stop ?<br><br>If he love his camera more then he love you , then he is someone not for you .... maybe a painful truth , but you have to face it now or sometime in the future also.

            <div class='col-md body'>scary. my boyfriend also like that. ask him to save up he say no ability to. Sure.. he's a full-time student, but I last time full-time student also can save wat.<br><br>anyway, joint-account biz is really when the two of you are en route to getting married. Or, unless you create an account where the money can only be put in and not taken out (or only by you lah), AND that you match what he put in dollar for dollar (less nvm, but never more).<br><br>But yeah, i see your problem. i've got the same problem. same dilemma. if by the time he starts working and still have this problem then...... i guess i won't be thinking too much of a future together.</div>
