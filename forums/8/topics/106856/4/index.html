            <div class='col-md body'>the problem with these chinese nationals is that they arrive in singapore and expect us to bow to them and their culture. they treat this place as home with no respect for the real hosts (us) and they make noise everywhere. they're an eyesore. when in rome do as the romans do. else it's just plain piss-offing, i dun pity them. they deserve it. if you dun assimilate, dun expect a warm welcome..<br><br>and yes china students ARE robbing local students of scholarships... dear people who are working, your tax money is partly going into giving these people (and many of them) scholarships.<br><br>i would like the government to explain why chinese scholars arrive here in singapore 6 months before the uni term starts in sinapore, pick up local culture (which is still lost on them by the way) and some modules. how is that fair to local and other foreign students? please tell me..<br><br>meanwhile... eyesore eyesore... earsore... yesterday i saw a bunch of chinese teenagers in the joo chiat area talking so loudly (as usual)... wake up singaporeans, they are spoiling our culture and our previously idyllic and quiet towns..!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>foxwalk... I know about my tax dollar and I know how these prc treat locals as 2nd class. I know prc think they are the best and they are superior and cultured and refined, when they do not have the social grace to conduct themselves properly or use public facilities with more civility. i know they think its their right to strut around in another chinese dominated country and run it to the ground like they did in prc because the local government has so many loop holes but are too stupid to realise it. I know about the prostitution by both peidu mothers as well as their children who work in geylang bars for fast money and entice all the faithless men. I resent the fact that there are so many locals who sympathise these prc where they came on their own and created social issues for us, but yet do not sympathise the locals who have to put up with them and that we never invited them here in the first place. we open our tourism but it was interpreted as a means to come here and do illegal acts and to "marry/escape" out of their country for a rich lifestyle. I totally resent having anyone of them prc here, be they good or bad. America did not have the same issue with britain cause they declare themseves as america, they never called themselves brits. Neighter should we be just classified as formerly china citizens as I recognise myself as Singaproean and I correct every ang mog I come across when they mistaken me for some prc garbage. We should recognise our singapore as a sourveign state, like Lee Hsian Loong in his strong stance insisting on Taiwan visit that we should not allow some prc garbage to tell us what we can or cannot do. We are not their dogs and we will not allow them to treat us as one...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>saddest thing is that local families are paying the price for whatever social ills these prc brings... everyone pities that prc and makes excuses and say they are in foreign land or they are poor, but does that justify them coming here and doing such things? Then I am poor, should i go rob a bank? I was told to understand their lives in china is difficult (i beg to differ). Besides,I don't think its as difficult as those families whose lives they broken and have to live with faithless husbands who brings home prc diseases and emptied family bank accounts on these prc on the pretext of pity (and self gratification). Then how come no one pity the old 80 yr olds along China towns, picking up soda cans for their living, sleeping on the corridor cause they have no housing.  Why do we go all out to help the parasidic prc when our own people, needed our help.

SG chinese start acknowledging chinese roots and migrate back to mainland <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote>It's indeed the toughest thing in the world to persuade and inform others that race and nationality are mutually exclusive.Why do lamers still walk around with the twisted mindset that race = nationality?<br><br>To hell with the Japanese, in WW2, they are not even socially and mentally developed enough to be able to differentiate between people of the same race but with different upbringing.And today, some of them are still the same backward buffoons that still cling on like a newborn does, to the idea that a homogenous race is the pinnacle of evolution.They possess the same mentality as mainland Chinese, so I guess we can safely say that those who idolise and worship the Japs are no different from the myopic creatures I mentioned earlier.SG Chinese will never consider China their motherland, and why should they, since she has not nurtured them, provided them with their life foundation and the basis of their life stories and memetic experiences.I'm proud to be born in the Malay Archipelago and grow up in a social context where I learn at a young age that I do not belong to any supreme race.<br><br>In the end, it's all about personal opinion, but I guess when the sheep are trundling over the cliff, us smart rams amongst them must go against the flow to survive based on our own initiative and choosing, and if we gore some of our fellow sheep, so be it.It's about evolution of the mind and the need to eliminate such antiquated attiudes.The war of ideas is not over, in fact, we have not even reached the peak of it.Stay firm and never give in to racists and fascists of the bloodline.</div>

You just don't need to say it out or show it.<br><br>Coming from the other side of the fence ,the australians don't really like me "taking jobs" from their own , this i know full well but we respect each other professionally . We treat each other  civilly  and some of the "objectors" are my friends now who still tell me how they feel because they know I won't be offended. Some people can call it racism but I value it as freedom of thought and speech without intention to hurt.<br><br>However , I have friends from PRC, hongkong  in australia and I find them same as any other person out on the street. yes I find some of them disgusting in their social etiquette but some are genuinely nice and try to change if you correct them politely in their social ways.  We respect each other because we are the "same people" in a foreign land which is australia. Our common language, unfortunately,  is one in a foreign land which holds us chinese together. Those who have been to Singapore has commented on the  horrible way the Singaporean Chinese treat each other and the PRC chinese.</div>

The post you quoted was in direct response to Vito_corleone.<br><br>I said b4 we should suck up to them only as long as we benefit, and for no other reason. Not because of some ideal that we chinese should band together, nor because of past technological prowess.<br><br>I NEVER said that china is not strong technologically now. I simply don't know about that.<br>--------------------<br><br>Yes and i agree that singaporeans generally think quite low of the PRCians (?). Maybe its due to the Hong Kong movies we watched durin the 90s where the "tong zi" are protrayed as either:<br><br>Kung fu Masters from some backward village,<br>Aintique smugglers from some backward village,<br>Gangsters from some backward, depraved city,<br>Prostitutes from some backward village OR<br>some poor relative from some backward village<br><br>I dunno. THing is i think this bias against them actually rubs off in the way we tok to them and deal with them. My housemate now is a PRCian and i find that sometimes i get too short with him. It is TRUE that they are loud. I dunno why, but that is their way i guess. My House mate last yar was a PRCian who couldnt speak proper eglish at all and i was even shoter with her. Not overtly, but there was certainly an underlying tension. Am working on getting rid of that though. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Seriously, i have no idea why i am biased aginst them - certainly illogical.<br><br>Maybe this rubs off them and they reciprocate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am a Singaporean Chinese.<br><br>I do not have a particular feeling for the China National (like or dislike). The fact is all of us are born differently, in terms of character, national and attitude. We have to learn to be adapted and get use to living with people of all races, national and character. We should never try to make ourselves avoid people that we dislike or fear. Rather, learn to understand and challenge ourselves to accept different people from different country.<br><br>It is most unfortunate that families were broken by these China ladies. But aren't our men too easily susceptible too them?<br><br>There is no doubts that China will be the next super-economy in the World. There are now the world-manufacturer. If you do read the papers, you will know that the US will be importing automobiles from China. However, I do agreed that the China government exercise more control on corporate goverance, intellectual property and etc. In addition, they should also learn to be more humble in their dealing with other nations.<br><br>But then again, aren't we accused by our neighbours that we ourselves are arrogant?<br><br></div>
