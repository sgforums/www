For them, the upbringing are a constant fight for everything and anything.<br><br>After the opening up, the costal cities are better off due to trades.  Even now ( I was in Shanghai yesterday), the Shanghainese still despise their own ppl from other cities like Hu-Nan, Hu bei etc.<br><br>These are also the ppl tat u c standing the streets in Geylang, trying to con ppl in the heartland.  Y? it is becos they have not attained the basic necessites for a comfortable life yet (inner cities china is still extremely poor).  So they r still fighting the old war.<br><br>Hopefully, they will eventually be on par with the rest of the whole and they will not need to fight anymore.  However it will take a while before that happens.  BUT it will not solve the problem, there will always be conners and street walkers.

            <div class='col-md body'>I find it offensive that you refer to "divisions" between Chinese Nationals and Singaporean Chinese. I reiterate; I am Singaporean. My ethnicity does not mean much in this discussion. They are my own "kind" only as much as humans are my own "kind".<br><br>To talk about taiwan, singapore and PRC uniting together simply because we are the same color is wrong. As singaporeans, our first concern should be singapore's interest. If it is in our interest to suck up to India, then we should do it. Color != relevant.<br><br>Clearly there is a problem of generalising. As you pointed out, ethnic Chinese are being lumped together by the japanese. I have experienced that in the UK too. But then the solution is not that we unite with all yellow skins; the solution is through better promotion of Singapore as a country.<br><br>Also re the arguments of "the thais, indians, etc also do it", i find that quite unhelpful. At best it tells us that other nationalities also contgribute to singapore's social ills. Yet it doesn't change the fact that chinese nationals do contribute to sg's social problems.<br><br>Fact: Chinese nationals have, directly or indirectly, contributed to social problems in singapore. I find no convincing evidence to show that our policy of wooing chinese students here have helped Sg in any significant way, esp since they are paying the same amount, if not a lower amount of school fees as citizens. This is not to say we should not suck up to china though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not ashamed of being a chinese, but the fact that the RPC has really casused quite a bit of social illness since their arrival. Not that all of them are that bad, but sadly is MOST of them.<br><br>I'd known some PRC "scholars" that are being subsidised to study here with contract, you know what they say? "Finish the education here, get the cert. then go home, change a name, go other country find better paid job. and that SG goverment is so stupid to "sponsor" their course.<br><br>The "accompanying mother" for the kids seeking education in Sg? on the pretext of "taking care of their kid", but most of the time i hear about them trying to hook up some men be it old or married... so long got $$ can liaoz. I still can't get over Huang Na's case, whereby the mum came to Sg on the pretext of looking after her daughter but actual fact she was the "agent" to get more PRC women into Sg for whatever intentions. S'poreans "donated" generously when she "lost" her daughter and gave such "sad" story, but when the media found out she'd entered Sg illegally and as a different name, she said we change our attitude faster than the weather. Wah leow! The current husband also PTE LTD... still dare to lie to the public... how to have high regards for them?<br><br>Then for those females whom married local males, ain't doing well either. My good friend married this "Fujian" woman and she darm arragont when talking, now that she offically "ROMed" with my friend, she kept saying she don't want to go back to the poor days and how she despise her own village ppl, and is asking for new handphone and wants to go meet her other China friends in SG. She came here expecting to be served and expect to have a maid at her call... she now so sorry for coming... i pity my friend honestly.<br><br>Not saying at we locals are very good and perfect, but the sad thing is that RPC have only reflected most of the bad images instead of the good ones. Sometimes i really prefer the Bangalas (pardon me not knowing how to spell) to these PRC.</div>

She brings her whoring to the house every night midnight and they would do till 3 or 5 am, When I confronted her and asked that she keeps to normal hours, she said this is normal singapore night life and she has her right to treat the house as she like. Real bit.ch!  I know first hand what they fu.ck these bit.ches do and what they say and how they do it. He daughter sits in the living room waiting for her mom to finish whatever she needs to do with the guy. Oh the guy's name: Bruch (read as Bruce). Anyone in business knows this name, please screw him ??? When I asked for more normal hours, the guy came forth and said he can charge me in court for making a demand and said  he is treating my house as a transit! So he's rich enough to pay for a cheena bit.ch but cannot go hotel? fu.ck!  (Yea my bf's mom who i rented from assured me I am safe even when I told her the conditions I live with.
