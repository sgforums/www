They were well educated and came here, for god knows what stupid reason. They never gave any of their kids any education. Taught one of them to smoke opium till the day he died. Gave one of the kid some education but spoil him so bad he squandered away the money. My father had to work and keep his family togather since he was 5. We lived in poverty for many years. My relatives in China kept writing over to collect free money and they build themselves a mansion with the best Dali Marble and they export Tiger prawns and had been earning large sums of money but still they kept asking for cash from a priverty stricken family who always scrapped money for them. Till one day, one of my father's side relative gone back and came back with stories about the people and good living over there. How lazy and well fed these people are...<br><br>Truthfully, I hated my china roots.

Then you know what its like to be sitting with bus loads of them "Talking" as if the next bus can hear them.<br>If you are Char Bo. Try talking a walk along Geylang and see if you are treated like one of them ROC and wanna rape you.  Even the Bangalar over there see any chinese looking women as potential prostitude. The Tee Ko Pek in China town will look at all the girls up down and you can see they drool while they imagine raping you.<br><br>Truly I am disgusted and disappointed with the kinds of things China has expoerted, From SARS to their prostitudes and Finacial Scandels.

However, there is no such corresponding actions from the China government and they know there is no way to reign in these kinds or rouge trading in all their rouge companies China is exporting. This then release all sorts of problems in to the world economy which has to take extra actions when trading with China entreprises. Its a lesson that I though should had been learnt with the industrial park fisacal. Businessmen who deal with china do not have nice stories to tell of the system and the business or the people over there.<br><br></div>

You're not the only one. Trust me. Don't believe a word they say to you... They are really good at fibbing and telling you nice things and next moment go to boss twist your words. My boss was a stupid big fat bit.ch and believe her. Gave me hell after that. Then, its another colleague who came forward and inform me about what's going on then I realised many things about these China colleagues. Anyways, they do not see us as Chinese or part of the chinese clan. So why should we treat them as if we owe them for our roots. For I feel that kind of "payment" had long been paid by the sweat of our forefathers, and I only want to look ahead with no color barriers to a better future. And if its without any ROC, the better.<br></div>
