            <div class='col-md body'>They have always been ungrateful. Things did not ever change. Its just that they made use of others for their advantage and then make all sorts of nasty comments.. You think they feel they owe us the times we helped them. To them its expected, to them, we owe them. Now turning the thing around, they know we now need them to grow our economy and say all those ungrateful things and we have to take it because they know we need them.<br><br>You know why US is so hard on them. Their Yuan is peg down much lower. Ie valuation of their currency is forcefully lowered down. This means that their currencies are lower than most regions and thus most companies are going there to build factories because it cost less to get things manufactured there then anywhere else. Simply means that China is using underhand methods to induce growth at the expense of world economy (from Mexico, indonesia, Malaysia,, thailand and others). Once they joint the WTO, US was very hard on them to ped their currency to the world standard and play fair but they had consistently refused. Lets see what happens next... My hope is that more natural disasters hit them. I would never feel sorry for them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>China in her current state is not a place I would ever choose to visit.She has delusions of grandeur when she has not even managed to pacify her own minorities.Think that China might fragment one day, to form a confederation of the richest coastal states and the inner resource rich regions.The coastal grouping consisting of Shanghai, Guangzhou, Suzhou and Hong Kong might form a successful and modern state that might move on to greater heights.<br><br>Anyway, China is running a huge surplus up against the US and this cannot hold on forever even though the US knows that China is probably holding most of their foreign exchange funding through T-Bills.I have no affinity with those people up North and am not so puerile and juvenile like many others who think that they will give us any respect just because we have the same skin color.These pretenders to the throne have a long way to go before they can even truly claim to represent any voice of the Chinese people.If the Overseas Chinese stop remitting money and investing back home, the Beijing politburo(yes, I do not pretend that they are not Communist anymore) will see who has the clout in the world.Petty mandarins have been thinking huge for the last three centuries and their cojones are still as small as their heart.My ancestors probably left China sickened by the way the State runs things, and frankly speaking, we see that they have not changed their spots till this day.<br><br></div>

Even their passports can be faked. ie Huang Shi Ying.  They come here on social visit pass through some travel agent.  On arrival, many travel agents who deal with ROC tourist say some will disappear and the tour agent is penalised for them.  When they disappear, you very well know these people are out there commiting illegal activities. Even if we catch them, we can deport them or feed them in our prisons (so our tax dolars stil go to maintaining these parasites. It is what happened in taiwan as well) Their country is getting more powerful and offending them is not an option. Look at  the time Lee Hsian Loong visited Taiwan... These people are not even screen for aids (and they bring it here and spread to our unfaithful men and their innocent families. Shameless!) and it is well known that in the next couple of years, China and India will surpass Thailand with the most Aid patients and speed of spreading is accelerating due to their sexual permiscuity (They are very much worse than westerners in being loose with morals.). These are parasites. They have a large country and yet it is so run down and they do not take care of anything. They simply sap and take and abuse. They will not give anything back. I look at this generation (PRC parents) already suck. They are breeding a next generation of worse people and they are all like kings and queens because of the 1 child policy. I don't think it is going to get better, and I only hope that maybe some widespread disease will kill the bulk of them off.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>reminds me something<br><br>NTU's SCI A/Prof Lee Chun Wah suspects something is amiss in the murder case of Huang Na.  In the article published in Pg. 6 of Lianhe Wanbao dtd 11-11-2004, he cited that something was amissed in the psychological behaviour of Huang Na's mother, Mdm. Huang Shuying, and her step-father, a certain Mr. Zheng. The expert's view was that Mdm. Huang appeared aloof and was unusually quiet for a mother who claimed to have lost her beloved daughter in a murder case. He noted that it was baffling, not only to himself but to members of the community-at-large (possibly including psychological experts at Woodbridge Hospital and NUS), that Mr. Zheng, being a stepfather to a daughter he had hardly any contact with, could behave in such a manner - wailing loudly and crying uncontrollably during the funeral procession.<br><br>The article carrying Prof. Lee's views is suggestive and appears to point towards a plausible scenario that Huang Na was silenced by her mother and stepfather, thereby making Malaysian Mr. Took Leng How as a scapegoat. Prof. Lee himself had the opinion that the case left numerous questions that have not been answered. Technically, from large numbers of death cases reported worldwide that had been examined by psychologists and other experts, it is almost certainly an unquestioned fact (and an antipicated behaviour) that the natural parents of a child who died either from an accident or subjected to an act of murder would have sobbed uncontrollably, and wailed loudly - to the point of even fainting on-site. How come Huang Na's mother did neither upon the discovery of the body and during the wake that ensued as well as at the funeral proceedings certainly raised some eyebrows in the pyschological fraternity. As tapes were reviewed through the various TV stations, it seemed that Huang Na's mother only appeared to be anxious to find her - and in particular, her dead body. It was baffling why she could appear so calm when news of her daughter's death got through to her - as if she already knew a priori that her daughter is dead. Apart from all these evidence suggestive of an inside job, the appearance of the step-father into the entire picture cast even greater suspicion that Huang Na's disappearance and subsequent murder might have been premediated by the couple. A further twist in the development of the case is the dream of Huang Na being found in the woods - literally a tell-tale sign to help guide the law enforcers and narrow down their scope significantly. It is apparent from the evidence on hand that somebody wanted the body to be found and deliberately left it in the open within the confines of a conspicuously large cardboard box in the Telok Blangah heights area.<br><br>As an expert in Mass Communication, Prof. Lee's remarks came with the understanding that there are people who deliberately creates a scene to attract the attention of the media. In a possible murder case, where the murderer is the person crying foul, the murderer may be tempted to court the media and amass sympathy from the general public to jeopardize court proceedings and verdicts/judgements. Anyone who has taken a course on human behaviour and psychology coupled with background in the mass comm. industry could easily identify the stark similarities of such classic case with the one on hand - that Mdm. Huang Shuying had deliberately courted the attention of the media, with journalists and reporters being made use of (technically classified as "tools" of the murderer).<br><br>11 Nov 2004<br>NTU Professor shares expert comments on Huang Na reporting in media.<br><br>NTU School of Communication and Information Assoc Prof Lee Chun Wah shares expert comments on the role of media in stirring public sentiments in the case of missing Chinese girl, Huang Na.<br><br>You can view the entire article (in Chinese) from Lianhe Wanbao Pg. 6 dtd 11-11-2004 on<br><br>Dunno if the news were reliable  = Huang na's dad actually went back on his words abt the 'pek Gim' that he initially promised to donate 50% to charity. In the end, he donated the soft toys to charity homes instead and kept all the money, which was reported to be at least half a million SG dollars.<br><br>Reporters asked him why he didn't keep his promise, he said he need to buy LAND(so Tiong Kok siah) in China. And also he said he got heart problem, thats why need to go back to China.. Reporters were bewildered and told him that he can have a check in local hospitals, from that moment, he became frustrated and declined the interview..<br><br>Actually this 2 parents......had only want to make 7 day funeral procession then go back china... but was persuaded to make it to 49 days instead.<br><br>Daughters are not valuable in China and they have to sacrifice her to make their fortune!<br></div>

Even their passports can be faked. ie Huang Shi Ying.  They come here on social visit pass through some travel agent.  On arrival, many travel agents who deal with ROC tourist say some will disappear and the tour agent is penalised for them.  When they disappear, you very well know these people are out there commiting illegal activities. Even if we catch them, we can deport them or feed them in our prisons (so our tax dolars stil go to maintaining these parasites. It is what happened in taiwan as well) Their country is getting more powerful and offending them is not an option. Look at  the time Lee Hsian Loong visited Taiwan... These people are not even screen for aids (and they bring it here and spread to our unfaithful men and their innocent families. Shameless!) and it is well known that in the next couple of years, China and India will surpass Thailand with the most Aid patients and speed of spreading is accelerating due to their sexual permiscuity (They are very much worse than westerners in being loose with morals.). <span style="color: red;">These are parasites. They have a large country and yet it is so run down and they do not take care of anything. They simply sap and take and abuse. They will not give anything back. I look at this generation (PRC parents) already suck. They are breeding a next generation of worse people and they are all like kings and queens because of the 1 child policy</span>. I don't think it is going to get better, and I only hope that maybe some widespread disease will kill the bulk of them off.<br><br></div></blockquote>I totally agree with these points, and the ones in red are especially true.Sad and terrible.We need a paradigm shift in policy and if we can stand up to so many huge nations in the past and carved out our own cozy corner for our own self-interests, I'm pretty sure that we are able to stand up to China and not let them dictate terms to us either .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My penny worth of opinion...<br><br>During the cultural revolution, the chinese are derived of the basic necessites, fighting for the basic living commodities.  they are also devote of the cultural upbringing... ie the arts, literatures, religion etc etc... For them, the upbringing are a constant fight for everything and anything.<br><br>After the opening up, the costal cities are better off due to trades.  Even now ( I was in Shanghai yesterday), the Shanghainese still despise their own ppl from other cities like Hu-Nan, Hu bei etc.<br><br>These are also the ppl tat u c standing the streets in Geylang, trying to con ppl in the heartland.  Y? it is becos they have not attained the basic necessites for a comfortable life yet (inner cities china is still extremely poor).  So they r still fighting the old war.<br><br>Hopefully, they will eventually be on par with the rest of the whole and they will not need to fight anymore.  However it will take a while before that happens.  BUT it will not solve the problem, there will always be conners and street walkers.  It is a demand and supply thing, juz tat the current falvour of the month is China.</div>
