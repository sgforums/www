            <div class='col-md body'>Kaihoe said:<br><br><blockquote>And for Jasonnex, if you claim to be open<br>minded, I want you to read about all major<br>religions of the world with the same<br>intensity I do. Quit telling me to open my<br>mind to christianity when you show blatant<br>ignorance in all other major religions in<br>the whole world.</blockquote>And then he goes on to say:<br><br><blockquote>This is ever so funny. Since when did I<br>purport myself to be a knowledgeable person?<br>I do not even see knowledge as something<br>which I can show off. Besides, I have<br>repeatedly post, knowledge alone will not<br>make a person mature or enlightened.</blockquote>HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Its not even funny anymore.<br><br>Wait! There's more...<br><br>Kaihoe said:<br><br><blockquote>And also, I personally do find the character<br>of christ inspiring, do not think of me as<br>a christ hating chap because I think that<br>christianity is a social ill (which of<br>course, it is). So do not ask me to open my<br>heart to him, when it is not even closed at<br>the same time.</blockquote>AND<br><br><blockquote>To reiterate, I really really really<br>sincerely think that christianity is a social<br>ill. I swear that I have never been<br>sodomized before, much less by a christian.<br>I really think that christianity is a social<br>ill, sincerely and honestly. I say this<br>without a sense of bad feelings, because I<br>sincerely and honestly think that<br>christianity is indeed a social ill.</blockquote>And then he goes on to say:<br><br><blockquote>Only fools think that they are definitely<br>right. They always seem to sure that they<br>are right.</blockquote>HAHHAHAHAHAHHAHA<br>WOOHOOO!<br><br>My hat's off to you kaihoe. Closed-minded self-righteous fool!

U must understand it's a characteristic of mentally weak folks that they can't stay too focused on a particular topic for too long.

After all, he has put in so much effort pretending to be one of the intellectual community....can't give up after coming so far lah</blockquote>prodigal: boy would i love to hit on YOU below the belt! (I love the way you liken me to a pathetic boxer, wooohooo!) (and thats so above the belt eh)<br><br>And finally, a few points to clear up:<br>1) I did not know kaihoe was gone to NYC (I'm not his fucking boyfriend) (or fan).<br><br>2) He's gone to NYC for 2 weeks without being connected to the net? bwahahhahahaha. He's a system administrator is it not?<br><br>3) This is not an attack on kai.<br><br><blockquote>My hat's off to you kaihoe. Closed-minded self-righteous fool!

My boy, I suggest that you should check the Oxford or Webster dictionary to see what the word "prodigal" means. I know what "hit on" means, but unfortunately, I am a heterosexual, so I don't want to be associated with gays like you.<br><br></div>

And even if I know about<br>the main tenets of all main religions, that<br>does not mean that I am knowledgeable.<br><br>And to distinguish between the institution<br>and christ the person. The institution beinga<br>a social ill has no bearing on christ as a<br>person . read carefully</div>
