Perhaps this idea can come again with proper planning and when time gets better?<br><br>Meanwhile, we can just settle for exclusive members... &lt;- Meaning not everybody have to pay to be a member lah...

Also, this would be more CONSISTENT than 'donations'....

            <div class='col-md body'>hey Jason, i think the only way to make the site not lose money is to turn it into some form of transaction/auction site where people sell their stuff lor. you can consider making this website an organisation and area to import/export stuffs and be a middleman taking commission, providing limited guarantees, something like an ebay of singapore, but it will take quite a bit of work. i think it won't be easy to break even in any case.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to clear up this money point:<br><br>I will NEVER charge people for using this forum. The original idea is for totally voluntary donations to help support the financial burden of hosting the forums. $69.95/month is not cheap. The idea i'm toying with is allowing people to contribute via paypal.com (go see the website). They will handle the credit card transactions &amp; etc. if people want to donate $2/month it is also possible to have it donated automatically via paypal.<br><br>However, I'm also aware of many of the problems involving donations (legality, &amp; my obligations, etc)<br><br>Regarding the interface- There will be a lot of improvements to the interface... I admit.. it is still very 'raw'. The thread display especially... but I've been trying to perfect the forum display (ie, the list of topics in a forum). How is it?<br><br>and yes... I will listen to all the suggestions and TRY to implement the best ones.<br><br>Another thing. Everything I do is out of my own time and effort... please don't expect too much from me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Oldman: er... ?<br><br>Devil1796: dun worry  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Fireice: that is not quite possible because the pictures are not stored on this server (they are uploaded to other servers) and it would be unfeasible to ensure they conform to size limitations. I think I have a better idea... dun worry i'll clean up the topic display.. I don't quite like it too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jason, i am so SURPRISED that you r back fiddling with this long dead area.<br>LOL, anyway I welcome the new look (which i havent looked at it yet), but i am sure with your intelligence, the new "face-lift" will be refreshing and interesting.<br>But i suggest you to add in more features for moderators ,like me (LOL), whom seem to be so powerless in every minor or major petty arguements in the forums.<br>I would definatly like to see more "power" given to the moderators. Like appointing someone or some to be moderating all forums and not just one.<br>Also give moderators the power to remove repeated offenders permanently. (i know this has short comings)<br>And also, remove all kind of bloody ability to add in big pictures and long signature. That got to be OUT of the new forum. I am sure alot of people have "wonderful" memories of some users having "Great Wall of China" signature and mega size pictures.<br><br>Of cos, its YOUR forum, you can choose not to listen and do your own way. Considerring I have been helping out here for quite sometime (in fact i am the ONLY moderator left). Hee hee.<br><br>-----------------<br><br>Oh, I just looked at the new forum. And this is my tots.<br>It looked professional in a sense that I dont have those "hippie" feeling which this forum oozes out non stop. The new forum has a touch of professional feel (perhaps that is what you want since u r targetting business people, and thus excutive, but dont forget there r alot of young and hip excutive, making it too serious can be a turned off, but also u cannot compromise professional feel)<br>Oh yah, the violent/lilac/fuschia part got to be out, it completely crashes with the total black and white attitude, which of cos oozes "seriousness" unlike the older one.<br>Anyway i feel that both old and new forum got its own "attitude". The older one gives a more "younger and hippier" feel where as the new forum has a serious tone to it.<br><br>I think the font ought to be better, it makes reading easier.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Ah_Nic (edited 13 June 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh yah jason, i do have an idea of how u can "earn" some petty cash for this forum.<br>There are alot of local clothing shops whom the owner design their own clothes to be sold. What i was thinking is, host their clothes range on the forum and enable people to buy online and thus charging a little fee with every purchase or something like that. I know of shop owners whom are already launching their own website to cater to oversea customers whom buy the clothes online.<br>Similarly, u can also host a auction site like ebay.com or something like that with the same capabilities like them. Probably catering to only local market first and then expand to international.<br>Some ideas for you to explore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yeah.. one more thing... regarding the long posts and pictures...<br><br>pictures will still be allowed to stay. but i'm not so concerned about them now...<br><br>i'm more concerned about long posts...<br><br>I've thought of an idea, something like:<br><br>posts &lt;1000 characters in length, leave alone,<br><br>posts &gt;1000 and &lt; 2000 characters, shorten to 500 characters and put a link at the end so people can read the whole post.<br><br>posts &gt;2000 characters, don't show the message at all, just leave one link so people can read the post. (by clicking on the link).<br><br>This seems the best way to do it. People who are trying to be disruptive can no longer be, at the same time, people can still post and read long messages.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>long posts are ok....those in Speakers' Corner are bery good reads<br>and i dun tink ppl will be happy to have their posts "chopped" or made into a link (which a lotta ppl will be sian 1/2 to have to open another window to read then come back)<br><br>the main prob is the signature part<br><br>either one mod tt has power throughout all sub-forums or each sub-forum have their own mod/mods</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Only very long posts will be chopped.<br><br>There has to be a compromise between allowing longs posts for reading enjoyment (10 screens long?!?!?) and stopping disruptive posters.<br><br>Either ways, if it is a 10 screen long good read, people won't mind clicking on a link just to read it.

            <div class='col-md body'>personally im ok with the chopping idea...<br>will it be like...<br>the first portion (say 1000 words) will be shown...then there will be a "more" link at the end for ppl to click and the rest will show up?<br><br>mebe u can ask the ppl over at Speaker'a Corner for their feedback on this...<br>cos i think the chances of having long posts is higher over there than in chitchat and they will be affected most<br><br>and oso...hope there can be some housekeeping or archiving in the "Free Forums" section...too clustered and most are stagnant oredi....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm what about the idea of hosting up "local shop's clothing range". You can host up a area to display their clothes (at the same time, our own forummers can browse thru). And than if people r interested, they can buy online! Or check out the shop themselve. Maybe like being paypal verified or something like that. I think its quite feasible but u got to find local shops (which Heerens have tons of them) and ask them if they r interested. They can enable their products to reach a wider market (the net is unlimited).<br><br>As for the limiting of words for msg, i think its a good idea. But does it includes signature word count also?<br><br>And as i STRONGLY SUGGESTTED before,to give mods MORE power. Like one - three mods that oversees all forums, and within the one forum has their own mods (not more than 3 again).<br>And the one that oversees all has power like removing repeated offenders users, but within one forum mod does not have it. So its kinda like a hierarch you know.<br>One administrator, followed by 1 - 3 "grand" mods that oversees all forums, and than followed by 1-3 "mini" mods that oversee one forum.<br><br>And the power is as followed : administrator that has power to do anything he wants.<br>"Grand" mod has the power to remove/ban repeated offenders from any forum and the usual mod power.<br>"Mini" mod is of cos, an usual mod as like current.<br><br>I am very CONCERNED over this mod's extra features cos with the current "power" i have, I am unable to regulate the forum properly, esp with those irritating forummers who dont seem to take warning as an advice.<br><br>Oh yah, can u do something about the deleting? So far , i am only able to close, not delete topics that are deemed offensive.<br>And we need to constantly remove old topics that r of a certain "age". Like maybe topics 1 yr and above are removed. So they dont clot up the forum.<br><br>When i think up of more suggestions, i will repost.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>nic: yes I agree with you that mod powers need to be increased.. and that in general we need a greater amount of moderation. this will be done in time to come... worry not  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>fireice: yes... the free forums will be much neater...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>the next step is to shift the whole forums to the new design... this will be done ... SOON  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> and the front page will soon show maybe the top 10 forums (based on popularity) as well as a link to browse/search ALL the other forums.</div>
