            <div class='col-md body'>anyway, i think the page numbers at the bottom should by default list all the pages, instead of 1 to 5, with the option of showing more, because some threads can get really long. also, the page list should be displayed at both the top, and bottom of the page so you don't have to scroll all the way down to bottom to select a page  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by chamenos (edited 11 June 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FIreice: I understand your concerns. I also believe in usability coming first. I will probably implement a feature that will make the font size larger (if desired).<br><br>The posts in seperate boxes is because sometimes people post large pictures and it screws up the tables (becomes hard to read) as the table width becomes longer than the screen! so people got to scroll... I will probably think of a more elegant solution...<br><br>This is just a work in progress!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wouldn't mind paying, but paying monthly is a bit too much hassle. How about a yearly basis, that way I can't really feel the "pay bill" feeling.<br><br>Seriously, how much for you intending to charge? I wouldn't mind $20 a year but anything more than tat I have to think twice. (My frequency of visits is not very high... unlike FI and some others)<br><br>Besides the getting membership fees......I believe there are alot of issues that might need your attention. Found that this place is a very "undermoderated" resulting to frequent flaming and pranks in topics.<br><br>Yeah, we salute to freedom of speech (for now) but Many people tends to ABUSE it. They have no idea of the meaning of Free speech, thinking that it means they can say whatever they want, including insults and stuffs. Even US forums (The creators of FREEDOM OF SPEECH) cannot tolerate such acts....why should SGforum tolerate them? Why must I pay $$ to see pranks being made and read flames(or being flamed)?<br><br>What I'm trying to say is.... if possible, get someone to moderate the sections of your forum (not just chitchat, aunt agony and speakers corner need them too) ....volunteers who are matured enough to deal with situtations. That's the only lacking thing I find in SGforums.</div>
