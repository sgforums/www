Like appointing someone or some to be moderating all forums and not just one.<br>Also give moderators the power to remove repeated offenders permanently. (i know this has short comings)<br>And also, remove all kind of bloody ability to add in big pictures and long signature. That got to be OUT of the new forum. I am sure alot of people have "wonderful" memories of some users having "Great Wall of China" signature and mega size pictures.<br><br>Of cos, its YOUR forum, you can choose not to listen and do your own way. Considerring I have been helping out here for quite sometime (in fact i am the ONLY moderator left). Hee hee.<br><br>-----------------<br><br>Oh, I just looked at the new forum. And this is my tots.<br>It looked professional in a sense that I dont have those "hippie" feeling which this forum oozes out non stop. The new forum has a touch of professional feel (perhaps that is what you want since u r targetting business people, and thus excutive, but dont forget there r alot of young and hip excutive, making it too serious can be a turned off, but also u cannot compromise professional feel)<br>Oh yah, the violent/lilac/fuschia part got to be out, it completely crashes with the total black and white attitude, which of cos oozes "seriousness" unlike the older one.<br>Anyway i feel that both old and new forum got its own "attitude". The older one gives a more "younger and hippier" feel where as the new forum has a serious tone to it.<br><br>I think the font ought to be better, it makes reading easier.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Ah_Nic (edited 13 June 2002).]</div></blockquote>~Puke puke...~ Hey, your signature looks a little too long too...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

What i was thinking is, host their clothes range on the forum and enable people to buy online and thus charging a little fee with every purchase or something like that. I know of shop owners whom are already launching their own website to cater to oversea customers whom buy the clothes online.<br>Similarly, u can also host a auction site like ebay.com or something like that with the same capabilities like them. Probably catering to only local market first and then expand to international.<br>Some ideas for you to explore.</div></blockquote>COOL!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there was a page that i used to frequent once (long gone now) that had a similar dilemma.<br><br>that page was Lum The Mad ( <a href="http://www.lumthemad.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.lumthemad.net</a>  ), a satirical site whose contents were usually about online gaming and just stuff in life.<br><br>the place was so popular they garnered over a million hits a month, so much that it was too much for the owner, nor any of their sponsors to continuing sponsoring, due to the bursting of the web-ad companies, web advertising just doesn't work.<br><br>instead of resorting to subscriptiong, they decided to go the way of donations, money was sent to the owner via Paypay ( <a href="http://www.paypal.com" rel="nofollow">www.paypal.com</a>  ), the process is transparent and every single cent collected went to the maintaince and upgrading of the site, never once to the owner's pockets.<br><br>this idea would be quite feasible, since i don't really think sgforums would require that MUCH cash to maintain a month, just a simple $1-2 donation from even 10% of the users here will keep the place alive for a relatively long time.<br><br>1 of your problems would be, how are you going to explain to the government about the excess money, though i don't really think you're gonna rake in that much money for it to really be a problem (LtM got close to USD$5000 in 2 months), but it might help to register sgforums as a not-for-profit organisation to handle the cash flow  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Magical Racing<br>F.C.C.
