            <div class='col-md body'>March 7, 2005<br>Making the job switch<br>By Leslie Koh<br>JOB re-creation has landed 2,000 Singaporeans in jobs that were once deemed too dirty or cheap but have since been given a makeover.<br><br>.....................<br><br>New life blooms for green thumb<br>AFTER Mr Tan Choon Kok resigned from his job as an engineer last October, he had problems finding another.<br><br>The 44-year-old nearly gave up after three months, until a chance to turn landscape technician came up.<br><br>He now gets $900 a month planting, watering and pruning shrubs and trees at places such as Changi Airport.<br><br>It's a drop from the $3,000 he used to earn, but it's exactly what he sought, after his stressful job reconditioning heavy machinery.<br>'I've always liked horticulture. I wanted to switch. I like the challenge of learning new things,' said the mechanical engineering diploma holder.<br><br>The National Parks Board sent him for training under the National Skills Recognition System, where he learnt his professional skills.<br><br>NParks then matched him with its contractor, Kiat Lee Landscapes and Building.<br>The transition turned out to be quite easy, he said, as he had great interest in plants. Also, with his wife working as a laboratory assistant, he could afford the pay cut.<br><br>'My previous job was very stressful, it left me no time for myself or my family. Now, I can plan my own work and time, and have time for courses at night.'<br><br>His manager, Mr Simon Soh, told The Straits Times the match was perfect. He said: 'Before, people would come for a few days, then quit. They said it was too hot, the job was too dirty, too tough.'<br><br>In Mr Tan, however, the local firm found a worker who was happy to work under the sun and get his hands soiled.<br><br>Indeed, the green bug has bitten Mr Tan so deeply that he intends to go for more horticulture courses and turn 'tree doctor' one day.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like this guy chose to be switch lines and sounds happier after that.  Anyway, a 44-year-old engineer earning only S$3000 per month?  It no wonder he quit lah.<br><br>Actually its nothing new.  Engineers always have been doing dirty work.  Take me for example....I make coffee, clean the office desks, floor, beg customers to pay up on time, become a debt collector sometimes...and even have to praise my customers' excellent taste in shoes sometimes.  Everything the people in my company don't want to do is eventually and surely passed on to me.  Sigh....engineers have it bad.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Seriously, I just spent about an hour yesterday repairing my office toilet's flushing system.<br></div>
