How the F*** you expect people to take a seat?<br><br>I want to tell you how to differentiate good and bad people. If you want to find a truly sincere boyfriend, do this test. If he ever cross his filthy shoe towards you when sitting together, he is rubbish, he dosen't love you truly in his heart at all;  this shows an egoistic and unsympathatic character. People who sit cross legged with shoe almost touching the person next to oneself are unsympathatic and selfish people. No wonder the societal crisis, you can know why Singapore is famous for this type of people.<br><br>Why do people want to scare off other and occupy double space when sitting in public transport espsecially? So that they can dirty others clean clothing when sitting close by, hence scaring them off, and keeping all space all by themselves?<br><br>PLEASE make Singapore a better place by not sitting cross legged in public places. Thanks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>correct everyday i saw this in mrt and bus<br>even my cloths dirtied by these kind of ppl<br>and never say sorry also these a s s h o l e s<br>In my dictionary, these ppls are = ANIMALS<br>yes really not ANIMALS only<br>they are VERY DIRTIEST ANIMALS IN WILD</div>
