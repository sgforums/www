The title is "1100 Words You Need To Know". Should come in handy for you if you would like to expand your vocabulary.<br><br>There is one assignment for each day of the year, and for each assignment, they first give you a short passage containing new words for the day, so you can have a glimpse of how they may be used.<br><br>Then there'll be sentences with blanks for you to fill in with the correct words, and lastly you'll be asked to match definitions to words.<br><br>At the end of each page, there's also an idiom and its explanation...<br><br>Grammar-wise... I don't know, does it come naturally as you read more (good) books?</div>

It is not that our reporters are lousy, just that news paper must cater for the population of the country. Thus, you won't gain much...<br><br>When read, go for magazines like Times. They offer great materials to improve ones English. Go for CNN and stuff. Another great source is novel. Try avoid romatic novel or such. Suspence or criminal novel will be of better help.<br><br>Dictionary is another great tool. We tend to read through words that are difficult. We even praised ourself that we can guess the meaning of a certain word by reading the whole sentence. Bad mistake! We actually miss the opportunity to know another new word thus improving ourself.....<br><br>*most of the comments here I read it from somewhere (forgotten source.....) and are the ones I agreed with.
