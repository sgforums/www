            <div class='col-md body'>I used to work in a media company owned by a family.<br>The father is the publisher, the father's sister is the finance director, the father's wife is the general manager, the daughter is the circulation manager, the elder son is the group marketing manager and the youngest son is the assistant marketing manager. Total office stength is abt 20 people.<br>I was there for around 6 months and I am one of the longest serving marketing executive working there. The average marketing executive working span is about three months. There are many kinds of problems within the company.<br><br>The group marketing manager will takes charge of the sales accounts and the marketing executives have their own accounts to take care of. There are endless rivalary among the marketing executives and things like back-stabbing, gossiping, under-cutting of accounts, ungrounded accusations and many many more. The group marketing manager knows what is happening but ignored to solve the problems. During my six-months stay there, I actually have at least 10 marketing colleagues who came and go. The working atmosphere is just like the taiwanese/Hong Kong drama show content.<br><br>There are endless things I can say about the company. If you want me to explain further, you may zoom in to a certain area where I can expound on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Family run ?<br><br>LoL.. depends what kind of personality ur dad is ,and especially if he is one of the directors.  It will decide ur fate in the company. Each family will want his own family to be the one holding more power to the others. It will also depend how each individual family member relates to each other.<br><br>Normally power and money will always bring a bit of rivalry , thats why family members have to be close and know that they will need each other. I personally think , the older generation will soon be gone. And the allegience between younger family generations in the company will be crucial for future development and success of the entire company as an overall.<br><br>There are those that will rise their kids up the ladder fast , and there are those that makes u work as a guli worker and make sure every time u climb up the ladder , u bleed for it.<br><br>And about the wealth not able to last 3 generations , thats for those that scum peoples money . Its karma's way of kick your @ss.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> It does last for more then 3 generations. Depends how ur predecessors manages.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> And i believe that family is family..  but once they become liability , they are no more family , but because of the good gracious of thier parents  they can stay on.. until such day the good graces of the older generation no longer carries the weight.<br><br>When u say partners , even family run business if u dont have an outsider that is good at what he does to compliment the business at least will have 1 or 2. Anyways just what i think. heh</div>
