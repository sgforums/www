              <p>The prizewinning artist Gregor Schneider, enfant terrible of the German
              cultural scene, is looking for a volunteer who is willing to die for his –
              that is, Mr Schneider’s – art.</p>
              <p>He wants someone whose dying hours will be spent in an art gallery with the
              public admiring the way the light plays on the flesh of a person gasping for
              the last breath.</p>
              <p>Politicians and curators are in a state of uproar about Mr Schneider’s plans.
              The 39-year-old artist has been concerned with death for much of his career.
              He gained critical acclaim for a sculpture, <em>Hannelore Reuen</em>, of a
              dead woman. He has been hatching his current idea since 1996, and now has a
              sympathetic pathologist and art collector to help to find a candidate who
              wants to become a work of art in the final days of his or her life.</p>
              <p>“The dying person would determine everything in advance, he would be the
              absolute centre of attention,” said Mr Schneider. “Everything will be done
              in consultation with the relatives, and the public will watch the death in
              an appropriately private atmosphere.”</p>
              <p>Death is commonly seen as the last taboo, but artists have been trying hard to
              demystify it. Gunther von Hagens, nicknamed Doctor Death, has been
              travelling the world with an exhibition of plastinated corpses, showing
              genuine human bodies in living poses, playing chess or on horseback. The
              Wellcome Collection in London has an exhibition of portraits of people
              pictured before and after death by two German photographers.</p>
              <p>The Schneider project, however, seems to have gone too far. It is being
              compared with watching executions in the United States. The influential
              gallery owner Beatrix Kalwa spoke for many German curators who rule out the
              idea of giving space to Mr Schneider’s artistic endeavour. “Existential
              matters like death, birth or the act of reproduction do not belong in a
              museum,” she said. “There is a fundamental difference between portraying
              these acts in an art form, and showing them in actuality.”</p>
              <p>The head of the German hospice foundation that provides care for the
              terminally ill, Eugen Brysch, said: “This is pure voyeurism and makes a
              mockery of those who are dying.” But Mr Schneider, who feigned his own death
              as part of an exhibition in Germany in 2000, argues that death is already
              undignified and that his aim is to restore its grace.</p>
