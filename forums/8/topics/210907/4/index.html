Could be someone did 'abuse' her foal before and that's y she's so intolerant towards strangers now.</div></blockquote>There were alot of people petting and feeding the foal, including myself.  Peanut was strangely nonchalant about it.<br><br><strong>She was very, very unresponsive and withdrawn unlike the other ponies </strong>.. <strong> and her appearance was very emaciated.  The foal tried to suckle from her but she didn't appear to have much milk and it gave up.  You could see her pelvic bones jutting out prominently, and her ribcage outline could be seen clearly</strong>.  When she came over, her eyes were fixed on the food in my hand.  I gave her a few more handfuls, as did a few other young children half my height.  She used her snout and slowly pushed the foal out of the way to get at the food.  But when there was no more food, I was still standing there observing her.  The other kids were petting and trying to feed the foal, which had ambled a few feet away from her.<br><br>Peanut took a few steps forward.. she smelled my hand with the empty packet of horsefeed, and tried to bite it when I lowered it.  She then levelled her snout right next to my head and studied me with her left eye, and I sensed something was wrong so I stepped back slightly - that was when she suddenly attacked without warning.<br><br><strong>Without warning</strong> meaning when she raised her head, she did not fold her ears back, her eyes did not show any whites, no curled lip or baring of teeth, no flaring of nostrils.  She also did not stomp her foot.  The only thing that did not seem right was the way she quietly studied me.  About the way she looked at me in the eye - I have seen horses give such looks but only those that have been treated poorly before - I can only describe it as contempt.<br><br>1 - The foal is very healthy looking, at least 3-4 months old.  It was odd that Peanut would still be so tired, unresponsive and skinny as the foal had not just been born.<br><br>2 - If she was being protective of the foal, she would have turned her attention to the children instead, who were all touching the foal.  I feel she was protective towards herself.</div>

So she became like that over the course of 3 weeks?  o.0  wow.  what happened, I wonder.<br><br>Well she was very thin and sad looking when she made her appearance that day - her pelvic bones were sticking out very prominently, ribs could be seen.<br><br>anyway thanks for ur concern, I'm closing this thread now so this will be my last reply here, but will be glad to reply to any pvt msgs.<br><br>Mods, FYNA thanks! =)</div>

I suspect the editor may have cut out your observations of the horses' condition because that is treading very fine line. Your story is shocking enough already without the need to include your observations.<br><br>Has the management decided if they are going to compensate you already? Maybe you ought to go look for some lawyer doing pro bono work for some preliminary advice.<br></div></blockquote>I cannot believe that it is so hard to get a fair hearing as a consumer.  Why didn't the management contact me directly to apologize or to try and resolve the matter after the incident despite my repeated requests for callback?  They had plenty of time to do that.  I have never encountered this in all my years in the customer service industry.<br><br>I am upset and disappointed because to date, neither my fiance nor I have not received a single apology / expression of regret / phonecall / e-mail directly addressing this incident from the stable management, unlike what Shankar Mani claimed.. and I was not offered aid until I repeatedly asked for it.  The only one response acknowledging that this incident did happen came from the 3rd party INSURER, who called the day before the article got published.. He offered to pay my initial GP bill excl tetanus jab and br3ast examination follow ups.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I did not expect my observations of the horse's condition to be published.  I stressed to the reporter that my most important point was the handling of the situation.  When she asked why I decided to call TNP, I said it was because I was dissatisfied with the insincerity and lack of "appropriate action" on the part of the management, and that people had recommended me to approach them.</span>  The reporter later apologized to me, at her own initiative, and explained that her editor dropped that out.<br><br>I've been receiving calls and e-mails from concerned friends.. I have tried my best not to inconvenience my dear friends, but I am very glad that at least they believe me and have offered help.<br><br>I maintain that all I have said is the truth.  My conscience is completely clear.  The trauma of going through this is really taking its toll on me, but I cannot pretend that none of what I described ever happened.  I do appreciate your concern, very very much.  I really hope no one else will have to go thru this sort of thing.  I don't know what else to say.</div>
