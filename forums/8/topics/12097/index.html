            <div class='col-md body'>Is anyone here an expert on overseas education because I'm at a real loss. How does the banks' overseas education loans work? Do they cover living expenses? The estimated cost per annum for my course is<br>US$25600 including accomodation, food etc. Is it too high for the banks to loan the full amount?<br><br>And would I be able to work as a student in the US. If anyone has any experience regarding this before, pls tell me how much you can realistically earn working parttime over there.<br><br>Do you know of any websites that provide help for Singaporeans intending to go overseas?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know about bank loans but I know what your tuition fees will be approx 4 times of an American. You cannot work as a student especially from a rich country like Singapore, but if you are from poorer countries like vietnam, Indonesia or the like you can apply for a hardship work permit. You'll need to be pre qualified and verified you are eligible though.. You can work on campus as a student, but the max pay I've seen is like $8 an hour. That's not a lot.<br><br>You cannot be found working off campus or you'll be deported and fined I think. You can do odd jobs like neighbour babysitting, lawn mowing, contract murders and heroin sales but I don't recommend the last two.<br><br>One good thing you want to take note of especially if you're on a tight budget, watch the transportation service in the destination city. America wasn't built for buses but for cars. If you plan to own a car, be prepared to pay like $120 minimum per month for insurance, and that's for the most basic policy. That was one consideration we failed to think of before I came here and it's costing me $480 for 6 months.<br><br>Getting cell phones, anything that usually comes with a bill is not easy as in Singapore. You need a history of credit, to get credit you apply for a credit card, which you also need to have credit to apply for. Telephone line, apartment deposits all usually include a check of your history by their financial people so be prepared for higher interest rates or total denial of service.<br><br>Good luck amigo.<br><br>------------------<br>Honesty is the Worst policy when taking an exam in CME</div>

She is really good in music and is gonna have to do her music studies overseas coz no degree courses in Singapore yet.<br><br>Going to USA and Europe is best for music.  However, she has to go to Australia instead as living expenses are much more tolerable there.  And thats despite her 95% possibility of getting a 100% scholarship.  Yeah...... living expenses are really too high for her to do studies in USA and Europe.<br><br>Oh well, if you can get scholarship, good!  But then again, if you cannot handle the living expenses, then better review options.  You wouldn't wanna get stuck with paying loans and loans throughout your entired life?<br><br>------------------<br>I aM WhO I aM,<br>ItS iMpOsSiBle To bE aNy MoRe Or LeSs......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks all. By the time I save enough money to go to the US, I'll be thirty. And DBS no longer provide education loans. That's what their email reply said when I enquired about it. Does that mean they don't cover local education loans now too?<br><br>I feel so stuck.

            <div class='col-md body'>If you need to borrow money to cover your entire expenses in the US, I'll suggest you look for alternatives like SMU, distance learning courses or Australian Us. All these cost a fraction of what a US education will cost. Trust me, you will not want to be heavily in debt right after you graduate from college.<br><br>The estimated cost of about $25k (May I know which college?) will not remain stagnant. Tuition and housing rents are guaranteed to increase on an annual basis. The extent of increment will depend on which city you are talking about.<br><br>With an F-1 visa (Student visa), it is illegal for the holder to work off-campus. On campus work is permitted. But bear in mind that on-campus jobs are very very competitive.<br><br>As for the off-campus work after 9 mths of residency as mentioned by delerium, correct me if I'm wrong, you only have a total of 12 months to work. You will want to use this for summer internships when you are in Junior/senior years; and after graduation before your employer starts the process for a H-1 visa (working visa) or green card.<br><br>Having said all these, there's one most important point. You have to ask yourself if you can bear the stress of studies, worrying about financial problems, working part time on-campus and being away from family. If you think you can, by all means, come to the US. Where there's a will, there's a way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey delighted to know that u wanna do vet scie... but to do that u must get a basic degree first cos vet sci in America (Canada and US) requires at least a general 2 yr sci studies(which must includ one yr coursework in bio, chem, physic, math and eng and other electives), and then u will have to go thru selection rounds (which r pretty limited for international students unless u r really realy good!) most students do their vet sci after their basic degree (which is 4 yrs later) and attemtp to do vet sci after that.<br>I am attempting to do vet sci too but i am doing a basic degree in Zoology in Canada first.. than i will think about vet sci later (that is if i am good enough and rich enough! vet sci is very exp overseas)<br>But if money is a constrain... i suggest that u apply to Australia's vet sch (which cost about A$25-30K per yr on fees only).. u enter straight into vet sci for UQ and U of Sydney... in Murdoch U, u have to do 2 yrs in vet bio, than follow by vet sci (3yrs). For U of Melborne, u can only apply (i think) after first or second yr. Admission average for consideration is at least a 80%.<br>Or u can go to New Zealand's Massey Uni who is offering vet sci to international students for the first time in 2001 (fees r around NZ$25k). But it is not a confirmation if u r accepted, cos the first semester is the elimination rounds, u have to do well in vet core subjects and then face selection round after that... if u r good, u proceed to second semester and so on.<br>It will be cheaper and (i think) easier to enter vet sci in Australia or NZ...<br>but its also easier to go vet sci in US if u dont mind the wait and money spent. In Canada, there r limitations like citizenship blah blah...<br>i dont know much about UK.. but i guess its as hard and exp also...<br>i hope my info is good enough!</div>
