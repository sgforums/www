            <div class='col-md body'>When I first started to have them,I felt as if I was being forced to fall asleep,I knew when I was going to have one.

I knew I was not "awake" and force myself to wake up,at times I would think I was awake but was not.I would then again get out of bed and do the same thing over and over until I was awake. Other times I would try and turn on my lights and my hand would not come in contact and I would get that falling feeling threw the door,walls or floor.<br><br>There has been other times,I felt like I was in other places..one time I felt as if I was in another country in a mall..hehe..but there was a man there and saw me. He was angry with me,and I could feel from him that he was asking me why I was here.<br><br>Alot of the time during these experiences,I feel,evil spirits around me.I am fighting them away with Gods help. When I am back,there have been times I have seen spirits,not the ones I wanna see ither.<br><br>I have been told by a person who seen me in this state once,That I am shaking and breathing very hard.I felt I was doing this because I could always hear myself and feel myself shaking,so them telling me this validated what I thought to be true.<br><br>Well there is some of my experiences<br><br>Anyone have any  experience or have any thought of it???</div>

I would hear shuffling of feet and whispering.Felt like I was dreaming but was very aware,sometimes I would be "walking" around my home or getting off my bed,sometimes I would feel like I was falling or start spinning out of control. I knew I was not "awake" and force myself to wake up,at times I would think I was awake but was not.I would then again get out of bed and do the same thing over and over until I was awake. Other times I would try and turn on my lights and my hand would not come in contact and I would get that falling feeling threw the door,walls or floor.<br><br>There has been other times,I felt like I was in other places..one time I felt as if I was in another country in a mall..hehe..but there was a man there and saw me. He was angry with me,and I could feel from him that he was asking me why I was here.<br><br>Alot of the time during these experiences,I feel,evil spirits around me.I am fighting them away with Gods help. When I am back,there have been times I have seen spirits,not the ones I wanna see ither.<br><br>I have been told by a person who seen me in this state once,That I am shaking and breathing very hard.I felt I was doing this because I could always hear myself and feel myself shaking,so them telling me this validated what I thought to be true.<br><br>Well there is some of my experiences<br><br>Anyone have any  experience or have any thought of it???</div></blockquote>I think i read bout this story in some ghost story website...</div>
