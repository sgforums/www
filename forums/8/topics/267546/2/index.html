Try going into the teaching career before commenting. Maybe some teachers are truly bad, but some are just tired of facing the students everyday.<br><br>2. If the teacher is bullied by the staff for being too nice to students, will u stand up for him/her? Furthermore, how would u know your teacher is being bullied when many things are "hidden" from you?<br><br>3. No one says students = rowdy.<br><br>4. And you want to blame teachers for being too strict? And how about the chinese sayings that u should give more respect to your teacher?<br><br>5. No comments, because it will be too great a generalisation.<br><br>I wouldn't know about your teacher, but I would like to remind you to think in the shoes of others. Note that:<br><br>1.  Teachers are humans, not robots; they get tired trying to help you improve.<br><br>2. Teachers do not only face students; they have to face their colleagues. Office politics is rampant in teaching. Sometimes, when two teachers walk together, some students will only greet ONE teacher because they dislike the other teacher. You wouldn't know what backstabbing will happen after that.<br><br>3. Teachers face the stress of having to face their superiors when their students don't do well. Or when they cannot keep a class quiet and in control.<br><br>4. I would think that a number younger teachers would like to quit, but it's not possible because they are bonded or have no other job to do. (There are of course some teachers who are happy because they feel that teaching is their calling)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'll speak from my experience, as a teacher and a previous student.<br><br>As an ESL teacher (although it is applicable to any subject), my philosophy is to help those who want to help themselves. If you don't want to improve, you're welcome to leave my class. You don't need to waste your money and my effort. If you have the motivation to begin with, I can surely further motivate you and bring forth the passion to learn...however, I cannot create your passion if you have none to begin with.<br><br>It is important to capture the attention of the students within the first 5 mins of meeting them. But maintaining that relationship is most difficult and requires effort from both ends. I can only do so much to ensure that I answer your questions. However, it is up to you to ask the right questions. Also, we have to ensure there is a clear understanding of our respective goals.<br><br>There was response to write a note to the teacher to explain how you feel. I would suggest taking it one step further and actually speaking to the teacher one-on-one. Before you do this, you have to determine whether you have put forth the effort. If you have always had this bad attitude and negative perspective of the teacher, I would suggest you change your perspective of the teacher and the subject. After a few days, if you still find yourself in an unenjoyable situation, simply ask for a few minutes of the teacher's time. Sympathize and empathize with the teacher by trying to understand why they act that. Then you'll be able to project your own perspectives to the teacher.<br><br>To you I ask: what steps have you taken to show the teacher that you want to be in that class? What steps have your classmates taken? Are you all thinking alike or do you truly want to strive above your classmates?</div>
