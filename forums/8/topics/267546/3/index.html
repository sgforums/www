Note that:<br><br>1.  Teachers are humans, not robots; they get tired trying to help you improve.<br><br>2. Teachers do not only face students; they have to face their colleagues. Office politics is rampant in teaching. Sometimes, when two teachers walk together, some students will only greet ONE teacher because they dislike the other teacher. You wouldn't know what backstabbing will happen after that.<br><br>3. Teachers face the stress of having to face their superiors when their students don't do well. Or when they cannot keep a class quiet and in control.<br><br>4. I would think that a number younger teachers would like to quit, but it's not possible because they are bonded or have no other job to do. (There are of course some teachers who are happy because they feel that teaching is their calling)</div></blockquote>What this bro say is damn true<br><br>And on top of that, teachers have to:<br><br>- face lots of paperworks, like typing ur results into the system, not 1 students, but a whole lot of the students they are teaching<br><br>- Marking exams paper after exams. As a student, we do 1 paper, they have to mark hundreds of them from different class<br><br>- Monitor your results, behaviour. If anything go wrong, they need to call your parents and talk to them<br><br>so from what i've seen, being a teacher is not quite easy</div>
