It will be worse for the teacher, rather than helping the teacher. Do you think a whole class or the whole staff has a larger say.<br><br>Yet, if you don't stand up for the teacher, it just means that she cannot be as nice as before.</div>

I was hoping to know you well, and hope you understand me. You may be awkward to merge and be like one of us, as your maturity and ours are just different.<br><br>We, as the students, tries to pay attention to what you say during the first lesson with you.<br><br>During our second lesson with you, we hope you would remember us, our characteristics, our hobby, our leisure. Even if you do not remember us during our second lesson, we hope your would remember us during outside class, and the third lesson.<br><br>My dear teacher, why are you so old fashioned? We all know that teachers are humans too, then why are you acting as a good role model for us? Why can't you be more open?<br><br>During small class test, we are all very scared, just like your first time being a teacher. I am sure when you are first time being a teacher, you would want us to encourage you, and understand you. Just like you, we want you to encourage us during small class test. Small class test are meant to know our standard and let us learn from our mistake, so I guess you need not be so strict towards us.<br><br>We, as a student, has our own problems and stress too. Who says a young child cannot have problems and stress? We are humans too. So please understand us too. Stress and problems do make us grow, but in an unhappy way.<br><br>We always hope that you are in good mood, so that we would be happy for you too. We, be it a student, a child, a teenager or even your friends, care lots about face. We easily feel awkward, so we do not show our feelings and emotion easily on our face.<br><br>Lastly, please note that naughty students or active students, have feelings too. Me, myself, being a naughty student, cry easily and got hurt in our heart easily. We are humans, like you too.<br><br>I wish the teachers out there see this, and know how we feel. We totally understand the stress and hardships you are under. And, most importantly, humour and friendliness is what we are finding inside you.<br><br>Cheers<br>IA.</div>

A friendly teacher without being able to teach well will be under a lot of pressure from peers and higher authority.<br></div></blockquote>Here is one story that happened last week in Japan. 2 months ago a young teacher got posted to my School as an English Teacher.I dont know where he came from but he couldnt spell, his pronunciation and grammer is horrible but he has  talent....a real bullshit artist.The first week the kids loved him but by the second week parents started to complain then by the third the students also started to complain.We tried to help him but he was stubborn maybe because I am not Ang mor and he felt he didnt need any advice from any teachers.Last week the Board of Education people came to spot check on him but just before his presentation he asked me for advice.I told him that he had only two choice left,to either shoot himself or let us all watch him fcuk himself in class......he ended killing himself for 50 minutes in front of a cold &amp; tough audience doing his "Tiger Show".Teachers are not paid to bluff and arrogance will only hurt you.</div>
