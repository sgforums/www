            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, I need some constructive suggestions here...<br><br>I am taking H2 physics currently but it is really very very unenjoyable. I have a good mind to switch to H2 Biology after 3 months. I have Physics and Biology background in secondary school so I sort of know what to expect should I switch to H2 Biology.<br><br>Currently Biology teaches things at molecular or cellular level, which makes it inevitably mundane. Is there any use of studying Biology into such a great depth until the cellular level? Is A level biology very complex and very bulky since there are TONS of information to be memorised? Physics is less mugging, more mathematical (which is good for me), and has more link to daily applications in our lives. But i hate the physics lessons so far!<br><br>Aplitude wise, my Physics and Biology results are about the same. I dont intend to do engineering in the future but I may work in the medical field in the future. So is Biology important? Or is H2 Chemistry/ H3 Pharmaceutical Chemistry more important?<br><br>If I choose to switch to Biology after 3 months, I would have to change my class, which is a - point, since I would have to adapt into a new environment again.<br><br>But I really cant tahan physics la, I have learnt nothing abt physics so far from the lectures and tutorials. I am going to flunk my physics if this continues. So taking physics is also not very feasible, since now I detest physics...<br><br>So in this case should I take bio or physics?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>H2 Chemistry is the most important. For medicine, either Bio or Phy works fine in terms of getting into uni (for NUS). But in my personal opinion, and based on what we are being taught, Bio will definitely be more useful. Overseas Unis may require Bio or Phy specifically (mostly Bio).<br><br>Bio at H2 level is definitely content-heavy. You will do well if you have a passion for it. If not, it will be alot of memory work. Physics requires alot of understanding, application and practise, just like maths.<br><br>With regards to readjusting to a new class, definitely it will be something to face. But consider that the subject you choose will live with you for 2 years, while this readjustment is just a one-off.<br><br>Talk to your seniors, especially if anyone is taking both, though highly unlikely.<br><br>Reconsider H3 Pharm Chem. The whole syllabus is extremely tough and lectures are nonsensical, probably worse than the physics you are getting now. But I guess it may be better in your year, since my year was the first and no one was really clear what was going in. If you can, though, NUS Bio is a more viable and enjoyable option, plus you can get it over and done with in 4-5 months, rather than 1.5 years for the MOE syllabus, and that the exam does not come with the A levels, leaving you free to concentrate on your H2 subjects.<br><br>All the best with J1 =)</div>

Physics is less mugging, more mathematical (which is good for me), and has more link to daily applications in our lives. But i hate the physics lessons so far!<br>[/b]</blockquote>With regards to teaching bio at the molecular or cellular level, I can say that it being mundane is your personal opinion and not applicable in general. It is rather amazing, actually, how such systems work together in such precision and efficiency. If you go into medicine in future, understanding what life is built upon - cells - will definitely help you in understanding how the human body functions, breaks down, and is treated. While there is stuff to memorise, as you understand and familiarise yourself with it, it becomes easier.<br><br>I disagree that physics has more link to daily applications in our lives. Biology is as beautiful, and is all around us - look at nature, why we function the way we do, etc! Both are simply different.<br><br>Go with your heart.

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe you are hesitant about taking H2 Biology because you doubt it's usefulness in daily application. However, I do not agree that Physics has more link to daily applications. In fact, most of the things we learn in JC are not very useful in terms of daily applications regardless of subjects (with certain exceptions, of course). We are taking the subjects mostly to help us build our foundations before we continue to university (arguably). If you are not intending to take engineering in university, I don't see why you'll find studying things like forces, waves and quantum mechanics useful.<br><br>Given your current hate of Physics, I don't think you'll be enjoying much when studying it. That may cause you to give up on it when the 'A' Levels approach next year and may result in you not doing well.<br><br>I'll advise you to take Biology instead.<br><br>If this is important, I'm taking Physics myself and I love it (I'm taking NTU H3 Contemporary Physics, so yeah...) , so don't flame me as being biased. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>@ghoby:<br>If you really hate physics that much, just switch, no point hanging on to it and doing badly in the end. If you are not sure if you want to switch to bio, crash a few bio lectures (kena caught the teacher usually dun care one, at least for you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  ) then decide if you like the style better. If you intend to go medical field, bio is not needed, but I *think* it might help quite a bit, from what my bio teacher in sec sch told me at the time.<br><br>@yxTay:<br>I'm taking NTU H3 physics too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  You taking at which JC now?</div>
