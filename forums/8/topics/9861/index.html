            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...<br><br>Recent reports shows that married women have the tendency to have a extra marital affair as much as guys. Some do it on the sly while others make unwritten pacts with their husbands.<br><br>They are commonly known as MSBs aka Married Social Butterflies.<br><br>Further interviews with individuals show that women thinks they have as much right to flirt around as society nowadays emphasize more on sexual equality. A string of several men is better than one. Just like you will get tired of eating cheeseburgers everyday.<br><br>One woman, Lex* said that she married her husband out of convenience and she was already two months pregnant when she met him. After giving birth to her son, she still goes around having fun with her lovers.<br><br>Another two, Maya* and Rachel* felt that they are not getting enough sex and money from their husbands, so they try to lighten their financial and sexual troubles by loitering around underground clubs to seduce potential guys secretly.<br><br>However, one woman, Claire* indicated that because her husband is having his own fun outside, so she is paying him back in his own coin. They are both agreeable not to have a divorce to humour their relatives.<br><br>Professor Sofie M. Francisco, who specialises in human psychology, commented, "Women nowadays feel that they are having the same problems as men. Therefore they are entitled to everything that used to be men's privilege. Modern society humans can be classified as bisexual in a way that they have a masculine and feminine side to them. No human can be classified as a single sex anymore. This MSB tendency will not die down... in fact, I think that maybe females will dominate males eventually in the next quarter of the century."<br><br>*: <span style="font-style: italic;">Not their real names.</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>You are poison... poison running through my veins...<br><br>Poison...
