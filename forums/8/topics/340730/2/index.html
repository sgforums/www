              <p><br>Yup i pray everyday even it may be a short prayer. its the heart dat matters, no point praying for hours if u dun mean it.</p>
              <p>but dat doesn't mean im holy which many people still dun get the true meaning of christianity. im still a sinner. i judge people, i scold vulgarities but at the end of the day, i apologised &amp; admit my faults. most importantly is one must know his roots.</p>
              <p>E.g, if u done someone wrong, would u apologise to the person if u knew it was ur fault?</p>

              <p>Many people still think sex as the way of the world does. But if u think it in God's way. Sex is holy &amp; meant only for married couples. Get your facts right. Dats nothing to be ashamed of having sex openly in the eyes of God IF YOU ARE MARRIED.</p>
              <p>i think you totally misterpreted my post. Mind if u read carefully, with your heart. Or maybe you dun get it becos you never went thru holy matrimony in church. And appreciate you dun judge me as you will be judged by others in turn.</p>

              <p><br>Unlike you, I'm not afraid of being judged by others as I am not of this world. You claimed to be a Christian and yet you are using the world's opinions as your sword and shield. GOD should be your ONLY Shield and Sword, not the world and their opinions nor their judgement matters anything to you.</p>
              <p>You should know it's wrong to compare between Christians and yet you claimed to be more pious and devoted than me. I'm happy for you if you really are more pious and devoted than me...as I'm sure it will certainly bring joy to GOD.</p>
              <p>Praying everyday and going to Church on Sunday or even everyday, does not makes you a Christian... as non-believers are all capable of doing that. And those illustrated actions of yours does not makes you a Christian. </p>
              <p>Sex is holy??? Do not try to mix up sex with GOD. And do you know why does married couple have sex? Sex has nothing to do with GOD, please go and consult your own pastor and correct your lost and twisted belief.</p>
              <p>If your belief is incorrect, it doesn't matter what you have contributed in Eternal Hope, which Church you come from, how many People you have helped or benefitted, or even who you are.</p>
              <p>What matters most to Christians is their relationship with GOD.</p>
              <p>Do you have a two-sided relationship with GOD?</p>
              <p>If not, you should first seek after a two-sided relationship with GOD. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Your knowledge of Christ is indeed laughable. For your benefit since you are not afraid of being judged by others. <strong>Matthew 7:1 "Do not judge, and you will not be judged, because the judgements you give out are the judgements you will get, and the amount you measure out is the amount you will be given".</strong> </p>
              <p>I repeat myself again. Sex is created by God &amp; He only permits MARRIED COUPLES to have sex for the creation of children. There's nothing to be ashamed about. Unless you are a pervert, then you will perceive sex as porn.</p>
              <p>Go get your facts right first before replying all your one-sided opinion.</p>
              <p>I have a good r/ship with God by the way. He blessed me in all areas. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Pls go &amp; brush up ur own christian knowledge &amp; stop saying sex has absolutely nothing to do with God. <strong>God creates sex for pro-creation.</strong> How many times u want me to repeat? How do u think God can promised Abraham many, many descendants? I'm certainly not misleading people. You just refused to believe dats all becos u r living in ur own world of perceptions.</p>

It is your own imaginations that were trying to link up Sex as holy and sacred. You must know this too, non-Christians have a choice whether they want to have pre-martial sex or not.

So sex itself is neither holy or sacred as you have painted in your twisted imaginations. Go seek help from your pastor if you don't believe me. But if that's what your pastor have been teaching you all this time, then I suggest you go and consult a different pastor.</p>
              <p>Do not mix up sex as an holy or sacred act because it is just a NEED. And it is the same as eating, breathing and sleeping as they are both examples of NEED. You cannot reproduce or pro-create other than having sex. And even if you choose not to have sex like priests and nuns, it doesn't means you are not holy and you have disobeyed GOD because you have denied yourself from sex by your own choice.</p>
              <p>And sex isn't a prayer as much as you have tried desperately to link them up as both sacred and tried to pass sex off as a prayer. Prayer is the way where Christians SEEK GOD. Christians seek GOD through praying. Worshipping is how Christians show their exaulted love for GOD.</p>

Everything you have written is <strong>FROM YOUR OWN WORLD OF PERCEPTIONS</strong>! Have u found out anything i have said whether is if the truth? Or you are just shooting your mouth off cos you simply just disagree. You were the one who contested my claim in the first place so YOU should go find evidence to suggest i am wrong.</p>
              <p>And no i did not say sex is prayer. I said <strong>SEX FOR MARRIED COUPLES MARRIED UNDER HOLY MATRIMONY=PRAYER</strong> becos both are considered sacred. But if you are not married, be it normal people, priests or nuns, you <strong>ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE SEX</strong> if you are a christian.</p>
              <p>Have u been listening to my post? Open ur heart for once &amp; stop all this one way traffic opinion of yours. You are just repeating &amp; repeating. Stop nagging.</p>
