              <p>Well, I certainly wasn't taught that. Besides, do you really think that the cliched exclamation of "Oh God, oh God," during sex is really a prayer?</p>
              <p>Being Asian has nothing to do with it. I've yet to find a verse in my Bible that states explicitly that having sex is a means of worship.</p>

              <p>Alamak u misinterpreted totally. i dun meant moaning: "Oh God...or sweet Jesus" during sex. dat is so wrong! i meant the act itself between a married couple, bonded by holy matrimony together like Christ with His bride(church) is equal to a prayer.</p>
              <p>What i meant being asian is perhaps we are more conservative &amp; tradition in our mentality as opposed to the US, europe &amp; middle east.</p>
