I am a woman. First I will run away, if cannot then surrender. If the enemy wins, I will work as a translator for them. My favorite department will be civil police.

With 4, the question became one of interpretation of the law.<br><br>And since they made no monkey chants and simply stood there in a silent protest, one can arguably claim that they were not DISTURBING THE PEACE as the officer-in-charge claimed.<br><br>This was exactly the kind of response they had hoped: an overkill attempt by the home team dispatched to subdue 4 mere citizens trying to spread a decent message to the public. It stinks of panic and mismanagement from the police force when 2-3 officers asking them to disband would have done the job.<br><br>With the live coverage from international reporters, they got the publicity they craved for and in so doing, indirectly sent a blunt signal to people around the world and singaporeans as whole: that SG represents a distorted democracy.</div>

We are the citizens, Gahmen are the master... thus no democracy at all.<br><br>Police? They're only paid big fcuks who think they are so great that they forgot their pledge to protect the people.

All the spf achieved was to attract criticism to itself and the govt, and to paint the SPF as the opressor of Singaporeans. I would have sent a couple of cops to disperse them, and it would have worked brilliantly; Singaporeans would probably go, 'CSJ Again! That clown!' as they did many times before.<br><br>I do not think the order came from the govt. I think what happened was that some high ranking police officer got too caught up in the moment (perhaps he was thinking of the increased promotion prospects if he did this right), and well, screwed up.<br><br>Damn sad, coz i gather he would be relegated to the promotions graveyard now.</div>
