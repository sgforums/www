Four (yes, 4) activists who had assembled outside the Central Provident Fund Building in downtown Singapore to protest against the non-transparent and non-accountable nature of the way the Singapore Government deals with public funds.

Throughout the protest all four protesters stood silently until the police started questioning them.<br><br>Three, why is the Singapore Government so afraid of four peaceful protesters that it had to send in the riot squad? Signs of insecurity perhaps? </div></blockquote>I haven't screened through the papers today but it will definitely not be front page news.<br><br>Given the fact that the protesters were clearly aware of the 5 or more = rioting law, it seems only rational they chose to include just 4 in their protest. Won't be surprised the law is amended to cover this 'loophole'.<br><br>I'm sure if CNN or BBC covered the news, SG would have been promoted as the laughing stock of the world. The fact that a completely non-violent 'demonstration' required just under 40 police with a dozen in RIOT gear must have been a visual RIOT for viewers.<br><br>Having broken, no laws (technically) and carrying no weapons (except for 'dangerous' placards), they were forced to surrender all damanging items to the law enforcement office, who will probably lock them up in some soon-to-be-forgotten storage area; hardly evidence worth investigating.<br><br>This goes to show that the bullyboy tactics utilised by police was a mere show of power to intimidate other like-minded members of the public not to attempt such acts at govt institutions again.<br><br>Wonder what Wong kan Seng will say....SAF doctrine requires ratio of 3:1 for attacking prepared positions. Against civilians, our home team went one better and applied an odds on 10:1....overwhelming odds?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>
