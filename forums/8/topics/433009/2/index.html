              <p>(1) Naive. You think government is really sincere in wanting to curb immigration and restrict foreign labour influx</p>
              <p>(2) How do you attract more investments from MNCs when they come to singapore and you restrict foreign labour influx causing their labour costs to increase?</p>

              <p>I guess you are one Singaporean that has been corrupted by the govt's talk about being cheap and good (with cheap being the most impt factor).</p>
              <p>There are other means of attracting investment, labor costs being ONLY ONE of them.</p>
              <p>Aiyo... you really aren't doing much critical thinking, eh?</p>
              <p>And since when are we talking about the sincerity of the govt? We are talking about how to manage costs, NOT about whether the govt is sincere in really wanting to manage costs or not.</p>
              <p>If you cannot get out of the mindset of "I hate the Govt", and look at things objectively, no one can help you.</p>
              <p>You will just continue to whallow in self-pity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And, since you like to criticize without giving any alternate suggestions (as per always for armchair critics), why don't we hear what you think we should do, for our housing woes right now?</p>

              <p>Ok, stop arguing already.</p>
              <p>I think more can be done to make housing more affordable, but I'm not sure if the idea by TS is the way to go.</p>
              <p>Firstly, more affordable to who? To the poor, to the rich or to everyone? A one-size fits all policy will only create more problems.</p>
              <p>As mentioned in other threads, you also have to look at other policies relating to housing - investment, overseas buyers etc. All of this are related and can affect the general affordability of housing for locals.</p>
              <p>I think an option would be to offer subsidised housing for groups on the lower scale of income (is this kind of information readily available?). I think it is that group that can really say that housing needs to be more affordable.</p>

The sudden shift of property prices down would create a scenarios for foreigners to withdraw and in a all business related  economy like singapore, you will see fall in sharemarkets, construction, industrial supporting construction and so on,..at the lower end, earn less, eat less and travel less, food stalls will take in less and taxi drivers etc etc will hv to suffer.</p></div>

              <p>Government will not stem the flow of foreigners despite a

              want to fool citizens into believing that action is being taken.The
              government needs new citizens to shore up its own support base for
              the next election and to prop up Singapore economy or ministers and
              their cronies will not be able to eat their abalone seafood feast,
              go France for culinary classes, throw weddings for a few hundred
              thousand dollars.</p>
              <p>The government did not have the welfare of the people at heart
              in the first place thus causing this to happen, the government is
              not interested in helping its' own citizens, it helps only
              foreigners with free housings, scholarships and jobs. They went

              <p>New flats are being constructed, still a few more years, so
              people who are holding onto expensive flats will have a chance to
              try and do some personal damage control if they really find
              themselves in a unfavourable position. There's still time.</p>
              <p>What the government should do is trying to cool the property
              market step by step, with enough time so that people can do some
              adjustment.</p>

              <p>Regarding your point that the government begged them to come, anyone online can see that it's true.</p>
              <p>But as long as a single government person does not admit or even deny it, nobody will believe this is happening. The government is smartly ignoring the noise.</p>
              <p>You need to shout louder by putting the evidence on stomp or use some even better tactic.Then we can have a public outcry!</p>

              <p><br>that's the problem with our Govt.</p>
              <p>They are still using yesteryear's policies to compete in the global market. Where once, we were a developing country, and we could compete based on lower wages, it's no longer true for today's Singapore. </p>
              <p>Some kids here think that the only way to competing in the global market is through being cheap. That they rant endlessly about the Govt's policies and yet accepting this untruth.</p>
              <p>If today's global market is only focused on cheap, then rightfully ALL jobs would have gone to India and China. As you can see, this is NOT true. </p>

              <p>I think you do not understand the impact of property price fall, so far for the past years, it had shoot up tremendously, non stop. Once there is a downfall, it will hv a domino effect that affect all things, more so are those who had bought it at 600k for a 5 rms, ++interest total 700k++ will be still paying more than what his pals who just bought it for 300k, who during his time, he could had paid off by now or able to pay one time off. The sudden shift of property prices down would create a scenarios for foreigners to withdraw and in a all business related  economy like singapore, you will see fall in sharemarkets, construction, industrial supporting construction and so on,..at the lower end, earn less, eat less and travel less, food stalls will take in less and taxi drivers etc etc will hv to suffer.</p>

              <p><br>Drastic price falls are very detrimental to Singaporeans who bought flats at a high price.</p>
              <p>For example, if a Singaporean bought a home at $1m, and owes the bank $800k.</p>
              <p>There is a sudden property crash and the value of his home has now fallen by half to $500k for example.</p>
              <p>Given that the bank now values the property lower than the outstanding loan amount, the bank can decide to exercise its right to demand the Singaporean to pay up the difference (ie 800k - 500k = 300k). If he cannot pay up that lump sum, the bank has the right to repossess the home.</p>
