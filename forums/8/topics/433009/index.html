              <p>I think government should subside new hdb flats more and put a cap on the price to make them more affordable.</p>
              <p>1 room new hdb flat could be ranged from 50k to 80k. Meaning that the maximum amount we have to pay to buy a 1 room flat at a very good place is 80k while those at lousy location pay only 50k for it.</p>
              <p>2 room new hdb flat price range from 80k to max 120k.</p>
              <p>3 room new hdb flat price range from 120k to 150k.</p>
              <p>4 room new hdb flat price range from 150k to 200k</p>
              <p>5 room new hdb flat price range from 200k to 250k.</p>
              <p>HDB should also offer no interest housing loans for a maximum of 99 years which is the lease of the house.</p>
              <p>For example, if you buy a 80k 1 room flat, you get a 99 year interest free loan.</p>
              <p>So the amount you pay a month is 80k divide by 99 years divide by 12 months=$67</p>
              <p>So if you take a 99 year free interest rate loan with hdb, you only pay $67 a month for the entire 99 years.</p>
              <p>I think this will make hdb flats very affordable and more people will get marry and have their own family</p>

              <p>One idea is to sell HDB at slightly higher price than the cost needed to build the flat.</p>

              <p>If market determines that the price drops, nothing to say.</p>
              <p>But if it's because of 1-time policies to placate Singaporeans who want to buy a flat, it's not correct.</p>
              <p>What is the percentage of Singaporeans who want to own a flat, versus those who already own a flat?</p>
              <p>Realistically, if you are a leader, what would you do? Placate the small percentage of Singaporeans who want to own a flat, and in doing so, incur the wrath of the huge percentage of others who already own one?</p>
              <p>Like FireIce said, Wake up.</p>
              <p>Not to say I agree with the government policies of letting prices run amok. Just that they are now caught in a situation where pushing prices down is bad, pushing prices up is also bad, they are just not sure how to resolve the situation anymore.</p>

              <p>A more realistic method of resolving the property issue are the following:</p>
              <p>(1) curb immigration and restrict foreign labor influx. This will put a damper on demand</p>
              <p>(2) focus on increasing salaries by (a) attracting more investments from MNCs, (b) more importantly, growing our homegrown companies</p>
              <p>The most important thing is to grow salaries, and curb price increases for now, so that salaries can catch up. This is the better solution in the long-term.</p>

              <p><br>Precisely. I don't envy anyone sitting in that ministerial role now. It's like taking up the consequences of someone else's incorrect policies.</p>
              <p>In the 1st place, prices of properties should have been better managed to rise in tandem with salaries.</p>
              <p>But in our relentless pursuit of economic growth, and the use of yesterday's policy of curbing labor costs to attract investments, we are now caught in a situation where it's now very difficult to resolve.</p>

              <p>Not to say I agree with the government policies of letting prices run amok. Just that they are now caught in a situation where pushing prices down is bad, pushing prices up is also bad, they are just not sure how to resolve the situation anymore.</p>

              <p>A more realistic method of resolving the property issue are the following:</p>
              <p>(1) curb immigration and restrict foreign labor influx. This will put a damper on demand</p>

              <p>(1) Naive. You think government is really sincere in wanting to curb immigration and restrict foreign labour influx</p>
              <p>(2) How do you attract more investments from MNCs when they come to singapore and you restrict foreign labour influx causing their labour costs to increase?</p>
              <p>Which MNCs will want to come to singapore to invest and employ expensive singaporeans to work for them?</p>
