DOn't be telling me how to spent time with my GF, How i got my girlfriend is simply; we both have Japanese Passports. but i think just for you ONLY, your mixed parentage "Machipanese" yield a fu*kin stupid offspring. Yea, why don't you try cross breedind with Scandinavian and Peruvian. maybe your child might have the IQ of a dog. Sorry that i cant answer the rest of your questions. my english is no good and i want to go shopping!<br><br>Prodigy<br><br>You are so right, i crave attention but i don't intent to get it from this posting here.

Does that make you a Taipan? Relax man its just light hearted fun. No flaming intended okie?<br><br>Oh yes I have a question. Does having a Japanese passport make you Japanese by racial categorization?<br><br>And you mentioned your gf has a Japanese passport. How did you two meet because I haven't met much Japanese girls in Singapore.<br><br>By the way, where are you going shopping? How are you getting there? Who are you going with? Why did you choose this day to go? What is your budget? Do you prefer feeding your dog biscuits or dog food? Do you use checks or cash? Or credit card? NETS? Do you use plastic or paper bags? What color is your hair? Does it affect your ability to shop? If you were part of a tree, which part would you be? Why? Are you happy that this string of questions are ending? If yes, why?<br>If no, why? Please answer these questions in letter format.<br><br>Oh yes Shogun, I'm too lazy to ask who you are and why you know my name, so don't worry about trying to unfog the 'mystery' of your identity in my mind.
