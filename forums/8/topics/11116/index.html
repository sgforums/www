            <div class='col-md body'>I discover this site by chance and i was specially interested with the posting on HMV Japanese girls.<br><br>First to begin with, this site need revamp in the expressing of english language. So if you boys and girls can't speak enough Nihhongo to save yourself, try speaking better english, preferable with americano accent. Trust me you stand a better chance<br><br>Second Don't waste time hanging out at HMV or Ginza like dicks, you make yourself look like a sorry pile of sh*t. Stop wearing tight fitting Diesel T shirts with Japanese prints, they are fucking adverds of some household products.<br><br>Personally i have nothing against Japanese fashion. I mean just like some they DIG america stuff But FUBU is really Blackwear, so ppl how many skinny niggers have you seen?<br>I've seen many NiggerBengs, (with skintight T's) yea thats what they're call. FUBU is Black clothes for Black people, it's meant to LOUD AND HUGE, not skinny pukes'wear So to all the people that i'd mention, if you persist to keep wearing a $50 blond mop on your head and wear awful rugs, what you call fashion...  go grap your passport and live in Johore Bahru. There you can be the hippiest dude and maybe....they think your Japanese!!!  Hahaha<br><br>final words before i get struck to hell for my judgemental views, if you want Japanese girls, Go form a rock band and have big $200 blond hair OR be yourTrueself and speak proper english. well ..  rest is up to her<br><br>ps, my GF is jpnese but no i don't have big blond hair   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by mishima (edited 06 February 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mishima chan<br>Ok I just took elementary Jap so I shan't talk about that ... hehe...<br><br>The Japanese younger generation in my opinion is imitating the so called "pop culture" of America some time back. Right here in Canada, it not just the Japanese that dye their hair blond, most Asian girls who wanna be 'Coco Lee' is mainly, so they can relate better to the Americans.<br><br>What I believe is that no matter what u wear, u must feel comfortable. I think right now the Japanese fashion is 'in', therefore young ppl who do not know what is nice on them, wear what is so called 'safe' so that they won't be in the limelight of people looking weird at them. So what if the T-shirt they are wearing, they do not understand a single word?<br><br>The Americans are even more weird then. They tattooed dragons, chinese wordings onto their body, thinking it is so cool. Can u imagine that they would not even know how a chinese character look like and one stroke or less can make a character means a totally different thing! One of my Canadian frens came to ask me once how to write 'kindness' in Mandarin. Not feeling very competent, I just wrote it base on what I remembered. MY gosh,, the next day, she turned up at my door-step and showed me a shoulder, "Hey look at this!" I was like..."Oh my.....!" She tattooed that word on herself!!And it is permanent, mind u!I was really praying that I have written the right strokes or some real hard core Chinese ppl will be laughing their heads off! I would have told her not to do it if I knew that she was going to get it as a tattoo.<br><br>Yeah...cool...very very cool.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 06 February 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FireIce<br><br>this is my definition of JFashion<br><br>10 years ago, it was just your regular Jeans and Ts with a sprinkle of cardigans, silly big hats(you see this in orchard) The hats are to keep the skin white and when pink makeup was in the rage. For the men still your regular stuff but torn jeans this time. Also for the OYAJIs (old man) they carry one of the small leather bag which they have under their arm.

I'm critical on this issue, i talk about it couple of time on this post but hey i can't change anything rite. It's just my person view and the whole point of the post is freedom speech. I don't tell anyone who is right or wrong on this site, i'm just saying what went wrong out there in the streets. OK so this is not personal, i'd just want people to know why i talk on the "printed T-shirt issue"<br><br>[This message has been edited by mishima (edited 06 February 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Living in Singapore for the past 5yrs. this is my personal experience, with contacts to the local, food, culture &amp; more....Fashion<br><br>Theres only 2 season here either hot or rainy like this evening.the range of clothes will also be limit because of the weather. I think singaporean are still exploring with their fashion Identity, the trends here are a fusion of US(street/skates/surf/Bobmarleys), HongKong, Taiwan. these are the mainstream that i can think of. Suits and more serious clothes are out at this point as i'm talking on the focus of general fashion. People, when you see PUNKS walking with Skin shaven Spiked hair, do you not get shock? Same goes to JWear, it's born out of the popstar craze with guys wanting to look like Kimu Taku and Namie A. mess media and mags and the spread of this culture revolution. Being HIP has become commercial, everyone hang out at cool place looking for the next fashion statement or with the invasion of MTV and TCS popcats (sucks) hate the host anyway. In a sense, some disillusional think copying or look alikes are the closest that they can attain Fashion Nirvana.<br><br>Whether here in Asia or the west, singapore fashion is a fusion and slow becoming a confusion. This is ofcourse happaning in Japan, all chicks there throw megaBucks to get the NamieA tan and blond hair, but hey Namie is making big bucks on these poor mindless chicks. Fashion is to express yourself, if you don't fit the bill try some things else. why try become someone when you can't be, ending up looking foolish.<br><br>white people, mostly can't tell what you are, either you Japanese, chinese, taiwanese. They just think your yellow (not being racist here) and Asian chicks here are exotic, so girls why try so hard to act like Jpopstars, you are exotic and beautiful if you express yourself in the manner.<br><br></div>

And if you were truly half Japanese, you would NEVER EVER say the word "Jap". I am part Malay, Chinese and Japanese so does that make me a Machipanese?

And your gf is japanese? What's her name? Nagasaki Hiroshima Hai? Or you gonna come up with a more exotic name? Where did you get your Japanese girlfriend by the way? And why are you posting this when you can spend time with her? Have you fed your dog yet? Look at your shoelaces and make sure they're tied. Did you remember to shake your clothes before hanging them out to dry? Have you tried virgin sushi yet? If you are half Japanese, which half and why?
