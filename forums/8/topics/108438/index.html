            <div class='col-md body'>Here's an alternative point of view:<br><br>Well, I think the bunch of NTU students who attached to my office had enjoyed themselves cause I see the girls always go chit chat with the guys, surf net, play games. The girls do the documentation, print and print till printer jam and pretend nothing happen. The guys were suppose to do up some application with some fields to collect/display data over a web based interface.  They do not much and I know their supervisor hold meetings and gave instructions what should be implemented but I guess they don't quite get it. Towards the end, they sorta miss the place. Although the guys are ok, the girls are kinds bit.chy, ie look at other people up down and almost always look so unhappy.  Though they are quite a noisy bunch but kept to themselves.  They are so "unspoilt" and new to real working life ... I guess its their first foray into the real world ...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before I started any of the industrial attachments I did while at university, we had to sign a placement contract, which stipulated exactly what we were expected to deliver to the organisation and vice versa.  The contracts always contained an exit clause in the event that obligations were not being fulfilled.<br><br>As for payment, the highest I got was when I converted a placement into a full-time job (it was for redesigning a recruitment system so that at least 80% of the work could be done online) and got about A$4600 per month.  Personally, I figure market rate would have been between $5500-$6000 a month, but what the hell, I was short on cash at the time.</div>
