Never win, else will be a good advertisment for me.<br><br>Bottomline is if you can get a company on your own, you may be able to negotiaite the work styles or even pay then ask them to request for you. Given that now lots of company is not into the attachment scheme, company who does esp smaller one would tend to abuse, or you might not learn anything useful.
