People can save images on the internet as they like for personal usage as you mentioned but that does not implied that they can repost it in some other website. The law by itself is meant to protect the company products from pirated off the net into someone elses. It also serve to protect against infringement of a person privacy.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hisoka:</div><div class="quote_body">what to do? stupid govt with stupid laws......... how dumb can the judge get by saying the host must screen thru everything, not only that but must make sure its not copyrighted(last time i checked there isn't a database of copyrights and even if there is how to conduct a good search of it.

So if you take a photo of some chio schoolgirl on the streets, you haven't done anything wrong legally, so long as it's not pornographic or supposedly 'undesirable'.<br><br>Of course, if you do want to take the pic of some chio schoolgirl for goodness' sake ask for her permission first....

Man -&gt; Xggirls Company<br>2. Man -&gt; Newspaper Company<br>3. Man &lt;- Knife Company<br><br>The basis of law is to protect people and also to upkeep the business ethics. If the two company in 1 &amp; 2 want to get into play, they must obey the rules of the game. The knife company in this case is not liable for any offence because the service they provide is generally for "good consumption." One may also argue that in example 1 &amp; 2 could also providing "good consumption", but note here that they are actually opening up their services. An another argument is that knife company is also providing a service. Hence the man is this part play an important role, in example 1 &amp; 2, the man post photos or articles because the companies in 1 &amp; 2 provide such a service hence upon providing such services they are liable under law. Whereas in 3, the man buy knife from knife company for his own consumption while the knife company indeed provide a service to man but the company existence is for providing "good consumption".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>If I can't win you, I'm going to confuse you. Joking... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>By the way, if I am not wrong, there are certain measures undertaken to differentiate what are copyrighted materials. I believe any website that intent to upload photos on their own website are required to print their own website name as a safeguard for pirates. A measure though not foolproof.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The main issue here should be if there was intent by the service provider, to encourage, exhort or in any way show tort in their action.<br><br>Take for example the case of "sggirls": due to the large volume of information transfered, it would be crazy to vet all the information.  Hence when copyright information is detected by the owner and brought to the attention of the provider, the provider should remove the said information.  Once that has been done it would seem to have solve the problem rite?<br><br>Do not forget that what has transpired, happened online sooo... if we trace it all the way back would't it be the inventors of the internet be responsible?<br><br>If such rulings are made with no exception, it would desuade others to have such services.</div>

Man -&gt; Xggirls Company<br>2. Man -&gt; Newspaper Company<br>3. Man &lt;- Knife Company<br><br>The basis of law is to protect people and also to upkeep the business ethics. If the two company in 1 &amp; 2 want to get into play, they must obey the rules of the game. The knife company in this case is not liable for any offence because the service they provide is generally for "good consumption." One may also argue that in example 1 &amp; 2 could also providing "good consumption", but note here that they are actually opening up their services. An another argument is that knife company is also providing a service. Hence the man is this part play an important role, in example 1 &amp; 2, the man post photos or articles because the companies in 1 &amp; 2 provide such a service hence upon providing such services they are liable under law. Whereas in 3, the man buy knife from knife company for his own consumption while the knife company indeed provide a service to man but the company existence is for providing "good consumption".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>If I can't win you, I'm going to confuse you.

I believe any website that intent to upload photos on their own website are required to print their own website name as a safeguard for pirates.
