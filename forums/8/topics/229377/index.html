            <div class='col-md body'>The answer is white.. The reasoning behind it I know but its very long but you think about it it's got to do with the silence.. Like the people keep quiet because they have 2 or more options to guess their colour so after eliminating the possibilities "told" by the silence, thats how the guy know the answer..

            <div class='col-md body'>The Answer...<br><br>The prisoners would only keep quiet if they cannot eliminate enough and 100% confirmed the colour of their hat. In other words, each would probably be having the options of 2 possible colours or 3 possible colours of their own hats.<br><br>A keeps quiet at first because obviously he doesn't know as he couldn't see anyone's hat.<br><br>D who could see everyone's hat except his, kept quiet. This means that he has a dilemma on the colour of his hats(couldn't 100% confirm). This means on the 3 prisoners, the colour cannot be 1 red and 2 black. Because by elimination, D would have guessed his is white and he would have shouted out his hat is white first. Hence, it is concluded that D could see a white in front of him.<br><br>Prior to D's silence(meaning that 1 red and 2 black is not possible among A, B, and C), can it be 1 red, 1 black, 1 white? D would remain quiet cos he is either white or black. But C could see that if the hats in front of him are 1 red and 1 black, his would definitely be white and he would shout his is white but he didn't. Hence, it is concluded again that he sees a white in front of him.<br><br>Now to B. After D and C kept quiet, he should know both of them saw a white either on him or A because of their silence. If he saw a red or a black on A, that means he is white, so he could shout out the answer! But he didn't shout. So if he didn't shout that means he didn't see a red or a black, but a white hat on A!<br><br>Thanks to the silence treatement by D,C, and B, A now knows all of them saw a white hat. <strong>That's how he shouted his hat is white!</strong></div>
