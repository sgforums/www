            <div class='col-md body'>aiyo..its like that de la...Rules must be regulated against Singaporeans de..No rules No courtesy! and even though rules are implemented, some of those will not follow, they heck care...you can see Australia,although rules are not implemented, you can see the toilet of a long highway clean like new...<br><br>But something that i want to clarify is that, all the act you mention above does not solely applies to Singaporeans mahz...Singapore has ppl frm many countries mahz...if you are refering to chinese, they can be frm malaysia,china, blah blah blah...Indians can be frm bangaladesh, pakisetan blah blah blah...<br><br>so..the moral of the story is, what you have seen does not means it Singaporeans doing it mahz, can be ppl of other countries. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>............................................................................................................................<br><img><img></div>
