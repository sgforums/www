            <div class='col-md body'>Ok when the synthetic age reaches its climax, there will be machines (intelligent ones) in every household and there will be 10 times more machines than humans. Now you have to realize that because it is we, humans, who built these machines, they share our thinking and way of reasoning. They would treat humans as their masters, or if an error in digital programming occured, they would no longer see themselves as our servants, but treat us as we would treat animals. they would see us as a great source for harnessing our biothermal electric energy to power their mechanical bodies when there are too many machines for usual methods to support. or they would just leave us alone, knowing we pose no threat unless we try to win the world back from, the machines of course. or they would cooperate with us. this is very unlikely, because we humans have been dominant species of this planet for hundreds of thousands of years and when we finally become 2nd in position on earth we would feel extremely neglected and would seize ANY available opportunity to destroy the machines.<br><br>Even now we have household robots, but not plentiful..most are for industrial use but one day we'll have robotic servants..everything would be digital and the human race would sink into a state where everything is done automatically for them..we'll be lazy, inconsiderate, useless, weak, ignorant fatties who live in pleasure everday..work would be done by machines, employment rates would drop so much...in about 200 years..just imagine the technology that would be a part of our daily lives..imagine cities that actually REACH for the skies, cities that are constructed by machines alone..while humans would not risk the danger and would control everything from their homes or offices...nothing would be done by human beings..everything would be automated..we would multiply, destroy the environment, pollute eveyrthing on earth..then we would move to the moon, mining its minerals and rare resources, and when we're done with that, we'll terraform mars to support human life due to overpopulation of the earth's surface...machines would clear the path of all obstacles to make way for humans to colonize..we would integrate technology into our bodies, we would be biosynthetic beings, androids, biomechanisms..cyborgs...we would first start with small synthetic parts being built into us, then one day we'll make ourselves fully machinized..and when that happens, the human race would be as good as dead because the only thing that determines if we're alive or not is our physical bodies..our FLESH..if our minds were to be transferred to machine bodies...we'll be exintinct even tho we're still very much alive...that is what future generations of people would have to go through..the horror of a world controlled by machines and not by humans or any other animal...<br><br>you have to realize in the near future, within a thousand years, theres almost a 100% possibility of machines that have near-human intelligence, and bio-computers would replace network/home computers and would be at least a thousand times faster in processing speed.<br><br>Within a thousand years, there may be 5 intelligent groups living here:<br><br>1) Humans/Primates (Without implants/Natural)<br>2) Biomechanisms (Humans with cybernetic implants)<br>3) Smart Machines (AI enabled, home use/scientific use)<br>4) Industrial Machines (AI disabled, very few functions)<br>5) Bio-Synthetics (Machines controlled by a human mind)<br><br>Which machine you will be depends on how wealthy you are, or you much you are willing to pay. Of course, in the distant future, money would be the least of all concerns, as we do not need to pay machines to do our work. Machines would construct machines, machines would mine for resources at the edges of the galaxy, where humans would not yet have ventured to, machines would be linked in a network I would call a Nexus, the internet of the machine world, where all machines are linked together through cyberspace all across the colonized galaxy. The Nexus would be a storage of machine data, and it would be accessible by humans who tap into its database. Our Internet would be linked to the Nexus and data would be freely available. There would be the Opposition though, a group which despises our technology and wants to end all machine dominance and dependence on technology. This group would be a minority, maybe less than 5% of our world's population (machines excluded). This group would be outcasts in our society, because they have failed to adapt to changing circumstances and new technology and instead choose to live in the past. The Opposition would be neglected, hunted like criminals, and they would start a war to end machine dominance, but they would fail. This group would very quickly cease to exist. I'd suggest you'd not join this group.<br><br>But, when overpopulation occurs on the Earth, the humans would no longer be ignored by the machines as a harmless species. The machines would USE us and any other animal still alive to harness our body's heat to convert it into electricity which would power up the machines' bodies.<br><br>which side mechanized humans would take would greatly depend on their culture and beliefs. If you believe in a world of 'paradise' where law and order would be maintained by machines alone, where no human would dare commit offences, then you would side with the Smart Machines. If you believe in a world where Nature is greater than artificial intelligence, and where humans should rule instead of machines, then you would join the Opposition. If you believe in a world where technology would help us but also not prevent us from ruling this planet, then I suggest you join the Biomechanisms.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A machine must be treated as part of an individual species I would like to call the Digital Races of the Machine World. We must realize that, as machines grow more powerful, one day they'll develop similar thinking as ours, and also when a species grows, it would think of ways to better itself. colonization, conquest, expansion..all these would come into the mindset of the machines very soon once the synthetic age reaches its peak.<br><br>Ah by the way I've written something to help u better understand where we are right now.<br><br>1930-1960: Atomic Age<br>1960-1975: Space Age<br>1975-1990: Nuclear Age<br>1990-2020: Digital Age<br>2020-2100: Genetic Age<br>2040-2300: Synthetic Age<br><br>Approximately in the early years of the 23rd century, one machine would be capable of calculations of 10 to the power 78 per second, many many many times faster than our fastest computer right now. By this time, machines would be as powerful, or even more powerful than 'God', if god even exists, that is (but i doubt it). anyway, a human living in the 21st century when compared to another living in thr 23rd century would be far weaker in physical and mental strength than its counterpart. a human in the 23rd AD would have many many cybernetic implants that allows him to speak without opening his mouth or uttering a single word or noise. Thoughts would come as brainwaves and sent to the receipent of whom the person is talking to. the receipent would receive the brainwaves and translate them into words or images in his built-in computer in his head. mental strength, especially, would improve a thousand times in the next 300 years as we better understand our consciousness and minds. we would speak to animals through brainwave translation alone. we would be able to achieve anything!! it would be paradise!! it would be an age humanity have long dreamt of!! a vision to create a superhuman would finally be realized!! or, it may be a nightmare as biomechanisms and machines would compete over who gets to rule the planet and solar system as both are machines, although one only partia</div>
