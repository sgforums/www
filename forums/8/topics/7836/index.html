            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm, hi there,<br><br>I wonder why I have decided to write a post like this in the forum, particularly, sitting down in front of my computer, putting my results into the thesis. Well, perhaps, I just think about where I am heading.<br><br>For the whole of last week, I got drunk almost everyday because I am bored of everything. I find that there is no faith in life and people.<br><br>So, what do we do when we are at crossroads? Where do we move from here? I really don't know, and I recalled from a song that I listen by Jeff Chang called "Duo Siang" (Thinking more), and it reflects totally what I have in mind. Finally, after a good booze last night, and I slept thru the whole night, I realized that it was morning again, and the sun is shining on my face.<br><br>I suddenly realized where to go from here, and not to be bored again. It's time to say no, and to say no, is the most important thing in my life, because to say no, means that I can finally come to terms with what I think is the cause to all these suffering and I can finally leave it all behind. So, since Death did not take my life in the past week, it would be much harder for him to do so, until later.<br><br>Because I can finally say no, it is time to come home soon......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Have a good day....<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>The Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>

He flew over from Boston after seeing his daughter's graduation to see me here. I have a good talk with him, and he offered me a few words of wisdom. One of the most important things, which he said to me before I go home, is that "there are no wrong turnings, but only paths you walk which you thought at first that you were never meant to."<br><br>*let's cheers with our beers for old times and new times*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>yours,<br>The Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights.
