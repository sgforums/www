Some may think this is a slightly over exaggerated, whimsical and maybe a little unrealistic. But let me assure you. I do hate Australia, and for good reason.<br><br>1. You Elect, then re-elect, then re-elect again, COMPLETE MORONS.<br>John Howard. In Howards first term his goverment scrapped many education and training initives set in place by the previous goverment, increase to university tuition fees and a large funding cuts in the budget, across the board. DOES THIS NOT SEND WARNING SOUNDS TO YOU MORONS? In the guys first term he starts cutting back on education and other essential areas (In heinsight the very concept of education is wasted on an Australian mind, but oh well) And despite these obvious warning signs that the guy obviously is unable to run a country, even one as retarded (literally) as Australia, you re-elect him in 1998, then in 2001, and again in 2004? <br><br>Most Australians I’ve spoken to (and I do know a fair few) have admitted that Howard simply peddles a few promises at election time and that saves him. Again proving how retarded you are as a nation. POLITICIANS SAY A LOT OF THINGS AROUND ELECTION TIME. You must take everything they say with a pinch of salt. Hell, it seems anyone could get elected as prime minister of Australia, all they’d need to do is say they’d abolish all tax and the state would pay eveyone a personal salary so you didn’t have to work. No question you’d all go out and vote for them. Morons.<br><br>2. Aboriginies<br>Now this may be a touchy subject in Australia, some people tell me it is. But lets look at this logically. Any white Australian is little more than an immigrant. Your family can not have been in Australia for more than 200-250 years if you are not an aborigini. So what? 4-5 generations? Like I said, you’re little more than immigrants in your own country. And yet, aboriginies are treated like an underclass? They were in ‘your’ country, long before you. <br><br>3. Australian Rules Football<br>WHAT A RETARDED GAME. Seriously, it’s like somebody woke up one day and said “hey, lets go make a game that nobody else in the world will be able to sit through an entire match of without wanting to gouge out both of their eyes.” The rules make little to no sense, and it seems like a retarded version of football and rugby. And watching it is on a par with passing gallstones in ones urine.<br><br>4. You, as a country, aren’t good at much, if anything.<br>Ok what? Sport? You’re good at cricket, I’ll give you that. England have beaten you twice at rugby in the past two world cups, even though both times you were the favourites (Tip for Australians: Look up “Moral Fibre” in the dictionary and learn something about it) Football you suck at, so sport overall, you’re nothing special at. What else have you got..?<br>…<br>..<br>..<br>I’ll answer for you: NOTHING.<br><br>I could list more but I’m getting bored of typing this out, and I have to leave in 5 minutes.<br>If you are reading this from Australia, and have the huge misfortunue of being Australian, I leave you with these words: Suicide is the only option.<br><br>That is all.</p></div>

              <p>If you're going to justify hating Australia, at least have the dignity and intelligence to do so for something important like Pauline Hanson turning up for that stupid dancing competition.  You gotta learn to think big, son.</p>
              <p>By the way, get with the times.  What with the wine industry going to screw caps these days, corksuckers are becoming rarer and rarer these days.</p>

              <p>I think we're better than Singapore in many ways. We're a much healthier democracy and we're happier, and we surf, we have more sport in schools. But yeah aussie rules sucks, watch league its much better. We have a sense of humour and we laugh at things that are funny, and we have better comedy. What else, oh and longer history.Part of being a democracy means you'll always get time wasting politics and stupid electoral cycles, but unlike a dictatorship, we can kick out the corrupt and change things much quicker. Each government is suited to its own locale. But yeah electoral cycles suck because the electorate is myopic, same thing in most democracies, but that's the essence of democracy.</p>
              <p>Yeah it sucks what we did to do aboriginees, it was really cool how rudd apologized though.</p>
              <p>Actually i think Singapore has more suicidal tendency due to stress than in Oz.</p>
              <p>But to each his own. I dont think Oz is a good place for singaporeans or asian people since they complain of racism and not being treated equally. So where you choose to live ultimately depends on you, we don't force ideas to the people and i wont tell u whether one country is overall better or more superior to another, that's just childish.</p>

              <p>Australia has more overt racism and violence, and its not safe walking alone on the streets past midnight. The laws are extremely lax against crimes. There was random mugging/violent assult inducing grevious head-injuries of a friend leaving him close to death and a month of coma, while those retarded 17 year olds criminals were only jailed for 1 year (after which they're free to roam the streets again) and they didn't even look sorry.</p>
              <p>Implementation of technology is slower in comparison,and they have shitty and costly internet compared to SG. Bad public transports, everywhere is too far even by driving, very inconvenient. Too much vandalisms, and dangerous threatening looking losers walking on the street. Some might yell racial slurs at you for not being white, you feel your life's threatened.</p>
              <p>Its boring as shops closes early, and the prices of things are wayyyy too expensive, bad for shopping. Everywhere look the same, nothing unique or special after you've stayed for awhile. Although Australian TV programs are better than our lame SG local productions, their humor are actually quite lame too and tries to copy ideas from the US and their accent are extremely annoying.</p>
              <p>Nice beaches though, but that's all.</p>

              <p>what i said is just an observation.</p>
              <p>and with regards to forgiveness.. it's the position of the aborigines and red indians to forgive us. lol there's nothing for us to forgive.</p>
              <p>yes, racism is wrong, but i'm comfortable leaning towards stereotyping races.</p>

              <p>THe traditional native american tribal lifestyle may have a superior sustainable aspect of it. But i suppose we can say this: they may have been around longer, but they did not develop and the europeans were at a higher level (a level which everyone today wishes to emultate by the way, including you singaporeans), and hence it was easy to subdue them, that is the law of power and the way history turned out. Those that are better developed easily subdue and incorporate those lesser developed peoples.</p>
