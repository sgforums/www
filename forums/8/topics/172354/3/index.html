According to boliao, he said that it's good to hav 150RMS.<br>however, Denon D-F101 has only:<br>"The 2-way reflex loudspeakers provide 35W (RMS) power output per channel."<br><br>and the CMT-WS2D has 2X75W (RMS).<br><br>so, does it mean that Sony one is better than Denon. ( I think the D-F101 is aroud SGD1,500 compared to Sony SGD699)<br><br></div></blockquote>First, power rating for speakers and amp are diff things.<br>And IT IS NOT a basis for quality.<br><br>Speaker's power rating is the max it can recieve from the amp.<br>Amp's power rating is the max it can deliver to the speaker.<br><br>Generally speaking, its the bass/low-frequency that requires more power.<br>Speakers with lower power usually has bass limitation in High Volume.<br>Simliarly for amp.<br><br>Also a high power amp can drive speakers more easily.<br>Eg say you have a car whose top speed is 500KM/h<br>u can easily drive at 50KM/h.<br>but a car w top speed at only 60KM/h is going to have difficulties.<br>Just a simple analogy.<br><br>Generally, for amp, about 50W is good enough for room.<br>However again, higher power DOES NOT mean higher quality.<br>Eg a bus/truck has more power than a mercs, but a mercs is smoother.<br><br>Denon F101 amp is 70W (35W is the specs for its speakers)<br>Sony CMT has 75W. about the same.<br>With denon's 35W speakers, perhaps, the bass will be lacking in loud volume.<br><br>Quality wise, Denon Amp is well-known.<br>Sony S-masters amp is new. not sure about the quality.<br>But it sure is attractive for its low-price and digital design.<br><br>You may also keep in mind that denon new model release<br>is less frequent than sony, and you should be still<br>able to repair ur denon in 10 years time.<br>but 1500.. hmm quite ex huh. still within budget ?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Have you considered separates?<br>say a CD player + amp at ard &lt;1000??<br>then get a speaker for ard &lt;1000??<br>But then again, u have to make sure u can repair<br>them in 5-8yrs time.<br>however, i have no recommendation for separates man.<br>gotta consult those audiophiles.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Think only those doing CDdrive related engineering will know.<br>There may just be one type as specified by the global CD standard.<br><br>Im also quite surprised that he said some expensive player do not have error<br>correction yet lousy players have.<br>I believe the thinking behind is<br>-for the good player: trust the drive mechanism and the quality of the laser component.<br>-for the lousy player: the error correction logic will correct any wrong laser<br>pickup.<br><br>Although there are different grade of laser component,<br>I would rather have a lousy player with error correction,<br>than an expensive one without.<br><br>honestly, we can go into more details, but<br>i personally think its not worth it to buy any CD-player<br>without error-correction these days,<br>esp when u know the cheap PC CDROM drive already have such feature,<br>and that the end output is the same digital ones and zeros.<br><br>however, i wonder if these CD-players really produce such tech specs.<br>without which how do these salesmen know??<br>so u have to wonder if what he said is indeed true too... hmm<br><br>also, any HDCD, SACD or DVD-Audio player outperform a CDplayer anytime easily. so, again really not worth it to pay too much for a CD-player.<br><br>Betw, I just came across Arcam Solo. I thought the design is blooody coool<br>but think its overpriced too.<br></div>

No pt paying too much for a player.<br>Digital technology always become better and cheaper over the years.<br>(a correction over prev post, yes, there are different error-correction<br>mechanism, particularly over the drive/laser control too, i forgot abt this)<br><br>Yes, it does make a difference esp when u consider no error-correction<br>and pt 3) in my prev post. But for the amt of improvement, it is overpriced.<br>And having no error-correction, is like going back to the beginning days<br>of CD-players 15+ years ago.<br>In the end, it all boils down to pt 3) when components for pt 1) and 2) are almost perfected over the decades to some mere few dollar chips.<br><br>Generally, i advice u budget more for speakers, then amp, and lastly CD-player.<br><br>I still want to say, CD-player is getting obsolete soon.<br>We will all be playing songs from ripped mp3s/lossless format<br>or online purchased songs. while SACD remain for 'professional' audiophiles.<br><br>Perhaps, i should give u some good reasons, i shall pm you<br>some unique information.<br><br></div>
