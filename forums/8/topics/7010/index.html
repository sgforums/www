But she took time to counsel me and share with me her bad experiences (though she is very busy) I took quite some time to pull through that period, but I really appreciate her concern for me. She really set a very good example and if I ever have the chance, I would want to pass this good spirit on.<br><br>SeCrEts:<br><br>It is usually the case when you just joined. Everything and anything just get dumped to you. But you will certainly get the sense of satisfaction after clearing the stuff! Well, at least, this is true for me.

It has never occurred to me that the working people can really be that bad, even though I was constantly told it is so before I enter the working society. Or is it I choose not to believe? I dunno.<br><br>Anyway, I have tried to get through this barrier. Everywhere, there will be people like them.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. It's true that a smile can brighten up one's day!<br><br>But sometimes, I don't feel like smiling to them because<br><br>1) I don't know them well enough. I have seen them hanging around but we were not formally introduced. Probably I should try to break away from this bad habit and take the initiative. There is a person in my dept who always smile and make gestures at whoever he finds familiar. Even the person (I know it becos initially I am like that) didn't respond to his smiles and gestures, He will still do the same again. Now, I smiled at him whenever I see him. It's amazing how he wins over people this way.<br><br>2) I tried to smile before, but they didn't and looked away. I am discouraged by that. A lot of thoughts come to my mind. Was it that she doesn't like me? Even before she got to know me?? Or Does she feel the same way like I do about not knowing me well enough? We were formally introduced but Is it because we do not liase much, there isn't a need to do so?<br><br>3) I don't like them. I really can't bring myself to fake a smile.<br><br>4) I don't want them to force themselves to reciprocate my smile. Some of them really look awful when they fake their smile.

School is a nice place isn't it ? hahaha. Well, in school there is no conflict of interest hence it is easy for you to make close frens, frens who can open up to you without much defence. But in the working world, there are a lot of conflict of interests and people are harder to understand, not to mention "opening themselves up".<br><br>I once asked my Lecturer why she does not choose to work in the private sector since with her qualification, she can definitely earn much more than what she is earning now. She said this :<br><br>"Well, do you call those people in the working world frens ? They are always trying to move upwards by stepping on you."<br><br>It is hard to find close frens in the working world, though not impossible. You'll probably have to bear with numerous monsters just to enjoy an angel. But sometimes, that angel isn't there too.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Everywhere, there will be people like them. Just as I find them bad, maybe from their point of view, they may find faults with me too. I can't get everyone to like me. Neither do I have to force myself to like them.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>there are <strong>all kinds</strong> of people everywhere. You can't just make everyone happy. Some people hate durians some love it like crazy. Well, just be truthful. Truthfulness is the most important. It saves you from all troubles.<br><br>I remember watching the show Dong(1) Fang(1) Bu(4) Bai(4) when I was in Sec 3/4. In that show, someone said this which i hold deep in my heart :<br><br>you(3) ren(2) jiu(4) you(3) jiang(1) hu(2),<br>you(3) jiang(1) hu(2) jiu(4) you(3) en(1) yuan(4)<br><br>But never try to hate those people who treat you badly cos they are not evil, just foolish, one fine day they will realise their mistakes, give them time. And NO, i am not a Christian.<br><br>I am a person who is very sick of office politics and complicated human relationships in the working place. I admit that i am not  excellent in handling human r/s. I am talking about those superficial human relationships, you know ? I dun have a high EQ. I dun have that kind of skill that salesman have, know what i mean ?<br><br>When you dun feel like having lunch with your colleague, people may say you "dao", when you are not in the mood of chatting and joking, people say you are snobbish. People in the working world are not very tolerant. They do not give you space to make mistakes and be yourself.<br><br>Hence i choose to work in an environment where i will have minimal contact with my colleagues. Less contact, less misunderstandings, everybody's happy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>"Life is about making choices.

            <div class='col-md body'>working world isnt as bad as whut many ppl think it is. yah it can suck a lot. but dats basically the point. if a job becomes too enjoyable and too easy going. if there is no office politics and assholes/bitches in the office. think about it. how interesting would it be for u to go to work then?<br><br>its one of those times when u go for lunch or go for a smoke break when we start bitchin about bad bosses, lousy supervisors and assholes in general. so u see it can be all that bad right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>------------------<br><strong><br>::</strong> eat your cereal with a fork, do your homework in the dark<br><a href="http://occy.skynode.com" rel="nofollow">occyzine</a></div>

I guess maybe some ppl are just too myopic to see what they are doing, or maybe they just adhere to norms (since it's a well known "fact" that you can't find a true friend at work, politics is inevitable etc).<br><br>For every action, there will be a reaction.
