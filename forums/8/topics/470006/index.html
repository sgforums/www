            <div class='col-md body'>Those low wage foreign workers who are stuck in Singapore are mainly because their employers have infringed the MOM laws. The company failed to pay them their salaries, the company failed to make payment of the monthly levy to MOM and etcs. MOM will then call for the $5000 security bond assured by the company's insurance company where the $5000 security bond has been secured and assured through that insurance company. MOM will then make the company foreign workers as the witnesses and hold back their passport until the case is settled. This caused the dilemma of the foreing workers. While awaiting for the MOM proceeding against the company, these foreign workers are given an immigration document whereby every 2 weeks they need to report to the immigration to have it stamped and extended. Sometimes, it will take a long time before the case is settled. In the meantime the affected foreign workers can request from MOM for temporary employment in Singapore. MOM will then recommend jobs to these affected foreign workers to other companies for employment while awaiting for the case to be settled.</div>

              Thats the problem...they can't speak up. Now you know where the fault lies. Even after reporting such cases to the Dept Supervisors and the Head of Department, it will take a long time to get the culprits. So the best way is to get the outsiders to expose the real thing to the public at large then only the relevant authority will take action on the matter...surprisingly immediately.

              Human trafficking - Singapore
              
              Singapore
              
              The Situation
              Singapore is a destination country for human trafficking. 
              
              Destination
              Singapore is a destination country for women and girls who are trafficked from Thailand, the Philippines, the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China, and Indonesia for commercial sexual and labor exploitation. Some women voluntarily migrate to Singapore to work as prostitutes but are later coerced into sexual servitude.

              I saw many young girls from China, Philippines and Thailand were working as 'Performance Artiste' in bars and nightclubs in Singapore. Most of them were desperate to secure a job in Singapore on social visit passes. When they failed to secure a decent job, most of them will apply for the performance artiste job as a last resort. Their work permit is valid for 6 months afterwhich they will return to their country and then 5 months later they will return to Singapore to do that same job. Once they hold that performance artiste work permit...it will be difficult for them to switch to other job. I suspected most of the bars and nightclubs in Singapore are implicitly owned by Secret Society groups or syndicates. They can use middleman to open those bars and nightclubs in Singapore. And this middleman can use his or her name to open more than one bar and nightclub in Singapore.
                      
              Many times I spoke to these young girls in front of me at my counter whether they knew what they were doing just because they want to stay in Singapore and work. Some of them were reluctant and afraid to speak because the agent or employer was sitting and watching them from the waiting lobby. I advised them before I registered and processed their work permit to think carefully and if they don't want this job, they should just reject this job and go back to their own country. Most of them just kept quiet but from what I observed from some of these girls' face expression...they were beginning to regret applying for that performance artiste job. Some of them just went through that work permit process out of fear or willingly but with regret.

            <div class='col-md body'>As for the young Bangladeshi construction workers (some of them look so young)...I suspected their passports were genuine and officially issued by their embassy back in their own country but the information within their passports were false. When I asked them, "When is your birthdate?" (in English or translated by their own fellow Bangladeshi foreman/supervisor that accompany them) most of them don't even know their birthdate and could not answer the question. I brought this up many times to the department in the past but they were not interested because MOM is not ICA...that is ICA problem and is not under MOM jurisdiction. The department were only interested in registering and processing the foreign workers' work permit.</div>
