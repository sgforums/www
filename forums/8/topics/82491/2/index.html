Few really make it big, they earn alot for a few mths but little for the rest of his 'career'. I know 1 guy in toys industries, successful, went to Japan and Taiwan to look for supplier, luckily he met 1 guy who is retiring but passed to him his links all dat so he no need scout ard. You need to meet the right person one...else quite difficult.</div>
