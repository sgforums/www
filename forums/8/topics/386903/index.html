              <p>short intro...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well i'm 22 this year...i just ORD from NS in Sep. After i ord, got a job in an 
              event management co. since my friend recommended me. But lotsa manual labor to 
              do n it was quite stressful, n i didn't really liked it, so i quit after bout a 
              month. <br><br>Then i slacked around till now. Still unsure if i should further 
              my studies locally or get a full time job. My parents will only sponsor bout 
              half or less for my school fees. <br><br>Anyway i always like to wear feminine 
              clothings secretly in the confines of my bedroom since my poly school days...n 
              imagined i'm a woman. But i didn't crossdressed too often coz there was always 
              many projects, assignments, exams to study, n therefore schoolwork probably 
              distracted me, haha. Which is a good thing actually <br><br>Anyway, since i ORD 
              in sep n left the company since nov...i have been pretty much doing nothing 
              at home. Decided to take a break ever since. Still in the midst of deciding 
              whether to further my studies or work. <br><br>With so much free time in my 
              hands, i naturally crossdressed, since its a diehard hobby of mine. LOL. My 
              parents n elder sister r always at work, n so i delved deeper into my feminine 
              self. <br><br>And now it seems i have dived deeper into the pit of femininity n 
              it seems to be no turning back. My god...feeling quite confused now. <br><br>And 
              another thing was, 2 months ago, i lied to my sister that my church needed 
              donations of old clothings for the poor in other countries. Lol n behold she 
              empties her wardrobe n purged more than half of the clothes she doesn't want to 
              wear. <br><br>I lied that i'm gonna haul them all to the church, but then 
              actually i gone thru the clothes n kept about half of it. I kept those nice 
              ones. Some r like brand new...i don't understand why woman have to buy so much 
              clothes which they hardly wear. <br><br>So i'm actually crossdressing in my 
              elder sister's old clothes..yeah they fit pretty well, thank god i have a lean 
              figure n my sister is about a female size M. Lots of singlet n spaghetti tank 
              tops, minishorts n skirts. clubbing dresses, some formal office wear.</p>
              <p>Yeah but i had to buy my own female shoes since my sister's size 7 shoes doesn't 
              fit my humongous size 9s. <br><br>And for the rest of the unwanted clothings, i 
              conveniently dumped them at the salvation army. yeah i belong to a church but 
              after i enterred ns, i stop going n have not contacted my church mates ever 
              since. <br><br>n when i crossdressed in my sister's old clothes, i feel kinda 
              guilty. She thinks she had donated her unwanted clothings for a good cause, but 
              actually i m wearing them. <br><br>some nights i have nightmares about my sister 
              n parents finding out the dirty habit of mine. N one episode of the nightmares 
              has her screaming over me for putting on her clothes n asking why have i gone to 
              such a state. <br><br>This is scary shit.</p>

              <p>Sounds more like AA topic and why do so many guys like to cross dress... This is like the 3rd guy over the past year?</p>
              <p>It would be best you can stop cross dressing by your own free will if not consider going for counselling to get some help. It would be better than letting your family or future girl friend find out and create more trouble for you.</p>

              <p>nothing wrong if you cross dress openly. something fishy ifyou cross dress secretly. open up be yourself. cross dress and go let the world know by standing by the road. let your paretns and sisters know.</p>

              <p>I am not a professional advisor, but logically thinking, you need to reassure yourself that you are a male</p>
              <p>Keep thinking that you need to find yourself a girlfriend and take care of her. <br><br>Try to occupy yourself with other thoughts when u want to crossdress or when u start to think like a female</p>
              <p>What your brain thinks will help and harm you. Now that you are aware of your problem, make it like an alarm in your subconcious mind that everytime you think of being a female, force yourself to stop thinking, and replace it with things man tend to do usually like fixing a computer, playing first person shooter game</p>
              <p> Having a nightmare about this may mean that your brain is aware of this, and know it isnt right, and want a change.</p>
              <p>When u sleep at night, think about being a man rather than a girl</p>
