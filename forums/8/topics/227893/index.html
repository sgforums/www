I have peeled the batter off this one.<br><br>Its taste and texture is disarmingly similar to Spam.<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/06/programmes_food_for_thought/img/3.jpg"><br>I stumbled across these extraordinary carp float bladders in a market outside Beijing.<br><br>They are not a delicacy themselves, but are attached to the roe and the bladders fill with gas as soon as they are pulled from the fish.<br><br>The Chinese eat a lot of carp and they are often still alive when sold in supermarkets.<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/06/programmes_food_for_thought/img/4.jpg"><br>Yup...scorpions. They were skewered alive in front of me in China, then dropped in boiling oil, where they cook almost instantly.<br><br>Very crunchy on the outside, yet smooth in the middle and they smell of the rather elderly oil they were cooked in.<br><br>This oil also masks any scorpion flavour (if, indeed they have any flavour).<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/06/programmes_food_for_thought/img/5.jpg"><br>Sea slugs always used to be my culinary nemesis, but when I found them in a market in Seoul I thought I would tackle my phobia.<br><br>I took them to a bring-your-own restaurant upstairs. They chopped up the slug, still alive, into pieces that you dip into red pepper sauce... still wriggling a bit.<br><br>They taste of fresh oysters Â– clean and salty. The texture is very interesting: crunchy and chewy, like eating raw cartilage I should imagine.<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/06/programmes_food_for_thought/img/6.jpg"><br>Heaven knows, I have eaten a lot of unusual things, but I found these little fellas terrifying.<br><br>They are silkworm larvae, and along with the sea slug, they used to be the food I was always most terrified of; so I felt duty-bound to try them.<br><br>Scorpion, eyeballs and yak's penis are a mere bagatelle in comparison. The texture is crunchy, oily and yet soft on the inside. Somehow they tasted of shrimp.<br><br>If I never eat them again, it will not be any great hardship.<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/06/programmes_food_for_thought/img/7.jpg"><br>Dried frogs are extraordinary. Even Yoon Jung, our South Korean fixer, hated the idea of them.<br><br>They are steeped in hot water to make a sort of stew or infusion and fed to sick children.<br><br>There seemed to be some debate about whether they were used as a cure, or a threat.<br><br><img src="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/06/programmes_food_for_thought/img/8.jpg"><br>Eating testicles is always a transcendental, yet unsettling experience.<br><br>They are fiddly to prepare, removing them from the membrane and then chopping them into small chunks.<br><br>They taste a little musky, and... well... frankly... testicular.<br><br></div>
