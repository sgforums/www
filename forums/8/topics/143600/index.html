So that's why I have this theory.<br><br>Ok, first let me ask you. There are 4 contestants, A,B,C and D.<br>Lets say A  and B are better than C and D. In the fans and votes aspects. But as the organizer, who would you choose to eliminate and go to the "Fight Back" Round?<br><br>I would choose A and B, the reason being they have more fans, meaning more smses( income ) will be generated during the "Fight Back" round.<br><br>The main thing is I want to have as many smses as possible, even in the "Fight Back" Round.<br>So IF my theory is correct, isn't it ironic that those who have more votes will get eliminated?<br><br>But we will never know since the result of the votes are not revealed to us, even if they do, we will not know whether the result is genuine.<br><br>Just a theory though. Hope I'm wrong.</div>

So that's why I have this theory.<br><br>Ok, first let me ask you. There are 4 contestants, A,B,C and D.<br>Lets say A  and B are better than C and D. In the fans and votes aspects. But as the organizer, who would you choose to eliminate and go to the "Fight Back" Round?<br><br>I would choose A and B, the reason being they have more fans, meaning more smses( income ) will be generated during the "Fight Back" round.<br><br>The main thing is I want to have as many smses as possible, even in the "Fight Back" Round.<br>So IF my theory is correct, isn't it ironic that those who have more votes will get eliminated?<br><br>But we will never know since the result of the votes are not revealed to us, even if they do, we will not know whether the result is genuine.<br><br>Just a theory though.
