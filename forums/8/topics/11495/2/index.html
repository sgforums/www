            <div class='col-md body'>got this from the <a href="http://www.singalore.com" rel="nofollow">www.singalore.com</a>  website<br>The famous yellow house in east coast:<br><br>In East Coast lies this dilapidated house which is believed to be haunted. There are several stories about this house. When I approached 2 passersby, both told me that this house is about 20 years old and it has been vacant for the last 7 years.<br>Questions begin to pop up in my mind, the land that the house sits on can easily fetch a few hundred thousands or even a million. Where is the owner? Who owns this house? Why is it vacant? What is the story behind it?<br>In this part of our East Coast Coverage, we will present a few stories that were emailed to us.<br><br>Story 1:This story is one of a successful man who from young without any education became successful with his own hard work. However it seems that he was not blessed with the fortune of having a family. Although rich and successful, he was lonely-without any wife and children. The house above was a grand one sitting on freehold land (that is why the government could not claim it). However it was purely a grand house and never a home. He had no one to share his success with. And on one night, for some unknown reasons he took his own life by hanging himself and from then onwards, without any wills written before his death, he left this world and the house alone to stand.<br><br>------------------<br>Â£Ã´vÃŠ Â“Â§ |Ã®kÃ‹ Âª ÃŸÂ¤++|Ã« Ã¸f wÃ®Ã±Ã‹ +HÃ© |Â¤nGeÂ® Ãœ kÃ«Ã‹p, +HÃ© BÃ«++|e Ã¯+ BÃ«cÃ¶mÃ«S</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>continue...<br>Because the man did not leave any wills behind, all his properties and this house were left untouched. Without any maintenance, the house lost its glamour and looks no more than a dilapidated  haunted house.<br>So is the house haunted?<br>I must admit this house looks very eerie at night. The first time I took photographs of it, it was done at night around 9 pm. And I can tell you I didn't feel good snapping pictures of the house at night. It was a funny feeling, I wonder if there were any ghosts lurking or resting inside which might be offended by the flashlight of my camera or if the films might capture more than what my naked eyes can see or even worse, "something" might be simple offended and actually follow me home! However I never managed to developed the film as the lady at the photo-developing shop told me that the flashlight wasn't strong enough. Thus my nighttime photo taking efforts went down the drain and this accounts for the late delivery of this part 2 series.<br>I have accounts of stories of adventurous "ghosts-hunters" or "Adventurers" (whatever you guys call yourselves) emailing me about your tales.<br><br>One of them goes:<br>A group of 6 friends including me decided to venture into this yellow house at 2 am to complete our Singapore 5 Coloured House  Grand Slam. At 1.45am, my gang arrived at the bus stop near it in our bicycles. True enough, this house gives us the creeps.<br>At 2am, the leader-Tim gathered all of us at the entrance to the house at the side. Armed with small torches ( mind you this is a private property I think and we didn't want to make our presence known). Soon we fell in single file with Tim at the front with a stick-to hit the tall grasses to scare the any snakes away. With just a 15m walk, we reached the door or should I say just an opening as the door was gone. Now we made sure that we went in in pairs ( why? Well it is believed that in trips like this we always go back in pairs so minimize bad luck so we won't have "them" coming back with us.<br>The house is BIG. We spent about an hour inside looking around and checked every room. Not much furniture there, so probably the guys who came long before us took everything away.<br>Since we didn't have any "encounters" we left the house.<br>Weird and scary enough, we never thought that "happenings" would happen only after we left the house! Our bicycles which were left just outside the entrance of the house were all toppled! It could not be the wind and and there were not a single soul in sight. The area around the yellow house was dead silent. And the worse part, there were scratches on the seats of ALL our bicycles! The scratches look as if someone had used his nails to scratch our nails. Believe me, we went back to Tim house together and stay over there as no one dared to go home alone by himself that night.<br><br>------------------<br>Â£Ã´vÃŠ Â“Â§ |Ã®kÃ‹ Âª ÃŸÂ¤++|Ã« Ã¸f wÃ®Ã±Ã‹ +HÃ© |Â¤nGeÂ® Ãœ kÃ«Ã‹p, +HÃ© BÃ«++|e Ã¯+ BÃ«cÃ¶mÃ«S</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>continue.........<br>I went to the side of the house and realized that the house was much bigger than I thought. There was a little hut built just outside the gate of the house. Seems like someone must be still staying there as cloths were hung outside. I shouted: "Anyone around?" and someone replied:"No". So disappointed I went on taking pictures of the house. But one thing I cannot make out: why are some of the windows opened and why is there no door at the main entrance? Didn't the government sealed the place out? Or are there some illegal immigrants living there?<br>I also found out that the house was not fenced totally at all. Near the entrance of the house, there is an opening with a little path to the house. The grasses were more than half a metre tall and that height totally killed my idea of venturing inside.<br>Playing with the thought that some illegal immigrants could be living inside, a story sent by Chee Kiat came to my mind.<br><br>The story:<br>We all know that no matter how efficient the Coastal Patrol or the Check Point in Woodlands are, there will always be illegal immigrants in Singapore? So where do they live? We are so small that we do not have any jungles for them to hide, however my cousin (whose name I do not wish to reveal) who works in the Police Force has a tale to relate.<br>Nick (not my cousin's real name) has been in the Police Force for more than 10 years. He has handled lotsa cases and there is this particular one that he could never forget.<br>It was just a normal routine night at the office (he was working night shift that day) when there was an urgent case. The case? A Thai worker wanted Police assistance in East Coast. Exact location? The yellow house.<br>My cousin was cursing as it was 6 in the wee hours of the morning and just one hour to knocking off he got an urgent case. Before his police car reached the scene, his colleagues and him could see a guy waving frantically at the road for them to stop.<br><br>------------------<br>Â£Ã´vÃŠ Â“Â§ |Ã®kÃ‹ Âª ÃŸÂ¤++|Ã« Ã¸f wÃ®Ã±Ã‹ +HÃ© |Â¤nGeÂ® Ãœ kÃ«Ã‹p, +HÃ© BÃ«++|e Ã¯+ BÃ«cÃ¶mÃ«S</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Getting off the car, the guy appeared to be the Thai guy who called the Police. Speaking only little English he panted and cried " Ghosts, ghosts!". My cousin tried to calm him down and look at the house where the Thai guy kept pointing at. He saw a dull eerie green light glowing near one of the windows.<br><br>It was the first time my cousin ever experience such things and being officers, his colleague and him had to go into the house and investigate. The Thai guy refused to follow him in and stayed beside the Police car.<br><br>Weird enough before my cousin and his colleague felt the creeps before he went into the house but after stepping inside, he didn't feel anything uncomfortable. It was only back at the Police station that he was told that the Police uniform that he was wearing commands authority that even the ghosts fear.<br><br>As for the Thai guy, after speaking through an interpreter that my cousin found out that he was an illegal immigrant who had stayed in the yellow house for 3 days before leaving as he saw furniture inside flying around and green lights glowing around him. He was left with no choice but fled the house and called the Police.<br><br>------------------<br>Â£Ã´vÃŠ Â“Â§ |Ã®kÃ‹ Âª ÃŸÂ¤++|Ã« Ã¸f wÃ®Ã±Ã‹ +HÃ© |Â¤nGeÂ® Ãœ kÃ«Ã‹p, +HÃ© BÃ«++|e Ã¯+ BÃ«cÃ¶mÃ«S</div>
