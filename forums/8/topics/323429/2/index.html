              <p>Without money, yes, love can still exist, but it is very dangerous as the love may break off due to money problems, if a guy keep asking me for money or married me and unable to pay this bills, pay to support childrens, then that will be a big problem.</p>

              <p><br>ya, with money, the guys can give the gal a good life, roses in bed, tour and lots of romantic dinners and moments, under such environment, love blosom in the eyes of the beholden.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Without money, yes, love can still exist, but it is very dangerous as the love may break off due to money problems, if a guy keep asking me for money or married me and unable to pay this bills, pay to support childrens, then that will be a big problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Joke it might be, but you hv to accept some truth, human relationship need time to nurture, with money, the nuturing will be a much more pleasant one than with no money.</p>

              <p>I have female friends who divorced because of money.    One of them - husband cannot make it so she was kind and supportive to give him money to start business.   So far all his 3 businesses failed and he was not responsible to the family - came back late, living like a bachelor, did not care about the kids and wife.   He rather spent time with friends and doing entertainment.   Came back late and demanded sex.   He dare asked money from the wife - the poor wife has no more money to give him.   Day in day out, he behaved the same, no change.  Finally, my friend could not take it, divorced him.     She has the custody of the kids for this man has no means to support the kids.     Pathetic.</p>
              <p>Another couple I know of who became unhappy after their marriage was due to lack of money.    After marriage, they kept borrowing money from people.   They quarrelled most of the time because of money.    Sad.    </p>

              <p>Buying a flat or a property in singapore is one of the best way of making money. You can rent house as you wants, but if you are eligible to purchase a house and within capabilities, please do so, cos property will go up, by then you sell it, you gain.</p>
