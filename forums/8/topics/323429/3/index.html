              <p><br>Angel, not that simple.    In reality the family of the wife or husband can wreck havoc in the marriage.  Possible the family can affect the way the husband or wife treat the spouse.   Didn't you read Sunday times yesterday?  A married woman wrote in to tell that her husband is too filial to the mum and treating her like a mother and not a wife, expect her to look after him like a mother.   Both the husband and mother are so close that they are depending too much on each other and wife feels neglected.</p>

              <p>And do u think there are simple gals in singapore that want to
              live a simple life with you..even foreigner gals want something out
              of you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buying a flat or a property in singapore is one of the best way
              of making money. You can rent house as you wants, but if you are
              eligible to purchase a house and within capabilities, please do so,
              cos property will go up, by then you sell it, you gain.</p>

              <p>LOL people always think property prices will definitely go up. What comes up must go down. Singapore's property prices have reached their peak in 2007 and have dropped significantly. Supply will continue to increase due to more developers and en-block sales.</p>
              <p>When you sell your only shelter above your head. Take up another loan and the whole cycle begins. The real winners are banks. Specualtion; lots of people have lost money that they havent realise, by buying at the peak of the bubble. Hoping to sell higher than they paid for. No one can predict what the market prices will be like tmr.</p>
              <p>What im trying to say is that not all Singaporeans are suited to own their own properties. Your remarks never fail to disappoint me. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>I guess you will be a lot happier marrying for money. But if you are already rich, it just doesn't make sense to me.</p>
