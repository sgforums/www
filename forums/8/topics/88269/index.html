            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-08-03/dxchan-214057.jpg"><br><br>HE was branded an 'absolute hooligan' by the judge who called his behaviour 'asinine'.<br><br>In the hearts of many Singaporeans glued to the now notorious Everitt Road saga, Chan Cheng Khoon is probably one of Singapore's most dreaded neighbours.<br><br>The 69-year-old was given the maximum fine of $4,000 on Thursday after he was convicted of insulting two female neighbours.<br><br>Despite his conviction, he told reporters outside the court that he considered the fine 'sup sup sui' (Cantonese for a small amount), that it was only a fraction of what he paid his lawyer.<br><br>Indeed, a day after being fined, Chan appeared to be in high spirits when he was interviewed at his home.<br><br>He even joked: 'I lost the case. Why do you want to speak to a loser?'<br><br>For 10 long years, the Chans and their neighbours have been embroiled in a bitter feud which involved spotlights, video cameras, harsh words and lawyers' letters.<br><br>Together with Madam Chua Gek Eng, his wife of 44 years, Chan shared how his life has been since he was cast into the limelight of Singapore's longest-running un-neighbourly dispute.<br><br>Nothing much has changed, he claimed.<br><br>He still sleeps soundly at night (with the floodlights shining on his driveway), dines out with his wife and daughter Soo Yin (a teacher), goes shopping and meets his friends.<br><br>He said: 'Life goes on. Battles are won and battles are lost.<br><br>'I may have lost this battle, but the war goes on,' he said.<br><br>He even goes dancing with his wife.<br><br>Waltz, cha-cha, rhumba, you name it, he says he can do it.<br><br>He loves dancing so much that he would gladly oblige with a little wriggle, a sway of the hips, and even a twirl if you ask him to show you a few moves - pretty much like his famous little jig aired on national TV.<br><br>On being labelled a hooligan, he said: 'I categorically state that I'm not a hooligan and have never behaved like one.'<br><br>ONLY FAMILY, FRIENDS MATTER<br><br>He didn't care what other people said.<br><br>'My wife, my daughter and my friends are all that matters. They've been very supportive and that's what counts,' he said.<br><br>His wife declined to be interviewed.<br><br>After a little probing, Chan admitted being the target of many a wagging finger and tongue. But he insisted it didn't rattle him one bit.<br><br>'If I was made to feel uncomfortable by those gestures, I wouldn't even step out of the house,' he said.<br><br>b&gt; 'I'm determined to remain cheerful.'<br><br>In fact, he went so far as to say that he's become a 'celebrity' of sorts.<br><br>He said, with a hearty laugh: 'I think I'm even more recognisable than some of the ministers.<br><br>'I've heard that when my picture is put on the front page of newspapers, it will sell very well!'<br><br>So, what next?<br><br>Chan said he won't be selling his house to start afresh somewhere else, as that would be a sign of 'cowardice'.<br><br>'But I can't say that I wouldn't sell if someone was to give me an offer which is too good to turn down,' he said.<br><br>For now, his motto is to just take one step at a time - while the spotlights continue to shine and the video cameras continue to whirr.<br><br>'I won't allow myself to be bullied,' he said. 'I'm not the sort to turn the other cheek after being slapped on one cheek.<br><br>'I'll slap the person back.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Modesty offence tough to prove<br><br>CHAN was given the maximum fine of $4,000 for insulting his two woman neighbours because he was prosecuted under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act.<br><br>However, under the Penal Code, there is a tougher penalty - up to one year's jail for anyone found guilty of ''insulting a woman's modesty'. But such an offence is harder to prove.<br><br>Lawyer Amolat Singh explained: 'Under the Miscellaneous Offences Act, all the prosecutor is required to prove is that the obscene gestures were done or that obscene words were uttered.<br><br>'So the moment you do that in public, the offence has already been committed.'<br><br>But the process is more complex for offences under section 509 of the Penal Code.<br><br>Then, you have to show that the person intends to insult a woman's modesty by making obscene signs or saying certain things.<br><br>For instance, it will be difficult to prove that there is intention to insult a woman's modesty by calling her a 'butch'.<br><br>Chan was caught on camera telling one of the women: 'Butch, put the camera between your legs.'<br><br>But lawyer Lim Kia Tong said: 'I don't think calling a woman a butch and asking her to put a camera between her legs is tantamount to insulting the modesty of a woman.<br><br>'One will have to show that there's an intention to outrage the woman's modesty by those words.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></div>
