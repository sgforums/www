He was continually diving into his bag, rummaging round and looking in it."<br><br>Seconds after Mr Jones stepped off the bus, it exploded with the "bomber" still on board.<br><br>Terence Mutasa, 27, a staff nurse at University College hospital, told The Sun: "I treated two girls in their 20s who were involved in the bus bomb.<br><br>"They were saying some guy came and sat down and that he exploded."<br><br>He added: "They said the guy just sat down and the explosion happened. They thought it was a suicide bomber."<br><br>Joely Ward, 36, was walking alongside the bus when it exploded. She told the Daily Mirror: "There was a huge bang and a pile of glass flew over my head. As I looked down there was a mound of flesh at my feet.<br><br>"I did not even register what it was, and then I saw a hand sticking out of it. It was a torso at my feet. It was blown apart."<br><br>A student who was near the explosion and helped medics at the scene said she saw "seven people obviously dead".<br><br>"There were so many bodies," another witness said.<br><br>Stephanie Riak Akuei told The Sun: "There was a lot of body parts and human debris.

Karma as a way of coming round.<br></div></blockquote><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes</a><br><br>Many war crimes occurred during the period of Japanese imperialism from the late 19th to mid-20th centuries.<br><br>In China during 1937Â–45, there are said to have been 8.4 million "non-military casualties", not including civilians killed accidentally during battle. (See Chinese Casualties in the Sino-Japanese War.) The most infamous incident during this period was the Nanjing Massacre, when the Japanese army massacred more than 100,000 civilians Â— some accounts say 300,000.<br><br>Military personnel from the Empire of Japan were accused Â— and in many cases were later convicted Â— of conducting a series of human rights abuses against civilians and prisoners of war (POWs) throughout east Asia and the western Pacific. These events reached their height during the Sino-Japanese War of 1937Â–45 and the Pacific War of 1941-45.<br><br>Historians and the governments of many countries officially hold the Japanese military, namely the Imperial Japanese Army (especially the military police, or Kempeitai) and the Imperial Japanese Navy, responsible for the deaths of many millions of civilians and prisoners of war (POWs) during the early 20th century.<br><br>These events are often compared to similar suffering imposed by Nazi Germany during 1933Â–45. The historian Chalmers Johnson has written that:<br><br>It may be pointless to try to establish which World War Two Axis aggressor, Germany or Japan, was the more brutal to the peoples it victimised. The Germans killed six million Jews and 20 million Russians; the Japanese slaughtered as many as 30 million Filipinos, Malays, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Indonesians and Burmese, at least 23 million of them ethnic Chinese. Both nations looted the countries they conquered on a monumental scale, though Japan plundered more, over a longer period, than the Nazis. Both conquerors enslaved millions and exploited them as forced labourers Â— and, in the case of the Japanese, as prostitutes for front-line troops. If you were a Nazi prisoner of war from Britain, America, Australia, New Zealand or Canada (but not Russia) you faced a 4 per cent chance of not surviving the war; [by comparison] the death rate for Allied POWs held by the Japanese was nearly 30 per cent.[1]<br><br>The Japanese military's use of forced labour, by Asian civilians and POWs also caused many deaths Â— more than 100,000 in the case of the Burma Railway.<br><br>Deaths caused by the diversion of resources to the Japanese military in occupied countries are also regarded as war crimes by many people. Millions of civilians in South East Asia, a major rice-growing region, died during a preventable famine in 1944Â–45.<br><br>Some sources claim the Japanese military was responsible for the deaths of more than 20 million non-combatants during 1937Â–45, although all such figures are controversial.<br><br>In the early 21st century, some activists, both inside and outside Japan, have attempted to reinterpret Japanese imperialism. For example, the views of a South Korean, Ji Man-Won, have caused controversy in Korea and further abroad. Ji has praised Japan for "modernising" Korea, and has said of women forced to become sex slaves: "most of the old women claiming to be former comfort women, or sex slaves to the Japanese military during World War II, are fakes." In Korea, such views are widely regarded as being offensive, libellous of the women concerned, and as representing historical revisionism. [2]<br><br>Another complicating matter is that some people from Asian and Pacific countries invaded by Japan collaborated with the Japanese military, or even served in it, for a wide variety of reasons, such as economic hardship, coercion, or antipathy to other imperialist powers. Many of these people were never investigated or tried and brought to justice after 1945. However, during the 1990s, the South Korean government started investigating some individuals who had allegedly become wealthy while collaborating with the Japanese military. In South Korea it is also alleged that, during the political climate of the Cold War, many such individuals Â— and/or their associates or relatives Â— were able to acquire influence and to assist in the covering-up, or non-investigation, of war crimes in order not to incriminate themselves.<br><br>Non-government bodies and individuals have also undertaken their own investigations. For example, in 2005, a South Korean freelance journalist, Jung Soo-woong, located in Japan some descendants of people involved in the 1895 assassination of Empress Myeongseong (Queen Min), the last Empress of Korea. The assassination was conducted by Japanese government agents, because of the Empress's involvement in attempts to reduce Japanese influence in Korea. Jung recorded the apologies of the individuals.</div>

That is the true measure of what terrorism may achieve. It is for Parliament to decide whether to give the terrorists such a victory." </blockquote></div>
