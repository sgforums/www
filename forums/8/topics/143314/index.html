            <div class='col-md body'>From: <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/62360.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/62360.asp</a>Property's long night is ending<br>New govt measures are the best piece of news for market since its heyday in mid-1990s<br><br>Mano Sabnani<br>Editor-in-Chief/CEO<br>mano@newstoday.com.sg<br><br>I WROTE in this newspaper just last Friday that the worm appeared to be turning in the long-moribund Singapore property market. The various positives, seen in aggregate, seemed to point to the beginnings of a sustained multi-year recovery in real estate values.<br>.<br>The market has had a few false bullish starts in the past decade, during which the bear has prevailed in all our property sectors: Residential, commercial and industrial. So, it was necessary for me to note that I was not in a wishful-thinking mode.<br>.<br>Still, that was the reaction I got the next day, from a few disgruntled property owners and investors. Here I was, they said, another clairvoyant who would have to eat his words.<br>.<br>After all, most of the news relating to real estate in Singapore has been bad since May 1996, when the Government moved to curb excessive speculation in residential property.<br>.<br><strong>Between 1988 and 1996, home prices quadrupled, everyone made money and greed set in. But the subsequent bear market outlasted anyone's prediction and even today, Singapore properties are generally 35 per cent off their 1996 values.</strong><br><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Between 1988 and 1996 my parents income didn't quadrupled. They own only 1 property. So what if that property is worh 1 billion dollars? So what if they sell that one? The next one they intend to buy still cost 1 billion bucks. In short, it is zero gain for those who only own 1 property. But if someone owns more than 1 property, it is pure gain and we know who are the ones who own more than 1 properties - those who think $600K is peanuts. The scenario in 1995/96 is worst for those who just married and are planning to buy a flat. Imagine a 4 room cost $250K?? when your total monthly salary is $3 or $4K! Do we want another such scenario to occur? NO</span>!</span><br><br>.<br><strong>In contrast, Hong Kong and Shanghai have recovered strongly from their 1998 Asian Financial Crisis lows and even Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta are doing better. Singapore should catch up and it is time to be positive about the property market, I argued. </strong><br><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">You wouldn't want to be a fresh grad or $2K salary worker in Hong Kong or Shanghai. If you got young adult friends in Hong Kong, ask them if they are proud and happy that property prices have recovered strongly</span>.</span><br><br>The economy has been steady, employment and incomes are rising, the stock market is buoyant and property values are low while yields are relatively attractive. Best of all, the glut in supply has been easing.<br>.<br>So, even without any special stimulant from the Government, the positives had begun to outweigh the negatives. The worm was turning, but taking its own sweet time. No one was getting excited.<br>.<br>Until yesterday, when Minister for National Development Mah Bow Tan unveiled a slew of measures he said were not designed to stimulate the market. Their purpose is to remove anomalies and ensure equity and fairness of policies relating to property ownership and investment. Yet taken together, the changes represent probably the best package of news since the property sector's heyday in the mid-1990s.<br>.<br>It will be easier for any resident to buy property through the higher borrowing limit and lower cash downpayment requirement. Singles now have more options in home ownership in the public and private sectors. It will also become much easier for Singaporeans to buy or sell older leasehold properties thanks to sensible, relaxed financing rules. Even foreigners have been given positive signals on local property.<br>.<br>The effects of the measures should not be underestimated. More can always be done but the measures, as proposed, are sufficient to underpin an already stable market edging upwards. Together, they take quite a bit of the slack out and nudge the market forward, especially with regard to the glut in older leasehold properties and the cash-strapped situation of many would-be buyers.<br>.<br>The market is turning, but that turn could now be quicker, with fence-sitters making up their minds.<br>.<br>Already, the stock market is excited. On Monday evening, it was stimulated by the news that Raffles Holdings is disposing of its entire hotel business at a stupendous 64 per cent premium to book values. The deal spoke volumes about the worth to foreigners of well-managed hotel properties, especially if some are located in land-scarce Singapore.<br>.<br>Yesterday, even before the Minister unveiled his measures in Parliament, property stocks rallied broadly. Investors sensed the clearing of some property clouds and took positions in the morning. Their optimism was not misplaced. The uptrend in prices continued in the afternoon and the broad market closed at a five-year high.<br>.<br>Could this be another false start? I think not. We are clearly in the early stages of a sustained recovery in the property market. But it is not yet time to speculate in physical property, or to let the topic dominate dinner conversations.<br>New govt measures are the best piece of news for market since its heyday in mid-1990s<br><br>-------<br>Lets look at commercial properties, aka you shopping centres and offices. If the property prices for those rise, do you think your Street 11 and your boss will bear the increase in rental? NO! Such increase will be bore by you, the average working Singaporean! Prices of consumer goods will increase, and your salary will decrease!<br><br>Employers will be complaining that property rental so expensive, can cut the employer CPF contribution from 13% (current) to 10% a not? With such a reduction in CPF, do you think you can afford the now more expensive HDB flat?<br><br>You might think, I can borrow from the bank wah. Do you think the bank so stupid to maintain the current low mortgage rate when more people are buying properties? NO. The lending rate will be higher and who suffer? The single home buyers!<br><br>How do we stop the property prices from going up?<br><br>Answer:<strong> <span style="color: red;">Do not participate in the speculation of properties! In Singapore, a flat is for you to live in. It is always a liability not asset! I would recommend non-business graduates to read Rich Dad Poor Dad. After reading you will understand more of what I said.</span></strong></div>

So it's a balancing act and we are looking at the whole structure and see how we can package this to our customers."<br><br>To mitigate the increased risk that banks will take, the Monetary Authority of Singapore will require banks to hold more capital against housing loans which exceed 80 percent of the property value.<br><br>It also expect the banks to carry out rigorous credit assessment before extending such high loans.<br><br>The central bank is also considering mortgage insurance as an alternative to the capital charge to mitigate the risks of high housing loans.<br><br>It will be studying the viability here and how best to regulate mortgage insurers. - CNA/ms<br></blockquote></div>
