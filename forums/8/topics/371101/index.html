              <p>Hey I liked this article.</p>
              <p>"The
              classic example is the mandatory review quota policy used by such
              luminary corporations as Microsoft, Amazon, and Washington Mutual.</p>
              <p>Basically,
              the system works like this: the employees are graded on a bell curve.
              In any given team, some percentage (we'll say 20%) MUST be given a bad
              review, regardless of performance.</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>So, let's review:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>You're losing your elite employees.</li>
              <li>You're retaining the worst of the bad employees.</li>
              <li>You've structurally eliminated teamwork."</li>
              </ol>

              <h3><a href="http://www.monkeytreats.com/2005/09/19/stupid-vs-evil-part-duh"> Stupid vs. Evil, Part Duh </a></h3>
              <h6>Sep 19</h6>
              <div id="post">
              <p>The
              most troubling thing about the Stupid vs. Evil metric is that, if you
              rate a bunch of companies according to this metric, and then you
              correlate that to public opinion of the company, you will find that the
              public generally considers Stupid to be worse than Evil. In other
              words, if you make shitloads of money, a little bit of bunny-boiling is
              acceptable.</p>
              <p>It seems to me that this
              should be reversed. In particular, when considering a course of action,
              it seems that it should be more important to not be evil than not be
              stupid. Assuming that we live in an ethical society, wouldn't the right
              way around be to evaluate an action's evilness before you even consider
              whether it's stupid or not?</p>
              <p>The
              classic example is the mandatory review quota policy used by such
              luminary corporations as Microsoft, Amazon, and Washington Mutual.</p>
              <p>Basically,
              the system works like this: the employees are graded on a bell curve.
              In any given team, some percentage (we'll say 20%) MUST be given a bad
              review, regardless of performance.</p>
              <p>In
              theory, this should result in the worst-performing employees losing
              compensation, while the highly-performing employees gain compensation.
              Eventually, the theory goes, the less-useful employees will head off
              for less-ambitious pastures, removing the dead weight from the bottom.
              More pressure will then be brought to bear on the higher-performing
              employees, incentivizing them to work even harder, and the organization
              will iteratively move toward a lean and mean ideal.</p>
              <p>The
              problem is that this turns out to be bullshit. First of all, teamwork
              is out the window. Why are you going to help someone else if it means
              they'll get a better review and you'll get screwed? Better to spend
              that time kissing the boss' ass, talking shit about your coworkers, and
              avoiding any kind of difficult project.</p>
              <p>Second,
              the people at the low-end aren't necessarily going to be shuffled off.
              The thing is, you need those people to stay around, because otherwise
              who will you stick with the bad review? Ultimately, that end of the
              totem pole will be filled with people who are plainly incompetent and
              despondent, lacking the strength of will to quit and tell the company
              to stuff it.</p>
              <p>Third, your truly
              high-performing employees are not necessarily going to be mindless
              participants in this system. Some of them will consider this unethical,
              and look for jobs at companies that aren't so draconian. Some of them
              will develop friendships with people who get crushed by the system, and
              will lose morale as a result. Others may feel that they could be more
              successful at a company that truly compensated performance, rather than
              using a quota.</p>
              <p>So, let's review:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>You're losing your elite employees.</li>
              <li>You're retaining the worst of the bad employees.</li>
              <li>You've structurally eliminated teamwork.</li>
              </ol>Your
              corporation is now just a collection of mediocre individuals, all
              working at cross purposes, even if they are under the same roof.
              Self-interest is the rule of the day.
              <p>It probably will take a few years for the damage to
              become clear, and in the meanwhile you'll have some cost savings, so
              the HR hatchetperson who came up with the policy looks like a rock
              star. They get a fat bonus, quit before the long-term debt comes due,
              and leave the squabbling masses to fight over the scraps as the ship
              goes down.</p>
              <p>In other words, this plan
              is Evil, and it is Stupid. Now, it's not Stupid on the face of it. You
              can see why this plan would appeal if you didn't really think through
              the ramifications of it â€” it seems like it ought to get rid of bad
              workers and reward the good ones. But it is plainly, obviously Evil.
              People who don't deserve it are going to be screwed. That's how the
              plan is designed to work.</p>
              <p>Given that,
              shouldn't someone in charge have taken one look and said, "We can't do
              this. It's Evil"? Even if it was the most brilliant plan in the world,
              it relies on being profoundly shitty to people. It conflicts with the
              most basic principles of human decency.</p>
              <p>And,
              given that, what kind of sympathy can we have for these corporations?
              Stupid is forgivable on occasion; people make Stupid mistakes all the
              time. Stupidity is not intentional.</p>
              <p>Evil
              only comes through conscious choice. And if a corporation consciously
              decides to go down the Evil path, only to find that that path was also
              the Stupid choice?</p>
              <p>Well, then it's hard to have much pity.</p>
