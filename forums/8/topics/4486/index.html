            <div class='col-md body'>When exactly was Jesus born?<br>Was he truly born on Christmas Day?<br>If not, why do we celebrate his birth on December 25?<br>Most Christmas have wondered about these questions at some time in their lives.<br><br>In the Western world, everyone is familiar with the way of reckoning dates as A.D., for<br>"Anno Domini", which means "in the year of our lord", in Latin, and "B.C., which stands for<br>"Before Christ." At the first glance, this appears to mean that if the year is A.D. 2000, then<br>Jesus was born 2,000 years ago. Such a simple supposition hides a fascinating story. It turns out<br>that Jesus was not born in the year our calender would have us believe.<br><br>Our calendrical system, Gregorian calendar, that we use today, is based on the initial Roman calendar created during the days of the Roman Empire. This Roman calendar, with only ten months,gone through much amendments with the adding of two months by the decree of Julius Caesar. With the help from the Greek astronomer, Sosigenes, in reorganising this calender, Sosigenes also introduced the leap year in a stunningly accurate form, which worked successfully for more<br>than sixteen hundred years.<br><br>However, this more accurate Julian calendar, which is the basis for our modern calendar,had a<br>small cumulative error in the date adjusted by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582.<br>By having a leap year every four years, the Julian calendar had a slightly over-corrected the calendar, leaving too many extra days over time. Though the difference is tiny - only eight days per millennium - the small quantiy adds up to over the centuries and causes the calendar to lose<br>its correspondence with the seasons.....<br>........ (extracted from "The Star of Bethlehem: An Astronomer's View" By Mark Kidger)<br><br>Seems that our calendar system is really a revision and amendments of what we thought is a real accurate measurement of when Jesus was born.<br><br>Anyway, the fact is that even if we know that Dec 25th is not the birth of Jesus Christ, many people still don't care, especially Christians. For they just take things for granted already.<br><br>Well....it seems that the truth of what we think, is not always the truth. This perhaps includes religious belief.<br><br>Any comments and opinions?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the same people that come here say that he was not born on that day but another day meaning they do believe he existed but yet believe in evolution. theres something wrong here. and no he was not born that day. they mostlikely was born in april Because that year in april jupiter, saturn, and other planets all aligned in aries and that meant that the KING of KINGS was to be born. and that day jupiter showed itself as a star which means that the king of kings has been born.<br>~ GOD BLESS~<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Should Christians celebrate Christmas?<br><br>I understand your feelings about this issue, I can assure that the goal of the article Â“Should Christians Celebrate ChristmasÂ” on our web site was not to justify something that is inherently wrong, but help people deal with what can too easily become a form of legalism. Certainly, the way the world celebrates Christmas and its idea of the spirit of Christmas is way off base and a travesty of the meaning of the birth of our blessed Savior and the reason for His incarnation. But if we avoid everything the world distorts, we would also have to do away with a great deal of what we do, even the things clearly commanded in Scripture like marriage, assembling ourselves as Christians for worship, and what have you. Just because the world distorts it does not make it wrong. The pagan concepts associated with the tree and other features of the Christmas season lost their significance and meaning years and years ago just as did the names of the days of the week, all of which were once associated with pagan beliefs.<br><br>Regardless, I think it is significant that (at least in my experience as a pastor for nearly 30 years and Bible student for many more) the majority of those who hold conservative, evangelical beliefs about the person and work of Christ, find no problem with the celebration of Christmas as long as certain precautions are provided. That doesnÂ’t prove it is okay, but it does suggest that a large number of people who love the Savior and have given their lives in full-time service just have not found this to be an issue.<br><br>In the final analysis, as a study of Romans 14 shows us, each person needs to be persuaded in his own mind and not act against his or her own conscience or convictions in this matter.<br><br><a href="http://www.bible.org/docs/q&amp;a/q&amp;a-85.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible.org/docs/q&amp;a/q&amp;a-85.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most christians would agree there is highly likely that Jesus was not born on 25th December. If you ever celebrate christmas in a church, you would come to know that we recognise 25th December as a symbolic date not an actual date. It may have been 14 AUgust, it could have been 20 October, but the more impt thing for us is to remember the day when Jesus came to redeem the world, regardless whether it was 25 December or not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>indeed...25 December is not the actual date for the birth of Christ on historical grounds.  That day is infact a pagan festival dedicated to the Sun god.  To counter the abominable worship of the sun, it is converted into a Christian festival celebrating the Birth of the Son.  Orthodox Christians believed that the actual birth date falls on 8 January instead.....whatever the date is i am not concerned, all I know is the fact that the Messiah is born to save sinners.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
