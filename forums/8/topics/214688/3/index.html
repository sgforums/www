To destroy the North Korean communist. For this purpose, USA lead the whole UN army incursion into North Korea.<br><br>China entered the war LATER, after USA troops had already overrun almost the whole of North Korea up until the border with China. The goal of China's army was to drive the USA out of North Korea. To visualise this, you must know that Korea is a peninsula. The peninsula was divided into North Korea and South Korea. To the north of North Korea, it's adjoining with China. I know some of you don't have much knowledge of the geography, but you can imagine Korea as the Malaysian Peninsula, and China's location as Thailand. Then North Korea would be like from KL onwards until the border with Thailand. Can visualise?<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>2)End</strong></span><br>The war ended with a cease-fire at the 38th parallel, which was almost at the original border between North Korea and South Korea. In other words, after China entered the war, the whole USA led UN army was driven completely out of North Korea. At some point, USA army retreated almost to the southern part of South Korea (like JB in Malaysia). Then the cease-fire agreement was reached, with the border set at 38th parallel.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>3)Comparison</strong></span><br>So now, do you think USA succeeded or failed in the Korean War? And don't talk to me about casualties. The definition of success and failure is whether the goal of the war was achieved or not.<br></div>

No oil, no nothing. No benefits.<br><br>2)North Korea is a tough nut to crack. NOW that it has nuclear bomb, USA will not attack. USA attack only countries without nuclear bomb. That's why Iran is also frantically developing nuclear bomb. If Iran is stupid enough to believe USA and gives up on nuclear bomb, it will be the next country invaded.<br><br>3)Other major countries around North Korea (except Japan) doesn't support USA to attach North Korea.

            <div class='col-md body'>War is not to see who is right, but to see who is left. Take note of that before thinking of war.<br><br>Let me deal with a few things I read:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1) Nuking N. Korea into a glass carpark.</span><br><br>A VERY <strong>NOT</strong> GOOD IDEA.  Not only it is cruelty and will be condemned by the entire world, but nukes will have severe enviromental, geo-political and humanitarian complications, especially for US close ally, South Korea,<br><br>Heck, becuase of the A-bombs dropped in 1945, everyone agreed to a certain extent that nuclear weapons cannot be used in conventional war. Otherwise, Vietnam would have been a smothering crater during the Vietnam war.<br><br>Anyone who thinks it is easy to drop a nuclear warhead without reprecussions needs to read more about what happened to the people that survived the blast in Hiroshima and Nagasaki; What happens after nuclear bombs detonate; What happens to the country that can have the heart to commit such an act of terror.<br><br>And also if 1 or 5 nukes don't ensure the removal of all of N.Korea nuclear capabilities, it most likely safe to say bye-bye to US West Coast.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2) The very idea of attacking N. Korea</span><br><br>Its a safe bet that US military is stretched to its limit with the Iraq war. Sure, they got a few million reserved, but financially, it is not profitable. Instead US would more likely sell weapons to Japan and allow Japan to build up a military to combat N.Korea.<br><br>BUT China and Russia both will not be happy. (Chinese-Jap relations are pretty sour, and Russia won't like bombs going off) S.Korea may not be happy either, REMEMBER that families in S. Korea and N.Korea are still separated, and it will take a few more generations to purify the population.<br><br>Plus, N. Korea have no oil, Russia is the ppl with oil, deep in the Siberian desert, and tons of nukes that were developed during the cold war.<br><br>And you got the Pacific Ocean, and the closest military base is Hawaii (or Alaska). The most US can do is shell and bomb the sh*t out of N. Korea, and say bye-bye to the West coast.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3) Prospekt USA </span><br><br>I personally am totally against war of any kind. USA flaunts its power by taking Afganistan and Iraq in a matter of weeks. But USA is having a hard time keeping the resistance down.  Terror attacks risen since then.<br><br>The first reason Mr. Bush gave is that Saddam is hiding WMDs, and is asking him to disarm something Saddam doesn't have in the first place, if you are talking about nukes btw, since the most he got is biological weapons. US would attacked Iraq anyway even if Saddam did disarm non-existant WMDs, because of the oil, glorious oil.<br><br>After sometime, no WMDs, so Mr. Bush declared Saddam as an insane, cruel dictator. We all can say he is, but now Iraqis have to fear for their lives still.<br><br>And an insult to injury, Bush applies 'damage control' by saying America is promoting Democracy in the Middle East, with Tanks! War justified!<br><br>Multiply by annual tropical storms damaging infrastructure and the recontruction after Katrina, one would wonder where did Bush pull out so much money from, and still is able to mantain the military budget. My theory is that he is pulling money from scientific progress, education and health to fund the war.<br><br>In summary, it is too costly to wage another war. USA have too much to lose when it already is 'bleeding like mad'. N. Korea has little to lose however, and would gladly test the effects of a nuclear bomb detonating in downtown San Francisco if it has a reason to retaliate.<br><br>So to answer topic: Why USA doesn't attack N. Korea:<br><br>Because Bush haven't got enough money and a not good enough reason to attack N. Korea.<br><br>Apologies for all spelling error, I drank too much coffee.[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>even in a head to head confrontation (DPRK vs ROK only), im confident that the Republic Of Korea would prevail against the crazy North... i mean, the Korean People's Army.<br><br>the North has severe budget limitations, spending only 5.2174billion or 22.9% of its GDP in FY02 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_North_Korea" rel="nofollow">Source</a>), with the ROK spending 21.06 billion or 2.5% of its GDP in FY 05 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_South_Korea" rel="nofollow">Source</a>).<br><br>this big difference in budget would lead to a few problems, namely the sustainability of the Korean People's Army in a protracted war and of course, how high, or rather low, tech its military is, and how well they are armed and trained.<br><br>the modern battlefield is ruled by the Air Force. the ROKAF has a modern Air Force, which fields advanced fighters like the KF-16, KAI A-50, F-15Ks, and the not so advanced F-5s, F-4s.<br><br>the North's airforce, is a mere air farce. although it fields about twice as many aircraft, they are mostly obsolete types with only 20 MiG-29s. how well these pilots are trained is certainly questionable, with <a href="http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/currentconflicts/a/koreanmilitary_2.htm" rel="nofollow">sources</a> stating that due to severe aircraft fuel shortages, their pilots receive less than 10 hours of flight training per year. translation: these flying tin cans would be swatted out of the skies by the ROKAF if the KPA has enough fuel to get them flying in the first place.<br><br>however, 70% of the active KPA's forces are stationed near the DMZ and artillery guns are in range of Seoul in secure bunkers. if they have enough ammo <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">, this would mean that the KPA can either flatten Seoul, or attempt to take Seoul in the opening hours of another Korean War. although the KPA is numerically superior, the ROKHRF can call up the reserves, and with technologically superior weapons, should be able to stand up against the onslaught by the crazy North.<br><br>not to mention that the US has forces stationed there, the Japanese are doing some sabre rattling, and China is in the midst of modernizing itself and one would imagine how likely it is to support the DPRK, when it has problems in it's backyard too.<br><br>the delusional Kim doesnt know how badly he is going to die if he starts a war.</div>
