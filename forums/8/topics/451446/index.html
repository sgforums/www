              <p>I am not talking about it being free, I am asking about self education, as opposed to 'buying a degree' as pillow said. Like in the movie 'Good Will Hunting', where Matt Damon's character has educated himself, on his own time, to the point of having genius-level intellect.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately the idea of intellectual property prevents anything to be "free". At least in the immediate sense.</p>
              <p>I think its possible to attain genius level without going to an actual "school". It is just like home-schooling. If you have the right material, I am sure you will do fine. The only problem is that in the real world, you have to back it up with your credentials. The system demands it. Or else everyone can be a "genius" like in sgforums without any proof of credentials whatsoever.</p>

              <p><br>I'm talking about everything in general, and that includes your mentioned topics. For example I am a post graduate on business and technology. After I graduated, I went to research on quantum mechanics on my own. Of course the more I dig, the more interesting it gets, and that gets me to learn even more... For example, do you know some liquid stays in the container and under the right temperature, it will leak out of the container? Do you know that liquid can climb containers? Do you know about the M Theory? Do you know we're mostly made out of empty space? Do you know we're made from the same material as the non-living things such as tables/chairs, so what makes us alive? Do you know that recently NASA realize that life can be in forms we never thought possible before? Basically what they mean is that life is no longer limited by what we thought was originally the necessity for the building blocks of life, because they managed to create a new life form that is built up of something else... Do you know that scientists have managed to create synthetic life out of chemicals, well in some ways, it's a breakthrough nonetheless... Do you know what is the observable universe? Do you know how many dimensions there are in this world theoratically and how scientists are trying to find evidence of those other dimensions? And then of course I also read about the double slit theory and how electrons can be at many places at 1 time... I can go on and on about what I researched so far but it's a long list but those mentioned are part of it. So yeah, I love physics and I educate myself on my free time on these amazing things!!!</p>

              <p>where did you read that liquid is able to flow out of a container under the right temperature? that's new to me</p>
              <p>based on my understanding, it is due to the smaller molecule size of the liquid being able to squeeze through the spaces between molecules of the container</p>

              <p><br> I'm talking about everything in general, and that includes your
              mentioned topics. For example I am a post graduate on business and
              technology. After I graduated, I went to research on quantum
              mechanics on my own. Of course the more I dig, the more interesting
              it gets, and that gets me to learn even more... For example, do you
              know some liquid stays in the container and under the right
              temperature, it will leak out of the container? Do you know that
              liquid can climb containers? Do you know about the M Theory? Do you
              know we're mostly made out of empty space? Do you know we're made
              from the same material as the non-living things such as
              tables/chairs, so what makes us alive? Do you know that recently
              NASA realize that life can be in forms we never thought possible
              before? Basically what they mean is that life is no longer limited
              by what we thought was originally the necessity for the building
              blocks of life, because they managed to create a new life form that
              is built up of something else... Do you know that scientists have
              managed to create synthetic life out of chemicals, well in some
              ways, it's a breakthrough nonetheless... Do you know what is the
              observable universe? Do you know how many dimensions there are in
              this world theoratically and how scientists are trying to find
              evidence of those other dimensions? And then of course I also read
              about the double slit theory and how electrons can be at many
              places at 1 time... I can go on and on about what I researched so
              far but it's a long list but those mentioned are part of it. So
              yeah, I love physics and I educate myself on my free time on these
              amazing things!!!</p>

              <p>hey, Funguy,</p>
              <p>where did you read that liquid is able to flow out of a container under the right temperature? that's new to me</p>
              <p>based on my understanding, it is due to the smaller molecule size of the liquid being able to squeeze through the spaces between molecules of the container</p>

              <p><br>Go youtube and look at superfluid helium. =) They defy gravity because they have no viscosity.</p>
              <p>And as for the smaller molecule size, not to my understanding. The liquid was staying inside the container without any problems all the time. But once the temperature went close to absolute zero, the atoms behaved differently and because they have no viscosity, they can keep flowing out through the solid container. Initially they couldn't because there's friction between the atoms but obviously you can't see with the naked eye, need to use imagination unless have state of the art microscope.</p>
