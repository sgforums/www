              <p>Just to pique some interests, the M theory suggests that there's many dimension in this universe. However, we are unable to see those dimensions (for a simple explanation, go youtube and search for "dr quantum flatland"). It seems far fetch but given the fact that we didn't know quarks used to exists until we find evidence of them in the past decade, in fact during secondary school I was told the atom was the smallest it can exists, but that's wrong. So something could be a fact and we didn't know until we found evidence. So scientists are trying to find evidence of the other dimensions or the other universe.</p>
              <p>How are they doing that? Very complicated but in super layman terms, they collide particles, for example if the particule is 10 gram, and they smash 2 particles therefore 20 grams, then they will breakup into smaller pieces and all the pieces should add up to 20 grams. If they add up to only 19 grams, then where did that 1 gram went? It went to the other dimensions! This is just a super simple explanation for anyone interested.</p>
              <p>Yah, I super siao about physics and science but I learnt these on own time. In fact I am not a good student in school because I find school so boring, no passion to learn.</p>
              <p>And then also why radiation occurs and why it can cause cancer? You all know it does, but have you ever find out the explanation? I explain next time, lol.</p>
              <p>Problem with physics is that the more I find out, the more I realize I don't understand something and then I had to find out more. Sometimes it gets frustrating.</p>

              <p>The other very interesting thing to share is the double slit theory. What it says is that when you look at photons, they behave differently, as if they know someone is looking at them!!! That's why I say, life could be different from what we thought possible, what if photons (eg. lights are conscience of their surroundings, but they can't talk and let us know)</p>
              <p>double slit theory simply is having 1 slit (hole) open and shooting photons. they behave like bullets when they hit the end target. but when you have 2 slits (holes), then the photons behaves like water waves. so are they bullets or water waves? scientists try to find out by observing them.</p>
              <p>when they tried to observe, something weird happens. the photons behave like bullets even on the 2 slits experiment. when they stop observing, then the photons became like water waves again!!! very interesting right!!!</p>

              <p>For double slit theory animation, you can watch Mr Quantum in youtube : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ElSXo1HWS4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ElSXo1HWS4</a></p>
              <p>Anyway if you are interested in physic based on what you discuss, I strongly recomend you watch Brain Greene 's show like "The Elegant Universe" in Discovery Science or another of his show "Beyond the cosmos" on National Geographic channel where he will discuss "sci fi" physic like quantum leap, multverse, time travel etc.</p>
              <p>Also for your info, in asia, another well-known Japan physicist who hosted Discovery Science channel Dr Michio Kaku is another awesome guy. In his show "Sci Fi Science", he discuss the blueprint of making light-saber, and even how to build an holodeck (If you are star-trek fan you know that is). these scientist is definately the men or "Einstein" of our time.</p>
              <p>Finally for some interesting physic theory like string theory, unless there is lab experiment which prove it "existed", sadly it just remind as a theory.Do you know that even scientist is beginning to disprove Einstein's theory that nothing can travel faster than light through some experiment. Moral of the story : A scientist has to be open-minded and be prepared for his theory to be right or wrong !</p>

              <p><br>Yep yep, I been watching Dr Kaku and Professor Brain's videos, very interesting! And yes I have watched that video you mentioned, very interesting.</p>
              <p>And what you mentioned faster than light is the neutrinos, haha. I been reading up about the LHC so yep, all those stuff is very amazing!</p>
              <p>So there are actually things we can learn online and become more educated.</p>
              <p>But all these physics thing is really screwing with my head, like it makes me wonder about many things. For example we're made of the atoms, and that superfluid helium can go through solid, which means theoratically we humans can walk through walls but that's assuming we can survive at absolute zero temperature. But theoratically, going through walls is possible, lol.</p>
