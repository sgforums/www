              <p>I'm a parent of 3 and both my husband and i 
              are working hard to
                                      pay off our housing debt. To take care of my 
              children during my
                                      working hours, i hired a maid about 3 years ago.</p>
              <p>However, it has become increasingly evident 
              that my kids are
                                      more attached to the maid than me! They always 
              talk with the maid
                                      and when i try to talk to them, they either give
               me short answers
                                      or just stare blankly at me. I feel frustrated 
              and so does my
                                      husband.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I feel like sacking the maid and 
              hiring another one,
                                      so that at least i become the more 'familiar' 
              person to them in the
                                      house. However, i don't think my kids are 
              willing to part with my
                                      maid so easily... Can anyone tell me how to deal
               with this??? thx

              <p>No point blaming the maid, be glad that at least your kids have someone they can talk/relate to and depend on.</p>
              <p>All you can do now is spend more time with them. I'm sure there are some things you can do that the maid cannot do. I don't think mothers can be completely replaced by maids. So find out what "that" is before your kids ignore you completely.</p>

              <p>and i forgot to add on. dont blame the maid, she's working hard just like you are; you work hard for your family and she works hard for hers. if your children are closer to her than to you, it shows that she's doing her job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sorry, but i really have a lot of prejudice against parents who throw their kids to the maid. i grew up like that, and even though i understand the stress and pain of life since im working now, i will never be able to be as close to my parents as those who grew up in a happy and contented family. sometimes i do blame my parents, was money actually so important that they could throw me aside? financially it makes sense, hire a maid for minimum wage and use the time saved to earn more. but does it make sense emotionally? some bonds can only be built when the child is very young, is the love between parent and child worth the extra cash?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>perhaps you shouldnt be so career driven? to quote someone that i forgot: on their deathbed, no one ever wished that they spent more time at the office.</p>

              <p>well if you leave the job of taking care of your children to your maid, who is to blame?</p>
              <p>u have to live with your decisions and be accountable for your actions.</p>
              <p>sack the maid for? any reasons other than being closed to your children? if the maid is lazy and shows attitude problems at work, fine sack her. but to sack her for being close to your children and she is doing a fine job doing housework and taking care of them is a tad lame, dun u think so.</p>
              <p>instead of being jealous and green with envy of your maid, what you should do is to spend more time with your children and give them quality time. make sure u do your job and role as a mother by educating them. please teach your children basic manners and etiquette, like thank you, respect and things like that. you should not vent your anger and frustrations on your children, because they are just children and being naughty. what you should do is to win them over by your actions. wishing to win them over is just wishful thinking. prove it with actions and not by words and thinking.</p>

              Don worry, when u're old and unwell, ur kids gonna send to u the old folks.
              They'll be too busy for u aniwaes.
              
              
              Make sure u treat the maid well, cos the way I see it, she's their role model
