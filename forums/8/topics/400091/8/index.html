              <p>2 cents worth,</p>
              <p>firstly I'm glad that you know about science and is able to pull your stand clearly and backed with reasons. unlike some. </p>
              <p>since female reproductive organs are internal , there is always the possibility of ovaries bursting, or pelvic fracture due to the impact of caning. It is harder to diagnose because it bleeds internally, and could be fatal. Is there ever caning perform for woman except Malaysia's three cases? Malaysia did not specify how heavy the caning would be for woman as well, so I can only guess it is light punishment.</p>
              <p>It's a sterotype that man are stronger and woman are weaker, hence, man are more aggressive, with actions and woman are meeker, with words. Applies generally, but not specifically.</p>
              <p>Not sure what the statistics say but it says more woman are unemployed. Woman faced a career ceiling, and harder to be employed. another example is woman who play around are sluts/bitches while it's a norm for man to play around. check the forums is there one who say "female looking for fun?"</p>
              <p>Caning is not just a form of punishment but more importantly, it acts as a deterrent from doing that crime. Gender equality certainty cannot be the sole basis for such debate, because, one should understand the genetic differences between a male and a female. % of repeated offenders, ratio of offenders between males/females, social impact, and many more comes into the picture. I find it appalling to see people argue for the sake of arguing, and caning for the sake of caning.</p>
              <p>Lastly, in my previous post, I do agree on implementing caning on woman, if the crime rates are as high as man AND there is a need to curb such potential problem.</p>

              <p>Sometimes they even stone them to death.</p>

              <p>And the stats are shit! Dun even have to look for stats! Just look at how many companies who are willing to hire pregnant women. Look at how society frowns upon women who breast feed in public, until they have to hide in toilets to feed their kids. And I can go on and on. But no point.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">And what are the other offenses? Rape? Let me ask you, is it feasible to change the law just to accomodate the very few women who would actually rape a man?</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Not just rape. Many many many</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">By the way, I was talking SCIENCE in case you didn't notice. It is a proven fact that generally men have tougher bones, skin and do not have wombs growing in their abdomen. Unless you are going to argue otherwise? And if you are going to go all out to cane women with the same force as men. Then with all these differences, WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF WOMEN SUFFERING GREATER OR EVEN PERMANENT INJURIES? Please actually read my post before you comment.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">THIS IS BASIC COMMON SENSE.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">I am talking about the effect of the punishment. Not generalised things like that. The question is whether the punishment is sufficient to cause greater damages. Like broken bones and decreased fertility. Tougher bones and having wombs does not mean damage will be done to it. Thats what i am talking about.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">And by the way, do you know of any countries out there who cane women, with the same amount of force as those administered in SG? Then would it be reasonable to suggest that this may be the reason why such articles don't exist? In fact, you may as well ask a doctor for his opinion.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">see above. The above can actually be testing using Prothestic dummies to emulate the female anatomy.The question is not is there any countries outside singapore. It is the tolerance of the female physique.<span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 19px; font-size: medium;"><em style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-weight: normal; line-height: 18px; color: #3366ff; font-size: 15px;"> </span></em></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In fact, whining and complaining on the forum about how unfair the law is to men, with regards to the caning issue, would be a hundred times more infantile don't you think? Instead of arguing with me, why don't you devote your time to writing a letter to the govt instead? I'm not gonna change the law for you even if you win the argument.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">No i dont find it infantile and i am not complaining. I just find it nice to exercise my head abit. I think most of my posts are questioning as to why women cannot be caned. Or are replies to some other forumers points. Its more oriented to finding reasons. Not a crusade to amend the law. I would not know if you are able to change the law and i dont expect it. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">And you can't think of other issues that may be involved?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">1. Before caning the women you will need to check if her bones are strong enough, and whether she is suffering from osteoporosis.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">A condition a man can also suffer from.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">2. You would need to check if she is anemic</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">A condition a man can also suffer from although women are at higher risk due to menstruation.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">3. You would need to check if she is muslim. (a muslim female is prohibited from baring her body in the presence of other men)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Need to check meh? i believe court documents will indicate your ethinicity. Caning can also be done by a girl. Nobody said it must be a guy. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">4. You would need to see if she's pregnant, and most women can go ard this simply by getting pregnant.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Indeed but not probable. You have to be very lucky.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">5. You need to check if she's having her period before you cane her.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Depends really on whether it has any effect on the punishment does it?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">6. In the light of all the issues, which I a layperson has churned out, what makes you think the govt would go thru with the effort just to cane a few women?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">7. Amending this law would probably cause the rest of the world to hate SG. Just look at the furore caning ppl has caused.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Enough issues for you? Want some more?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">No. Because women rights groups will spring into action, international communities would probably be against it (voters impt). But that is unimportant. Because this is a forum to exchange views on topics. Currently it will not. But in the future, if some research group finds evidence that caning of girls does not have the problems in which you refer to as "common-sense", things might change. <br><br>I am not suggesting anything but please realise that in life, doing the right thing is not enough. We must consider factors like should we do it, when to do it and how to do it.</span></p>

              <p>2 cents worth,</p>
              <p>firstly I'm glad that you know about science and is able to pull
              your stand clearly and backed with reasons. unlike some. </p>
              <p>since female reproductive organs are internal , there is always
              the possibility of ovaries bursting, or pelvic
              fracture due to the impact of caning. It is harder to diagnose
              because it bleeds internally, and could be fatal. Is there ever
              caning perform for woman except Malaysia's three cases? Malaysia
              did not specify how heavy the caning would be for woman as well, so
              I can only guess it is light punishment.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Thats speculative, have no data on it</span></p>
              <p>It's a sterotype that man are stronger and woman are weaker,
              hence, man are more aggressive, with actions and woman
              are meeker, with words. Applies generally, but not
              specifically.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Stereotype indeed. Although there is not alot of evidence to suggest that women are kinder. This is just my opinion, but girls seems to be masters of mind-games. More pro den alex ferguson. </span></p>
              <p>Not sure what the statistics say but it says more woman are
              unemployed. Woman faced a career ceiling, and harder to be
              employed. another example is woman who play around are
              sluts/bitches while it's a norm for man to play around. check the
              forums is there one who say "female looking for fun?"</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">This is the world economic forum gender gap 2009. search on google can find le. While more women are unemplyed percentage wise,  it is worth looking at the labour force participation which stands at 0.73 (73% of men). which means in numerical terms, more males are unemployed. Wage equity for similiar work (0.79) and ability of women to rise to enterprise leadership(5.87/7) are based on surveys and not figures. So i wont comment on them </span></p>
              <p>Caning is not just a form of punishment but more importantly, it
              acts as a deterrent from doing that crime. Gender equality
              certainty cannot be the sole basis for such
              debate, because, one should understand the genetic differences
              between a male and a female. % of repeated offenders, ratio of
              offenders between males/females, social impact, and many more comes
              into the picture. I find it appalling to see people argue for the
              sake of arguing, and caning for the sake of caning.</p>
              <p>Lastly, in my previous post, I do agree on implementing caning
              on woman, if the crime rates are as high as man AND there is a need
              to curb such potential problem.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Thats why i keep emphasising the need for scientific evidence that proves that such a punishment will or will not have the effects that </span><span style="line-height: 17px; font-weight: bold;"><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://sgforums.com/users/265101"><span style="color: #3366ff;">littlemissbonkers</span></a><span style="color: #3366ff;"> </span></span><span style="line-height: 17px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">are concerned about.

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">If you are so adamant that caning would not affect fertility then please go and take up this issue with a physican. Maybe he/she will be able to provide you with some "convincing stats".</p>

Too may variables. So, testing is needed. Thats why we need publications. Anyway i did not claim that it WILL NOT affect. I simply said until now, nobody have shown evidence here that IT WILL.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Please read properly. The labour force participation is 73% of men. The overall population sex ration(male/female) is 0.96. Meaning there are more women than men. Unless there is a great skew, which is unlikely, and assuming equal number of working age male-female, that represents many women are housewifes, shao nainai or somehow left out. <br></span></p>
              <p>Are they all shao nai nai too?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">The example was to show that there are women that wants to turn away from their traditional gender roles, which is rightfully so, but wishes to enjoy the benefits of their traditional gender roles, which is contrary to the flag of equality so proudly raised. As it would represent the reversal of roles into a maternal society. It therefore becomes a fight for supremacy.</span></p>
