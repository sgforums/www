            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by DrTech:</div><div class="quote_body">Totally bad ass. And it's all because of evil capitalist and businessmen!<br><br><a href="http://forums.facepunchstudios.com/showthread.php?t=143648" rel="nofollow">http://forums.facepunchstudios.com/showthread.php?t=143648</a><br><br>Never fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ck with an angry American......<br><br>52 year old welder Marvin Heemeyer lived in Grunbee Colorado fixing vehicle mufflers. His small repair shop was located near a concrete factory called Mountain Park. To Marvin and his neigbors' horrors, the owners of Mountain Park decided to expand the factory, forcing the people living near-by to sell their land to Mountain Park.<br><br>Sooner or later the factory's neigbhors gave up, except for Marvin. Having tried every way possible, the owners of the factory failed to acquire his land. However all the surrounding land was now owned by the factory, which resulted in Marvin's shop getting cut off from the rest of the world.<br><br>Marvin tried everything in his powers to restore justice. Obsiously, the city council and other politicians of the state were on the factory owners' evil capitalist side.<br><br>It's not suprising that Marvin lost the case to the owners, in court. After that Marvin was also given a $2500 fine for not having a connected sewer line. When paying the fine, Marvin attached a note to the check and ticket that read "Cowards".<br><br>He was just one of those who would not give up.<br><br>On the 4th of June, 2004 during a rainy day Marvin rolled out into town on a bulldozer reinforced with metal sheets. He started with the concrete factory, destroying building after building, until the factory was demolished. Then it was the city council's turn followed by the town hall, then the bank, the public library, the fire station, a warehouse, the local paper and other buildings belonging to the mayor.<br><br>Having tried to stop Heemeyer, the police finally understood that Marvin's bulldozer was unstoppable. More than 200 bullets were fired at the vehicle, causing no harm at all. The police force then decided to battle the titan with hand grenades. Once again their efforts were useless. Later a vehicle rigged with explosives was put in Marvin's path to destruction, it also had little luck in stopping him.<br><br>Marvin returned fire using two semi-automatic .23 caliber rifles and a single .50 caliber semi-automatic rifle through specially designed holes in the vehicle's front, left and right sides.<br><br>All the police were able to do, was evacuate 1500 inhabitants (the town's population was 2200) and block all the roads, including a federal highway that lead to the town.<br><br>Marvin's war ended at 4:23 PM.<br><br>Having just finished destroying the Gambles Mall, the bulldozer suddenly stopped. The only thing that could be heard comming form Marvins death machine was smoke out of a damaged radiator.<br><br>At first the police officers were too afraid to approach the thing. Trying to get Marvin out of his fortress, they had to make a hole in the armor. When they finally got through, Marvin was allready dead. He wasn't going to get into the enemy's hands alive.<br><br>Despite the great damage to property (13 buildings were destroyed, most requiring hundreds of thousands of dollars to be replaced), no one besides Heemeyer was injured; observers noted that Heemeyer appeared to go out of his way to avoid injury to bystanders.<br><br>The governor said that the city looked as if a tornado had just gone through.<br><br>Later an investigation was carried out. It was discovered that Marvin's creation was so strong that even a powerful artillery blow would only cause minor damage. The bulldozer was totally covered in sheet metal, with each piece being at least half an inch thick. In places, the vehicle's armor was over one foot thick, consisting of concrete sandwiched between sheets of steel to make ad-hoc composite armor.<br><br>To fit the bulldozer with this shell, Marvin had to use a self-made crane. "Lowering the protective armor onto the vehicle, Marvin knew he wouldn't be able to get out"- said police officials.<br><br>Although Marvin packed the interior with supplies such as water, food, ammo and a gasmask. To control the killdozer, Marvin used 3 monitors and a couple of video cameras. In an event of the cameras being blinded by dust, they were fitted with air compressors.<br><br>It took Marvin 2 months to design the Killdozer, and according to sources, 1.5 years to build it.<br><br>"He was a fine lad", - said the people that were close to Marvin. "They shouldn't have made him angry". "If he was your friend, he was your best friend. And if he was your enemy, well he was your worst and most dangerous enemy." - said Marvins friends.<br></div></blockquote>He has a good design against kinetic weapons but against thermo based weapons, he is in deep doo-doo.  Connect a few tanks of liquid nitro and a few tanks of LPG in the path of the dozer and away from each other by a few metres with detonators and blow them up. The steel plates will warp or even break, now the sharpshooters can get at the soft interior.<br><br>As for using limited resources to kick Mountain Park's arse, Marvin is the super-commando in my books.</div>
