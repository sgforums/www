              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Recently i read this article detailing the potential harmful effect on the use of sodium silicofluoride which PUB has added to our drinking water as a way to prevent tooth decay. I have attched the abstract of that article at the bottom of this topic for your reference.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This article concluded the negative effect of sodium silicofluoride in a cohort study of American children and found the lead content in their blood to be 2 times higher than those from sodium fluoride source. That article also details the other negative effects of sodium silicofluoride sodium silicofluoride with regard to our nervous system.<br> </span><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">May I ask if the fluorination of our water to be really necessay? It has long been reported that the fluorine in drinking water can cause fluorosis. May i ask why PUB is adding sodium silicofluoride instead of sodium fluoride since the former is a byproduct of the manufacture of phosphate fertilizer?</span><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"> </span><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Confirmation of and explanations for elevated blood lead and other disorders in children exposed to water disinfection and fluoridation chemicals</strong>  Original Research Article</span><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>NeuroToxicology</em>, <em>Volume 28, Issue 5</em>, <em>September 2007</em>, <em>Pages 1032-1042</em></span><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Myron J. Coplan, Steven C. Patch, Roger D. Masters, Marcia S. Bachman</span><br><strong></strong> <br><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Abstract</span></strong><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Silicofluorides (SiFs), fluosilicic acid (FSA) and sodium fluosilicate (NaFSA), are used to fluoridate over 90% of US fluoridated municipal water supplies. Living in communities with silicofluoride treated water (SiFW) is associated with two neurotoxic effects: (1) Prevalence of children with elevated blood lead (PbB &gt; 10 μg/dL) is about double that in non-fluoridated communities (Risk Ratio 2, <em>χ</em>2 <em>p</em> &lt; 0.01). SiFW is associated with serious corrosion of lead-bearing brass plumbing, producing elevated water lead (PbW) at the faucet. New data refute the long-prevailing belief that PbW contributes little to children's blood lead (PbB), it is likely to contribute 50% or more. (2) SiFW has been shown to interfere with cholinergic function. Unlike the fully ionized state of fluoride (F-) in water treated with sodium fluoride (NaFW), the SiF anion, [SiF6]2- in SiFW releases F- in a complicated dissociation process. Small amounts of incompletely dissociated [SiF6]2- or low molecular weight (LMW) silicic acid (SA) oligomers may remain in SiFW. A German PhD study found that SiFW is a more powerful inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) than NaFW. It is proposed here that SiFW induces protein mis-folding via a mechanism that would affect polypeptides in general, and explain dental fluorosis, a tooth enamel defect that is not merely "cosmetic" but a "canary in the mine" foretelling other adverse, albeit subtle, health and behavioral effects. Efforts to refute evidence of such effects are analyzed and rebutted. In 1999 and 2000, senior EPA personnel admitted they knew of no health effects studies of SiFs. In 2002 SiFs were nominated for NTP animal testing. In 2006 an NRC Fluoride Study Committee recommended such studies. It is not known at this writing whether any had begun.</span></p>

              <p>It really saddened me when I contacted MOH and their quality service manager replied. He is only concern with the preventive aspect of fluoridation has on tooth decay and did not even mentioned the adverse effect of this industrial by product, sodium silicofluoride, has on the long term accumulation on human body. There are so many reseacrh articles on the reported adverse effect of fluoridation and he still has the cheek to say it isn't so.</p>
              <p>Look at the Material and Safety Data sheet of sodium silicofluoride from one company that sell it. (<a href="http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9925037">http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9925037</a>)</p>
              <p>Section 3: Hazards Identification</p>
              <p>Potential Acute Health Effects:<br>Hazardous in case of skin contact (irritant), of eye contact (irritant), of ingestion, of inhalation. Severe over-exposure can result<br>in death.</p>
              <p><br>Potential Chronic Health Effects:<br>CARCINOGENIC EFFECTS: A4 (Not classifiable for human or animal.) by ACGIH, 3 (Not classifiable for human.) by IARC.<br>MUTAGENIC EFFECTS: Not available. TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Not available. DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY: Not<br>available. Repeated exposure to a highly toxic material may produce general deterioration of health by an accumulation in one<br>or many human organs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He even replied saying many of the products we use in our modern world are a useful by products of many complex chemical process which is different in terms of properties and purposes from the original products. He mentioned that plastics are a by-product from petrol refineries.</p>
              <p>I was like huh? I can even see the link between plastics and sodium silicofluoride. Does he meant to say both items are safe to be added into our drinking water since they are useful by-products?</p>
              <p>I listed many references that showed the potential adverse effects of fluoridation has on human studies but he did not seems to care.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is what Mr Khaw boon wan, Minister of health, wrote in his blog-</p>
              <p>My mission is to help Singaporeans live a long and healthy life and to make quality healthcare</p>
              <p>If his staff at MOH even refuse to acknowlege sodium silicofluoride based on the recent publised adverse effect as a potential harmful chemical, how is he going to help singaporeans live  long and healthy life?</p>

              <p>The question is what is the critical level for toxification?</p>
              <p>For an example,  Na+Cl-.</p>
              <p>To provide Na+ in the water, one can add Na2PO4, NaK, Na2CO3 and many other Na compounds.</p>
              <p>Too much Na+ in the water, it also deadly. Try drinking sea water everyday, you will die of  thrist. Yet pure distilled water will also kill you as well.</p>
              <p>It is long proven that fluorination can help to prevent tooth decay and there are plenty of literatures to back this story up. Even your tooth paste has F-.</p>
              <p>You should ask since every1 use toothpaste nowadays, is it still necessary to add F- to our water. Perhaps, PUB is still backdated since 1957, when every1 does not use toothpaste.</p>

              <p>For those interested, serach for neotame as the lastest artificial sweetener to be approve by FDA in US to be use in food without the need to be label in the food label. This means that even neotame can be added into organic foodstuff without be listed in the food label. Go and google for its side effect.</p>

              <p>   All this so call managers or public relations always like to use the approach of diverting you to another topic so that you will forget what you want to say or too confused by him untill you  forgot what you want to say liao . My previous manager like to do that when he was dumbfolded by other questions posed by us .</p>
              <p>In short , those so called " educated " pple always like to go 1 very big round to shoot pple . And will divert the talk to some other stuff to make you forget what you want to say .</p>

              <p>A little fluoride is good for teeth. however, too much fluoride corrodes the teeth. </p>
              <p>So the question should instead be: is singapore's water having the right concentration of fluoride ions?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And it's fluoride. Flu before oride. Not FLOUR then ide. </p>
