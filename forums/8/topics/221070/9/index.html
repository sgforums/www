It's more like you're asking people to smoke with you.

What things don't kill. The key word is moderation. Even too much of a good thing is bad for the body. For example, red wine is good and got significant health benefits but if you drink like 1 bottle of red wine everyday, your liver is going to be hardened. So, when it comes to smoking, smoke like about 5 sticks a day is enough and you can enjoy its health benefits.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
