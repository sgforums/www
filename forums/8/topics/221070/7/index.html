            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by R3SsH|n:<br>but coincidentally, so many students coming from schools ending with the initials JC happen to be scum of the societies...[/b]</blockquote>Coincidentally, a lot of so called scum are not from JC either. I'd like to give you examples but they're people I know personally.<br><br><blockquote>think that RJC girl...</blockquote>Out of how many RJC people you know?<br><br><blockquote>or that guy who push his girlfren onto the mrt track(this one i know is scholar,not sure jc anot)..</blockquote>Yes, he's from Hwa Chong Junior College. But he ended up pushing his girlfriend onto the tracks because he has emotional and mental issues, not because he's from a JC.<br><br><blockquote>then that nismogirl who asks stupid questions...and that chelzea twirp who is always looking for a discussion...</blockquote>Sorry, I don't know much about either so I can't comment. But honestly, do really think all the or even most of the stupid questions are by JC people. There is really no proven statistic either way. But I don't know how you can come to such an assumption from posts in sgforums when you don't even know most of who these people are that post.<br><br>About stupid posts, well, how about our resident racist, I don't think he's from JC. And if you've been around long enough, remember Cortez, was he from JC?<br><br>How about that Dilip Kumar guy, is there any proof whether he's from JC or otherwise?<br><br><blockquote>and that xinyi! who is openly loose on her sexual life...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></blockquote>I don't get you, there are non-JC girls who are like that too, in fact some people tell me that Poly girls are more open when it comes to sex, and that JC girls are very uptight. Also, if JC girls are stuck up, they won't be loose with just about anybody right? So does that make Poly girls more cheap? No offence to poly people, but I'm just saying sexual promiscuity is not determined by whether you go to JC or Poly. Is Xia xue from JC or Poly?<br><br><blockquote>then of cos in real life those who owe money don't pay...owe things don't return...</blockquote>I once knew a guy from an International school. When he was in army he borrowed money from everybody. Always cried infront of everyone, officers/sergeants/bunkmates that his family wasn't doing well. What he was doing was just taking the money to buy weed and he never paid anyone back a dime.<br><br>I've previously dealt with credit control as well, those who owe institutions and banks money come from all walks of life. They're not restricted to JC students.<br><br><blockquote>make comments like "zui kan bu qi ni men zhe zhong ren"</blockquote>You mean like how you kan bu qi JC student? bi ci bi ci ba le.<br><br>Don't let a few isolated cases cloud your judgement.
