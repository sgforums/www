The girl, an unseasoned drinker, soon became drunk. At her boyfriend's suggestion, she went to a bedroom to sleep it off.<br><br>Early the following morning, the host's two friends entered the bedroom and shut the door.<br><br>One of them first kissed her and molested her as she lay sleeping. The man, who is married with two young children, then took off her underwear and proceeded to rape her. The other man also kissed her and fondled her breasts.<br><br>Shocked, the girl woke up but was so drunk that she could do little to resist their advances.<br><br>After a while, the pair left the room and the girl fell asleep again.<br><br>When she awoke, she burst into tears and told her boyfriend ? who had been in the next room all the time ? what had happened. She was then taken to a hospital for a check-up and a police report was lodged.<br><br>A day later, the two men met the girl to apologise and plead with her to withdraw her complaint against them. She refused to give them an answer.<br><br>The men then set up another meeting to persuade her to tell the police that she had consented to their advances.

              <p>sigh! things like this wouldn't have happened if both the girl and her boyfriend have taken the following precautions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) being a woman, she should never have gotten herself so dead-drunk at any party.</p>
              <p>2) being an unseasoned drinker, her boyfriend should protect her from getting too drunk.</p>
              <p>3) she should not have stayed overnight in an unfamiliar place with unfamiliar people. her boyfriend should have sent her straight back home, if possible.</p>
              <p>4) if not, her boyfriend should have guarded her throughout the night in that room, instead of staying in the next room. he should also keep the room locked from inside to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what a lousy boyfriend he makes, if he can't even protect his girlfriend from harm. and the girlfriend should have some common sense on how to better protect herself from being an easy target for sexual assault.</p>
              <p>even after the offenders have been charged in court, i worry about how the victim is going to carry on with her life and relationship as normal. the damage has already been done. it will be a permanent psychological scar that will stay with her for the rest of her life, on top of other worries of unwanted pregnancies and/or sexually-transmitted diseases.</p>
              <p>it's sad..... but blame it on self-negligience and naviety. indeed, this is a hefty price to pay for such a lesson.</p>

              <p>this case quite clear cut what. the girl was dead drunk. she cldn't tink clearly. no matter what, the guys are going to kena, cos they took advantage of someone who was not in the right state of mind to decide for herself whether she wanted to have sex with them.</p>
              <p>the worst is tt the two guys actually had the cheek to ask her to drop charges. at least the bf supported her in making the report and tipped off the police when the two guys tried to meet her.</p>
              <p>it was good tt she had the courage to do the right thing. at least now those two guys won't be a menace to other girls for a long time.</p>

              <p>there is an unspoken rule in prison.</p>
              <p>if one goes into prison because he steals $1M, he will enjoy a hero's welcome by the other inmates.</p>
              <p>but if one goes in there because of sexual offences, he will be sure to get it hard and tough from the other inmates. even inmates will despise him. let's pray his ass(hole) can take it over there. i really wonder how big a tool they are going to use on him..... but most likely something longer and bigger than his own prick.</p>
