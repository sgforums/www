Which one is more harmful????</strong><br><br>I have thot of that way long long time ago. The reason they can ban chewing gum but don't ban cigarette is simple. MONEY!!!!!!! Who want to turn away money? Imagine no matter how high you raise the tax there are still buyers so why ban and terminate a source of income?<br><br>Another reason I can think of is they dun wanna alienate a group of smokers who may vote against them during election. Yes smokers are pretty passionate about their hobby and they can make 'noise' during wat time but election?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
