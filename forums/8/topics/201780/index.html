            <div class='col-md body'>when I met her, little did I know what I got myself into...<br><br>Her name was Susan, I got to meet her online. Susan seemed like a very pleasant girl and we shared many interests so we clicked instantly. After many romantic late night chats we became closer to each other and we exchanged photos of ourselves. It turned out that she was a very pretty girl too. Eventually we agreed to meet each other. So on that day, I bought flowers and drove to the address she gave me.<br><br>When I stepped out of my car, I was suddenly nervous. I was afraid that she might have played a fool of me and given me someone else's photo and address. However a moment later I realized that such a thing was not possible, we had many long chats after all and she seemed to be telling the truth. I pressed the doorbell and waited. I shifted nervously as the door opened, and to my joy, it was her! Susan smiled and hugged me, I gave her the flowers I bought and she was overjoyed. We went to an expensive Italian restaurant for dinner and then went for a movie. All the while talking excitedly with each other, glad to finally meet in real life. After a fun and exhausting night, she invited me back to her place and we slept together, the sex was fantastic and we just didnt feel like stopping until we both finally fell asleep due to exhaustion.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>When I awoke, I realized that she was not beside me. I sat up and recalled the events of the night before and thought of what my plans with her was. I was still dreamily having those happy thoughts when suddenly Susan rushed into the room and scried for me to get dressed and leave. Shocked, I asked her what was going on, but she only told me to listen to her as there was no time for explanation. COnfused, I dressed up. just as I was about to ask her again for an explanation, a strange cylindrical device suddenly flew into the room from the window. "stupid kids nowadays" I thought, and I was about to pick it up and throw it away when Susan suddenly pushed me away. Before I could react, the device suddenly gave a loud poof and started releasing a green colored fume that made my eyes water, I frantically tried to get out of the room and only a few seconds later the fume was starting to make my eyes unbearably painful and I stumbled blindly out of the room, unsure of where to go. I felt Susan pull my hand and I followed her. after a long agonizing moment, I finally was able to see again, and I found myself on the first floor and to my horror, Susan was holding a P90!! Before I could say "what the fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ck" the windows suddenly were smashed and several men dressed in camo jumped into the room through the windows.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I instinctivly ducked behind the furniture as I saw the men were heavily armed. one of them had an automatic shotgun and he immediately began firing at me. Susan shot him with her P90 and threw a grenade at the other men, who immediately ducked for cover. the grenade exploded in an extremely bright flash and I was temporarily blinded. must have been a flash bang grenade, I've seen those things in Counter Strike. Susan pulled me out of the house and pushed a button and the house exploded in an inferno of fire. She jumped into my car and I followed in, confused and fightened beyond belief.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>She started the engine and started accelerating. Almost immediately I could see two black cars start chasing after us from behind. She shifted gear and accelerated faster and faster. I could see the speed go up to 100 mph and we were not even on a highway. I wanted her to slow down but the sight of the menacing black cars behind me stopped me from speaking.<br><br>finally we got onto the highway and our car went even faster, but the black car behind pulled up, my car was no match for the speed and acceleration of the muscle car. the driver pointed a pistol at my window just as Susan suddenly swerved at the last second and the shot missed. Just then the other black car gained up to us from the left and the man in side fired at the wheels of my vehicle. the Tire immediately gave out a sickening burst and out car started skidding out of control, but Susan somehow managed to ram the car into the black car and returned several shots at the man and he was shot on his head and the car turned violently and rammed into the other car, causing it to lose pursuit of us to regain control.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A while later, I still could not believe what happened and I was shocked stiff. I didnt not even realized my car had stopped until Susan told me to get off. It turned out that she drove us into a secluded wooded area. She told me we would be safe for a while and explained to me what had happened. which I was more than glad to want to know. It turned out that while working for a professor, I had accidentally seen some trade secrets. and these trade secrets were illegal and unethical. To prevent me from spreading the secrets. The company had hired Susan, who was a professional assasin, to murder me. All the online chats were a ruse to get me to trust her. I was speechless at this point, but Susan said she couldnt bring herself to kill me, and therefore breached the contract. as a result her employers were furious and hired replacement killers to kill both of us, what the F<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>uck. So  I was so totally pissed off at this point that I decided to take revenge by turning into a ninja. and I went around killing people with my ninja sword and kung fu moves. and after I killed everyone, I married susan, and we lived together happily ever after. f<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>uck this lame story.</div>

I pretended innocence and went along with his questions and answers, but as we chatted, I found he was sincere, so we exchanged numbers. SMS-ed for a week or so. It was intense. Then a week later, he wanted to meet. I had nothing to do so I agreed. Met him by my condo side gates and went for a walk by the beach. Talked for 2 hours or so. Met him this way for sometime before he brought me to Aranda, his usual hangout. Introduced me to drinks. Too bad I could drink. LOL. Then on one of those dates he told me he wanted to tell me something. I flirted with him and told him what was it. I already knew what he wanted to ask. LOL...</div>
