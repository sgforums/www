            <div class='col-md body'>One great news about Dubai is that you dont have to pay any taxes. Its basically a Tax-Free country. No income tax, no GST, not a dime at all. All in all its not that expensive. Compared to Singapore its much much cheaper. For Example, a nice trolley-full of grocery shopping would come around 100 Drihams (S$45).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Right now at Internet Cafe at Lamcy Plaza in Dubai. It's damn pretty good place. Arrived here on Brunei Airline transit in Brunei from Singapore. Damn!!! Waited 10 hrs at Brunei int'l airport for transit. Took an afternoon nap there before leaving for Dubai in another 7hrs flight. Plane fare cost S$600 two way flight.<br>It's hot and windy over here in Dubai. Temperature should be over around 35-42c. But don't worry. The whole city is air-conditioned. After 6pm onwards, the weather is terrific for outing.If you can withstand Singapore weather its no problem down here. Lucky its not humid like in Singapore.Hehehe. Made a tour around the city with my cousin. Its truly cosmopolitan city with skycrapers like in Singapore. Also saw the world's only 7-Star Hotel "Burj Al Arab". Looks huge. There are 91% foreigners and 9% is local emirate currently according to the latest news. There are around 200 Nationalities in Dubai right at this very moment. Seen Angmohs,Arabs,middle eastern dudes,asian chinese.<br>The chinese hang around in a southern Dubai city called the Dragon city (its sth like china town but only bigger). They got plenty of chinese shops there I heard. I haven't been there yet but I'll go soon.<br>The city is developing. Its a shopping and food paradise over here. Plenty of ultra-modern huge shopping malls with huge cineplexes. Some of them has about 6-7 cinemas in each. The big ones comparable to Suntec city. There are 5 of them. There are 5 big carrefours here. Said to be Carrefours' third biggest around the world.<br>Yesterday we went to see the nightlife in Dubai. The most happening place in the Gulf with plenty and plenty of pubs,bars,clubs,discos. This is where Singapore lose hands down. The entertainment scene is said to be changing everything. They got almost everything -pop,R&amp;B. funk, rock, jazz, trip-hop, etc etc. 2 nites ago we even went to the famous cyclone club. There are 200 hookers from all over the world at that big nightclub. Extremely pretty Arab hookers there with round bosom (felt so soft when touched) and voluptous body with porcelian looking skin. Even PRCs,Malaysian and Singaporeans hookers (only 3) are there. Too bad wasnt allow to take photos inside. Shit.Damn.<br>Yesterday morning we went to the Gold Souk (Markets). Its huge. Took some pictures there too.<br>In the evening while going along Sheik Zayed Road to Dubai biggest shopping mall called Ibin Battuta, saw many projects still under development. Saw two mega projects which will provide ski and snow related activities. The first one is the Mall of the Emirates (Ski Dubai) which is due to operate in September 2005 and the second is the Dubai Sunny Mountain Ski Dome, due in 2006. Both these Malls will include huge shopping malls. Ski Dubai is a great engineering feat, a 25-storey structure and the Middle East's only indoor ski resort and the world's third largest.<br>The mountain-themed resort is being built within the billion-dollar Mall of the Emirates, this will be the third largest shopping centre in the world after the Dubai Mall( which 5 times the size of Suntec) and the Mall of Arabia which will be at Dubailand (One gigantic Mall with theme parks the size of Orchard Road + Raffles place + City Hall + Bugis) both of which are still under construction. So the world number 1,2 and 3 shopping mall will be in Dubai.<br><br>Also passed by the Dubai Marina which a city with the city and also the Dubai Waterfront which is a conglomeration of canals and islands studded with luxury hotels and homes. Larger than the island of Manhattan in New York. It is expected to house 400,000 people and transform the last stretch of Dubai's undeveloped Gulf seashore. You will see plenty of Skyscrapers still under construction. Expected to be finished next year or the year 2007. The development and construction is very fast over here in Dubai.<br><br>Also pasted through the Dubai Media City as well as the Dubai Internet City which houses IT companies such as Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, etc etc etc.<br><br>Finally arrived at Ibn Battuta Mall, the Middle East region's largest themed shopping experience and probably Dubai's biggest currently. Not to sure which is bigger Dubai Deira City Centre or this. But one thing is for sure. Its as bigger as Suntec City or even bigger.5-6 Malls combined into one (Chinese Mall,India Mall,Egyptian Mall,Persian Mall etc.)<br>The mall houses a 21 screen Megaplex and the region's first IMAX experience all built to international standards with cutting edge entertainment technology, including automated cinema, wall-to-wall screens, stadium seats, full digital surround sound and an ultra stylish lobby. Took 4 hrs to visit walking the whole mall. Hehehe.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Visit to Dubai Continues....<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Again at internet cafe Lamcy plaza.Damn crowded place but fantastic.Finally got to use the computer. Visited the Wafi City Centre yesterday. Though very big it got nothing much to see. Mostly branded stuffs, resturents and a game arcade. The size of the mall as big as Takashimaya in Singapore. After walking around and losing my way...i finally managed an exit and flag a taxi. Said "Hello mate, pls take me to the famed Deira City Centre" . Taxi uncle said "Sure Sure" and off I went and reached the mall in about 10mins. Paid 9 Dirham (abt SGD4.50) and went inside the mall. Damn big sial!!! It got almost everything any mall would have. All the lastest merchandise, book stores,cinemas,virgin record store,huge game centre,many foodcourts..etc etc etc..and of course not forgetting carrefour and a huge ikea store. KNN, took quite some time to venture the whole place and finally got out after 3 hrs. Walk to the near by Deira Shopping Centre. Cheebye!!!! wasted my trip. This mall sucks and no way compared to the other modern malls. After that went back to my friend's place. Rested and off we went again to the Dubai Creek. Took a small boat across the creek. The boat owner wanted to charge us 80 dirham but went bargain and bargain until it became 35 Dirham. After that we went to Dubai's china town. KNN, the chinatown over there is overcrowded with indians. 90% indians, 10% cina. Damn fucking crowded with vehicles and people. Don't know how the chinese are surviving there. Most of the chinese there are PRC chinese. They looked very busy though. After going round and round that place, we went off. Relieved. Went back home for a good nite rest. Today we went to the Dragon City Mart. KNN, its gigantic sial. 3-4 times the size of Suntec city mall. Dragon Mart, the largest trading hub for products from China being developed outside the Chinese mainland, is taking its final shape at the International City development. Noticed many mainland chinese trying to set up shops. Did'nt see Singaporeans though. Only managed to walk 1/3 of the mall and gave up. Too big. Beside the mall, also noticed a huge long warehouse built like the great wall of Cina and also lots and lots of nice looking chinese residences built for them by the UAE government.Also noticed the laying out of the foundation of the Dubai International City. As for the International city, please see http://www.gowealthy.com/realestate/dubai/internationalcity/<br>cos I need to go off now to have my dinner and making my way towards the beautiful big milky porceline breasted arabic streetwalkers near cyclone club. Hehehhehe.</span></div>
