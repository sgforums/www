After the first child patient has been diagnosed with SARS recently, the Health Ministry has invoked the Infectious Diseases Act to isolate everyone known to have been in contact with anybody who is diagnosed to be infected with SARS.<br><br>So far, more than 740 people have been placed under "home quarantine" for the next 10 days(at least). These people will be covered by medical leave, and first offenders (people who disobey the Infectious Disease Act) shall be fine up to $5,000. (For more details, please see Straits Times 25 March 2003.)<br><br>Staffs are advised to take care of their health and to seek medical attention if they are sick. Staffs are advised to rest at home if you are given medical leave by doctors, as far as possible.<br><br>As a precautionary measure, we would like to highlight the following information, "Precautions on Atypical Pneumonia Disease" for all to take note.<br><br>Best regards,<br>XYZ<br>Manager, Human Resources &amp; Admin<br>ABC Company<br>Tel : +65 61234567 Fax : +65 67654321<br><br>Subject:	"Precautions on Atypical Pneumonia Disease"<br><br>The Health Ministry has asked all to seek immediate medical attention if you :<br><br>* have fever (&gt;38 degree C)<br>* followed by, or, together with muscles aches, headache, sore throat and respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness of breath or breathing difficulty;<br>* have travelled to Hong Kong, Hanoi or Guangdong province in China,<br>* are in close contact with persons diagnosed with SARS.
