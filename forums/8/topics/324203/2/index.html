              <p>The SingSpring Desalination Plant is a 20-Year Build-Own-Operate Project, undertaken by Hyflux for the Singapore PUB, to supply drinking water to the western part of Singapore. <br><br>This is Singapore’s first seawater desalination plant and was completed 3 months ahead of schedule in September 2005. With a daily capacity of 136,380 m³, it can meet some 10 percent of the nation’s water needs. <br><br>Hyflux undertook the design, engineering, procurement and construction as well as the operation and maintenance of the plant. <br></p>

              <p><br>Yes, Hyflux is a privatised, just like singtel, starhub, power supply, all are privatised with govt as the biggest share holders, it been around since 1990s, so govt sure to get the contract to build it. We call this type of company GLC&lt; govt link companies.</p>

              <p>Essential items such as food, water, electricity, phonelines are critical to a nation, it must be control by the GLCs with ex  minister,  MP or army officer as CEOs. It will be dangerous to the national security if it is run by foreigner as they may turn off all electricity, water or phonelines and start demanding for something.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just like transportation, SBS, it is a GLC, where the govt have control over it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Privatising it allow it to suit the market and people like us to invest in it, and more importantly if it takes away the image of Govt iron rice bowl idealogy so as to churn more profits and hire and fire does become a norm.</p>

              <p>Here's the simplest and cheapest water filter of all: nothing.</p>
              <p>Tap water in Singapore doesn't just <em>meet </em>health standards; it <em>exceeds</em> WHO standards. To give you an example, NEWater is already highly potable in itself. Yet what the authorities do is that they blend it in with reservoir water first before pumping it to homes, effectively doubling the amount of treatment that is necessary.</p>
              <p>There's absolutely no issue in our tap water causing potential health problems. If it does, it means that WHO standards are screwed up, and those companies selling flagrantly expensive home water filter systems are better off advising WHO on what they should do.</p>
              <p>If you're willing to fork out $1800 - $3000 for a home water filtration system, then all the best to you. I've been drinking plain drinking water right out of the tap all my life with no problems, and I'll continue doing so - without having to fork out all that money.</p>

              <p>I did my 2 1/2 years, and I water paraded with plain unboiled tap water all the way through.</p>
              <p>Heck, I went through Brunei, and I drank river water self-treated with chlorine-based purifying tablets. No one in my unit came down with any water-borne disease.</p>
              <p>Whoever wants to pay huge sums of money to further treat tap water which has already been treated to kingdom come beyond accepted WHO standards, let them do so.</p>
