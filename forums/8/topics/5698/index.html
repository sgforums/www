            <div class='col-md body'>Hata :<br>If life is not unpredictable, then it will be very boring. Life is not about destinations but the journey. You can philosophize the meaning of life in anyway you want, but at the end of the day, whether you like it or not, you have to live through it, because that is what you are meant to do. If you do not live your life, no one else will help you live it. That is the part, whether it is happy or sad, it is just you who have to carry on...<br><br>Just my 2 pennies worth...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well as prodigal said, "if life is not unpredictable, then it will be boring". How many of us will do things as usual if we know the future? If one knows that he/she is going to get good grades then will he/she still study hard? It is the process that is more important. We should enjoy the process of living life to the end which is ultimately Death. It is the uncertainty and anticipation of the future with the present choices that we make, that makes life fun.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The only certainty in life is uncertainty.<br><br>How do you want your life to be? Happy? sad? free or not? As human's, we are gifted the gift of knowing right from wrong, we are gifted the gift of laughter and weeping. I do not know of any other creature that has that gift.<br><br>Now a greater gift, the gift of choice, we are given choices. To be or not to be free. And when given the choice, we also have to give others the same. Some choose to be free, to choose whom they love, and also when and how they love, and as such they also have to allow the other the same choices.<br><br>Live life to what value that you place on it. And also give others that very same choice to live their life to the value that they place on it.<br><br>Sometimes we find that we do not do things because we are afraid of the "image" that we portray. What others think of us, that is our pride at stake. And there are times that we are too obstinate to change because we think that we are right and do not want to be corrected, now that is ego. What is worse, is when pride and ego go on parade, now that is arrogance...<br><br>What kind of life do you want? Our world is in our hands, Don't say that we are born into this type of family and we are "fated" to live like that. That is utter bullshit. The only thing that we cannot choose is who our family is going to be. Everything else is in our control. Who we want to be, how rich, how happy, who we love, what we want to do. but with each choice, there is a process to achieve it. And just because there is a process, it doesn't mean that it will ultimately be achieved.<br><br>The journey will reveal to you, who you really are. And what you are really made of.<br>Situations do not make a person, it reveals the character of the person.<br><br>Life! It can be an acronym for Living In Fear Eternally, IF we just go about blaming others or situations. In the middle of lIFe, there is a big "IF". Take charge of your life, We know not what the future holds but live it like today like the way it ought to be, to the fullest.<br><br>Most of the time, we regret not what we have done, but that which we did not do.<br><br>So don't ever regret ever living.<br><br>Have a great life, and wake up expecting great things to happen, always....<br><br>Derek</div>
