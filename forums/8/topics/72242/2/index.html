In order to understand the court's decision, you need to understand some background on how Macross was created and licensed to HG in the first place.<br><br>Macross was originally the brainchild of three men working for a small creative company called Studio Nue (pronounced new-eh). There, the original sketches for the Macross mother ship itself, Valkyries and other machines as well as principal characters were created in various forms between 1980 and 82. Nue naturally wanted to sell the idea for TV broadcast, but lacked the know-how to negotiate with broadcasters, merchandisers, sponsors, etc. to make it all come about. So in 1981, they turned to a company called Big West which was more experienced in the business part of animation, and it was Big West who eventually sold the idea for Macross to Mainichi Broadcasting and various toy and model makers later that year.<br><br>Once the project was approved and a broadcast slot obtained, it became clear to Big West and Nue that their animator contacts lacked enough production power to create the many thousands of cels that would be necessary in the time remaining before broadcasts were to begin. So in April 1982 they turned to Tatsunoko Productions (Gatchaman, Speed Racer, Mospeada, etc.), at the time one of Japan's top animation powerhouses, to do the actual artistic grunt work through their affiliates. The three parties worked out a payment agreement, and Tatsunoko went to work creating the show. Broadcasts began in October 1982 and ran for 36 episodes until June 1983.<br><br>During production, it became apparent to Tatsunoko that the agreed-upon payments would not cover their production expenses. The parties met again in October of 1982 and a "memorandum" regarding royalty income was negotiated. Part of this memorandum granted Tatsunoko overseas broadcast and merchandising rights for Macross.<br><br>Based on these rights, Tatsunoko Productions licensed Macross to Harmony Gold in 1984. The terms of this contract, including period and precisely what rights and responsibilities are imposed upon HG in their handling of the franchise are not known, nor is HG currently willing to reveal anything about them.<br><br>In response to Harmony Gold's threat of legal action, the lawyer for one retail store has asked HG to document their claim to the rights for Macross. HG's legal counsel refused to disclose these terms or any part of their contract, so HG is essentially telling stores "we have the rights to this show, but you'll have to take our word for it." Since they're demanding that stores hand over the "offending" merchandise, one would think that they would at least document their claim if they actually expect anyone to honor it. Should they attempt to sue a retailer for damages or impound their merchandise via a court order, HG will have to document their claim to the courts, so these details will probably become clear at some point. In addition, if they wish to block imports of such merchandise with the help of the US Customs Service, they will also need to thoroughly document their rights to the property first, as set forth in Section 603 of the Copyright Act. </blockquote><blockquote>Individuals close to Big West have commented off-the-record that Big West is furious with Tatsunoko and Harmony Gold's handling of the property internationally. Not only is Big West earning no royalties from the show's international marketing, but HG has never consulted Big West about creative or editorial matters related to the show. <strong>In other words, all of the editing and changes made to turn Macross into "Robotech" were done without the permission of the show's original creators.</strong> The same goes for HG's "Toynami" merchandise -- none of which was approved by Big West (or by Kaiyodo, the Japanese model company whose Valkyrie sculpt appears to have been stolen for the Toynami Valkyrie items). </blockquote></div>
