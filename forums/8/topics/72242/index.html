THEY PRODUCED IT for migration, to prevent what happened to Earth.) was captained by Maximillian Jenius, the top fighter plane pilot in the original Macross TV series. Thus, the story of Macross 7 was about when they explore new universal frontier. And that was the reason why Lynn Minmay was so fresh in their heads.<br><br>Macross II, Lovers Again, span out of Macross time-line and should be accepted as a sole product.<br><br>Macross Plus was a stonealone, talking about using of AI technology on planes (was a stepping stone for technology to build the unique VF-19 Basara Nekki piloted)<br><br>Macross zero happened somewhere before Macross TV BUT (SPOILERS BEWARE!!!)<br><br>Roy Folker wasn't supposed to have eye targeting system.<br><br>If you watched Kikou Souseiki Mospeada and Macross individually, you would have noted how much they twisted the stories for American audience that it became ridiculous.<br><br>While Macross is always about triangle love affair, mechas and songs, Southern Cross and Mospeada lacked those.<br><br>NOTE: THE STORIES ARE NEVER LINKED AT ALL.

THEY PRODUCED IT for migration, to prevent what happened to Earth.) was captained by Maximillian Jenius, the top fighter plane pilot in the original Macross TV series. Thus, the story of Macross 7 was about when they explore new universal frontier. And that was the reason why Lynn Minmay was so fresh in their heads.<br><br>Macross II, Lovers Again, span out of Macross time-line and should be accepted as a sole product.<br><br>Macross Plus was a stonealone, talking about using of AI technology on planes (was a stepping stone for technology to build the unique VF-19 Basara Nekki piloted)<br><br>Macross zero happened somewhere before Macross TV BUT (SPOILERS BEWARE!!!)<br><br>Roy Folker wasn't supposed to have eye targeting system.<br><br>If you watched Kikou Souseiki Mospeada and Macross individually, you would have noted how much they twisted the stories for American audience that it became ridiculous.<br><span style="color: blue;">care to share with us any parts that are twisted till it is ridiculous??</span><br>While Macross is always about triangle love affair, mechas and songs, Southern Cross and Mospeada lacked those.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">what about Dana sterling &amp; Zor prime, Bowie Grant &amp; Musica in Southern Cross, Scott Bernard &amp; Marlene, Rand &amp; Rook bartley in Mospeada.... there's not love?? there's alot of new mechas too.</span><br><br>NOTE: THE STORIES ARE NEVER LINKED AT ALL.

Alot of character of Southern cross and Mospeada are link to Macross.. e.g. Dana sterling of Southern Cross is the  daughter of Max and Miriya Sterling.<br><br>Gundam and Orguss and Macross are not even on the same storyline..if u want to twisted it.. just enjy yourself lor..</span><br><br>Earth was destroyed and they only restored part of Earth in the end together with Zentraedi help.

            <div class='col-md body'>tell me how some jokers got stationed in mars. I would love to know how come a group of forces got stationed there. Did they get stranded in mid space when they decide, "oh my aliens gonna come, let's stay in mars." And MOSPEADA was never never linked to macross. Worst still. Southern Cross timeline = 2120+ Tell me did they enjoyed time travelling? or did they not twist the timeline backwards and installed lots of stuff.<br><br>DEN where did the zentradi technology go, thrown away? So ZENtradi got accepted into earth and became human instantly and they clicked like there's no racial division. How politically correct. And with such enormous knowledge about aliens, how come the Zentradi become unable to comprehend the aliens that came to attack ? Did their database died due to landing on earth? Don't make me laugh, the timeline is wrong and the details within macross TV series ignored. moreover, being an anime by itself, mospeada's plot was thrown so to fit the two together. And soon, they will lose their motorcycles and go into fist fighting style and u'll get hokuto no ken. anyway's a battered earth's was hokuto no ken's main interesting point.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">In Invid Invasion.
