            <div class='col-md body'>i think with the property market prices being very competive, why not consider buying a landed property? you put in 100-200k more for bigger space, and freehold status. you can walk up to your gardern n clench the soil in your hand and say its my soil. haha. after 5-10years sell the place and make money.<br><br>some ppl prefer to have cash asset, but cash if you dont invest somewhere and you keep in the bank it will not grow.<br><br>just my humble opinion</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Living in condo is a sign of wealth and image? I have a fren who told me he chose a condo over HDB cuz he wants his kids to live in a better environment cuz condo is surrounded by walls fences guarded by security guards. His argument is he dun wan his kids to mix ard with HDB kids running ard under the void deck which he scared of bad influence. Woa kaoz such logic can appear in reality to justify purchase of a condo!!!<br><br>Living in HDB kids is considered inferior quality to living in condo kids?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
