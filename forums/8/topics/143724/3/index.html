            <div class='col-md body'>There are pros and cons to renting vs buying. But the key pro over renting is that at the end of paying for the rent for 20,30 yrs, u dun own anything. but of cos, u have the flexibility of moving wherever and whenever u want.<br><br>And of cos, if the market is picking up, u will not get to enjoy any capital upside. and if the market is going down, at least u wont have a negative equity issue. it's a trade-off thing.<br><br>but definitely the market is looking better, u probably won't enmesh in the same kind of negative equity situation like in post-97.<br><br>i always believe in living within ur means and be happy. if u r buying for ur own stay, by all means, buy it when u r young and can enjoy the facilities, or u want ur family to enjoy the facilities. having so much cash but having to compromise on ur living standards/dreams, also defeats the purpose!<br><br></div>

Assuming that you are abuot to retire and you need cash for your retirement. What you can do is sell your 1m property and downgrade to a smaller private apartment which cost around 600K. And there you go, you have 400K for retirement and a full paid 600K apartment.<br><br>Honestly speaking, I think it is kind of dumb to keep 810K in the bank and live in a 200K HDB. I think you might be better of to do the reverse and live in a 810K freehold property and have 200K in the bank.<br><br>On the other hand, do you have reason to believe that you will be like Person B if you continue to pay rental for the rest of your life? Why dont you use 810K and divide by your month saving, and then tell us how many years or century you will need to accumulate 810K in cash.<br><br></div>
