            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Today's ST papers forum section had two ppl writing in to condemn the SIA pilots over their dissatifaction in the "amendment" regarding SIA's policy for rest time "accomodation" for their in-flight pilots.<br><br>One particular comment stated was that the pilots shd not consider thermselves indispensable and thus shd not expect be automatically offered business class-std rest quarters.<br><br>Another stated that pilots shd not complain abt revealing their pressence to passengers in economy class as the passengers would be "thrilled" by their presence and welcome the opportunity to chat with them.<br><br>Hogwash...<br><br>To the first comment: Pilots are assuming responsibility over the 300 plus passengers on a plane each time they fly it. I agree totally that economy seats are extremely uncomfortable at times, squeezy at others. If the general passenger cannot get a satisfactory shut eye during a plane trip, how can we expect our pilots to accept the new arrangements? Is that too much to ask for? After all, i believe the reason SIA had this business-class-for-pilots-policy in the first place was to ensure adequate down time for their pilots. If they circumvent this policy now by making crucial adjustments, why not simply tear up the arrangement then? Re-allocating them to economy class is as gd as saying the policy is closed.<br><br>To the second: Pilots have been flying almost non-stop since they took off. Manning the flight instruments and ensuring the safety of the plane takes a great deal off a pilot. When it's time to rest, which pilot would give a rat's ass to the squirms of a passenger? (excuse the language but that's as close to the real thing as it gets) Which pilot in all his tiredness would want to accomodate a passenger's boring whims when his time is better served sleeping? The person who wrote this comment has absolutely no idea wat it takes to fly a plane....<br><br>i'm further surprised ST published these two dimwit's comments in the forum page. Better columns have not even made it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i think the straits times forums' job isn't to judge who's opinion is worthy of being published for whatever reason...they just have to let people air their different views.<br><br>as for the issue itself, i think its more of a matter of principle - sticking to the pre-arranged agreement that had been made with the pilots. i don't think the pilots are such a petty and spoilt lot that they would threaten industrial action over a (seemingly) trivial issue, although this is the impression i think the newspaper reports have given people in general. to be honest, that was the impression i got initially.<br><br>as for the concerns over security issues, i think that is valid only to a certain extent. who's to say potential troublemakers (terrorists) won't be sitting in the business or first class where its closer to the cockpit? i think an area set aside as a rest area solely for the pilots would be a far better approach.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I fully agree that proper accomodations shd be afforded to pilots.<br><br>However i do feel that sometimes, subjective comments shd not be published in ST's forum pages, seeing as how the details including a person's IC no. in short if so much trouble is required to write a column, accept good and objective ones, not the obvious harebrainers.......<br><br>one last thing, there was a last comment they wrote that i neglected: mentioned something abt using RSAF pilots to replace those disgrunted ones who refused to accept the new policy changes....gosh how ignorant some ppl get. Dun think i need to lambast that ridiculous remark.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yea i guess so....but maybe no one else besides those people had written in so they had no choice? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> don't worry...i've also read a lot of stupid letters written in to the straits times forums, and have responded a couple of times by sending in letters, but none have been published so far.<br><br>one example is this: http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=24475<br><br>well, no comments regarding using RSAF pilots to replace SIA ones. what can i say?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>anyway, the names of the people who sent in those letters were published together with their letters, so its not like people won't know who they are <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don think it's about the money only lor. Give them $200 also not enough. Seriously, the pilots need to get proper rest. Even though it's not like they have a whole lot to do when they are flying long-distance; the auto-pilot does _most_ of the flying for them, but you still need rest! And yes, the economy seats are freaking uncomfortable. I don't see how the pilots can get proper rest in them. Besides, there was an _agreement_ to give them business class seats. SIA shouldn't go around thinking that they can boss people around just because they are the employers and go changing contracts as and when they see fit. If a pilot breaks his contract, they take action against him. So now SIA is the one in breach of the contract, so I say industrial action is only fair.<br><br>And I fully support the two pilots that got sacked! Yes, I'm not saying that they were not at fault at all. But conditions then were so atrocious that it was a total setup. Airport lighting conditions were dogsh**. Weather was dogsh**. Granted, they should have double checked and triple-checked, but which pilot would have imagined themselves to be in a situation where they lined up on the WRONG BLOODY RUNWAY?? And then there is the concept of Open Reporting in the aviation business. Basically, if you f*** it up, 'fess up, share your experience, and don't f*** it up again. You DO NOT get crucified for 'fessing up. If you do, people will be unwilling to admit their mistakes, and unsafe practices or incidents will go unnoticed. Pilots will want to "get away" with whatever mistakes they make, and this will degrade aviation safety. Caveat: If the f*** up is due to outright negligence/laziness/incompetence, then yes, the individual should be punished. But in this case, I really think that the two pilots are not so.<br><br><br><br>-storm</div>
