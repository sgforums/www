            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday my travel agent at Ken Brothers Reliant Air Travel call me and tell me got special to go Scotland.<br><br>"Scot-land"? I ask. "Go there do si mi lan?"<br><br>He say, "Got castle, got church, got countryside..."<br><br>I say, "How come nowsaday you don'ch have any more special to nicer places, like Genting Highlands?"<br><br>He say, "Scot-land not bad what, I think you might like because all the Scots-man supposed to be boh cheng kor one."<br><br>I hear only, I stone five minute.<br><br>"Boh cheng kor? They really don'ch wear pants one? Why?"<br><br>He say, "I think maybe they drink too much the Scotch whiskey and need to pang jio more quickly. You ask me, I ask who? Go and find out yourself, lah!"<br><br>Then he say, "Some more I give you free Ken Bros. Reliant Air Travel bag."<br><br>I say, "Like that is on, lah!"<br><br>So I go Scotland.<br><br>When I reach Scotland, I oreddy know this place is condemn.<br><br>First, they all cannot speak properly. The capital is called Edin-burk, but they all say it like, "Edinbrur."<br><br>(I think, ah, all that whiskey make them all "brur".)<br><br>Some more their accent is si beh teruk, I hear also lia'h boh kiew.<br><br>For example, I went to the tourist office and ask, "Where can I find man who don'ch wear pants?" and they replied, (or at least I heard) "Rrruurrr rurrr rurrr hae noo rrruuurrr."<br><br>I just cannot understand how comes Singapore also is last time belong Engrand, but we spik Engrish so much better.<br><br>Anyway, so I have to K.L.K.K. around Edinburk. My book say I must walk the Royal Mile, which is this old street dating back to the 16th century.<br><br>I see all the old building only, I stone. If this was Singapore, ah, long time ago the URA would have come in and upgrade the place oreddy!<br><br>The whole stretch can be change into like Boat Quay like that - maybe got some classy shops, like Giordano or AA Fashion - sure nicer than all these lao pok building.<br><br>Scotland food is also damn hojjiber. They got this thing call "haggis", which is like minced spare parts boil in a bag. But no kway chap to go with it!<br><br>The only thing they do well is whiskey. (They call it "Scotch", but they call themselves "Scot". Why they anyhow stick a "ch" in words, I also don'ch know.)<br><br>Anyway, the whiskey is damn cheap compared to at home. Wah lau, the KTV launge all charge damn high for one small cup (but then, it comes with free hostess on the side).<br><br>So I buy a few extra bottles of Glenfriggit Triple Malt to give to the people back home. And another few to sell to the KTV Launge.<br><br>After drinking a bit more whiskey, Edinburk begin to look a bit nicer. Acherly, the city is not bad one.<br><br>The only trouble is, I cannot find the men without pants, as my agent said.<br><br>Instead got all these chao ah quah walking around in skirts. The ah quah here all got no standard, not like Desker Road one. Here, they all never shave their beard, neh'mine shave their legs! Si beh argly.<br><br>Singapore still better.<br><br>from <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com" rel="nofollow">www.talkingcock.com</a></div>
