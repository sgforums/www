            <div class='col-md body'>You can try harder to change, or talk and explain to her that it's tough on you, that it is your character. You will gladly be a listening ear to her instead. In a relationship, both parties like to be assured that the other is "responding", hence if you appear to be quiet or non-reactive, she may be worried or wish that you can speak up abit more. Try to understand why she says so, and have a nice discussion with her. Do not get tired of a relationship just because of such a matter.<br><br>Unless she doesn't understand you or screams at you when you're trying to explain, then maybe you both don't click. Why were you both together in the first place? What was the attraction if it's not the character? Don't tell me it was looks. If it is, that is what judging by looks can bring you to. Not knowing each other's character compatibility thoroughly will cause such things to happen later...</div>
