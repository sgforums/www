            <div class='col-md body'>BigDeal...assume that U are Malaysian. Look at what this Fascist PIG wrote<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>FuckMudlaysia4ever:<br>What make you so sure we will die without our port? For your dickless head info, the port is no longer our main ricebowl. We are moving ahead with times in research in biotech and other field. Unlike you stupid northern pig, only copy what we do....hahaha.<br>Was it moi who did not read the posting or was it you stupid a**hole who can't understand what was posted by some authors here. In no way, was raping ever suggested!! What they did said was exploring ways to increase the birth population.<br>I did not state that I believe that bit about mercs. I just said that at least we have the cash. Read between the lines....mud!! Palm oil does not last forever...stupid!!<br>Just as I thought...brainless, dickless and stupid. Spores can be used for penicillin....to get rid of stupid, harmful organism like you...mud.<br>Stuff a bamboo up your arse. I know people like you love getting it done to you because you northern pigs are weird.<br>Face it brainless..dickless...single cell amoeba....you suffer from a bad case of low self esteem. Mud for vegetables..more like mud for people to step on.<br>We don't shop in JB, JB complain. We don't buy vegetable from you...your farmer also complain. Wah...don't know who is dependent on who.<br>P/S: What happen to the supposingly copy cat "silicon valley". Hahaha..waste of investment. Malaysia boleh...only without worthless piece of mud like Mudlaysians.<br><br></strong></blockquote>[This message has been edited by Sudaimiki (edited 26 April 2002).]</div>
