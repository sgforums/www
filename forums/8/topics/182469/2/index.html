            <div class='col-md body'>This is bullshit.<br><br>Anyone watched the movie "Wolf Creek" recently?<br><br>The two girls would have escaped death if they whacked the villain while he was injured and unconscious on the ground. But no, they let him live and eventually he hunted the two girls down and slaughtered them like animals (actually worse than animals).<br><br>I am not saying that we should hit back at our attackers with the intention to kill. But, when you are being attacked and you gain some kind of advantage for a second, it is perfectly logical that you will try to make use of that advantage to further weaken your attacker SO THAT he is not able to recover immediately and ATTACK YOU AGAIN.<br><br>Self-defense doesn't mean just being passive and try to block every blow from the attacker (no human in this world can block every blow from anybody). You will get killed eventually if you let your attacker repeatedly assault you. Self-defense is trying to take away your attacker's ability to continue assaulting you, and sometimes the best way to ensure that is if the attacker is injured and stopped.</div>
