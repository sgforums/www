And that he continued to stab the attacker after he was down, which was considered an act to cause intentional harm.

Isn't it logical and reasonable to do that?<br><br>repeatedly stabbing the person, well for one he is in an agitated state and probably not in a good state of mind after being attacked and probably hurt. secondly isn't making sure the person cannot hit him again a reasonable act? even  if that guy is hurt, he can still hit him.<br><br>supid laws we have.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It doesn't mean that you don't have to be punished if you kill someone out of self-defense. That's manslaughter not amounting to murder.

[/b]</blockquote>Even if the adrenalin rush cannot be proved,why should the benefit of doubt not be given to the initial victim of an attack not due to his fault<br><br>He had undue advantage (weapon)?lol that is 2 guys vs him alone. That extra guy does not give the pair undue advantage? And they were the attackers meaning they were mentally prepared to harm the guy,so they were mentally prepared for the event and thus more aware of their actions.When you are more aware of your situation,that itself is a huge advantage<br><br>The defendent on the other hand had never being mentally prepared to harm that person and he acted on the spur of the moment in fear of his life.<br><br>His intention to harm cannot be proven under a intented stated,but in the rush of the moment,he is likely to just want to protect himself at any cost. Have you never heard of the saying that when a beast is wounded,it is at it most dangerous state cos it will not care and give its all to defend itself. Why would a human under that state not do the same.<br><br>It is precisely cos the attackers did not think or cared for the consequences that is why they attacker the person,so they should bear any consequence if anything happen cos of their action.It is their own damn fault.So if anything happened,they should bear the blame of their action,not the guy who was attacked.<br><br>The person who attacked him commited no crime? Hello you attack a person with intention to harm him and he commited no crime.So one day someone on the street raise a parang and try to chop on your head,this person has committed no crime.What the hell are you talking about.<br><br>The whole incident started cos of these 2 person,so any fault must be on them if anything happened. If this is not so,i dread to think what society we live in when everyone can suka suka attack someone and they are not wrong.<br>Maybe you will like to live in such a delusional state but i am sure no one else would</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The person who attacked the deceased which sparked off this incident was a different person, not the defendant. Why isn't the police after him?<br><br>You can talk about the defendant acting on the spur of the moment, the lawyer did argue this point. But you can't argue that killing someone is ok, what message will the judiciary system be sending to society if the defendant goes unpunished?<br><br>As for undue advantage, even if it was 2 on 1, the one with the weapon has the advantage. No matter if the weapon was a knife or a gun, as long as it is capable of inflicting more damage than bare knuckles, it is undue advantage.<br><br>Besides, this case is not new. The defendant had been in hiding for 2 years.<br><br>I'm not saying it's the defendant's fault that he was mistaken for somebody else and had to defend himself and in the process, killed his attacker. He was just unlucky.<br><br></div>
