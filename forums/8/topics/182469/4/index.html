            <div class='col-md body'>The rest of the newspaper article will explain better the concept of self-defence:<br><br>QUOTE<br><br>What if you kill to protect yourself?<br><br>CAN you walk away scot-free?<br><br>Lawyer Amolat Singh said: 'The judges would look at the amount of force and the means used to defend oneself.<br><br>'If a man punches me with his bare hands and I take out a parang and hack him to death, the force I use would be disproportionate.'<br><br>Mr Amolat said the judges would also assess what the defendant was thinking when he committed the act.<br><br>Issues such as whether he had meant to kill the other party would be taken into account.<br><br>'On hindsight, we may think it was rash to stab the other man in self-defence. But sometimes you don't have the luxury of time to rationalise your actions,' Mr Amolat said.<br><br>Lawyer Subhas Anandan said: 'Nothing is an offence if it is done in the exercise of self defence.<br><br>'But if you had the time to call the police, then your actions can't be justified as self-defence.'<br><br>UNDUE ADVANTAGE<br><br>Mr Anandan said the actions of Neo Eng Kiat exceeded the right of self defence.<br><br>'He had undue advantage as he had a weapon and acted in great cruelty as he stabbed the other man repeatedly.<br><br>'So he couldn't invoke right of self-defence.'<br><br>Lawyer Kertar Singh, who defended Neo, said everyone has the right to self-defence.<br><br>'But you also have to consider the circumstances. In my client's case, he stabbed his attacker repeatedly after the latter fell down.<br><br>'So his actions were beyond self-defence as there was definitely an intention to cause injury.'<br><br>During the trial, Mr Kertar cited similar cases where defendants received light sentences of between 3 and 3 1/2 years after killing someone in a fight.<br><br>One was the case of cleaner Katun Bee Ibrahim, 56, who was jailed 3 1/2 years on 6 Jan, 2004, for culpable homicide.<br><br>During a fight with her lover G. Subramaniam on 13 Jan, 2003, Katun fatally stabbed him in the abdomen after blinding him with chilli powder.<br><br>Another case was of durian seller Lim Boon Seng, 40, who was jailed 3 1/2 years on 27 May, 2004, for culpable homicide.<br><br>During a fight with loanshark Keng Yew Cheng, 42, on 5 Nov, 2003, over a $1,800 debt, Lim fatally stabbed Keng in the chest.<br><br>UNQUOTE</div>
