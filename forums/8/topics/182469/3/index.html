Naaaaah. I'll slash...hang on... is the arm a vital part? The veins seem quite big. Oh...right...only on the outside of the forearm...NOT the inside...and Never longitudinally...don't want to cause too much damage to the veins...wait a minute...He's not playing ball! He just keeps coming at me...maybe a stab..no ....slashing his torso would be fine...wait...f<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>uckin' hell...he just never gives up...How about his legs...nope Big artery in the thigh...Arrrgh...now i've gone and lost the fecking knife...greeeeat...wait...stop stabbing me!<br><br>You get what I mean.  Only thing to learn from this episode is: You are only allowed to use as much force as is neccessary to protect yourself. Once there is no longer threat or you are allowed to run away, RUN.<br><br></div>

You will get killed eventually if you let your attacker repeatedly assault you. Self-defense is trying to take away your attacker's ability to continue assaulting you, and sometimes the best way to ensure that is if the attacker is injured and stopped. </div></blockquote>Agree.
