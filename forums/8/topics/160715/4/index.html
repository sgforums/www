            <div class='col-md body'>I'm trying to say that, instead of telling u y things can be done tat way, i can also say y things cannot be done in other ways, so  as to eliminated the wrong choices until the 1 correct method is left. in this case, it is good to use this method, because there are only 2 conditions, green <strong>or</strong> red. Pls continue reading to understand...<br><br>so, by saying <strong>IF</strong> C was the one wearing green hat, A and B will still rasie their hands, coz <strong>A saw B wearing red</strong>. and <strong>A saw C in green</strong>.<br>similarly <strong>B saw A wearing red, and saw C wearing green</strong>.<br>So, A will know B is raising his hands becoz of him(A), coz C is in green.<br>and B will know A is raising his hands becoz of him(B), coz C is in green.<br>So both of them (A and B) will walk out because they know their hats are red.<br><br><strong>BUT BUT BUT BUT BUT, A and B didn't walk out! Which means C must not be wearing green! he is wearing red coz there is only 2 colors, either green or red!</strong><br><br>i have tried to explain in my fullest capabilities...<br><br>well... is it better now??    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>thx for ur attention!<br></div>
