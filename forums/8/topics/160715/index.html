            <div class='col-md body'>hi! this is an IQ question. my teacher asked it today and she asked us to think about it. i'm very fed up coz i have been thinking for 2h and i'm sure i have heard this question before...argh! so please help, yes? thanks! ^^<br><br>A, B and C are in a room. they are each blindfolded and a hat is placed on each of them. they are told that there are red and green hats. after the hat is placed on their heads, they are unblindfolded.<br><br>they are asked to put up their hands if they see a red hat, and leave the room if they know what's their own hat colour.<br><br>it happens that all 3 are wearing red hats. naturally, everyone put up their hands.<br><br>but C, being a more thinking person, also derived his hat colour and thus, walked out of the room.<br><br>the question is, how did C know his hat colour?<br><br>ok. so that was the question.<br>please do not anyhow add in that the room got mirror or window or what.<br><br>also, this is an IQ QUESTION, NOT A TRICK QUESTION. so don't say things like C went to ask A and B what is his hat colour.<br><br>happy solving! ^^<br><br>urm. i just post my answer here ar.<br><br>hey everyone! this is the correct answer! Fatum also has the correct answer. yeaps yeaps. i've discussed it with my boyfriend just now. AND IT IS LOGICAL. let me rephrase this answer...hopefully you all will understand. ^^<br><br>ok...<br><br>let's say A wears a green hat. all 3 hands are raised.<br>in B's view, he can see that A is wearing a green hat. therefore C is raising his hand due to B's red hat. therefore, B can deduce logically that C is raising his hand towards B's red hat. so B will leave the room.<br>C himself would also see that he is wearing a red hat (same viewpoint as B) and leave the room.<br><br>next scenario.<br><br>let's say C is wearing a green hat.<br><br>All hands are raised as well.<br><br>In A's view, he is raising his hand because he saw B's red hat. he also takes notice of C's green hat. A can then safely deduce that B is putting up his hand because of A's red hat.<br>In B's view, it would be the same as A's. they would then have already leave the room, having known for sure that both of them (A and B) are wearing red hats.<br><br>HOWEVER.<br><br>A and B did not leave the room. they may be hesitating because they do not know for whom is each raising their hands for.<br><br>therefore, C can safely deduce that C himself is wearing a red hat in order to cause such hesitation.<br><br>get it?? hehe. interesting right!<br>yay! next week i can hao lian to the teacher. hahaha. kidding. ^^<br><br>if u dun understand, can go read pg 3 and 4 of this topic...most answers by different ppl are found there. ^^<br><br></div>
