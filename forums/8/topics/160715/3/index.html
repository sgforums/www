Since they were told that there are green and red hats.<br><br>Take for example, when A sees B raised his hand, it could implies that C is wearing red hat, and when A sees C raised his hand, it could implies that B is wearing red hat. As for A himself, he sees both of them wears red hat. So he would think that he himself is the one who wears a green one.<br><br>What gives? All three would be thinking the same.</div>
