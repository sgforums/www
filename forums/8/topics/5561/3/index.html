            <div class='col-md body'>Correcting the "not-so-good" traits is one thing. But who's to say what's good and what's not good? Barring the more obvious cases of course.<br><br>What you perceive to be a bad trait might not really be one. Take the example of the girl who said she was contemplating breaking up with her bf, just because the bf downloaded a picture of this actress! Gosh! She actually felt that a matured guy will not have crushes on actresses and stuff like that. Is that an undesirable trait? Or the bf's wish to surf porn once a while.. is that highly undesirable too?<br><br>We must learn to draw a line between what's undesirable and what's tolerable. You can't change a person just because you see something that you don't like. Especially the more controversial traits. After all, perceptions vary from people to people.<br><br>Reality is a matter of perception, or as some would say, perception is a matter of reality.<br><br>Cheerio!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahahaha...<br>Swiftwing : I personally won't deem it a 'fatal character flaw' as u call it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Too many guys share this addiction with u. If the female population were to condemn it, don't think there would be many of us attached at the end of the day, right? heh:b<br><br>Yes, Enigma, u're darn right to say that it's difficult for us to judge whether a trait is considered 'not so good'. A compromise has to be reached through a calm talk before anyone tries to correct anything. IMO, the thing about not allowing someone to have crushes on actresses etc, is something I won't do to my own bf. Such things are just too hard to control. It's all in the mind. The worst thing is, he may hate me for it in the end &amp; our relationship would suffer. So well, the best thing anyone could do would be to settle down for a peaceful discussion &amp; hopefully, derive the most satisfactory solution for the problem.<br><br></div>
