            <div class='col-md body'>Can't help but notice that a lot of the male population who come to post their views here are highly cynical about the prospects of finding someone to love for real.<br>Could this also be the real reason why they are posting messages here on this site instead of  being somewhere out there with that special someone?<br>There has been a fair amount of gal-bashing in some of these posts, typifying them as materialistic, superficial creatures.<br>Let's face it, I'll admit that not all girls are perfect. I have a lot of friends who put material needs above a real relationship, no doubt causing much hurt to the many embittered guys posting cynical messages here. However, think of the poor women who have spent their youth being with someone whom they thought was their true love, only to be dumped by him for a younger, prettier female specimen.<br>Guys. think for a moment why you are on this site...You're here to check out the babes too, right? So while you're at it, why don't you take a better look at yourself before you think that gals are superficial? It's sad, but true that looks really do matter. I've got ugly freinds who have hearts of gold deep dow inside but are ignored by the male population and I've known pretty gals with problems in the character department but the male population worships them anyway.<br>WHY?<br>No one is perfect, but somewhere out there, there may be someone perfect for you and to go through life without ever being able to say" I have loved"<br>is truly sad.<br>What kind of guys do gals want? Personally, he doesn't have to look like an Adonis, he doesn't have to be nearly as tall as I am, he doesn't even need to love the things I do, just as long as he loves me and I love him and we feel good when we aer together.<br>So here's my question: What kind of gals do guys want?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To answer your question Fionagal, I would say that your description of how a couple should be together is very apt....indeed as long as he loves you and you love him that's what really matters, and not other more materialistic or superficial things.<br><br>To brand me as a 'cynical' guy is not really too far off.....sometimes I wonder why I feel and think this way too, while most of my friends go about life not even caring about such matters ? Just to clarify too, it's my exams that make me stay at home and post such messages instead of dating =)<br><br>Not to digress any further, the kind of girl I like is as such:<br><br>Physical : She should not be taller than me (I am slightly beliw average for a guy), hopefully long hair but as long as it suits her face it's fine, no requirement for perfect figure and has to LOOK like a girl (meaning no butches or tomboys !). Spectacles are optional.<br><br>Character: She should be kind and not malicious, helpful and compassionate (to make a lovely wife). She should be humourous too as I cannot tolerate a girl who cannot laugh at good (or bad) jokes. She should be slightly cynical and know how to suan because that is what makes us question life so much. Being considerate and faithful is also very important to me, I wouldn't like an over-possessive girl or one who flirts around. Finally, and most importantly, she has to love me for who I am, and not only what I can offer her.<br><br>Lifestyle: She should not smoke, drink or gamble (I don't do all these too so it's fair to expect my girl to be like that too). Hopefully she is not one of the "cheong" type who hangs out at discos and pubs a lot, because then she probably cannot give up the lifestyle in order to settle down. She should never flirt around shamelessly especially if we are already steady.<br><br>Hobbies: She has to love music....any form will do as long as it's not crappy boy bands ot irritating J-pop. I can appreciate that people have different tastes and I am willing to accept classical music too (although I am an 80's English music fan). She should preferably play a little sports too but without is fine (don't mind fair or tanned girls). To drill down to the nitty-gritty, her hobbies don't have to coincide with mine too much as long as we enjoy each other's company.<br><br>Attitude towards life: Let's just say that I am not like one of those men featured in the Straits Times 23 Oct 99 about being single and successful in career. I wish to have a loving wife and children to make me life complete. Therefore her sentiments should suit mine too (or else how to get married ?).<br><br>Does this sounds like a lot ? Well....this is just the really detailed version of what I hope to be my dream girl. let me make it clear that of course no such girl exists, and probably if one fulfills just 40% of the requirements is sufficient for me.<br><br>As I reiterate again, all I want in life is someone who loves me for who I am, and I can appreciate her for who she is too; I am willing to sacrifice most of what I have to find such a girl.<br><br>Hope this would answer your question sufficiently fionagal and I wish you well in whatever you do !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would have to be one of those girl bashers. Quite a fervent basher too, but I know it's really unfair.  So i apologize to the female populace for any inconsiderate words said, but I think that all in all it's more of a discussion than anything else.<br><br>In retrospect, it used to be girls bashing guys for being screwed up...oh how the tables have turned. -just a thought.<br><br>Musicwhiz, ur idea of the ideal girlfriend is really...ideal. at least u know urself that it's an unrealistic request.  Girls exist independantly of their spouses or bf.  Even attached, they will sociallise, and so will guys.  U might not want to hear this, but it's quite natural for people to flirt while they are still attached or married.  It keeps life interesting...  Or else it becomes a prison instead of a relationship.  It boils down to the idea that you can let her go out whenever she wants, but still trust her to be faithful and still find time to spend quality time with you.  And yes, everyone has fantasies about other people, so there should be a lot of understanding on both sides.  When I hear people tell me that they never find anyone else attractive after they get "hitched",... I find it hard to believe. Or maybe they just don't want their partners to get hurt...?  The idea is to never hold onto your love too tightly because as they say, " the harder u squeeze, the faster they run"  areally crude way of putting a really eloquent quote.:-)<br><br>Fiona, you are definately right about women who stay with guy for many years thinking that he's the one only to have him find a younger girl.  It's especially painful to women as they get older because of their age.  Most people don't want older women. as can be seen, most men prefer younger women, so an older woman who gets ditched will have a harder time getting on track again.  And unless she's already an independant person, she would have been dependant on the guy for support financially and most probably emotionally.  Hmmm.  U just opened a door for my mind.  Thank u.  As a man gets older, the more attractive he becomes to the female species.  While women are more attractive when they are younger. ( which isn't neccesasrily true, but people believe it).<br><br>If a person wasn't of a steady mind, he/ she could become insane talking about this subject.  :-)<br><br>Don't think too much, if u feel for a person, and they feel for u.  The scene is set...But then again, u must meet that person first.  which is probably the hardest part for guys.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just a mild observation: what *is* this thing we have with height? Why is there always an automatic need for the girl to be shorter than the guy? Why are we so disgusted by height disparities in a couple?<br><br>Virtually everyone who has expressed their ideal partner has brought up the issue of "height"... I was just seriously wondering.. is there any practical reason? I mean, good looks and money may be materialistic but I can understand those factors.. but height??<br><br>Anyway, back to the point. I think it's hard to stereotype what a guy wants from a girl. Definitely there are some guys for whom looks aren't *that* important(although it's always a factor, whether to a greater or lesser degree); same for girls. Generally though, guys and girls with looks have definitely an edge up insofar as selection is concerned... interestingly enough people with good appearance tend to be(not all), IMHO, a bit deficient in the area between the ears. I suspect this is due to the fact that, if you're good-looking, life treats you well and you don't really need to develop a great personality or intelligence to get through this world.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Of course, if you can have all three, you're a gift from Heaven, and if you still can't get attached with those, you deserve to be shot.<br><br>Fortunately, the time for males comes when we reach middle-age. Our attractiveness value doesn't decrease as exponentially with age the same way women do... as someone once said: "Men are like wine; they become finer with age; women are also like wine: they turn into vinegar." Another one of those "sad-but-true" generalities of life we're dealing with in the nature of human relationships.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This forum is truly intriguing and I must say I agree with Fiongal. What puzzles me is the mention of this bizarre simile<br>"Men are like wine; they become finer with age; women are also like wine: they turn into<br>vinegar."<br>?????*Snowfairy looks puzzled*<br>And what's this about guys becoming more desirable when they age? *totally stumped*<br><br>I assume you must be talking about older men with lotsa $$$$ as opposed to younger ones who take a longer time establishing themselves and gatherting the $$$(ever heard of women going after old men who are poor? No right? Chances are, they will go for the matured corporate/businessman types who can provide)... Like Fiona said, it is sad but there will be some materialistic women out there but hey, don't generalise, will ya?<br>Take heart guys, it's not too hard to find your special someone yet and though it may be rare to find an attractive gal with character to boot, hey I'm living proof that they do exist!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well all you people, since we're on the topic of height, let me share some of my personal thoughts on it.<br><br>Firstly, I have to mention that I am NOT tall...in fact for a 23 year old guy I am about 166 or 167 cm and most girls would consider that short or average (depending on the height of the girl of course !).<br><br>Growing up in a world where most people are taller than you serves only to "push you down" (literally !). It seems tall people especially guys are sought after by most Singapore girls including those who post messages here (no reference to any girl in particular). Most claim their bf should be about 170 or 180 even !<br><br>So by the process of elimination, I guess that before they even get to know me as a person, I have already been "struck off" their list of potentials....correct me if I am wrong.<br><br>It's the first impression of meeting someone that counts (as I think someone had mentioned somewhere on this forum - the first 90 seconds) and probably as I graduate and go out to work in 9 months time, I would be meeting numerous new people and interacting with new faces. Imagine if the females all had this kind of first impression: "Oh...gee...he seems like a nice chap but sadly he's only 166 cm...what a pity" or else they would be thinking that he is nice as a friend but never as a husband because it won't look good on them ?<br><br>Frankly, that is how I feel about girls most of the time and since quite a few of them are taller than me in University, this feeling always seeps in to knock at my confidence.<br><br>In a way, Firewire's confidence is encouraging because maybe he does not have any physical features which may cause him to lose faith in himself.....well the same cannot be said for every guy unfortunately.<br><br>To end this, just to say that height is not a big issue to me as long as the chemistry is there....but often I have asked myself "Even if I don't mind a taller wife, would she mind a shorter husband ??"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheers everyone !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the most basic thing about having the ideal girls is sumone who u can really communicate with and trust.<br><br>Age, height, figure, need not matter, but lets face it, the world is realistic. To find one who fits well into ur description of being the ideal girl is not so easy.<br><br>Therefore, the criteria for sure things like age, is limited to not more than =/- 5 years. The height? Not more that +/- 50cm.<br>The figure?( I do not want to sae, but to me, as long as the girls is pretty I dun mind......)<br><br>This is what i think is happening nowadays.<br>So much for having a perfect society.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just like to add my over-valued ringgit into the height controversy....<br><br>Height is one of those qualities that adds to the attractiveness of the male populace to the opposite sex.  It's an added bonus, If I may say.  If u have it, be glad, because whether u know it or not, it can make a difference...<br><br>"...Tall Dark and Handsome.."<br><br>For Asian women, I think that the dark matters less than the other two(tall, handsome).  It doesn't matter who penned the phrase, but a lot of women support this line of thinking...<br><br>I (and all u other's below 2m should also) blame those damn romance novels for creating this myth...and hollywood, who basically makes these books into film.<br><br>With names like:<br><br>Romance under the Stars, or<br><br>Lusting for Fabio...<br><br>They should be ashamed of themselve,.,.:-)<br>I think that non of us here is going to come riding on a white horse to rescue some beautiful damsel from her boresome boyfriend while she's sitting alone contemplating her perfect man on the beach as the sun is setting.<br><br>Oh the horror if we all had to live to this expectation...Anyway, i'm off topic, but I'm Just glad that most women don't think like this...pheww..(wiping the sweat from my brow..)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The sad thing is whether for guys or gals, looks matter. To put it in a blunt way, people who say that they don't go for looks are probably those who don't have looks themselves. It's not 100% but i believe more than 50% of the people do go for looks whether they themselves look good or not. Most people nowadays only bother to look at the cover of the book. Not many actually bother to know the content. At the day's end, you got to have a good cover(looks) to make people read your book(character &amp; personality). I really admire people who don't go for looks when looking for a bf or gf. I may be wrong or naive to say this but even as a guy, I feel that guys tend to go more for looks &amp; girls tend to go more for character.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well Fries, I guess you're lucky to be 184 cm at least that puts you on the Notify list of many girls here !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> (Does irc ring a bell ?)<br><br>As for Unicorn, I dislike the comment you made that said "dun always think of gers"...after all this is a discussion board and giving opinions should be the right thing to do. Crying over spilt milk is not a good phrase to describe my situation. If you'd like more details please feel free to Email me.<br><br>For general opinions on height and other physical traits, I would say that height is the very FIRST thing that strikes anybody (unless that person had a severe acne problem !).....so it's unavoidable that it becomes a motivator for repeated discussions on this forum. As what the Japanese guy said, it's true that guys go for looks and girls for character.<br><br>A study had actually found that guys are turned on by sight and smell, while girls are more turned on by sound (sweet tongue) and touch (girls are more sensitive to touch maybe because hey have more receptors under their dermal layer ?). Does anyone care to clarify this ? If this was true, it would explain why girls could never understand why guys always ogle at pretty girls and guys could never understand why girls fall for a sweet-mouthed Ah Beng.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Another thing to add here may sound very "Biology", but I feel that pheromones may play a part in sexual attraction too. For general information, pheromones are chemical "scents" produced by one sex which drift along in the air and supposedly "attract" the opposite sex.<br><br>What's my point here ? Well.....all I am saying is that women may be exuding this pheromone when the use certain types of perfumes, which may make men find her more desirable when she walks past them and they take a whiff of that intoxicating smell.<br><br>From a ladies point of view, it seems that the body odour of some guys can act as a natural pheromone to "snare" girls (No kidding !)....<br><br>Any comments or opinions on this people ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers and take care !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pheromones. I heard of those.  They're supposed to be able to attract, but they said that for humans, the scent isn't powerful enough and that the recieving party isn't sensitive enough.<br><br>They say this, but I can swear I can sense it.  My senses are usually quite sensitive..not saying I'm superhuman or anything, but when I pass by women and their backdraft air as they pass by makes my head turn...Most times it's automatic and unconscious.  It sounds perverted, but the next time u walk by a woman, take a deep breath (not the deep exhagerated kind)...slowly and deeply, and try to figure out if it does it for u.<br><br>The scent of awoman really does it for me.  Depending on the girl, sometimes, if they sweat a lot and I am near them, even their BO (body odor) can turn me on.<br><br>as strange as it may sound...anyone feel the same?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*just thinking aloud*<br>i wonder if many people realise that when they are attracted to someone, they are subconsicously drawn to the person b'cos of the way the latter carry themselves? Personally, i think that if u are able to carry yourself well, you would be attractive to others in your own *unique* way. (cliche but true.Read the example below)<br><br>Now moving on about the issue of heights:<br>If u look at fashion spreads, u would realise that stylists usually tend to prefer taller models to parade on the catwalks.<br>Why? This is b'cos it has been percieved that tall girls are able to carry themselves better and this inadverently helps them to promote their clothes.<br><br>In conclusion...<br>being tall is an advantage as it helps u to carry yourself better?<br><br>U decide =)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But the chap must know what to do with that height.  For women, I thinkt hat their posture is a lot better than men's...must be fact.  Just go to Orchard or anywhere else swarming with nubile young things and u'll notice the way they stand and walk.  They have beautiful postures in Asia. Believe it or not, A lot of western women don't have very good postures...or it just doesn't seem like it to me.  I might be a bit biased there...anyone can comment on that.<br><br>That's why taller girls especially are hired as models, because their height portrays that posture very well, to an exhaggerated state even.  U'll rarely see women with bad posture, but I guess if u really got nothing better to do u can go and try and find them:-p  I don't know who would want to waste their time doing that.<br><br>Guys, on the other hand, are sloppy by nature.  I'm almost tempted to say that we're born sloppy...oops just said it...:-)<br>U can compare the guys and the girls on the street and u will see slumping differences...literally slumping...<br><br>I've got some tall friends..well not really, more like acquaintances,...and they are slck like hell in their posture.  I swear I'm almost their height.  If they stood up properly they'd be swaggering studs, but for the slouch....<br><br>I'm guilty of the same slouch. :-) Jeez, I'm just full of sins aren't I...hah hah.<br><br>So height can only make a difference if u know how to use it properly.  My younger brother said something to me once that never left my mind...<br><br>"Whatever u wear man, u make it look really sloppy."<br><br>He was reffering to the way my tuxedo looked messed up on me.<br><br>Case in point....But it's by nature really...back me up here guys....uh,...guys?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now the issue is about height &amp; posture. What I can agree is that the height of a guy does work a bit like a magnet to a girl. I mean it does make you more noticable among the crowd doesn't it? I stand at 1.89m so I know because I seen girls looking at me everytime I'm in town (due to my height of course, not my looks). Posture wise, I must say our girls really know how to carry themselves well. I should say they're very concious about how they look &amp; behave in front of people. Guys.... well simply too 'honest' or should I say you're being to true to yourself. Sometimes, just have more poise rather than behave so raggedly with your friends. Guys can also be very attractive as long as they can carry themselves well but PLEASE don't act cool or stylish. It's going to make you look like a clown.</div>
