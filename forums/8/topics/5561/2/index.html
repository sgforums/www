            <div class='col-md body'>Guys and gals,<br><br>Let's not be apologetic about this issue, gal bashing or guy bashing, I think what we have here is an intellectual exchange between adults who can think for themselves and are not afraid of speaking their mind. why is it that criticism automatically becomes bashing, we are just trying to share what we think is happening out there, if it is wrong, we will get reminded, if it is right, we get reminded too.<br><br>End of it all, it is a choice we make, if we dig this gal or guy and they don't give a damn about our existence, we move on (this is personal experience, me spend 1 year on this gal and at the end of it all, she told me I wld make a great boyfriend but not the type of boyfriend she wants now) Incidentally, we are still good friends but u guessed it, the effort has toned down which may open up another topic, why guys are more attentive when courting? The answer is simple, so gals pls take note, it is very tiring for the guy to sustain the effort for long, perhaps that explains why we are in the short sprint, we are not flirty as some gals claim but we just know the effort involved and if we know it cannot work, why push it. So gals, next time u want to berate ur steady for the change in effort, ask yourself, can u sustain that in the long run. A relationship is about sharing not a supply and demand cycle.<br><br>As always, this is a great forum with this meeting of minds and the Govt dare say we cannot think....<br><br>------------------<br>By Chance we meet,<br>By Choice, we become Friends...Make that Choice</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We have to admit that exterior "packaging" matters alot in real life. I mean look at it this way, if there is a gorgeous looking babe or a suave looking gentleman walking somewhere out there its bound to make heads turn and take a second look at that specific individual. Everyone have their ideal expectations of what they really want in their idealistic partner but sadly to say this, most of the male gender friends I know tend to fantasize having their girlfriend as some pretty gal with a great figure.<br><br>People tend to comment on how others look or appear and many would prefer someone who got the gift of looks good or looks better than an average person. Why? Maybe because its like having a valuable item in your showcase and it boosts the individial's ego whenever someone comments about how pretty or handsome your other half looks.<br><br>As for the view on height that most viewers pretty a shorter girlfriend then themselves. Personally I would prefer someone around my own dwarve like height (166cm). One of the reason being that if shes taller then me and shes wearing high heels or platforms, I'll be staring at her chest half the time. And its not very nice when someone tells you to stop glaring at her body when you aren't doing so. Heheh.<br><br>My expectations for the ideal girlfriend is not too high.<br>1. She must be caring and show kindness<br>2. She does not have to be anywhere near pretty looking.<br>3. She must be able to accept me for what I am.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your question is easy. Most guys will probably say that they want someone who is good looking, gentle, rich(maybe), tall with long hair(also maybe), ideal figure, etc..<br>Well, as a matter of fact, that's quite true but like you've said, we guys gotta check ourselves first coz I believe there's no such thing as 'beauty and a beast' kinda theory!!<br><br>Anyway, as for me, all I really want is a girl who will really like me for what I am and not What I have coz that will then strengthen our bonds together as one! She doesn't need to be very good looking, rich, etc. Someone who care and concern is a big bonus!!! You may think I am so noble but I meant every word.<br><br>Hope I've assist in your query.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just my two cents, if a female is constantly trying to reform you or change you then probably you aren't the one they really want. Perhaps they could not find their Mr. Right and just have to settle for someone closer or more alike to what they have in mind then slowly mould their investment into what they really want.<br><br>If truely so, the person lacks discipline and morales</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>secrets,<br>i suspect dat this 'obsession?' of guys wif long hair stems from the observation dat gals with long hair tend to be more pretty?<br>or should i rephrase dat into pretty gals tend to haf long hair? either way i tink dat guys have the idea dat if the gal has long hair there is a higher chance of her being prettier??dis is one hypothesis<br>the other hypothesis is dat long hair makes a girl look more feminine, thus making her more attractive to guys in general?<br>hope it helps.<br><br>------------------<br>Your Rights Will Be Read At Your Funeral - Max Payne<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>interesting comment.  guess it has to do with the society's standard of "ideal" beauty (read: slim, long-hair, big eyes, fair complexion).<br><br>unfair, yet so very true isn't it?<br><br>&lt;rapunzel, look what you've done! mesmerised guys for so many centuries.&gt;</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this discussion is coming down to physical stuff ! There isn't much to talk about, we know both sides have high expectations, so buck up, let's hit the weights for one year and see how much we've improved. Then I think we got an edge over some 90% of competitors. ( The problem is - that is a disciplined lifestyle )<br><br>A long list of requirements is very dangerous, you'll end up with nobody. Nah, just keep it simple. Mine is "believes in God". The rest can be worked out in the relationship.<br><br>So, it is true the gf's will try to change the guy, to become a better man? Well, you can see it that way, or you can see it as she cares for you and is trying to help you.<br><br>Why not just say what you don't agree about and explain why you don't agree? I'm sure that's acceptable to her.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, there may be an inadvertent wish to make a bf closer to our ideal "prince charming", when we attempt to change them.<br>But it isn't always our aim of doing so. The most important aim is to help the guy become a better person overall. Having a partner means not only physical, but also emotional and somewhat mental attachment. If his not-so-good traits can be corrected, both parties would be saved from further pain &amp; unhappiness. This helps to boost a relationship as well. Stronger bonds &amp; a greater appreciation of one another can be formed.<br><br>He hurts, I hurt. He's happy, I'm happy too.<br></div>
