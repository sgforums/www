            <div class='col-md body'>Has anyone ever used <a href="http://www.shaw.com.sg" rel="nofollow">www.shaw.com.sg</a>?<br><br>That is not a rhetorical question for the website is so badly designed, i really want to know if anyone has ever used the website to buy tickets or browse movie showtimes.<br><br>The first thing that strikes you is the design. The website looks like something a 12 year old whipped up using Frontpage during recess 5 years ago. The colour scheme - OMG - the colour scheme is striking not only literally but also for its complete lack aesthetic value.<br><br>And then, after you get used to the assault on your senses, you realise that things don't get any better. Try browsing movie showtimes and you are asked to register. Why would any webmaster want you to register to browse movie showtimes? Again, that is not a rhetorical qn because I really want to know. Coz, you know, I thought websites were supposed to help a company draw customers as opposed to driving them away. Perhaps there is a method to this madness that my puny mind has not yet been able to  grasp. So webmaster, get in touch!<br><br>Anyway...So, you survive the assault on your sense, you've calmed down enough to register (and you're too stupid to go to <a href="http://sg.movies.yahoo.com/" rel="nofollow">yahoo movies</a> instead) and you try to book a ticket using the website. That is when your computer will start emitting odd noises and your browser becomes non-responsive. Yes. They are using Java. Again, WTF??!!<br><br>So let's recap: The web design hasn't changed in years, it looks like it has been made by a 12 years old, it pisses you off and it well it pisses you off somemore. The qn every sane man would be asking himself is "why dun use i www.gv.com.sg instead of this sorry excuse of a webpage?"<br><br>My belief that the world is full of retards is, yet again, affirmed. Good bloody morning everyone. I think this is going to be a beautiful day.<br><br>PS: Webmaster, if case you can't be arsed to read the rant above, the conclusion is this: www.shaw.com.sg is about as useful as a chocolate teapot.<br><br>PPS: i realise that there might be some inaccuracies in my review of the website above. There is in fact a <a href="http://shawonline.sbmedia.sg/upload/1schedule/daily-schedule.htm" rel="nofollow">link</a> that allows you to check movie showtimes without logging in or registering. Allegedly. Because, you know, THAT LINK IS NOT WORKING.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ponders:</div><div class="quote_body">isn't Eng Wah worse?<br><br>i booked online before. When i reached Eng Wah, they told me they got my booking but not payment information.<br><br>So i gotta pay again on the spot but at the same time they issue a receitp for me incase eng wah double billed me.<br><br>They did double bill me and got the refund 3 months later.</div></blockquote>Me understand your problem...<br><br>Eng Wah Online system is using a decentralised booking readback system, which means the booking isn't centralised at the server but at their various cinema locations...<br><br>As the system is active inline with their over the counter sales, the application is very resource-extensive as it will fight the processing power and strains on the processor in the server...<br><br>When the server is "generating and processing" your request, other factors like over the counter sales, website browsing and simultaneous online booking up to 10 users allowed, will create a bottleneck in the dataflow, thus sometimes creating scenarios of double booking, non-registration of payment transaction through the payment gateway, non-issuance of booking even with payments...<br><br>Different Eng Wah cinema locations use different bandwidth for the ADSL service, including the main server host... Thus there's another bottleneck created from the data distribution at the main server...<br><br>Hope this information helps..</div>
