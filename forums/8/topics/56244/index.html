Yeah!!!<br><br>Yeah!!!</span><br><br>SEPT 5, 2003<br>Reply by police on plasma TV sets baffles me<br><br>I REFER to the reply by Mr Phillip Mah of the Singapore Police Force, 'Plasma TV sets more practical at police HQ' (ST, Sept 2).<br><br>His justification for the plasma TV sets was that:<br><br>TV sets screening national and crime-prevention messages serve the members of the public who are required to wait for an average of 15 minutes.<br><br>It is more 'practical' to have two large plasma TV sets than several small ones.<br><br>Even private corporations such as banks are cutting cost and not providing TV sets and chairs in their lobbies for crowds standing in queues for more than 15 minutes. Why does a non-profit organisation such as the police need to be different?<br><br>I do not understand what is so 'practical' about the large plasma TV sets. If members of the public want to watch the screenings, they can sit closer to the smaller TV sets. However, I am sure most will not care about the TV programmes when they are in the police station.<br><br>I had hoped that the police would admit that it was a mistake and promise to review all future spending.<br><br>On the other hand, I was not surprised to see the justifications by Mr Mah - a typical public-service response to criticism.<br><br>TAN CHEE YONG<br><br>THE police are using the Volvo V70 XC as a patrol car. Do we need such a costly and luxurious car for routine patrol duties? Is this justifiable in these times of economic hardship?<br><br>The police may be able to provide some insight into this choice of car.<br><br>DARRELL TAN YUAN CHING<br>Copyright @ 2003 Singapore Press Holdings.
