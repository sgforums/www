But you will be able to converse only because they are in a specific setting and outside that work setting it will not work anymore. Secondly the reflections and learning will also be faulty as they are reflections based on a specific work setting and untransferrable to other settings with other women. Thirdly the parfume thing is really really too made up and unreal. Who will pull it off? I imagine none. This whole article is too dreamy, completely out of touch with reality.<br><br></div>
