            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>With all these ramble jamble of USB, ISDN, Broadwidth and everything else mumbo jumbo, I would like your opinion (whoever whom cares to say) about which service to use? I would like to have something way faster than my current 56k modem but would like to have something reasonably priced. So, which one do you think is the best? SCV, or Magix from which ISP?<br><br>Ohhh I'm so confused. Would someone care to enlighten me with which has the best price, service, and the connection? Thanks</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have just missed the Magix promotion for the 256K USB modem, Magix would be a good solution since it offers bandwidth to yourself and I think it's on a leased line.<br><br>For cable modem, it offers shared bandwidth so if your entire block is using cable modem, the speed would be slower than a 33.6K. That explains why the monthly charges is $96.<br><br>You will have to weigh the two to decide which one to go for, you need to pay some fee for installation of hardware and the modem i guess, SCV will loan the cable modem to you and the card(i not too sure about that).<br><br>Some URLs to get more information <a href="http://www.magix.com.sg" rel="nofollow">http://www.magix.com.sg</a>  <a href="http://www.singa.pore.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.singa.pore.net</a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Magix sounds great, but then I've noticed that there is an increasing number of people who are dissatisfied with the service and that the quality has gone down tremendously since december. But even if I choose SCV (which is cheaper), what Macca says is true, if there is alot of people sharing the same connection, the speed would be wayyy slow.<br><br>Still, having to fork out $180 for the modem and I think about $150 for the connection, that sure is alot. I guess I have to wait for some oncoming promotion, huh?<br><br>Just as an info, my mom was clearing out her closet and an invoice from 1997 slipped out. It was an Aztech 56k modem for $175. I can't believe I paid that much for a 56k modem. What with the prices now dropping to just $30 for the same thing (yesterday in the newspaper classifieds). Woah, I wonder if hi speed modem would be that cheap in the coming years?<br><br>Ok nuff of my ranting</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>:It is not dedicated bandwidth.  Instead users shares a pooled resources, thus making it similar to SCV<br><br>Really?? Now theres a point to ponder. So I guess have to do abit of mathematics to figure out which is the better deal. SCV is like 1.5 MBPS (I think) while Magix is like 256 kbps. Anyway, Lets just wait and see if the prices could get more reasonable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>VDSL? hahahaaaa....I love to try that!<br>It is still a long way before Singapore public will have a taste of that kind of speed! ADSL is suppose to be able to support up to 8Mbits while VDSL is able to go up to 52Mbits! So what feel the difference?<br>If you can afford the kind of money, go for T3 connection but I don't think it is available in Singapore coz Singapore Internet backbone is running on T1 if I didn't remember wrongly.<br><br>Someone from the Semiconductor industry told me that he foresee VDSL taking the world by storm! It will be better than cable. He told me that certain company/organisation had stop the research on cable and switch to ADSL as they cannot see the future in it! Hmmm..hope I remmeber his words correctly!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> No flaming pls!<br><br>Selena:<br>If you can really wait for Starhub, it will be good coz they will be out soon, just under 2 months! The we will have a good price war with one more competition which will be benefical to the consumers. PacNet do has ADSL access but they cannot clearly tell me the kind of speed they offer and the hardware needed!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Hmmm, when did you buy that modem? $175 is really very very exp!
