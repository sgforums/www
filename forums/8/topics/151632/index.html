            <div class='col-md body'>Against all the authorithan rule and scums dynasty<br><br><img src="http://browndailysqueal.com/archives/Keyser20Soze2003.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">He's supposed to be Turkish. Some say his father was German. Nobody ever believed he was real. Nobody ever knew him or saw anybody that ever worked directly for him. But to hear Kobayashi tell it, anybody could have worked for Soze. You never knew; that was his power. The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.<br>One story the guys told me, the story I believe, was from his days in Turkey. There was a gang of Hungarians that wanted their own mob. They realized that to be in power, you didn't need guns or money or even numbers. You just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn't. After a while, they come into power and then they come after Soze. He was small-time then, just running dope, they say. (We see all of this in flashback) They come to his home in the afternoon, looking for his business. They find his wife and kids in the house and decide to wait for Soze. He comes home to find his wife raped and children screaming. The Hungarians knew Soze was tough, not to be trifled with, so they let him know they meant business.<br>(Flashback: Hungarian cuts one of the children's throats)<br>They tell him they want his territory, all his business. Soze looks over the faces of his family. Then he showed these men of will what will really was.<br>(Soze shoots two Hungarians, then shoots his children and his wife as the last Hungarian watches in surprised horror)<br>He tells him he would rather see his family dead than live another day after this. He lets the last Hungarian go, waits until his wife and kids are in the ground, and then he goes after the rest of the mob. He kills their kids. He kills their wives. He kills their parents and their parents' friends. He burns down the houses they live in, the stores they work in. He kills people that owe them money. And like that, he's gone. Underground. Nobody's ever seen him since. He becomes a myth, a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night. "Rat on your pop and Keyser Soze will get you." But no one ever really believes.<br>(We see a shadow-encased figure of Keyser Soze walking towards the camera in front of a huge tower of flame as Verbal speaks about the process of revenge.)<br>Agent Kujon: Do you believe in him, Verbal?<br>Verbal Kint: Keaton always said, "I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him." Well, I believe in God -- and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is from the film "The Usual Suspects" released in 1995.<br>The character in the film has somewhat attained underground cult status because the Soze character itself was a made up  alter ego for a simpler , cunning unassuming criminal who is similar.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Flash-backs and flash-forwards a la Pulp Fiction capture the action of the story told to the police by one of the criminals, Verbal (Kevin Spacey). Claiming that the five men were threatened by Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the lawyer of the devil Keyser Soze, Verbal says that they were forced to pull off the high risk job or else their loved ones will be killed<br><br>The twist in the plot is that nobody knows who Keyser Soze is. So the question that the criminals, the police and the movie audience ask is "WHO IS KEYSER SOZE?"<br><br>Verbal insists that he is a Hungarian drug lord who let his family be killed rather than surrender to an opposing drug force.<br><br>In revenge, Keyser Soze killed the families of the men who threatened him. He is never seen by anyone again, yet he continues to communicate through his lawyer.<br><br>I refuse to give away the answer to the question, "Who is Keyser Soze?" Every audience member has to try to figure out the mystery for themselves. Only in the last minute of the film is the answer finally revealed</strong></blockquote><a href="http://www.yaledailynews.com/article.asp?AID=8740" rel="nofollow">http://www.yaledailynews.com/article.asp?AID=8740</a></div>
