Conside this:- Afer 10 years in service (new contract), and you decide to look for new work opportunities, with the "10 years work experience" in army who will hired you? Hired you to teach them about military tactics,etc? In fact, where can you find a job that can equal the pay they give you in the army after 10 years in service.<br><br>That is why people say:- When you sign on, you sign on for life.<br><br>So do think it over first, ask yourself is this kind of life suitable for you. I recommend you watch the TV show "Boot Camp" on 5, I think it is  on Tuesday or Wednesday (can't remember which day) at 8pm and see if you can take that kind of life.</div>

They have onboard allowances. Aircrew have flying allowance.<br><br>If you sign, make sure you sign for life as the years in the force will not be considered as working experiences when you want to joing the public sector unless you are a technician and joins ST.<br>If you sign those 10 years contract, what will you do if your contract is not being renewed and your are just in your mid/late twenties, you still have a long working life from there you know.<br><br>THINK CAREFULLY</div>

But still left this job. The experience inside is really nil if u want to work in the outside world. As they said if u are unable to go to the second phase of the plan ( that is after 10 yrs) than u have to get other job. By than ur age will lose out to others, ur experience level is zero.</div>
