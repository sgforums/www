Perhaps he can tell that the shows suck by looking at the title  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyway fellow forumers, whether the shows suck or not, it is a subjective opinion... Maybe for the minority of u guys here think that it sucks, but results have shown that Ch8 and ChU are still 2 of the most popular channels around, and that their drama serials and varierty shows have drawn in a significant amount of viewers... Everyone is entitled to their opinion, hence even if u dislike the programmes, it does not mean that they suck, perhaps your taste juz dun fall in with the majority...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> So let us be more ojective over here on a public channel and not make pure blatant attacks?</div>

I'm sure that if their budgets allow, they would love to have better ads too and do away with so-called cheap and low budget ads (Ads have got nothing to do with the TV stations. The TV stations merely sell the air time)... And what is wrong with old faces? As long as they still can act well, I dun see the problem.

            <div class='col-md body'>Over the last 4 years, I watched more serials and variety shows at Ch U than i did Ch 8.  It has given us "Zhen Qing", "Nan Qing Nu Ai", "Jie Da Huan Xi" good TVB serials. Whereas I think Ch 8 has given us crap/boring local dramas. But Ch 8 also has its strengths -- its documentaries like "jiao Dian", "Jia Chuan Cai" etc and news are better-made. So we can pick and choose.  In any case, consumers always benefit from competition. As consumers, we shld mourn that the Singapore media scene is taking one step backwards in welcoming the Monopoly system back again.</div>
