Â“Think about it and the brain, how it works, how it thinks and how it functions. The creator who created this is the only one that is deserving of praise and gratitude.Â”<br><br>OÂ’SullivanÂ’s mother, Maria, said her son was not yet ready to speak about his conversion and was concentrating on snooker. Â“Prince Naseem has been a good friend to Ronnie,Â” she said. Â“He has been the main factor (in the conversion). Ronnie is a lot better in himself since he converted. I hope it will steady him.Â”<br><br>OÂ’SullivanÂ’s persona is one of a troubled genius. As a precocious talent, he achieved his first snooker milestone Â— the 100 break Â— at the age of nine and at 15 became the youngest player to score 147, the maximum break possible.<br><br>As he progressed towards the top of his sport he achieved his triumphs against a background of family problems. His father was given a life sentence for murder in 1991. When he was 17, his mother was jailed for tax offences, leaving him to fend for his younger sister.<br><br>As he grew older, partying, alcohol and drugs took their toll, and at one time it was feared his excesses would ruin his career. His biggest coup came in 2001, when engaged to Bianca Westwood, he won the world championship despite being drugged up on Prozac to cope with depression. The relationship, however, collapsed.<br><br>Ahmed Versi, editor of The Muslim News, said OÂ’SullivanÂ’s conversion could be explained by a yearning to fill a spiritual void. Â“There is a spiritual vacuum in the West,Â” he said. Â“With so much materialism, Islam is now providing the spirituality that is lacking.<br><br>Â“While Christian leaders seem prepared to give away their spiritual values and accommodate secularism, Islam remains constant.Â”<br><br>Ali remains the most famous sporting Islamic recruit, converting in the early 1960s shortly after becoming world heavyweight champion.<br><br>Then Cassius Clay, he announced that he was a member of the controversial Nation of Islam organisation and later changed his name. It is understood OÂ’Sullivan will also be given a Muslim name.<br><br>It is not, however, just the world of sport where there have been high-profile conversions. The singer Cat Stevens converted in 1977, changing his name to Yusuf Islam, and the British socialite Jemima Khan converted when she married Imran Khan, the former Pakistan cricket captain.<br><br>The sons of three public figures Â— the former BBC director-general Lord Birt, the former health secretary Frank Dobson, and Lord Justice Scott Â— have also embraced Islam.</div>
