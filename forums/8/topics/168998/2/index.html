I would say that's a lot of improvement as compared to previously where there are no air-con, no lift and open access to everybody.<br><br>There's always complains about perverts lurking in female toilets. So this added security is itself worthy of the hike.<br><br>I stayed in hall 2, hall 9 and hall 11. Hall 9 and 11 are more expensive than hall 2 but obviously they are better (newer too). So no complains from me at least. But in those halls, there's no lift and I actually stayed at the top floor. So a lift would be really good.  </div></blockquote>I'm not sure whether you read your bills properly. Or maybe you belong to a more SENIOR generation of NTU Grads.<br><br>After renovations, Hall 2 had the largest rooms and the highest bills, especially when compared to halls 8 through 11, which were designed by the same architect. The hall also had the luxury of adjoining toilets.<br><br>Hall 11 underwent a change in hall management after i left and the new management improved many things, among them, they provided a cleaning package for windows, blinds and mosquito netting during the off-peak periods FOC. They also added hot water dispensing units on every floor, changed the room tables to better ones and swapped all the shower heads to more durable types.<br><br>If people were made to pay for hikes, these would be the gestures a resident would expect. And these were done <strong>WITHOUT</strong> an increase in costs at that time.<br><br>Electronic cards vs keys wise, i still don't see the merits since keys work just fine and electronic cards are still not entirely fail-safe. A lift would indeed be welcome, but it isn't a necessity.</div>

I just don't understand why. Most of these students are Singaporean who already have a place to stay in Singapore, some of them even stayed quite near to NTU. So in the first place, they don't even need to stay in the hostel. Anyway, nobody forced them to stay in the hostel. If they are not happy with the rent, they don't have to stay there. Why all the fuss about this?<br><br>To put everything into perspective, the hostels here are actually very cheap as compared to those in UK and many other places.
