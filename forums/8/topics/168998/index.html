            <div class='col-md body'>I read the news regarding the students' unhappiness over the increased rental of hostel. I just don't understand why. Most of these students are Singaporean who already have a place to stay in Singapore, some of them even stayed quite near to NTU. So in the first place, they don't even need to stay in the hostel. Anyway, nobody forced them to stay in the hostel. If they are not happy with the rent, they don't have to stay there. Why all the fuss about this?<br><br>To put everything into perspective, the hostels here are actually very cheap as compared to those in UK and many other places. So don't complain.</div>

So if they feel that the rents are too expensive, then stay at home lah!<br><br>If there's demand, the price will definitely goes up. If they stopped staying at the hostel, leaving many rooms empty, I am sure they will lower the rental again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sometimes when you stay in hostel, it helps you such that you can do ur FYP all the way till 1-2am, then walk back to hostel and wash up and sleep by 2:30am, wake up next morning 9 or 10am.<br><br>gives you more time to study for exams, do projects etc.<br><br>Anyway in order to FURTHER NTU STUDENTS' CREDIBILITY on the overt pricing, maybe they can compare NUS hostel pricings against NTU's.<br><br>Then, hopefully it gives them more ground to negate the rise of housing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah lor. With so many good things, why complain so much? Want fresh and want cheap oso. How can?<br><br>Anyway, I don't think the petition will help lah. If the petition can lower the price, then maybe the entire NTU should petition to have free hostel. So I think they just have to take it or leave it because I am sure there are many more students who didn't meet the room application 'criteria' but don't mind paying the little bit more to stay in the hostel.</div>

So if they feel that the rents are too expensive, then stay at home lah!<br><br>If there's demand, the price will definitely goes up. If they stopped staying at the hostel, leaving many rooms empty, I am sure they will lower the rental again.</div></blockquote><strong>But like I said, I believe more than half of those students stayed within one hour or so journey from NTU. So if they feel that the rents are too expensive, then stay at home lah!</strong><br><br>that is just what u think... i stay in chua chu kang, it takes me 1.5 hrs to go to ntu due to it's ulu location... imagine the ppl staying in the east who goes to ntu, it is very very troublesome... so many ppl who cannot afford still opt to stay in hall coz of the time and distance it takes to go to ntu. raising hostel fees just make it more expensive for students... i believe they raise the fees becoz they feel the hall has an inelastic demand, students still have to stay hall even if the prices are higher now.. which is why students are complaining.. they have the pay whether they like it or not...<br><br>compared to nus, it is at the better location, going to school is more convenient than ntu. having higher prices is okie, coz those who can afford to stay will stay in hall, those can't just take transport to school.<br><br>in ntu, if u stay in the east, whether u can afford or not... most of those east ppl will have to stay hall... if they raise the fees, it just adds to the burden of the students.</div>
