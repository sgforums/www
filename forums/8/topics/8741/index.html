            <div class='col-md body'>This is the speech that I eagerly anticipate every year, the National Day Rally. Always thought that our dear PM is able to provide that inspiration and portray that fatherly image to us all with his warnings and ideas and definitely, his sense of humour.

            <div class='col-md body'>How about the second mention of Phua Chu Kang in two years??? His mention was used wisely as a bridge between two very different issues, of education and of a new endowment fund for corporates.<br><br>The underlying message was that one should continue with the learning process even after their formal education years. He highlighted that one can even learn English from Singlish and ever since Phua Chu Kang's last mention, Phua Chu Kang's English has improved, although not to the standard of Gurmit Singh. This brought about laughter from the crowd.<br><br>But I really thought that the structure of the speech was very nicely crafted out and the different components of the speech was very nicely bridged with such examples.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Moose, then why is the PM concerned that the Mahadrasahs is unable to compete with normal primary school in terms of the educational contents?? There was a special emphasis on Mahadrasahs students taking the PSLE, having to obtain the minimum credits in English, Mathematics, and Science. The PM also said that the present pool in this Mahadrasah thingie will not increase as there is already enough to suit the needs of the Muslim.

            <div class='col-md body'>The PM also mention that most people are staying single, and people are getting married later and later in life. What do you all think are the reasons for this???<br><br>For me, I think that the main reasons are the high standard of living, which means the "exhorbitory costs" involved in getting married.<br><br>Also, the existence of NS. People usually think of marriage (may be a sweeping statement) only after they are financially secure. But with NS, for a normal person like me, I would only step into society at the age of 25 (provided I don't go on for further studies), and with rigid career advancement structures in many firms, what age am I expected to get married??? What do you guys think that age would be???

            <div class='col-md body'>One point that I noticed from the rally was the PM's unhappiness with an article in the Straits Times, on a cleaner surviving on $133 a month, stating that this article started off a debate on the widening income gap in Singapore. He used this opportunity to clarify that the cleaner surviving on $133 a month doesn't mean that he earned $133 a month for the average wage for a cleaner is $850 per month. With this specially brought up in an occasion like this, it makes me wonder what turbulences there would be in the Straits Times meeting rooms.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Revelations : In Mahadrasah schools,there is more of an emphasis on islamic studies than other subject and also becos school hours are limited,PM Goh may be worried that becos of this reason,Mahadrasah students can't really do as well as those in normal school due to their added emphasis on islamic studies,but there are a few mahadrasah students who have proved him wrong.As now there is a shortage of students attending mahadrasah's schools,there is no need to create more school as nowadays malays tend to put their children into normal school than Mahadrasah as compared to the past.<br><br>There is no correct age to get married,it's only when you think you are ready for it,for some,it could be 25,other it could be 35?Anyway i think the cost of living is getting higher,but of cos not on par with other countries like Japan although we are getting there.Somemore with both sexes working and our government encouraging us to make learning a lifelong process and with our work schedules,it's no wonder people nowadays have no time to raise kid,let alone make love.Not forgetting that now raising a kid in singapore is almost a commpetitive sport in itself where you have to pay for computer lesson,preparatory lesson before primarcy school,swimming lesson etc etc and what have you and it's no no surprise that nowadays,people dun reallly wanna hae it's as it will mean a great sacrifice both financially and in terms of lifestyle changed and even if peopla have kid,it will be 1 or not,not 1 whole brood like our parents time,ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Makan begins with a drool, grows with a chomp, ends with a burp.When you were born, you were hungry and everyone around you was full.

            <div class='col-md body'>On career choice, one occupation which seems specially lucrative was that of a teacher. With the recent mass salary rise for civil servants, further rewards were promised during the rally so as to attract and retain quality teachers. So for those who have just graduated, go be teachers, hehehe...... not a bad choice.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Teachers now are grossly overworked from what i can see from a teacher friend of mine.Also teachers have to deal with unreasonable parents who think their little darlings can do no wrong and even shield their kids from anywrongdoing,now teachers do not only teach,they bao ka liao,they take care of collecting school fees and also other ECAs.Then if the school is siao onz and wish to improve it's rating,the teacher will have to conduct extra classes during the holidays.Now teachers do not primarily teach as in the olden days,they more like pao-ka-liaoer.No use employing more teachers if they cannot be retained,the gov must make teaching a more condusive environment,then even if there is no pay rise for teachers,people will still wanna be a teacher,ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Makan begins with a drool, grows with a chomp, ends with a burp.When you were born, you were hungry and everyone around you was full.

            <div class='col-md body'>On the widening income gap in Singapore, PM Goh mentioned that compared to developed countries like the US and UK, the bottom 10% of Singaporeans were no worse than that of developed countries. He also mentioned wages as a reward for talent, and that the widening income gap was due to the insurgence of greater talents, etc. How convincing is this part on wide income gap???<br><br>But I have to agree that we should not take wealth from the rich and give to the poor to achieve the aim of income equality, and that the education is the main solution to this income equality issue.
