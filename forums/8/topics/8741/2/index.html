What do you all think are the reasons for this???<br><br>For me, I think that the main reasons are the high standard of living, which means the "exhorbitory costs" involved in getting married.<br><br>Also, the existence of NS. People usually think of marriage (may be a sweeping statement) only after they are financially secure. But with NS, for a normal person like me, I would only step into society at the age of 25 (provided I don't go on for further studies), and with rigid career advancement structures in many firms, what age am I expected to get married??? What do you guys think that age would be??? After considerations of all these.<br><br></div></blockquote>hmm... marriagable age... i think that depends like most things do...<br>take 2 similar achievers (wage) with different expectations of an ideal family (includes condo, car, no. of kids and the like)... the one with a less 'costly' goal will naturally marry earlier ... say at 27 compared with 29... this of course simplifies all lot of other factors eg. the 2 same income earners are able to find their ideal partner by the time they can afford setting up a family...<br>If you are looking for the expected age, which should be the same as the mean age at which people tie the knot... assuming most people are rational, and therefore set their expectations not too far from most people around... I'm afraid I don't know that magic age... &gt;..&lt;<br>The best guys to consult should be the statstics department in the registry of marriage. &gt;..&lt;<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i got only one word to describe the act of the govt on the fertility rate.....'DESPARATE"....the govt must have realised that this trend cannot continue adn something got to be done!!!!....although the govt cannot pass a legislation on marriage, what the govt can do best is to create an environment for more birth rate...i think the schemes are generally good and attractive...but as what PM Goh said, he can't ensure the success of the scheme!!!! i really wonder how many families will respond positively to the govt proposal!!!</div>

A good point brought out by a member of the opp party(forgot who it was) was that public servants' motivation to serve the country should stem from selfless patriotism, not material gains.
