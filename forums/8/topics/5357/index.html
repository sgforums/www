            <div class='col-md body'>How do you guys find about living in Singapore? Everything from studies, lifestyle, work and old age.. do you feel that we are a restricted brunch of people with little room for doing something out of the norm.<br><br>Say if you screw up somewhere along your academic path, chances are you would not likely to end up in a local university. There is seldom an alternative route if you didn't do well in O level and had to do a private course, only way out would be an oversea education. There is still a good future for these people but what about those who can't afford it but possess the ability to excel in a particular field.<br><br>In term of lifestyle, what can we do in this small island and maybe the couple of tiny islands surrounding us? Sometimes when life is too hectic and if you wanna find somewhere nice to relax and admire the scenery or the beauty of nature.. what are the options available to us or those in the lower income group.<br><br>Working life is also not easy, most probably even worst than army and school life (schooling is still the best, trust me). Perhaps the saying of if you want a good life, there is a price to pay for it.. and well if you feel you can't take the challenge there are always some less demanding jobs available, which also equate to lesser income.<br><br>How about old age.. when you are old, would you like to be put into some old folk home or in some senior citizen studio apartment. It is kinda sad to just remain indoor living in a little apartment. There might be some active old folks around, but lets paint this scenario.. would you rather like have a little house by the countryside, with you own little garden, ocassionally travelling to some friends place to stay, perhaps by the lake.. or would you like to remain in Singapore with the former scenario?<br><br>Just like to hear the opinion of you guys.. cheers!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Luf...<br>Since this is your first thread, I will do u the honour to be the first one to be the spokesperson of this social topic.(As if!)<br><br>Well, I never liked the education system of SG, that is why I am in Canada right now!SS, being congested with ppl and buildings, it is simply not a place for naturalist like me who likes to be real close to Nature and peace and quiet.<br><br>In SG, most ppl are vying for power and status.Why??Cos they will say,"What to do?We are in Sg leh!Where go time to do other things!Dun even have time to watch TV."SG ppl are mostly stressed up.DO you now most of the professionals and expertise turn to drugs to relieve their emotional stress and the pressure to perform well in the company??<br><br>And dun be surprised that mostly the higher ranking ppl are the one who visited the psychologist/psychatrists the most. They have suicidal signs and find no meaning in life.<br><br>That is why I gave up my sale engineering job and came to Canada to pursue what i wanted. And if u are talking about places to go...dun think there is really much places to go...<br><br>But I really give my thumbs up for the variety of food and shopping...(I miss the food!!)...that is the only thing that make me miss SG.(of course the clubs in SG are better than here!So I never go to any of the clubs here.)<br><br>Anyway, I am sure when I am old, I will not stay in Singapore for retirement.Hmm..haven't decide where...will tell u when I decided...<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa..<br>Same sentiment here, I dun kinda like the education system here, and I never regretted studying in UK. I had the best time of my life while there, really give me an insight as to how life should be.<br><br>As for what you said about working class people, well, I am not really vying for power but I sure am pretty much stress up. Life as a professional isn't easy, but I do hope that I won't turn to drug. What is life when you are dependent on something like that to live?? Perhaps I might need your professional advise when you return, provided I can survive till that long.<br><br>I can't agree more with you pertaining to food and shopping, it's definitely much better than a lot of places. Only thingy I miss while oversea is the food.. economical and great.. where to find??<br><br>I do have some ideal places to go to for retirement.. UK would be nice or Swiss. Need to struggle hard and save up to buy a piece of land and have my own farm.. cool man!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, at least u guys are lucky, u get the chance to go abroad and do yur studies there.<br><br>For the rest of us (assuming there are others like me), there's the financial restrictions and the responsibilities we hv to fulfil to our families. So, wat to do? There's really little chance of escaping from this compact city.<br><br>Since I have to make do with this little country, I have to make it a point to make the best out of it, dun I? Juz to name a few out of the way places:<br><br>1. Changi, there's this big field where u can watch planes taking off, great unless u are the paranoid type who's afraid that a plane may lose its navigation and fly towards u.<br><br>2. Labrador Park, dun go peeping into those cars parked by the road though!<br><br>3. Playground abv Wisma Atria at nite. The place is only accessible by staircase coz its closed, try looking for it, fun to see the bustle of Orchard Road from this quiet spot.<br><br>4. NTU at nite!! Climb up to the roof of the Nanyang House, and there is the south spine as well.<br><br>One thing though, I guess its more the way each individual l@@k at things that really determines the stress level. If u are the optimistic type, no matter how dynamic the situation, u will be able to take it. Something like the Type A and Type B personality.<br><br>If u are the type that gets stressed up ezly, there's oways the best remedy: FOOD! And Singapore is not lacking in that. Looking at the correlation between the percentage of obese pple and the no. of food outlets here, it seems like this is the preferred solution. :O)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's true what u both say...For the naturalness of Spore, I would have to note that altho I like the way Sipore looks...they have controlled everything about it.  Even the natural parts seemed man-made...most plots of grassland or forested areas seem to have been touched in some way or another...and u can feel it....there's no randomness that is endemic of nature in the growth of Singapore island...Of course there is randomness, but when u control it, it almost seems that the growth is forced to grow within a certain confine or limit of human intervention....:-)<br><br>The education system is really stifling here...I see how people study and do schoolwork here and I get stressed out for them...I never beleived in working hard for the sake of working hard...I believe(as in the TV infomercials) work smarter, not harder...I think that Spore gov realise this already...but we are asians after all...most asians, no matter what race, will try hard as hell to make their children study really hard...they understand the use of education...Even in the West, It's the Asian parents who put the most pressure on their children to study harder...that's why the suicide cases are so much higher in proportion to the other races...ugg...:-(<br><br>I don't think that the education is endemic only of Singapore...If other asian countries had the resources and leadership that spore has, they would also make their education system damn strict and regimented also...Japan would be an example...I hear they are really tough...<br><br>things seem to be expensive here, but don't kno why it has to be sooo expensive...i tink the gov try to make a little more from each of us hah?:-)<br><br>Clubs are great as Rinoa said,...and there is actually a night life where u can go out and walk the streets and see others walking around also...fantastic...and in complete safety...Love the food!!!!Best almost anywhere...I think best anywhere...:-)<br><br>Shoppping is fantastic also...no place compares...:-)  the girls are beautiful and the people are educated....altho everyone is always so stressed out...it's a shame....<br><br>Very few people here have  a say about how they want to pursue their carreer...they just have to keeep up with everyone else or else no money no face...I think uRinoa and Luf should kno what I'm talking about...The people overseas seem to lead a more stress free life...they separate work from their free time...boy over here, work is free is free time...:-)<br><br>As for old age...uh...I kinda find the support from the government for old people very lacking...comparde with other modernised and tech cities...And to think that Spore is so much richer than these other countries...yet even the CPF is only given to u in 200$ amounts every month(as I know it ) when u are retired...u work so damn long and hard, yet u can't even get the full amount of ur own money to enjoy...i see so many old peopl living alone and don't have enough money that private citizens have to help out...altho it warms my heart to kno that their are people here who are so selfless...I'm wondering why the gov is so stingy in helping them...those people who live with their family are really lucky compared to those who become unwanted or live alone...Where do they turn...The country they work for all their lives also only give them so little when they are so rich....Comparatively, my Grandmothers were each recieveing US$600 every month...that's US $1200 every month...In the States...far more than enough for old people to survive and enjoy a little...In one month for two people, groceries will set u back about $200...maybe a bit more...so the rest goes to living life...and they weren't even citizens...just PR.  I think that Spore Gov has more money than the US reserves...Usa reserves are only in amounts of millions or a few billion...Spore is like,...50 billion or something like that..Wahh...then don't want to do anything with that money for old people...sad...altho it does go to the maintainence of Singapore...they must also not forget the older people here...because not every family is going to take care of their parents or grandparents...just a sad fact.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cheers guys.. thanx for your opinion.<br>I agree with Firewire that a lot of things in Singapore look very artificial, we dun have them but to pacify the people, the govt do try to create somethig for us, which is good. Still if given a choice, would you rather ski in Swiss or in a man-made indoor ski centre??<br><br>The way people study here are just giving each other more pressure. It's good to have competition but are we going on the right track. If you compare how the American or British study, they are definitely not like us, but they might be doing similarly well if not better than us.<br><br>And for those car lovers, well, this is definitely not a heaven for you.. the cost is so high and yet you can't make use of it to it's worth. So what for??<br><br>As for career, well, we are paid well compared to other neighbouring countries and maybe some western countries. Even our standard of living could be higher than theirs, but are we living a quality life?? I think we are lagging far behind in that area. Just imagine spending about 14 or 15 hours a day at work.. what kind of life would you have??<br><br>Yup.. I think the old folks are living a better life in western countries than in Singapore.. and we are asian, supposed to know the meaning of filial.. then how come there are so many old people suffering?? What are our govt doing to help out??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Life in Singapore??? I would say life in Singapore isn't really what one hopes.<br><br>Imagine living in a Paper Orientated Society where everything counts is the paper. If you're creative, people says u're impractical, if u have the expertise but NO PAPER, people will call u a useless bum. So what if the gov tried to implement Creative Learning? People still stare at paper stars.<br><br>Also, with more and tougher exams year by year, more students get stressed up and look really tensed up. Those who get into U would probably forget about all other people around them and only rub shoulders with those frm 'High-ranking/class society' and not even turn to look/smile/greet an old friend who didn't do that well at... say 'O' Levels?<br>(Sorry U students, but you know who u are if u're like that!).<br><br>Gov spends millions of dollars on these campaigns (courtesy, gracious society, cleanliness, etc) over the years, but get no results. Might as well put the millions of dollars into good use, say... increasing allowance of NSFs?<br><br>Looking at all these, can't really say that Singapore is a nice place to live in! (Can't imagine why tourists choose to say this)<br><br>--------------------------<br>You wouldn't know anything,<br>unless u've experienced it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah... S'pore is trying to introduce creative thinking in school.<br><br>To roll off the whole process, they will setup a special task force to come up with a SYSTEMATIC way for people to learn creative thinking. Sounds good huh... so much for creative thinking in S'pore.<br><br>I'm one who believe in freedom, and s'pore definitely does not provide me with that. For those whos priority is security, s'pore will probably come out as a very good choice: low crime, low natural disaster.
