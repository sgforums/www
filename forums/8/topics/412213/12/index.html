              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Living up truly to his vindictive style, PAP strongman Lee Kuan Yew took a swipe at his former political comrade and foe Lim Chin Siong in his eulogy to his wife made yesterday at Mandai Crematorium.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;">His wife of 63 years Madam Kwa Geok Choo passed away last Saturday.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;">When recounting his wife’s “contributions” to Singapore, he made use of the opportunity to cast Mr Lim in a negative light:</p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;"><strong>“In my first election for Tanjong Pagar, our home in Oxley Road, became the HQ to assign cars provided by my supporters to ferry voters to the polling booth. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">She warned me that I could not trust my new found associates, the leftwing trade unionists led by Lim Chin Siong. She was furious that he never sent their high school student helpers to canvass for me in Tanjong Pagar, yet demanded the use of cars provided by my supporters to ferry my Tanjong Pagar voters.”</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;">As Mr Lim Chin Siong passed away in 1996, nobody knows what happened exactly and the reasons behind him not sending his helpers to canvass for Lee in Tanjong Pagar.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;">Lim Chin Siong was a hugely dedicated, popular and charismatic leader whom Lee once introduced as the “future Prime Minister of Singapore” to the British Prime Minister.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;">A co-founder of the PAP in 1954, Mr Lim’s popularity rose rapidly and he became the leader of Chinese workers, trade unions and Chinese middle school students in the 1950s.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;">Without Mr Lim’s help and support, the English-speaking Lee could never have won the 1959 legislative elections and became the first Prime Minister of Singapore.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;">Mr Lim later split from the PAP to form the Barisan Socialist. He was arrested in 1962 under the Internal Security Act for being a “communist”. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recent declassified information from the British archives revealed that neither the British nor the PAP regime had any evidence that Mr Lim is an agent of the Chinese Communist Party plotting to overthrow the Singapore government via an armed insurrection.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;">Dr Greg Poulgrain of Griffith University observes that the British Governor of Singapore and his Chief Secretary in their reports to London stated that the police found <em>no evidence</em> to establish that Lim was Communist.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;">It is shame that Lee is still unable to put the past behind him long after Mr Lim is gone</p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/10/07/lee-kuan-yew-took-a-swipe-at-lim-chin-siong-in-eulogy-for-his-wife/">http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/10/07/lee-kuan-yew-took-a-swipe-at-lim-chin-siong-in-eulogy-for-his-wife/</a></p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;">They always set the poorest example for others to follow, this Lee family.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;">Still want to talk about gracious society.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;">They are the worst when it comes to giving grace.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0.5em 0px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; color: #262c2c;">And why Ong Teng Cheong no state funeral?</p>
              <p>Even when the opponents are dead, this Lee family also won't let them off.</p>
              <p>Vindictive and narrow to the core. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All of us must <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong> follow the example of the Lee family.</p>
