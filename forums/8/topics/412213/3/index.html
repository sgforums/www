              <p>I suppose people who've left their mark on history shall always have their detractors. You can't make the whole world like you, that's a fact of life. It's also a fact of life that people whose existence doesn't have much meaning, those chaps who doesn't really have much going for themselves in their lives, take pleasure in sniping from the gutter.</p>
              <p>Well mate, it doesn't matter, the world would never remember the existence of such people the way the Lee family would be remembered, eh.</p>
