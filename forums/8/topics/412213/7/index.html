              Looking at the posts in this thread, I'm now even more convinced that when the opposition takes over Singapore, there will only be more of the same, but with more chaos as the opposition-ists tries to destroy everything considered "PAP", the good, the bad, and all (read: virtually everything in Singapore).
              
              Look at this thread. Is this an example of intelligent, civil debate that we truly need, or is this more of the very same mudslinging the opposition-ists are so quick to accuse those in the PAP of?
              
              I said it once elsewhere here, and I will say it again: hogwash is not a replacement for hogwash, even if it's of a different variety and from a different place.

              <p>Well......</p>
              <p>I have mixed feelings when I watch the media coverage, TV segments, etc about her.....</p>
              <p>Something makes me have slight discomfort.......</p>
              <p>I think the society, or at least the media.......has just simply pigeon-holed her into "MM Lee wife" or as a "PM Lee mother"</p>
              <p>This is making me a little worried......or maybe "worried" is not the right word.....I dont know how to describe it......just mixed feeling....</p>
              <p>In my opinion, it may send the wrong message.....</p>
              <p>A woman is a person.</p>
              <p>It is outdated and unsuitable in the modern era to pigeon-hole a woman into "someone's wife".......or "someone's mom"</p>
              <p>I think many feminists would understand what I'm talking about here.....</p>
              <p>But in the same time, I understand that she is 89 years old, she is a product of her time, the time when women mostly do not enter the workforce, and mostly be identified as someone's wife, or someone's mom, and is supposed to devote her life to her family and thats that, thats the life for a woman.</p>
              <p>So....</p>
              <p>I dont know......I just feel awkward....</p>
              <p>Media coverage, newspaper, TV, talk to her as a supportive wife.....talk about the love story of the young couple....etc.......</p>
              <p>So this is the "definition" of her....</p>
              <p>I'm just thinking, to a certain extent, this is unfair and unjust.</p>
              <p>Because she is a person, but even in her death, her obituaries, and the way she is remembered, is how she is such a "good supporting person" for another person, the male, the husband.</p>
              <p>Is this really life for a person who is a woman in this world?</p>
              <p>This makes me uneasy.</p>
              <p>I wish the media would stop or at least reduce such outdated archaic depiction of "a good woman" , and maybe talk more and emphasize about other aspects, even things such as her involvement in the charities, or arts, or culture, or health promotion, or any other things, would be more suitable and preferable, otherwise I humbly and seriously think that those TV programs would negatively effect emancipation at a subtle level.</p>

              emphasize about other aspects, even things such as her involvement
              in the charities, or arts, or culture, or health promotion, or any
              other things, would be more suitable and preferable, otherwise I
              humbly and seriously think that those TV programs would negatively

              <p>well, I think she chose to take a back seat and let her husband run the show. but that's not to say, she has not contributed.</p>
              <p>Personally, I do not know her, but I do believe she did her share of good works but she always went about it quietly.And that's good for her.</p>
              <p>irregardless of how the media paints her, no one will really know her like her family or feel the pain like her family.</p>

                  <p>I have mixed feelings when I watch the media coverage, TV
                  segments, etc about her.....</p>
                  <p>Something makes me have slight discomfort.......</p>
                  <p>I think the society, or at least the media.......has just simply
                  pigeon-holed her into "MM Lee wife" or as a "PM Lee mother"</p>
                  <p>This is making me a little worried......or maybe "worried" is
                  not the right word.....I dont know how to describe it......just
                  mixed feeling....</p>
                  <p>In my opinion, it may send the wrong message.....</p>
                  <p>A woman is a person.</p>
                  <p>It is outdated and unsuitable in the modern era to pigeon-hole a
                  woman into "someone's wife".......or "someone's mom"</p>
                  <p>I think many feminists would understand what I'm talking about
                  here.....</p>
                  <p>But in the same time, I understand that she is 89 years old, she
                  is a product of her time, the time when women mostly do not enter
                  the workforce, and mostly be identified as someone's wife, or
                  someone's mom, and is supposed to devote her life to her family and
                  thats that, thats the life for a woman.</p>
                  <p>So....</p>
                  <p>I dont know......I just feel awkward....</p>
                  <p>Media coverage, newspaper, TV, talk to her as a supportive
                  wife.....talk about the love story of the young
                  couple....etc.......</p>
                  <p>So this is the "definition" of her....</p>
                  <p>I'm just thinking, to a certain extent, this is unfair and
                  unjust.</p>
                  <p>Because she is a person, but even in her death, her obituaries,
                  and the way she is remembered, is how she is such a "good
                  supporting person" for another person, the male, the husband.</p>
                  <p>Is this really life for a person who is a woman in this
                  world?</p>
                  <p>This makes me uneasy.</p>
                  <p>I wish the media would stop or at least reduce such outdated
                  archaic depiction of "a good woman" , and maybe talk more and
                  emphasize about other aspects, even things such as her involvement
                  in the charities, or arts, or culture, or health promotion, or any

                  humbly and seriously think that those TV programs would negatively
