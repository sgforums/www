              </h1>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Tahoma, 'Lucida Grande', Ariel, sans-serif, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 24px; font-size: 14.1667px; border-collapse: collapse; color: #333300;  "> </span></p>

Everytime someone dear to us passes away, the pain is deep. Losing a loved one is the cruelest act that life can inflict on us humans.<br><br>Even as you mourn the loss of Mdm Kwa, I am certain that you think of the happier moments that the both of you shared and that you, of all the people in this world, were the one to have had the pleasure of spending a lifetime with her. That, at least, is to be celebrated.</p>
              <p><br>But while you had Mdm Kwa on whom you cultivated your affection, there were others who were deprived of that very same joy. They were not separated from their loved ones by that surly grasp of death, but by political power with which you wielded, and wielded so ruthlessly and unjustly.<br><br>You had Mr Chia Thye Poh locked up for most of his adult life. He was incarcerated when he was only 25 and regained his freedom only when he turned 57. Even Nelson Mandela spent less years under detention. The best years of Mr Chia's life was so inhumanely taken away. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He had a girlfriend who could not wait for him and who left him when he was still in prison.</span></strong><br><br>Dr Lim Hock Siew married Dr Beatrice Chia. When I met them recently, I saw the love - unspoken but abiding - that they had for each other despite the fact that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you had kept them apart for 20 years.</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then there is Mr Said Zahari whom you also imprisoned for years, 17 years to be exact</span></strong>. He spoke lovingly of his late wife, Salamah, whom he adored. She faithfully and lovingly tended home while waiting for her soulmate to return and to hold her and to talk with her. She struggled with their four children, running a foodstall to eke out a living while Said languished in prison. Their children often had no money to go to school.<br><br>To this day, he asks for God's forgiveness for breaking the oath he made with Salamah to be together when they married each other. When she died in 2004, his heart must have broken into a thousand pieces, just like yours is breaking into a thousand pieces.<br><br>While you loved your wife, they loved theirs too.<br><br>There are scores of others who cannot be reunited with their families because you have made it so.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Ms Tang Fong Har, who was detained in 1987 and who subsequently fled to Hong Kong, has been wanting to return to Singapore to see her ailing mother.</span></strong> But she cannot because there is still the threat of her being re-arrested if she returns.<br><br>Others like <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr Tang Liang Hong are also separated from their families because they cannot return to Singapore without facing incarceration. </span></strong><br><br>I, too, have family. My wife wishes for me to return to Taiwan with her to be with her family.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> I cannot fulfill that obligation because you have made it so.</span></strong> I did go to Taiwan last year, but only to attend my father-in-law's funeral. He had asked about me before he died but by the time I got to his bedside after I managed to get the OA's approval to leave the country, he had lost consciousness. I never got to say goodbye.<br><br>It pains me to think that the only time I can be with my wife and children in Taiwan is when someone in the family dies.<br><br>You have taken away much of what I have but despite all that you have done to me and mine, I bear you no ill-will. As I said to you during our trial in 2008, you are an intelligent man, I only hope that you will become a wise one. I meant it then and I mean it now. Love and the relationships we have with family and friends are what matter most. Riches and power mean little when those dearest to us leave us.<br><br>I extend to you my deepest sympathies on the demise of Mdm Kwa. I want to express my condolence in the sincerest manner I know how. While I commiserate with you on your loss, I would be remiss if I did not take this opportuinity to tell you, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">if you don't already know, how much pain you have inflicted on your political opponents and whose families you have torn apart, the same kind of pain that you presently feel.</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">In the remaining time while you still walk this earth with us, turn from your ways.</span></span></strong> Free yourself from the prison of wealth and power that keeps you from cherishing that most precious of life's qualities - humanity. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is still not too late.</span></span></strong><br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Chee Soon Juan</p>

              <p>Dear Soon Juan,</p>
              <p>The chinese use to say in their proverb, no see coffin, no tear drop. We appreciated your love of family and your lecture on family love. Everyone love their family, and to lose a love one, is certainly painful. However, we need to divide between one man's work and lost. It is a two different issue.</p>
              <p>A man or woman has to answer for his/her work, if he/she think that what he/she is doing could undermine his/her family happiness, he/she should had stopped it. Simply put it, you cannot let a criminal go just because he has a family of love to look after. When he committed the offend, did he give thot for his family or loveones.</p>
              <p>In politics, emotional pressure get you no where, you do not play with emotion in politics, it is more for family, love and friends. Losing someone we love does not imply that we need to change our way of looking at thing and our life. We should actually carry on be more strong and stand firm so as not to disppoint our beloved ones who had been contributing to our success.</p>
              <p>We thank you for your kind letter and advices.</p>

              Agree with what you say, also from human history we know politics is very dirty game.
              In my personal philosophy.
              It is very very wicked to lock up your political foe almost as long as Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela!

              <p><br>i have mixed feeling on the gun carriage for the late mrs. lee.</p>
              <p>For recognizing Woman as equality....this is a first.</p>
              <p>For most  I think that It is unique for govt to pay tribute to her in the sense that it Gave recognized the Role of Woman as spouse of public figure no less than Man. I think it recognized equality as a 1st in the world.  </p>
              <p>History is on the lees side. - founding father of Singapore.</p>
              <p>First of all i think History is on the couple side - meaning outsider will credit the  lees 's leadership in transforming Singapore within his lifetime. She play a part in it. How much still remain as state secret we do not know.</p>
              <p>State ceremonial</p>
              <p>Singapore does not have a history of symoblic elaborate ceremonial. So it can still have room to create depth to national state funeral.  </p>
              <p>e.g I recalled when the late Dr. Benjamin Shares passed away SAF soldier stood along the road side as the gun carriage drove passed with Rifle down salute.</p>
              <p>I have not seen a 22 gun salute on state funeral.  </p>
              <p> U kinda of have to wonder who write up the manual for state funeral as it needs symbolic gesture.</p>
              <p>So at the end of the day.....they were the ones that built the Animal Farm and All of us are just pawn who happen to live in the farm that decide how to honour the builders for fencing us in the Farm and slug it out among ourselves.............ha ha ha.</p>
              <p>My view is give them some privacy........! there is such as thing call Lay to Rest.  </p>

              <p>Dear Soon Juan,</p>
              <p>The chinese use to say in their proverb, no see coffin, no
              tear drop. We appreciated your love of family and your lecture on
              family love. Everyone love their family, and to lose a love one, is
              certainly painful. However, we need to divide between one man's
              work and lost. It is a two different issue.</p>
              <p>A man or woman has to answer for his/her work, if he/she think
              that what he/she is doing could undermine his/her family happiness,
              he/she should had stopped it. Simply put it, you cannot let a
              criminal go just because he has a family of love to look after.
              When he committed the offend, did he give thot for his family or
              loveones.</p>
              <p>In politics, emotional pressure get you no where, you do not
              play with emotion in politics, it is more for family, love and
              friends. Losing someone we love does not imply that we need to
              change our way of looking at thing and our life. We should actually
              carry on be more strong and stand firm so as not to disppoint our
              beloved ones who had been contributing to our success.</p>
              <p>We thank you for your kind letter and advices.</p>

              <p style="padding-bottom: 10px; margin: 0px 0px 0in; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;">Mr Lee Kuan Yew<br>Minister Mentor<br><br>Dear Mr Lee,<br><br>As you grieve over the loss of Mdm Kwa Geok Choo, many Singaporeans grieve with you. Everytime someone dear to us passes away, the pain is deep. Losing a loved one is the cruelest act that life can inflict on us humans.<br><br>Even as you mourn the loss of Mdm Kwa, I am certain that you think of the happier moments that the both of you shared and that you, of all the people in this world, were the one to have had the pleasure of spending a lifetime with her. That, at least, is to be celebrated.</p>
              <p><br>But while you had Mdm Kwa on whom you cultivated your affection, there were others who were deprived of that very same joy. They were not separated from their loved ones by that surly grasp of death, but by political power with which you wielded, and wielded so ruthlessly and unjustly.<br><br>You had Mr Chia Thye Poh locked up for most of his adult life. He was incarcerated when he was only 25 and regained his freedom only when he turned 57. Even Nelson Mandela spent less years under detention. The best years of Mr Chia's life was so inhumanely taken away. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He had a girlfriend who could not wait for him and who left him when he was still in prison.</span></strong><br><br>Dr Lim Hock Siew married Dr Beatrice Chia. When I met them recently, I saw the love - unspoken but abiding - that they had for each other despite the fact that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you had kept them apart for 20 years.</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then there is Mr Said Zahari whom you also imprisoned for years, 17 years to be exact</span></strong>. He spoke lovingly of his late wife, Salamah, whom he adored. She faithfully and lovingly tended home while waiting for her soulmate to return and to hold her and to talk with her. She struggled with their four children, running a foodstall to eke out a living while Said languished in prison. Their children often had no money to go to school.<br><br>To this day, he asks for God's forgiveness for breaking the oath he made with Salamah to be together when they married each other. When she died in 2004, his heart must have broken into a thousand pieces, just like yours is breaking into a thousand pieces.<br><br>While you loved your wife, they loved theirs too.<br><br>There are scores of others who cannot be reunited with their families because you have made it so. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ms Tang Fong Har, who was detained in 1987 and who subsequently fled to Hong Kong, has been wanting to return to Singapore to see her ailing mother.</span></strong> But she cannot because there is still the threat of her being re-arrested if she returns.<br><br>Others like <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr Tang Liang Hong are also separated from their families because they cannot return to Singapore without facing incarceration. </span></strong><br><br>I, too, have family. My wife wishes for me to return to Taiwan with her to be with her family. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I cannot fulfill that obligation because you have made it so.</span></strong> I did go to Taiwan last year, but only to attend my father-in-law's funeral. He had asked about me before he died but by the time I got to his bedside after I managed to get the OA's approval to leave the country, he had lost consciousness. I never got to say goodbye.<br><br>It pains me to think that the only time I can be with my wife and children in Taiwan is when someone in the family dies.<br><br>You have taken away much of what I have but despite all that you have done to me and mine, I bear you no ill-will. As I said to you during our trial in 2008, you are an intelligent man, I only hope that you will become a wise one. I meant it then and I mean it now. Love and the relationships we have with family and friends are what matter most. Riches and power mean little when those dearest to us leave us.<br><br>I extend to you my deepest sympathies on the demise of Mdm Kwa. I want to express my condolence in the sincerest manner I know how. While I commiserate with you on your loss, I would be remiss if I did not take this opportuinity to tell you, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">if you don't already know, how much pain you have inflicted on your political opponents and whose families you have torn apart, the same kind of pain that you presently feel.</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">In the remaining time while you still walk this earth with us, turn from your ways.</span></span></strong> Free yourself from the prison of wealth and power that keeps you from cherishing that most precious of life's qualities - humanity. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is still not too late.</span></span></strong><br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Chee Soon Juan</p>

              <p>I think for the best interests of everyone, it is best that everyone who has nothing nice to say should just shut up.</p>
              <p>This has nothing with politics and all the crap involved with it. Rather, this has everything to do with basic etiquette and manners that your parents should have inculcated in you.</p>
              <p>I don't have a lot of love for Harry, and I disagree with him on a lot of points. However, I do know that dissing his wife on her grave and wishing for him to join her soon makes me the biggest d*ckhead in town.</p>

              <p>Never knew calling an unfancied spade a spade is now defined as "hatred". Maybe that's what happens when you haven't been exposed to the free world (instead relying on the power of fascist propaganda) and not had the opportunity to understand the essence of what free speech entails.</p>
