              <p>Haven't you heard about the joke where someone walked into a bookstore asking where he could get a copy of the fascist's parables (quite literally), to which the store keeper advised the person to head for the "Fairytale Section"? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>It's no less ironic that the demise of the despot's wife has come in such a way that would have complemented the wonderfully-scripted Animal Farm.</p>

              <p>speaking from a non-biased point of view, i think there's been too much hype and hoo haa over an ex-PM's wife. Had it been Ong Teng Cheong's wife or Goh Keng Swee's wife, it wouldn't be as big as this.</p>
              <p>And we don't know her personally, so we don't know the things she has actually advised the MM on. She could have done a lot of good but we don't know the flip side of the coin too.</p>
              <p>It's not really good use of taxypayer's money to accord her a state funeral when officially, she was never part of the government. Do this in America and the Senate will surely come down hard.</p>

               PAP-controlled media has been trumpeting how “thousands of ordinary

              Madam Kwa Geok Choo, the wife of PAP strongman Lee Kuan Yew. However, it
               now appears that some of the “mourners” may be offered some perks to 
              make the trip to the Istana where her body was placed for the last two 
              days.</p>
              <p>According to feedback we received from some readers, 
              community clubs were offering free meals and transport to ferry 
              residents to Mrs Lee’s wake at the Istana.</p>
              <p>Vernon Sim posted on TR Facebook:</p>
              <p><span><strong>“My
               place is only 2 MRT stops away from Istana, there was already free bus 
              service from the CC (Pek Kio Community Club), which comes with free food
               and drinks to entice residents there (Istana).”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Another
               reader from a Community Club in the northern part of Singapore claimed 
              that grassroots leaders have been “going around” asking residents if 
              they are free to attend Mrs Lee’s wake. Free food and transport were 
              provided as well.</span></p>
              <p><span>One grassroots leader who declined to be named said:</span></p>
              <p><span><strong>“We
               were told to get a certain number of participants from each RC, failing
               which we will have to cough out the numbers ourselves.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span> </span><span>It
               is a common “practice” of the PAP regime to provide free food and 
              transport to generate fake support for itself. For example, Singaporeans
               were given free meals and transport to attend its rallies during the 
              2006 elections. </span></p>
              <p><span>Grassroots leaders are often 
              “arrowed” to get residents to attend PAP events such as selling tickets 
              for National Day Dinners, failing which they will have to pay for the 
              empty seats themselves.</span></p>
              <p><span>However, Mrs Lee’s wake is a 
              private event and has nothing to do with the state. Why should 
              taxpayers’ monies be used to provide free food and transport to 
              Singaporeans to attend her wake?</span></p>
              <p><span>If Mrs Lee is indeed
               so popular and great as proclaimed by the state media, why must the PAP
               regime splurge public resources to orchestrate fake support for her? </span></p>
              <p><span>Are
               grassroots organizations serving the interest of Singaporeans or the 
              PAP regime? What has Mrs Lee’s wake got to do with fostering community 
              bonding and social harmony? </span></p>
              <p><span>Singaporeans should now 
              realize why Lee Kuan Yew dared to boast to a visiting Chinese delegation
               last year that all “CCs, CCCs and RCs are part of the PAP.”</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; font-size: 16.6667px;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">I have 2 stories to share about Mrs Lee. But I must confess their veracity cannot be confirmed, unless LKY confirms the 1st and the party involved in the 2nd instance is located.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">I have a friend who was for many years attached to the Istana.His father was a gardener during the 60s, and my friend followed suit before becoming an Istana driver later on.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">The first incident occurred sometime in the 60s, when LKY first came to power. In fact it was reported he was very down to earth and approachable. Given the problems in the PAP, such the Barisan walkout etc, he did not believe he would remain in power very long, just as David Marshall and Lim Yew Hock before him.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">LKY did not become aloof or distant then, he would regularly chat with the Istana staff, from the humble gardeners, butlers, drivers all the way up.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">However soon after our independence, when it became clear that he would remain power for much longer that 1st anticipated,staff overheard Mrs Lee chiding him for fraternising with such staff so openly. She told him there was a need to maintain a distance between him and them, given his ‘new permanent status’ as the unchallenged leader of Singapore.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">Of course the only 1 who can truly verify this story will be Mr Lee himself, and I doubt he will ever give confirmation. Yet, if one observes his demeanour in public from the late 50s and early 60s, to the late 60s onwards, one can see a marked difference in how much direct contact he had with ordinary members of the public.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">Obviously there are perhaps valid reasons for such a change, but my point is to merely highlight the influence she had over him, to the detriment of the common man in the street.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">The 2nd incident was again at the Istana in the 80s. As is commonly known, there are lots of fruit trees grown on the Istana grounds. I believe local fruit trees like mangoes, jackfruit, bananas etc are still grown there to his very day.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">Like her husband and her sons, Mrs Lee was known to jog regularly in the evenings on the Istana grounds. One such day she spotted 1 of the lower staff (gardener, driver etc, I can’t remember who exactly because I was told this story many years back) picking up some fruits that had fallen to the ground.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">She made a check with her security officers later on where, that staff had reported the incident or kept the fruits to himself. It was later confirmed that the staff had intended the fruits for his own consumption. He was told to either return the fruits and resign, or be subject to formal police investigations and face the possibility of being charged. Naturally he took the first offer.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Again here, technically speaking Mrs Lee was right because the fruits are public property, however on a moral basis, one feels she could and should have, let the matter rest.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">Generally speaking that was typical of her and the standards she expected, especially to those below her station in life. The human factor was never as important as the belief, that everyone must stick firmly to the rules, without exception. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">According to my friend, Istana staff were terrified of her, because of her tendency to point out even the smallest of infractions, or worse, bring to the attention of her husband, which she did on several occasions. And when the Big Man enquirers about such things, everyone jumps and greatly fears his questioning.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So because of these things that were told to me, I never really liked Mrs Lee.</span></strong> I do believe LKY did set out to do things with good intentions in the beginning, and he truly did a lot of good. Unfortunately, in later years, I feel he no longer was the person he was in the 50s and early 60s, a champion for the underdog, an anti-Communist and a believer of basic rights. Instead now we see him embracing Chinese Communist Party leaders like long lost kin, promoting a culture that gives the elite a priority over the lower classes. And in place of basic freedom and expressions, is a demand that he and the party knows best, and the people should follow without question.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">And I firmly believe Mrs Lee played a very crucial role in that change in him.<br>So with her passing, I am reminded of the speech by a UK MP (quoting Cromwell) in demanding Prime Minister Chamberlain’s resignation in 1940:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">You have sat too long for any good you have been doing lately … Depart, I say; and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!</p>
