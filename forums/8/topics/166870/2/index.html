            <div class='col-md body'>Come on man..Any Windows user knows it has a Registry system that swings its moods like a girl with PMS.<br><br>Even a application install or uninstall gone wrong causes tonnes of redundant registry keys blah blah blah...<br><br>You did a upgrade from win98 to win2k. Ok i dunno  why Windows put in the Upgrade choice in the first place when they already warn that applications installed on win98 MIGHT not work on win2k. Theres no full compatibility here.<br><br>I really suggest that INSTEAD of finding a way to clean up the mess, you find a way to back up your files, get the applications you need from your friends maybe ? (how many softwares can you need? i dont think its alot eh), and do a clean install.<br><br>And another thing. For a 1gig pc i would definetly install WinXP. Solves the hassle of installing drivers blah blah.If your RAM is low then just set it to use the classic theme.I even installed WinXP on a 233MHz pc with 256MB ram.<br><br>So yeah.thats it. Clean install is really a more convenient choice. Even if it doesnt seem convenient now, in the long run it will.</div>

Is there still a standalone Upgrade CD for current times? Thought they phased out after Win 98?<br><br>I think many of u are confused. I never  reformat my Hard dsk when the installation asked me if i wan to do a clean install (means wipe out everything and install on empty HDD). Can u remember the options screen where u can choose which type of installation u want to do, I just chose "leave the system as it is" and upgrade. It will just overwrite the Win98 OS. Then your other files like songs, videos, programs , games are still intact. This is the meaning of Upgrade<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i will suggest doing a clean install of the programes...if you have the original installation discs for the missing or non-functionalprograme/s, et in in the cd--rom drive, run it and choose the uninstall option. once done, re-install again. the program should work if the creator (MS) supports it. your CD-rom should not be affected by the upgrade since it do not require any drivers to perform the read options...firmware should take carre of that. infact all DVD, CD and CD-r are CD-roms.<br><br>that is...u should be able to open an excel file created in a win98 (with office 97) computer from another computer running win2k (with office 2000 installed).<br><br>when u uninstall programs, the files created by the progam will not be lost so dun worry.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
