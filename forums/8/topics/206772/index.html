            <div class='col-md body'>Nobody wants to have kids nowadays knowing that the standard of living is so high.<br><br>Somebody ever told me to support a kid from baby until the age of 5 need at least 20k or more. This amount includes medical, diapers, food, clothings , baby powder, etc etc.<br><br>With this kind of money needed would u think any1 will ever consider on giving birth unless they are filthy rich.<br><br>Gahment might have started something as to pay families who have given birth and the amount depends on how many kids u give birth to. The amount might have looked nice to u but pls bear in mind. In order to get the specific amount, u must have successfully raise ur kid up to 5 yrs old then u are entitled to that sum of money.<br><br>Putting the blame on women are simply actions of irresponsibilities and cowardice. Knowing its their fault yet dares not admit and pushes blame to others.<br></div>
