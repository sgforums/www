            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by banzie:</div><div class="quote_body">DIdn't you hear the Minister say its because that Singaporean girls unwilling to give birth that's why we need more people import for the deficit workforce!? If but its really a great place for woman to be in coz in places like Japan, the force the woman to give birth. I remember last time they actually ban the sales of condom. I guess Singaporean girls want to be like man don't give birth... plus don't want NS... hmmm... 10 months Pregnant worse than 2 years NS meh!?<br><br>Hmmmm Fireice got contribute to the workforce or not?</div></blockquote>Aiyah, you another one, kena con by our beloved Minister... a snippet from <a href="http://commentarysingapore.blogspot.com/2006/08/pulling-fast-one.html" rel="nofollow">Mr Wang's blog</a>:<br><blockquote><br>(1) Singapore faces the challenge of an ageing population (or so we're told). Current projections show that one in five Singaporeans will be over the age of 65 by 2030. The government therefore wants to encourage Singaporeans to have more babies.<br><br>(2) Singapore's economy lacks skilled manpower (or so we're told). The government wants to import huge numbers of foreign talents, to keep the economy going strong.<br>.<br>.<br>Something is very wrong with the above reasoning, and no one in the blogosphere seems to have pointed it out yet. So I guess I'll have to do the job again.<br><br>This is it - babies are not adults. Adults are not babies. Let's imagine that PM Lee's baby-making incentives had succeeded beyond his wildest dreams and Singaporeans produced 75,000 babies last year. That means we would have 75,000 one-year-old cute little chubbies in Singapore today.<br><br>But babies can't work. They don't contribute to the economy. They're not research scientists, engineers, bankers or teachers. That would take another 20 to 25 years to happen.<br></blockquote></div>
