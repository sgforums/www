            <div class='col-md body'>To all my fellow divers,<br>Fins Magazine of Singapore had posted this thread online:<br><br><span style="color: red;">I have been told that there may be a need for experienced divers who are strong in search &amp; recovery skills to help with recovering bodies in low visibility waters.<br><br>Likely places include Sri Lanka and Thailand.<br><br>These divers must also be able to handle the trauma of fishing decomposing bodies out of the waters.<br><br>I have also to say that, the mental trauma of doing a thing like this will stay with you for many nights to come.<br><br>I have no details at this point - but if you think you can handle this, and only if you can handle this, drop me an email at <a href="mailto:edmund@finsonline.com" rel="nofollow">edmund@finsonline.com</a>, and I'll let you know when thigns are firm.<br><br>"Thai officials are now calling for volunteers from anyone who is able to help - from professional divers to help find the bodies, and grief counsellors for those who need them."</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">(Posted by one of the people who is organising a team of divers for Search &amp; Recovery work - Fei-wei<br>PADI OWSI 466067)<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/cgi-bin/search/search_7days.pl?status=&amp;search=diver&amp;id=124700" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/cgi-bin/search/search_7days.pl?status=&amp;search=diver&amp;id=124700</a><br><br>I'm asking for:<br>1. Volunteers for recovery work, especially ex-Navy divers who have done this sort of stuff. Although I need all the help I can get, can we please have only DMs and above and/or techies (unless you are ex-Navy which in this context is more relevant). This is for safety reasons - no point going there only to have us rescue you.<br><br>I'm just 1 of several hundred OWSIs here, but if the response to cleanup days shows the spirit of volunteerism in us, then we should have the 10 volunteers that I'm looking for.<br><br>2. 2 co-ordinators / logistics persons, if you are a experienced diver so much the better.<br><br>What volunteers can expect:<br>1. This will be an entirely own-cost effort - be ready to pay your own airfare and expenses etc, although if this effort reaches semi-official status the airlines may look upon us kindly. I'm thinking it should cost $600 onwards, depending on how long you want to stay.<br><br>2. Dirty, stinky and tiring work - the bodies have been soaking 3 days already so by the time we hit the water it will be 5 days, which would make the corpses just about a pulpy mess.<br><br>If you would like to help, please e-mail me, or call me at 91476031. (If you have another number you have been using, please call the above number all the same - it's for this effort). If you can't help, please forward this appeal to as many divers you know. If you want to give money, please let me know too.<br><br>I hope to be able to leave with all volunteers for Phuket Friday morning or Saturday morning.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">(Warning from Greg Doyle [Technical Diver])<br><br>Be careful about recruiting people for body-recovery. The diving would be in contaminated black water. It requires a full biohazard setup including dry-suits and helmets with bacteria/ameobe proof double exhausts, surface supplied gasses / umbilicals, decontamination equipment and safety divers.<br><br>It is well beyond technical diving as commonly understood on FiNS.<br><br>Coordination of this is best left to professionals. I would guess that only the SCDF and some commerical diving operations have the expertise.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;"><br>Thanks.<br>__________________<br>Edmund Tee<br>Publisher<br>FiNS<br></span><br><br>I got the basic requirement, but gotta pay my own expenses, no money now leh, how to go???[/url]</div>
