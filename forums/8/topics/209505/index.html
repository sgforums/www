            <div class='col-md body'>REAL CONSPIRACIES - PAST AND PRESENT<br><br>By Berit Kjos<br>September 9, 2006<br>NewsWithViews.com<br><br>President Woodrow Wilson: "Some of the biggest men in the U. S., in the field of commerce and manufacturing, are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it."[1]<br><br>President Franklin Roosevelt: "The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the Government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson... "[2]<br><br>Real conspiracies -- in contrast to mere theories -- have spawned fear, murder, lies, and revolution throughout history. Driven by greed, ambition, or utopian visions, they reflected the darkness of human nature. No nation or empire has been immune to such intrigue; betrayal, murder, and "useful wars" stain the records of ancient Israel and Judah as well as the history of mighty empires like Assyria, Babylon, Persia, China, Greece, and Rome.[3] The nations of Renaissance Europe -- always competing for dominion and commercial markets -- were torn by the same human impulses.<br><br>More recent conspirators such as Lenin, Stalin, and Mao bound their masses to inflexible Communist standards that banned the Bible, condemned resisters, and rewarded public murder. Hidden behind their atrocities were Western supporters -- including the financial establishments of J. P. Morgan (father of AT&amp;T), Carnegie and the Rockefellers -- which funded revolutionaries and fueled the global vision of totalitarian control.[4]<br><br>...<br>...<br>...<br><br>Do you wonder where God fits into this conspiracy?<br><br>Remember, the biggest obstacle to Fascist, Communist or Communitarian triumph is Biblical Christianity! Of course, today's politically correct, non-offensive, service-oriented "Christianity" -- with its dialectic leadership training and postmodern view of God's Word -- fits right in. But God's unchanging, uncompromising Word can never be squeezed into that mold. It clashes with the notion of global solidarity. That's why Marx, Lenin, Stalin, Mao and Hitler killed millions of faithful Christian disciples. God's Word is simply too "offensive" and "divisive" to totalitarian rulers who demand loyalty to their own ideals rather than to God. So the psalmist asks;<br><br>"Why do the nations rage, and the people plot a vain thing?<br>The kings of the earth set themselves -- and the rulers take counsel together,<br>Against the Lord and against His Anointed, saying,<br>'Let us break Their bonds in pieces and cast away Their cords from us.'" Psalm 2:1-3<br><br>Part 2 will give an answer to that question. It will provide more evidence for today's global conspiracy, show how Islamic terrorism helps the overall agenda, and take an encouraging look at God's sovereignty. Remember, our God reigns -- no matter how dark the world!<br><br>"Blessed are all those who put their trust in Him!" Psalm 2:12<br><br>For full article, click:<br><br><a href="http://www.newswithviews.com/BeritKjos/kjos63.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newswithviews.com/BeritKjos/kjos63.htm</a></div>
