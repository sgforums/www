            <div class='col-md body'>During my lunch, I went to a coffee shop to eat. After awhile, I decided to eat chicken rice. I ordered chicken rice with drumstick. I waited for 10 minutes and I remind him again. After that, he bring my chicken rice but with wings! I said I ordered drumstick and he said he go and change. Again, he bring me normal chicken meats. I asked him he want to play with me and still want to do business or not and he replied "Don't like go eat Laksa!" I pissed off and went to the next coffee shop and buy a chicken rice with drumstick. I went back to the previous shop and sit in front of his stall. I ate the chicken rice and said "Wah, this chicken rice so damn nice! Not like some stupid stall!" He damn angry and approach me. He said whether I want to find trouble and fight or not. I said bring it on. Then he punched me and missed but he slipped due to the wet floor and fell down. Then I farted directly on his face and laughed. He still can't stand up and bear the pain. Damn, this is so funny. Luckily he fell down or else I'm gonna kick him in the nuts!</div>
