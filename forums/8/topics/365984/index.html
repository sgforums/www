              <p>I dont know, but some words, actually it seems to be quite a lot, are Chinese loan words/ absorbed words.</p>
              <p>Even their surnames are Chinese surnames, or how should I say, have Chinese equivalent.</p>
              <p>For instance, Tranh Tan Vao (notice the 3 names system) this surname "Tranh" maybe is "Chan" in Mandarin equivalent. (this is just example). It is like this.</p>

              <p>as what Meat Bao had mentioned, they were partly Yue people who went downwards and mixed with the Tai and Khmer groups.</p>
              <p>in the first place, the language of the Yue, Tai, and Khmers are already not related to the Sinitic family (i.e. the Chinese Dialects)</p>
              <p>the final language stratum of Modern Vietnamese derives from Austroasiatic stock, of which Khmer and Mon are related languages. the Tai elements occurs in Vietnamese mostly as a co-stratum while the Sinitic elements occurs in Vietnamese both as a substratum minority as well as a superstratum majority</p>
              <p>the final language stratum of Modern Cantonese derives from the Sino-Tibetan stock, of which Tibetan and Burmese are related languages. the Tai and Khmer element exist in Cantonese only as a substratum minority only</p>

              <p><br>Racial Harmony is celebrated to commemorate the racial riots of 1964.</p>
              <p>It is for the races of Singapore: Chinese, Malays, North and South Indians, Eurasians and other Muslim minorities, such as Arabs.</p>

              <p>I dont know, but some words, actually it seems to be quite a
              lot, are Chinese loan words/ absorbed words.</p>
              <p>Even their surnames are Chinese surnames, or how should I say,
              have Chinese equivalent.</p>
              <p>For instance, Tranh Tan Vao (notice the 3 names system) this
              surname "Tranh" maybe is "Chan" in Mandarin equivalent. (this is
              just example). It is like this.</p>

              <p>Meat Bao, this time you are right again</p>
              <p>Ã©â¢ËÂ Tran (without the "h") is pronounced in Vietnamese almost like Cantonese Chan. The relationship exist in Vietnamese "Tr" which is the retroflex consonant clusters which mirrors Middle Chinese Ã¥ï¿½Â¤Ã¦âÂ Ã¨ËÅÃ¤Â¸Å  relationship with Modern Hokkien which pronounces the same word as "Tan". Â Therefore "Tran" is in fact an evidence of the superstrate Chinese vocabulary in the evolution from "Tan" -&gt; "Tran" -&gt; "Chan"</p>

              <p>No no no, the Chinese Characters in Japanese belongs to the superstrate which is borrowed into the Japanese Language only after the Japanese absorbed Chinese culture.</p>
              <p>Japanese language is totally unrelated to Chinese Languages and dialects. Â It is an language isolate to this day, the only relative being the Ryukyuan languages only.</p>
