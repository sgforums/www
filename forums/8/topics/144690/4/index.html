All churches have regulations on what you can wear, some don't allow sandals so to respect the rules set by your church leaders.<br><br>To the non-christians, not that owning branded clothes or dear jewellery is wrong (though I never had branded stuff, and don't take to gold and diamonds so I may not understand. I know to some it's just something nice not necessarily that you want to flaunt or what). It's when you wilfully wear clothes with THE HEART to flaunt to others and not follow the regulations set by the church and your priority to dress well is to show off -  that is wrong. We must always look to the bible in all its context -  looking at verses before and after.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1 Peter 3<br>Wives and Husbands<br>1Wives, in the same way be submissive to your husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives, 2when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. <strong>3Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes. 4Instead, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight. </strong>5For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to make themselves beautiful. They were submissive to their own husbands, 6like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her master. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear.<br>7Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.<br><br>James 2<br>Favoritism Forbidden<br><strong>1My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favoritism. 2Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in. 3If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a good seat for you," but say to the poor man, "You stand there" or "Sit on the floor by my feet," 4have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? </strong><br>5Listen, my dear brothers: <strong>Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him? </strong>6But you have insulted the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court? 7Are they not the ones who are slandering the noble name of him to whom you belong?<br><br>Luke 12<br><br>Do Not Worry<br>22Then Jesus said to his disciples: "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. <strong>23Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. </strong>24Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! 25Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life<strong>? 26Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?<br>[b]27"Consider how the lilies grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 28If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith!</strong> 29And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it. 30For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them. <strong>31But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well. </strong></div>

Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer. 17Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come! 18All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: 19that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. 20We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God. 21God made him who had no sin to be sin[a] for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.<br><br></div></blockquote>Sounds like, 'if a girl is raped.

Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother's way. </strong>14As one who is in the Lord Jesus, I am fully convinced that no food is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean. <strong>15If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love.</strong> Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died. 16Do not allow what you consider good to be spoken of as evil. 17For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, 18because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men.<br><br><strong>19Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification. </strong>20Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. <strong>All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. </strong><strong>21It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall. </strong><br><br>22So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself by what he approves. 23But the man who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>So you understood the verses of 1 Cor 9-13 already yea?
