            <div class='col-md body'>To sassyfire:<br><br>Well, I want to assure you that I intended no malice towards you and that I was utterly sincere in saying everything I said.<br><br>Having said that, I'd like to also say that I accept the olive branch that you appear to be offering me, believing that it has been offered to me in what could be described as the right sort of spirit.<br><br>However, I'd like to clarify my position at those points where it appears still to have been misunderstood by some people.<br><br>1) Regarding your husband, let me say that I wasn't saying that you cannot possibly know him as well as you say you do; rather, what I was saying was that if there was a chance (or if you didn't feel that you were in a position to be sure that there wasn't a chance) of your husband's feeling himself inclined to contemplate the performance of acts that would displease God (or of his showing himself otherwise to be forgetful of the primary purpose for which sex should have been instituted by God) in the event that your husband were ever to have glimpsed you whilst you should have been clad in what you have described as a 'nicer nightie', then it might very well be the case that it would be morally incumbent upon yourself not to appear to him whilst clad in such a nightie.<br><br>For our purposes, it matters little whether these acts are defined by the law of the land as criminal (although, of course, it is the case, as I have already implied, that various forms of sodomy, including oral sex, are technically defined as acts against the order of nature and thus as crimes by the law of Singapore and this regardless of whether the forms of sodomy in question should comprise heterosexual acts or otherwise); rather, what matters is that these acts should be deemed abominable by God.<br><br>In other words, it is in principle possible, on Christian grounds, for a woman to sin by wearing lingerie even for her husband's viewing pleasure, if the woman in question does not feel it to be possible that she should know her husband as well as you have said that you have been able to know yours.<br><br>This being the case, I feel that it would be all the more incumbent on a woman to be mindful of the modesty of her attire when in a public setting; and further that if the attire in question would be unsuitable for use in a setting like the sanctuary of a church, on the grounds that it is too revealing, then, on the same grounds, it would have to be equally unsuitable for use on 'dating trips'.<br><br>Thus a woman needs to be careful of what she wears in public, lest she sin by dressing immodestly.<br><br>If, however, a woman does not think that it would matter to God that she should sin in this way, and that God would be prepared to overlook this sin notwithstanding that she should be unwilling to repent herself of it or even to acknowledge it as a sin to herself, then I think that such a woman would be deceiving herself in thinking that she has God for her father.<br><br>I'd like to make clear in this connection that I am in no way implying that you are such a woman; I am only saying rather that you should meticulously examine your conscience to determine if indeed you are such a woman.<br><br>2) Your husband may not be a pervert or perverted in the same way say that a homosexual is or a rapist; but that does not mean that his desires are not disordered, and in and of themselves, perverse.<br><br>The doctrine of the Fall implies that each of us is a fundamentally a pervert (in the sense that all of our desires are to varying degrees perverted and so deviate from the norms established by God for their operation); and this is why we have to be ever mindful of the influence that our base desires have upon our thoughts.<br><br>Thus it is hardly unsurprising if a man may entertain with relish the prospect of even a woman whom he may have come to regard as his own wife, performing an act upon himself that in God's eyes would be judged perverse (whether or not such an act should have the approbation of the law of the land).<br><br>3) I agree that women who wear bikinis to the beach need not be 'morally loose' in the sense of their not being sexually promiscuous; indeed I should not be myself surprised if a fair proportion of them are virgins.<br><br>However, this would not change the fact that such women would still be clad immodestly and that (especially if they are Christians) they would probably be guilty of a sin in this regard.<br><br>4) I think that it is entirely appropriate and indeed obligatory for us as Christians to judge the propriety of various acts, or forms of behaviour.<br><br>If we were to refrain from judging such acts or forms of behaviour, then we would be effectively telling ourselves that no possible act of wrongdoing could be implicated on the part of any person performing one of the acts in question or indulging himself in one of the forms of behaviour in question; and so we could eventually come to lose sight of the objective distinction between good and evil.<br><br>The moral law embodies God's moral will and if we are unconcerned about discovering its dictates, then we would effectively be unconcerned about pleasing God by heeding his moral will for us; and if we are unconcerned about pleasing God presuming that regardless of whatever we do and however unwilling we may be to repent of it, we should still be able to have God for our father, then who is not to say that at the end of our lives Christ will not see fit to say to us, 'Depart from me, ye that worketh iniquity; I have never known you'?<br><br>Lastly, I'd like to wish you peace in Christ.<br><br>Ben<br><br>Ps. I'd like to thank Mr Fugue again for his perceptive interjections.<br><br></div>
