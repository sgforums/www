              <p>i'm sorry if you guys feel that i'm long-winded regarding this but i have to ventilate it out a little or else i can't sleep with all that anger inside.</p>
              <p>have you guys seen this small advertisement sticking out the top of POSB/DBS ATMs that sells travel insurance? they claim that within 10 minutes, one could purchase a travel insurance and have a peace of mind when travelling overseas. they cover death/permanent disabilities and medical expenses blah blah, the usual... the parent company is MSIG and this is like a joint thing with DBS.</p>
              <p>i was queuing up with Mrs ATM card to withdraw some cash to change to Ringgit when i saw the advert... my mentality, "be prepared, not sorry" right? so after withdrawing some cash, i continued to use my Mrs card to apply for the travel insurance but as it's her card, her name is registered as the one applying for the insurance. i specifically purchased FAMILY COVER... which legally means the insurance will cover the insured, his/her legal spouse and child/children... am i right to say so? it say so in the contract they sent over a few days later before our trip.</p>
              <p>the last day of the holiday, i got sick... real sick... food poisoning... a piece of advice... don't drink tom yam soup from KL's hawkers... they don't wash their hands... i've seen it myself. so back to the topic... as my wife's a nurse herself, we tried to self-medicate for the duration on the way back to Singapore. back to Singapore, the symptoms didn't really subside so what's the next best course of action? visit a doctor right? since it was Sunday, only private clinics are open and down at Lorong Ah Soo there is a Healthway clinic which opens on Sundays. took a jap, some medication and the bill went up to $81.50. hey, i have no complains since i'm covered by insurance right? wrong!</p>
              <p>called them today, sent in an online claim form and what they replied me? the insurance only cover the insured person, which is my Mrs. not me... huh? why the hell would anyone purchase a FAMILY COVER if he or she is alone? there is an INDIVIDUAL COVER which is a lot cheaper...

              <p>How did they replied you?</p>
              <p>By voice or by email.</p>
              <p>With email or even text.  You can easily shoot them upside down.</p>
              <p>If that reply is by voice.  They will of course try to cover up with....they misread whatever contract and so on.</p>
              <p>There may be little bits and portions they can use to cover their backside as to why cannot pay you.</p>
              <p>From:  You were suppose to seek medical treatment in Malaysia instead of Sg.  To you only gotten sick in Singapore so its not travelling....to....the insurance dont cover travelling in Malaysia.  Or.....that the accident only covers for injuries and death, not sickness.</p>

              <p><br>They wont entertain you wan.</p>
              <p>You are better off, going down to their office and demand to speak to a real manager.</p>
              <p>Don't make too big a ruckus that police can be called in.  But bring up issues that you will complain to the press.</p>
              <p>Anyway, DBS/POSB changes their insurance partners and everyone of them uses the same ploy.  They attract you to buy their insurance products, then they say they are not responsible for the insurance products.</p>
              <p>Then they change to another insurance firm to continue fleecing the public.</p>
              <p>You are really better off, consulting a real insurance agent/broker and getting a full year travel and personal accident on top of your Life, hospitalisation, and illness insurances.</p>

              <p>ya ,bank telemarketing technique is quite unscrupulous .They do not advise you ,they just tried to "sell" it on the phone and the contract is done</p>
              <p>there is not room for objection and its hard to understand the limitation of the plan</p>
