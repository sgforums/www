Why? Why in the face of public fury do they not see the light?<br><br>Here are the reasons.<br><br>1. The govt/MOH<br><br>Whose responsibility is it to look after sickly kidney patients and the needy? Is it NKF or the govt? GCT and LHL maintains that no S'poreans will be left behind, we will look after the poor and needy etc. But the reality is they have shirked that responsibility and passed that burden to NKF and VWOs. It is no secret that NKF, more than any other VWOs, has the implicit support and nod from MOH all this while. The public funds NKF! It is no cost to the govt or MOH! That is why NKF has full support from MOH and have been allowed to grow so huge, elbowing out smaller VWOs in the process. And it has been revealed that NKF's direction into cancer is initiated by the minister himself. All this while NKF could very well be a branch of MOH! But if that had been the case, it would not be able to use the name of charity to get fundings. The govt/MOH would have no choice but to draw on its own reserves. And we know how stingy this govt is.<br><br>So you see there is this mutually beneficial relationship between govt/MOH and NKF. At $600k per annum, Durai's salary is of course peanuts compared to million dollar ministers. Mrs GCT is not wrong! And i stress again that in the first place Charities and VWOs do not assume the role and responsibilities of the govt to its people.<br><br>2. Charity model<br><br>Should charities and VWO operates like a business? Kaw and LHL have made it clear that they feel that "professionalism" is the way to go. But herein lies the problem which led to NKF's downfall - the expectation gap between how a VWO should be operated. It is very clear that most of the public does not buy into the business model. 12 months performance bonus, corporate style perks and benefits. But without the business model, would NKF be able to amass such huge funds? Probably not. And if charity and VWOs are unable to look after the same number of patients as before or provide the same level of service, what will happen to the neglected patients? Naturally they would turn to MOH/govt, and this is what the govt is afraid of. They would now have to do the very job that they have happily passed on. So obviously the "professional" model is in the govt's interest.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>So quite clearly S'poreans are being taxed in an indirect manner. The govt has "outsourced" its responsibilities. And in the weeks and months to come, the govt will try to convince the angry public that the business model is the ONLY way going forward for charity and VWOs. Instead of tightening the guidelines, LHL wants to now move on thinking that a change in CEO and the Board will pacify the public. Durai and the Board will be spared because they have performed good National Service as far as MOH/govt is concerned!<br><br>And this is why MOH and Kaw moved in just 2 days after they realise this could spiral out of control. Behind the genial smiles and kind words from Kaw, Durai and the NKF Board are forced to go. Which is why till today they see themselves as having done no wrong and need not apologize. In fact they rightly feel they have been victimized, albeit by the very same people who supported and encouraged them up till now! These few days we hear headlines screaming that NKF has betrayed public trust, in reality it is the govt that has lost touch with the public. And it is the govt that has betrayed Durai and his Board.<br></div>
