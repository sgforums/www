            <div class='col-md body'>I have met PM Lee on several occassions. He's a nice guy and a smart guy. I'm glad he took the RPL to Tekong instead of a SAF coptor. Even if it is to win hearts and votes, I salute him for his efforts because there are Singaporeans who are just smaller examples of success than the PM but who thinks that 95% of Singaporeans are beneath. I encounter such toads on the road every day.</div>

Nevertheless, I am certain that my letter will set many a tongue wagging.<br><br>Last Friday, my wife and I were in for a surprise when we accompanied our son to the Basic Military Training Centre on Pulau Tekong for his enlistment into full-time national service: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his wife, Madam Ho Ching, were also there to send their son off.<br><br>The humility displayed by PM Lee and Madam Ho was indeed exemplary. They did not claim any privilege, which rightly they could as Mr Lee is no ordinary citizen.<br><br>During a tour of School 2, they were treated in the same way as the other enlistees' parents. By this, I concluded that PM Lee must have given instructions that he was not to be given any red-carpet treatment.<br><br>What was most gratifying was to see PM Lee and his wife sitting with the other enlistees' parents in the auditorium for a briefing by the school commander, eating the same food, riding in the same bus to and from the jetty on Pulau Tekong to School 2 and taking the same launch to and from Pulau Tekong.<br><br>As protocol dictates that PM Lee and his wife be protected adequately from harm and danger, they were escorted by a team from the Police Security Command. Nevertheless, their bodyguards were unobtrusive and carried out their duties in an even-handed way.<br><br>I left Pulau Tekong feeling proud to be a Singaporean for two reasons: I heard my son and the other enlistees taking the oath of allegiance to defend Singapore and, if necessary, to lay down their lives, and I witnessed the humility of PM Lee and his wife as they rubbed shoulders with the people for more than four hours.<br><br>Lionel De Souza<br><br>http://www.sgboy.com/sgboyx/index.php?showtopic=19220</div></blockquote>obviously this person do not know what politicians are or what they do.............</div>
