              <p>cyberr, if point no.1 did happen,  note down the name of
                      the staff and the manager on duty.  Ask for a receipt as
                      proof. take a pic.</p>
              <p>You may write in  to
                      MacDonald management and relate what had
                      happened. </p>
              <p>Returned food are not supposed to be served (by food safety
                      standard).  They are considered as contaminated as it has
                      been passed via another person's (customer) hands.  You
                      have the rights to question them. </p>
              <p>Hope this helps.</p>

              <p>I didn't take down details and didn't have a camera with me. The manager was there (I think a filipino/malay) but she didn't do anything yet she seen what happened.</p>

              <p>I saw thru the opening to the kitchen how they prepared a special order or re-assemble "new" order.....</p>
              <p>.....I ordered a sausage muffin with egg, they take an existing sausage muffin left on the shelf for some time and just add in 1 egg patty and re-wrap. Ta da!!! Sausage muffin with egg but only the egg patty is fresh and piping hot. The buns &amp; meat patty is stale.</p>
              <p>I got to salute to those mcdonalds aunties for really knowing how to do short-cut jobs and instead of re-doing a new order for us!!!</p>

              <p>I am surprised that this kind of thing happens in fast food restaurant.  I always thought they only know how to waste food. </p>
              <p>Years ago, I worked part time in Burger King.  Not only they dun recycle food.  If food prepared and not sold in 10 minutes, throw!  I everytime saw them throw, I very heart pain.  the food still edible what. </p>
              <p>But now, I hear that Mcdonalds recycle food.  wahhhh times have changed or what.</p>
