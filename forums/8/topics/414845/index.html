              <p>1) At a bedok branch, just after I order a sausage muffin with egg, a customer returned another sausage muffin with egg to the staff whom I just ordered to. I saw the staff go to the take-order area and pretended to take a "new" sausage muffin with egg. I saw the improperly packed wrapper and asked him if this is the one the customer just returned. He hesitantly admitted and told me "still can eat"......</p>
              <p>2) At a Orchard branch (plus many other branches do this), when I order iced milo, they just gave me the one they left on the drinks area for several minutes. Once, when I ordered a medium size one to avoid the regular size milo they left on the shelf and guess what they did? They pour the regular size milo into a medium cup and top up some more milo.</p>
              <p>I thought all fastfood outlet's procedure is to throw away 
              returned/rejected food items. <strong>Is McDonalds so cash-strapped now that 
              they "recycle" food items?</strong></p>
              <p>Sure, I'm not being fussy and technically I can even eat the half-eaten burger left on other customer's tables as long as it is not poisoned and free-of-charge. But clearly this is an issue of ethnics! I paid full price and therefore I deserve fresh food.</p>

              <p>I knew ditzy will reply and I already expected some sarcastic remarks from ditzy.</p>
              <p>Personally, I believe ethnics should have no boundaries.... beyond age, beyond social class, beyond salary levels.</p>
              <p>In the 1990s, fastfood staff will automatically throw away rejected/returned food items and re-present customers with fresh ones. I see no reason why it is not practised today.</p>
              <p>Something is very wrong with McDonalds as these unethnical practices are prevailing in many outlets. The company needs to educate their staffs.</p>

              <p><em>To me, as long as it's clean, i will.</em></p>
              <p>Then you will ask me how do i know it's clean? I will say i dun know.</p>
              <p>Then you will ask me how would i feel if someone serve that food to me. I will say, of cos it's not good if it happens to me, but then again, im doing it to others.</p>
              <p><em>anyway, for myself, if im serving it to my mother, i will of cos make a better one, if i am in the mood, but im not now.</em></p>
              <p>We know wad is expected, but just that the mind doens't really care now. <br>Maybe it's because we are taught to earn money, with out really think about others.</p>
              <p>It's a weird issue.</p>

              <p>cyberr, if point no.1 did happen,  note down the name of the staff and the manager on duty.  Ask for a receipt as proof. take a pic.</p>
              <p>You may write in  to MacDonald management and relate what had happened. </p>
              <p>Returned food are not supposed to be served (by food safety standard).  They are considered as contaminated as it has been passed via another person's (customer) hands.  You have the rights to question them. </p>
              <p>Hope this helps.</p>
