              <p>I recently learned  from a source that works closely with the licensed
                  money lending industry that the IPTO (the Singaporean government
                  agency that regulates and licenses money lenders) intends to
                  effectively end the practice of legal unsecured lending to
                  Singaporeans earning less than $30,000 annually via new regulations
                  which are to become effective June 1, 2012.<br> <br> The new regulations state that the interest rate charged is to be
                  capped at 20% “Effective Interest Rate” (“EIR”) and that no other fees
                  may be charged to the borrower except:<br> <br> 1.) Late payment fees.
                  2.) Fees for varying the contract at the borrowers request
                  3.) Fees for dishonored cheques
                  4.) Fees for unsuccessful GIRO deductions
                  5.) Fees for early redemption of the loan or early termination of the contract
                  6.) Fees for legal costs incurred for the recovery of the loan<br>
                  <br> In other words, above and beyond 20% “EIR”, no additional money can be
                  collected unless the borrower fails to honor the terms of the loan,
                  requests a change to the contract or repays the loan early.  Since the
                  vast majority of borrowers are going to act in their own
                  self-interest, clearly they will not change the contract or repay the
                  loan early if it results in anything much more than an effective rate
                  of 20% “EIR” over the lifetime of the loan except in very rare cases.
                  Therefore we can conclude that, for all borrowers that honor the terms
                  of their contract, money lenders will under no circumstances be able
                  to receive more than 20% “EIR” on those loans.  That leaves deadbeat
                  borrowers who fail to honor the terms of their contract as the sole
                  source of additional revenue above and beyond the 20%  “EIR” on loans
                  available to licensed money lenders.  The problem with this, as anyone
                  that has worked in the industry surely knows, is that once a borrower
                  (particularly in the short-term, unsecured, subprime market) becomes
                  delinquent in their payments, chances become significant that some or
                  all of the principal will never be recovered, let alone the interest
                  and any additional fees assessed for delinquency.  The amount of
                  additional revenue realized from various types of dishonor fees that
                  are willingly repaid by delinquent borrowers will not even begin to
                  cover the losses of those that fail to repay some or all of their
                  principal.<br> <br> To illustrate exactly how absurd a 20% “EIR” cap is on these types of
                  loans let’s take a very simplified hypothetical example:  A licensed
                  money lender makes ten 3-month loans of $1,000 each at 20% interest
                  p.a. “EIR” stated as specified by the IPTO with three equal monthly
                  repayments.  Then let’s also assume that the money lender experiences
                  10% bad debt rate (i.e. one of the ten borrowers fails to repay the
                  loan).  That lender will lose $722.53 on these 10 loans cumulatively,
                  and that is without any consideration given to overhead, costs of
                  processing and servicing the loan, marketing, the money lender’s own
                  internal financing costs, etc.  Even with only a 5% bad debt rate
                  (i.e. one of the ten borrowers can only pay back half of the principle
                  and none of the interest) our hypothetical money lender would lose
                  $222.53 on these ten loans, again without any consideration given for
                  expenses or internal financing costs.  It turns out that if we assume
                  the bad debt rate may be as high as 10%, which certainly is not an
                  unreasonable assumption for this market, the amount of interest
                  required for  our hypothetical money lender just to break even,
                  assuming they have no expenses or internal costs of financing is 89.2%
                  “EIR”!  That’s well over quadruple what the new interest rate cap of
                  20% “EIR” is to be!<br> <br> The unfortunate nature of short-term, unsecured, subprime loans is
                  that they are necessarily at very high rates of interest so that the
                  borrowers that do repay their loans cover the losses associated with
                  the borrowers that do not with enough money left over for a money
                  lender to earn a reasonable profit.  If this is not the case there is
                  no motivation to be in the money lending business at all.<br> <br> Clearly the industry can not profitably make short-term, unsecured
                  loans to subprime borrowers at an interest rate of only 20% “EIR”.
                  The IPTO’s new regulations effectively mean that short-term, unsecured
                  lending to borrowers with less than $30,000 in annual income will
                  become illegal as of June 1, 2012.  That however, will not mean that
                  this industry will go away, it will simply be pushed into the black
                  market.  As anyone that has studied economics knows, price controls do
                  not, cannot and will never work and this new interest rate cap is
                  effectively nothing more than a price control on low-income subprime
                  credit.  The people who stand to benefit the most from this incredibly
                  bone-headed legislation are illegal black market money lenders or loan
                  sharks, the very entities the IPTO is tasked with curtailing.  Surely
                  a greater gift could never be given to black market money lenders than
                  these new regulations.</p>
