            <div class='col-md body'>what i think is the plus side of irc: many ppl i know like the irc/icq cos it allows you to get to know someone from the inside out. you get to know his/her "heart", so to speak, b4 you even know what he/she looks like. to many there is a certain charm in this. i think it comes down to ppl wanting to be judged by their characters/ personalities or what they have to say, rather than by physical or outer characteristics.<br><br>the bad thing abt the irc/icq is that if you are trying to get to know someone (and not just chatting for fun), you can't tell a person's tone of voice and all the other gestures that go with communication in real life. and this makes a big difference. on the irc you can get to think one thing abt a person based on what is written, when really another meaning was intended altogether. even with all the smiley faces and other little devices that are used to convey the tone of voice and so on, you can't really tell if the person is really happy, for instance. so the irc hides a lot more than it reveals. in real life at least you can notice a lot more abt the person and make a better gauge of what the other party is trying to say or how they are really feeling.<br><br>then again i know a lot of ppl who prefer the irc to real life communication (e.g. over the fone) cos they get to chat with more ppl at once and cos they find it tiring to focus all their energies on one person. this habit i find personally disturbing because i think it breeds a certain kind of complacency when dealing with another human being. if you want to develop real social skills, talking with someone in real life teaches you more abt how to handle ppl than over the net, where you can just shut them off if you don't like them.<br><br>the only time i have ever found using the net effective when dealing with ppl is when two ppl just can't talk to each other without fighting. in such a case, using the net as a medium helps to lessen the tension and remove the offensive tone of voice that only leads to hurt feelings and further arguments, rather than addressing the issue at hand and trying to come up with a resolution.</div>
