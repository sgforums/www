              <p>i suggest you spend less time worry about this topics...or LKY.</p>
              <p>Reasons:</p>
              <p>1) That is not your decision to make totally out of your control when his time is up...</p>
              <p>2) You give yourself too much power to LKY that generate so much hate and anger....\</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe you should go to temple more often to refresh for more positive Karma....</p>

              <p>Angel3070 will be so happy that he might go bersek as his curse on LKY to die  has finally come true. But hor, he might lose his meaning in life as he has to find a new target to make the curse. LHL ? grandson of LKY ? great-grandson of LKY ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Seriously, when LKY dies, there will be instability at least for some months. The opposition will think that now they have chances but in reality the chances will not be any much better even if the opposition turned confrontational.</p>
              <p>The instability will be more on the economy rather than political.</p>
              <p>A likely political outcome will be a split of the PAP and a new political party is formed with former PAP politicians and other professionals who will join the new party to make it a formidable party. While the existing political parties will more or less be the same with perhaps a few professionals joining them but they will still remain an insignificant force in Singapore political scene unless in the situation where the two PAP parties are unable to obtain a majority in the election and that is the time when these small political parties will have a role to play.</p>
              <p>Another scenario will be the PAP still have more than 50% of the votes despite the split. If this is the case, the opposition will not be able to do much. They might go on strike, demonstrations and adopt other confrontational tactics but to no avail.</p>
