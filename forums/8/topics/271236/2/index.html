We didnt dare to made a report or anything.<br><br>It was wrong for him to do tad, though it was partly my fault for being a nuinsence in class. But my point is, becos of him, i bucked up and scored well enough for my psle. 228/300 if in not wrong. And i bear no grudges against him now.<br><br>Maybe at primary4, its abit harsh to use fat and lazy on the kids. U could maybe have a word or two with the principle?

            <div class='col-md body'>Imo, i think your worries are unfounded or not called for. Getting upset over such trivial comments will not do any harm to the person. It is time kids grow up the harsh way and stop cushioning or peppering them with nice praises when the work they produced were real crap.<br>I was once a part time teacher, and i do not mince on my words if i really find the student's work sloppish and terrible. And parents should also stop shielding them whenever their kids are in the wrong. I kind of believe that if you allow an outsider to discipline your kid, although embarressing, the child would remember for life and not make the mistake again.</div>

U very well know that in the society doesn't work in a way whereby everyone is like a fairy godmother.<br><br>I'd say stop over reacting over such minor issues. why did the teacher say he is lazy? ever thought of that? Ask your child what did he do to deserve such a comment. I dont think any teacher will pass that comment if he has done nothing wrong to piss the teacher off.<br><br>besides the teacher teaching "in this crucial year", parents too play a major role in educating YOUR child. Take time off to guide him in his work will be much more constructive than worrying about a comment like "fat and lazy"</div></blockquote>NOW PSYCHOLOGY ENGAGES IN THE USAGE OF POSITIVE ENCOURAGEMENT AND NOT NEGATIVE ONES.</div>
