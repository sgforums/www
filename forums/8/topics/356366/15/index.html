              <p>Yeah, I believe most of them are really well-intentioned, you know.</p>
              <p>Your Christian OC bit, so funny  - poor him. But you are very interesting combination (" i consider myself to be a conservative Christian in doctrine, but a liberal Christian in practice.... what a paradox".)</p>
              <p>Anyway, like you, I prefer to work for non-Christian. Somehow, I prefer not to be called to judgement everything I do something "wrong". I feel I have to be perfect when I work for super-on Christian boss - cannot get angry, curse or swear at people, or I am a bad testimony for God. Very stressfull.</p>

Just to mention a few that Aware has helped change (for those who have read this, forgive me for repeating): </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1987 – the government wanted to give priority of primary school admission to children of graduate women. Aware, eventhough it has many members who are graduates,  opposed this as it felt that the children of all women deserve equal rights and opportunities. The Education Ministry eventually withdraw their proposal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1994 – Aware proposed successfully for a change to the way police handle rape cases so that victims are treated with more dignity and care</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1999 – Prior to this, only Singaporean men who married foreigners can sponsor their spouse's application for PR and citizenship, not Singaporean women. Aware helped changed that. Subsequently in 2004, Aware again lobbied successfully so that Singaporean women (and not just Singaporean men) who married foreigners can apply for Singapore citizenship for their children. If you have women friends, sisters and daughters in this situation, you would appreciate this.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2003 – Aware contributed to the policy change in lifting the quota restricting female intake in the Medical Faculty at NUS so that entry is based on merit.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2005- Aware also contributed to the equalisation of benefits in the medical scheme in the Civil Service for male and female officers. If you have mothers, sisters and wives in the civil service, you would appreciate this too.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">More can be found at </span><a href="http://we-are-aware.sg/achievements"><span style="color: silver;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">http://we-are-aware.sg/achievements</span></span></span></a></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Also, many underprivileged women in our society are excluded from better opportunities and these include women abused in marriages seeking protecting, divorce, legal aid, financial aid and counseling. Aware tries to help in these area too. It is not just about getting equal salary or high flying positions as the men. </span></p>

              <p>I am now offering an insight, something which most, if not all would have missed absolutely, on the debacle of the AWARE fiasco.</p>
              <p><br>What started out simply as a flawed democratic procedure on the part of the old exco became a major show of our stand on secularism.</p>
              <p>Even though it was only by chance that the new exco of a civil society  was of a similar social group, common amongst every other civil society group ( not POLITICAL representative group), it became a hotly and emotional issue that delve and derive from most subconcious fear - religious persecutation and direction, made worse by the fact those members were from the same religious fraternity as well as place of worship.</p>
              <p><br>If those members were totally and absolutely from another religious fraternity, it would have had met with similar response, for homosexuality is something no religion compromises on.</p>
              <p><br>We are the genetic inheritors of our ancestors minds. Their life experiences are passed on to us through experiences, teachings and socializing. Thus it is of no surprise to the result of the debacle when it came.</p>
              <p><br>The christian church started full swing with the adoption by the Roman emperors-rulers of the world, and through its catechism as well as its philosophies, it grew to became Catholicism, with an earthly ruler in the presence of a papist pope even though no where in the philosophy of Christ did it mention one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Furthermore, it made the worship of His mother - Mary. This was most probably due to the inherent fertility cults practiced by  cavemen turned farmers whom needed workers to toil their fields - Astare for the Assyrians, Hera of the Greeks, Isis of the influential and rich Egyptians of the Meditteranean. A form of respect and need to ensure the continuance of mankind.</p>
              <p><br>However, in time, societies found it difficult to operate with dual masters - one being allegiance to the pope and another to their own feudal kings, espacially when both more often than not do not think alike on policies, resulting in constant warfare of the medieval ages.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> "Pay unto Caesar what belongs to Caesar and pay unto God what belongs to God" is something at odds with serfs whom after paying both end up with nothing, more so when popes and clerics started owning lands and living in castles, dressing in rich robes which were a far cry from the homespun worn by a son of God that Christ was. The catholic herachy elevated themselves similarly and was no different from nobility.</p>
              <p><br>Worse still, religion became so dogmatic societies howled in protest, as many europeans did, espacially when in the hands of tyrannical priests. Some seek a purer and freer form of worship but inquisitions made a stop to it. Excommunition and burning as heretics attempted to put a stop to it. Thousands of the Calvin and Lutherian faiths died.</p>
              <p><br>European monarchs made use of such religion to keep their hold onto power, but fortunately for England, they had people like the french Monfort - the first man who invented Parliament into the world in 1258, to check papist and monarchist rule to prevent excesses and succeeded with Queen Elizabeth-Supreme Governor, Church of England, and staunchly Protestant, rising to the throne, who took the neutral course and allowed freedom of worship so long as one attended church, till she died and left no heir, resulting in her catholic husband Phillip of Spain returning to annexe England.</p>
              <p> <br>Unfortunately, Catholic Rome was insistent on wiping out heresay and freedom of worship of the likes such as Knox,Calvin, Luther, and a newer 15th century christian philosopher- puritan Presbyterian. It resulted to a civil war in England between Catholic Royalists Cavaliers and Cromwells' Presbyterian roundheads. The roundheads won, and Catholicism was replaced by even more unfortunately tyrannical Presbyterian puritans where many too were burnt as witches or sorccerors.</p>
              <p><br>In time, through parliament, such fundamentalism was stopped, and England resumed its freedom to worship, largely as non-papist. None whom remembered the inquisitions wanted it resumed.</p>
              <p><br>Thus, latter civilisations realised how religious fundamentalism- such as denominated christianity as well as mongol/Ottoman cruelties of the Mohammedan faith can destroy blossoming societies through its rigid dogmas and sought to find a compromise so that all may live in peace and prosperity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are the latter generation whom benefitted from such compromise, and term it as 'secularism'.</p>
              <p><br>It is still about codified laws on how a society can function with mutual respect to each other- neither harsher nor lax, only based on principles of pragmatism, but has its roots on the best of  religious teachings, with its sole primary aim for the continuance of mankind. We in Singapore benefitted from the most because we have the best of all religions codified into our constitution.</p>
              <p><br>Thus, we MUST jealously guard our 'secularism' and not prevent it to be misused the way liberal democracy had been twisted and corrupted by criminals to achieve their ambitions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The respected and best chancellor Germany ever had was Hindenburg in the 30s who steered a defeated nation towards prosperity and peace, only to have his hard won liberal socialist democracy taken advantage to the full by Hitler to rise and who  then destroyed every democratic institution and replaced it with dictatorial Nazi rule.</p>
              <p><br>In Singapore, for example, how many of the 3000 members were militant lesbians, gays and their degenerate lovers? ( they did sent hate email, threaten to murder, etc.) Would you know FOR SURE?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> How else then to seek this golden opportunity to 'divide and conquer', target the prime victims and drag through mud first before moving clandestinely to target other religions and societies so that their lifestyle may continue?</p>
              <p><br>Our secular society had already decided on the homosexual issue. These are our people and our responsibilities. They need help and will be given help, BUT NOT ENCOURAGEMENT to continue with their lifestyles. I repeat once again - no mother or father would want their child adopt, adapt or be influenced to such anti-humanity degenarative lifestyles.</p>
              <p><br>Be a secularist by all means, but know where your responsibilities to society lay. Do not be hoodwinked the way Hindenburg and other nation leaders was misled by Hitler. It led to a world war and millions dead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At least Hitler was no homosexual, he married Eva Braun. With homosexuals, it will be worse, - end of the family father mother unit and extinction of mankind.</p>

              <p>for
              homosexuality is something no religion compromises on.</p>
              <p><br> We are the genetic inheritors of our ancestors minds. Their life
              experiences are passed on to us through experiences, teachings and
              socializing. Thus it is of no surprise to the result of the debacle
              when it came.</p>
              <p>We are the latter generation whom benefitted from such
              compromise, and term it as 'secularism'.</p>
              <p><br> It is still about codified laws on how a society can function with
              mutual respect to each other- neither harsher nor lax, only based
              on principles of pragmatism, but has its roots on the best of 
              religious teachings, with its sole primary aim for the continuance
              of mankind. We in Singapore benefitted from the most because we
              have the best of all religions codified into our constitution.</p>
              <p><br> Thus, we MUST jealously guard our 'secularism' and not prevent it
              to be misused the way liberal democracy had been twisted and
              corrupted by criminals to achieve their ambitions.</p>
              <p><br> In Singapore, for example, how many of the 3000 members were
              militant lesbians, gays and their degenerate lovers? ( they did
              sent hate email, threaten to murder, etc.) Would you know FOR
              SURE?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> How else then to seek this golden opportunity to 'divide
              and conquer', target the prime victims and drag through mud first
              before moving clandestinely to target other religions and societies
              so that their lifestyle may continue?</p>
              <p><br> Our secular society had already decided on the homosexual issue.
              These are our people and our responsibilities. They need help and
              will be given help, BUT NOT ENCOURAGEMENT to continue with their
              lifestyles. I repeat once again - no mother or father would want
              their child adopt, adapt or be influenced to such anti-humanity
              degenarative lifestyles.</p>
              <p>At least Hitler was no homosexual, he married Eva Braun. With
              homosexuals, it will be worse, - end of the family father mother
              unit and extinction of mankind.</p>

              <p>Excuse me... Who said that homosexuals need our help... You are saying that these people have no dignity. You have no idea the legal ramifications of what you said. And how sure are you that in our society no mother or father would want their child adopt, adapt or be influenced to such anti-humanity degenerative lifestyles? My parents, for a fact, told me to do what I wanted, to anything I should feel to do so. And why are you comparing with Hitler? He killed millions of Jews. By comparing, are you suggesting that a Christian Singapore stand up and kill the homosexuals? You are the kind of people like Thio, and Josie who have intentions to divide the society. Do you forget, you Christians and Catholics in the Middle Ages launched crusades against the Muslims(in this context the non-Christian and non-Chinese Singaporeans, and homosexuals to a great extent). You are just racist and sexist and religionist. You said Singapore is a secular society. Homosexuals are still people. They deserve to do what they want to do. It is not as if the homosexuals in Singapore conduct outdoor parties to lure people to their cause. Please be mindful of others.</p>

              <p>And why do some Christians pick on other people becoz they are homosexual? They talk so much about Christian persecution, but they never say anything about the persecution they levy on others.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I wouldn't say
              that Singapore women are deliberately mistreated. I truly think
              that Singaporean women are one of the luckiest in the world as they
              have many opportunities that are equal to men.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Having said
              that,we must also recognise that our society still a patrichal
              legacy. There are many situations of unfairness too. Just to
              mention a few that Aware has helped change (for those who have read
              this, forgive me for repeating):</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1987 – the
              government wanted to give priority of primary school admission to
              children of graduate women. Aware, eventhough it has many members
              who are graduates,  opposed this as it felt that the children
              of all women deserve equal rights and opportunities. The Education
              Ministry eventually withdraw their proposal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1994 – Aware
              proposed successfully for a change to the way police handle rape
              cases so that victims are treated with more dignity and
              care</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1999 – Prior to
              this, only Singaporean men who married foreigners can sponsor their
              spouse's application for PR and citizenship, not Singaporean women.
              Aware helped changed that. Subsequently in 2004, Aware again
              lobbied successfully so that Singaporean women (and not just
              Singaporean men) who married foreigners can apply for Singapore
              citizenship for their children. If you have women friends, sisters
              and daughters in this situation, you would appreciate
              this.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2003 – Aware
              contributed to the policy change in lifting the quota restricting
              female intake in the Medical Faculty at NUS so that entry is based
              on merit.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2005- Aware also
              contributed to the equalisation of benefits in the medical scheme
              in the Civil Service for male and female officers. If you have
              mothers, sisters and wives in the civil service, you would
              appreciate this too.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Also, many
              underprivileged women in our society are excluded from better
              opportunities and these include women abused in marriages seeking
              protecting, divorce, legal aid, financial aid and counseling. Aware
              tries to help in these area too. It is not just about getting equal
              salary or high flying positions as the men.</span></p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I think it's unfair to just blame religion flat out like that. Afterall, the problem isn't so much with the religion itself but the people who use it. Hitler was a christian but in order to push his agenda forward, he replaced and eliminated priests or church leaders that opposed his motion. Even now, there then and now, there are Christians who are against what Hitler had done.</p>
              <p>So what of these many other Christians who think differently?</p>
              <p>Also, not every muslim in the world is an extremist. There are those who condemn Al Qaeda and do not agree that such acts are not true acts of Islam. What of these people as well?</p>
              <p>Religion or any ideology (including nationalism) is like a knife. It can be used as a tool to cut things and shape things, or it can be used as a weapon.</p>

              <p>Let me just clarify the principle about Christianity and homosexuality. Think I remember seeing it mentioned before somewhere but just can't remember where.</p>
              <p>The principle is that Christianity is against the act itself, but should not be hating the person. Having said that, a lot of people who hate gays or homosexuals are not Christians either.</p>
              <p>Homosexuality is a sin like any other, and likewise hate the sin but not the sinner.</p>
              <p>In practice sometimes people might not get this right. In my personal view as a Christian, homosexuals are not above or beneath anyone else when it comes to sin. I myself have friends who are homosexuals. I welcome them as friends, I hang out with them, talk to them. But I don't approve of their lifestyle, just as much as I don't agree with those who cheat, steal, gamble, etc.</p>
