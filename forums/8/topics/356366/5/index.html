            <div class='col-md body'><p>I cannot agree with the new AWARE exco mode of operation as well. If we look at it from another context, a group of 100 "convert" members suddenly join a christian group, vote in their "planned" members and then subsequently throw out the other real christian leaders. Then the group start to propangate about anti christianity, demonise the old group, support abortion, homosexual etc. How will this group feel then ? They are voted in legally as well. Perhaps the original members of the group should smile and agree to follow the new anti christian direction ?</p></div>

              <p>It is most clear that you have developed a prejudical and one sided perception which I will not be able to penetrate through, despite my reasonable attempts to break through to you with the simpliest of conceptualisations, therefore I would have to leave you to your own system of fanatical beliefs and misconceptions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To continue would only be churlish and a repetition, with no new substances, akin to a schoolyard brawl, common among thickheaded opponents and an absolute waste of time.</p>
              <p>I would only leave here with an addeum as a response to your crazy notion that views from civil society groups are immediately accepted and rectified as law as evident in your fears.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is and must be no fear of civil society groups. They only present a viewpoint to our elected representatives for legislation. Their views carry no heavier weight than yours and my views when we present our woes to our MPs at those meeting sessions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The more professionally run a civil group is, the more chance it will be heard, and heard only, not accepted unless such views are debated before our elected representatives. Thus, any civil group that seeks to be heard would have to ensure that they do have people of credibility in their ranks, mostly made up of volunteers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And volunteers are something that our country lacks, even to serving as our elected representatives is a difficult chore to find. Therefore should a civil group cease to exists just because they find that their volunteers are friends and came from the same social group?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If such beliefs are held, why then, we ought to ban NUS graduates from serving the nation, for they came from the same social group. We ought to ban clans, ban medical associations, ban every civil society group then!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please do broaden your mind and not allow narrow views to filter through. If AWARE is an organisation in Germany of the 30s, rest assured that with such fiasco, it would be terminated and replaced with another called Hitler's Women Reform Society, and any views would come from the Fuhrer alone after a night's sleep.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore's political EVOLUTION had came a long way, from a necessary authoritarian democracy to administer to a largely uneducated population on a do or die mission, to a conservative democracy, on the way to socialist democracy and one day a liberal democracy ( may i be long dead and the population fully educated to handle such liberisation).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The previous committee had sadly taken our new found freedoms for granted and had allow emotions to take the better of them, and may have destroyed a budding society capable of uplifting the lives of womenhood, as determined by our society you and i share. If it is shut down, it would be a loss to womanhood.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only fanaticism seen in the episode is a desire to stir up religious hate by some, totally disregarding the need for religious tolerance as well as a total disregard to our secular society's demand to uphold the law and not promote same sex activities</p>

              <p>Then why are those christians so fearful of the old AWARE ? They are the one with the irrational fear and sought to replace them.</p>
              <p><em>And volunteers are something that our country lacks, even to serving as our elected representatives is a difficult chore to find. Therefore should a civil group cease to exists just because they find that their volunteers are friends and came from the same social group?</em></p>
              <p>The reason why they are from the same church is mentioned is probably because it shows there is a conspiracy for the hijack. They openly declared they are linked to the "feminist mentor", from the same church, they have anti homosexual views and they resent the previous AWARE isn't it ? They plotted this takeover and it is no coincidence</p>
              <p>Now a group tat represent secular issues, inclusive of all religion and background should really have some diversity of people from all spectrum of lives. However now it is totally lopped one sided, all of them suddenly fundamentalist christians and they openly declared christian direction. What do u think of a christian group comprising of all members with anti christian views ?</p>
              <p><em>The previous committee had sadly taken our new found freedoms for granted and had allow emotions to take the better of them, and may have destroyed a budding society capable of uplifting the lives of womenhood, as determined by our society you and i share.

              <p>That is your personal thinking. My personal thinking is that religion should stay out of secular affairs and not impose their thinkings on other people. To christians, the bible is the truth but to a non believer it is fiction. They are people who really feel homosexual are not sinners and one shouldn't judge and impose their views on others.</p>

              <p>one - the so-call feminist mentor is in the middle of it all, the ladies she mentor are from the church.</p>
              <p>two - with the sacking of the staff of AWARE, the replacement is also from the church. isn't the normal practice to advertise for staff the norm?</p>
              <p>three - the anti-homosexual stance is typical of a church.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i have seen many of these, even in my own church. for some very strange reasons it is usually the ladies who have a very narrow perspective of the world and how the world should operate.</p>
              <p>reading into all the histronics from various reports (including non-government controlled ones), shows that the new exco is clutching at straws with their arguments and justifications. it also goes to show how petty women can be - sacking of these, exclusion of that, changing locks, getting muscle men to guard - and with that dragged the reputation of an organisation fighting for women's rights to the dirt.</p>
              <p>i say down with Josie and her pussycats.</p>

              That is your personal thinking. My personal thinking is that religion should stay out of secular affairs and not impose their thinkings on other people. To christians, the bible is the truth but to a non believer it is fiction. They are people who really feel homosexual are not sinners and one shouldn't judge and impose their views on others.<p></p>

              <p>The reason why homosexual is outlawed is because christians r forcing their beliefs on others.  Whether u like it or not they r importing in tons of homosexuals into singapore and they r not enforcing the law. The religion is already pushing their influece too far. As said if u wanna compare, why not compare with the whole world whereby only religious country ban homosexual.</p>

              <p>Here I see fundamentalist christians seeking to censor off views from other beliefs.

              <p> If u treat them as human, why not leave them be ? Why need to outlawed them, storm troop neutral organisation and keep condemning them ?

              <p>The thing is, no one is asking you to encourage homosexuality. </p>
              <p>From what I understand, Buddhism doesn't encourage homosexuality, neither does it ommit it too. Do not use strong words such as embracing and welcoming as you might end up incurring the wrath of the different religions and get the topic side tracked.</p>
              <p>Right now, it's not about saying to allow gays and lesbian to preach their beliefs and lifestyle. By not allowing homosexuals, or in this case, gay women, to seek help from an organisation namly to offer help to woman, isn't that going against their mission?</p>
              <p>Aren't gay women, women too? Or is it that just because they are gay, they aren't considered women, but under a third gender classification. By including them in the organisation and offering them an avenue to seek help, it's not encouraging their lifestyle, but to just provide assistance to any troubles that they are in.</p>
              <p>As long as they are women, they should be considered into the organisation, irregardless of their sexuality. </p>

              I think it just happens that Thio Su Mien was in this church whereby there was a group of gullible/irrational women who 'shares' her views and was silly enough to do things according to her bidding. As for Josie Lau, she is the nephew's wife and therefore got to 'give face' mah. If Thio is the mentor then Josie should be the mentoree?
              
              As far as I'm concerned, Thio is the cause this saga.
