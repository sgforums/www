              <p>I think it's unfair to just blame religion flat out like that. Afterall, the problem isn't so much with the religion itself but the people who use it. Hitler was a christian but in order to push his agenda forward, he replaced and eliminated priests or church leaders that opposed his motion. Even now, there then and now, there are Christians who are against what Hitler had done.</p>
              <p>So what of these many other Christians who think differently?</p>
              <p>Also, not every muslim in the world is an extremist. There are those who condemn Al Qaeda and do not agree that such acts are not true acts of Islam. What of these people as well?</p>
              <p>Religion or any ideology (including nationalism) is like a knife. It can be used as a tool to cut things and shape things, or it can be used as a weapon.</p>
              <p>The gift to speak well is also something that can be used as a weapon or a tool. Which are you?</p>

              <p>I agree there r people who r moderates. However in tis world there r people who r religious extremists. One of them seems to spoke on the issue and said the 3000 over people r "lesbians" and "degenerative lovers" and they live "degenerative lifestyles" and r "anti humanity" and link "secularism" with "hitler".</p>
              <p>Shouldn't one rebuke him tat his religious is not always right and one shouldn't be too fundamentalist and allow religion to cloud over secular matters ? Or we should let him keep thinking his religion is always right and we should think and become like him ?</p>

              <p>I think I should point out a difference in stand here that I previously have already done. The difference lies in different intepretations of the same religion, which to some extent leads to different practices even within the same religion.</p>
              <p>You see religion as the problem, whereas I see the problem lies with the people in the first place.</p>
              <p>If a muderer uses a cooking knife to kill someone, is it the knife at fault for being sharp?</p>
              <p>You are also making a prior assumption that whatever priests say are wrong and untrue, which is a sweeping statement. Even between priests or even people considered religious leaders there can be difference in thought.</p>
              <p>Do you assume that the individual will always know better than any given set of practices and ideology?</p>

              <p>Lets see. Priests and pope and bishops openly condemn homosexual. Priests and popes and bishops openly condemn women from holding post in the church.

              <p>Lets see... bible tell people to kill others people of other beliefs. Bible say tat women r worth half of men. Bible states tat women cannot hold any office in church and women must cover their head in church and not make any noise. Bible tells how god kill tons of people for really vague reasons. Bible see people who commit incest as being good to his eyes then suddenly they become serious sins. Bible states tat homosexual or people who commit adultery must be killed. And god expect everyone to obey all his words faithfully for all ages otherwise they go to hell. Is it really a human problem or religion problem ? Unless u say the bible is written by only human...</p>
              <p>Now u say it is strictly a human issue. I am sorry to say but my personal opinion is that the scriptures have some serious problems in it tat make it irrelevant in tis age.</p>
              <p>And I did not say tat all christians r like hitler. I am saying hitler is a christian and there r people who made use of christianity to commit hedious acts. And these people may really be true to the bible because tat is wat the bible states.</p>
              <p>And if popes, bishops and priests r not reflective of catholic, then wat is ? All catholic receives the same mass and talks about the same issue. They r supposed to be guided by the holy spirit and in the end they really perform crusades and inquisition.</p>

              <p>my father once asked my cluster leader this question, how to show love when he's being put in this situation, when his boss wants him to fire some of his staff etc.</p>
              <p>my cluster leader quoted his life example, when he had to let go one of his pilots (he was a pilot trainer). while he didn't have a choice because the decision is from above, he was sincerely sympathetic, and explained the situation, and tried to help him find another job.</p>
              <p>but i think it's really immature to call chrsitians evil because they had to cut headcosts.</p>

He said that people may view Christians as "arrogant, suspicious and unfriendly" it is our duty as Christians to change their misconceptions. We invite non-Christians into our ways of life and to know our saviour. We ask, we make others think but will never force someone to accept our beliefs.</p>

              <p>Ya rite... everything is grey and not black or white. A person who steal bread because he is starving. So if we see things as black or white, either we cut off his hands or we let him go scot free for everything he steals. Which decision will u take ?</p>
              <p>It is same as homosexual. R they born to be gays ? Nobody can say tat is not true. If they r born to be gay, wat wrongs have they commit ? It is like god make them gay but condemn them because they r gay.</p>

              <p>my cluster leader quoted his life example, when he had to let go one of his pilots (he was a pilot trainer). while he didn't have a choice because the decision is from above, he was sincerely sympathetic, and explained the situation, and tried to help him find another job.</p>

              <p><br>If I may be allowed to be presumptous, I would dare say you are an avowed atheist, from observations made on your numerous posts, and the way you pettily defended your beliefs through nitpicking and generalizing of other's views.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I personally hold no grudges against you and your beliefs, for each must answer for one's own conscience. Nor do I seek to approve or disapprove your own personal belief and the need to believe that your self perceptions are right. Only you can convince yourself of that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can understand your inherent fear of religious authority and would not blame you. Far too often in the course of human history, we had seen how religious officers sought to dictate and direct human affairs, when such officers are no more flawed than anyone else.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Worse still when such directions turn detrimental to human lives, compounded when the religious officers themselves turn tyrant, wilfully mis-interpretating the words of a higher being, found almost in EVERY religion practiced by mankind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So if one is NOT to believe in the existance of a higher being, incapable of wrongs, whom was fair and direct human affairs from our past till present,  then what is there to believe from another equal human being, flawed and all? Or are we to believe only in ourselves, deluding that we are perfect and incapable of being wrong?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who are we but flawed beings</span> shaped by our common education and experiences - education and experiences which are still very much lacking in comprehension of our own lives, let alone the world?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Marx, Mao, Lenin, Stalin, etc may term religion as 'opiate' of the masses, but what they - flawed humans - replaced was far worse and responsible for more destruction, deprevations and deaths than any religion could or had in the course of private civilian human history.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While I am far far away from the intellectual levels of an Eienstien, Hawking, Aristotle, even LKY, I still do consider myself a sufficiently educated man of science, and do not believe in coincidences - events that occur with no seemingly scientific laws or logic, more so when it continues on many times.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only answer is that there lies existance of laws in play which mankind has yet to unravel. A Jung or Freud would easily claim the usual subconcious mind hyperbole, or a neurologist attribute it to electrical impulses releasing chemicals resulting in a perception on a coincidence, or coincidences.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It still hardly explains the natural or unnatural forces at work, which is real and happening.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For all our scientific advances and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">belief in Man</span>, we have yet to find a cure for the common cold after 6000 years of civilisation on Earth, let alone cure Aids, Cancer and a whole host of afflictions affecting mankind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For all our political advances and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">belief in Man</span>, we have yet to find happiness, for a mother, a father and children, to live in prosperity and peace without infringing on the rights of others - many have to suffer and be poor for some to be rich and happy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the end, due to our ignorance of yet to be divined knowledge, we can only resort to religion for comfort and solace, the way our ancestors had sought, as we secularly progress and build upon what we know till one day some future human/humans can solve humanly woes and limitations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Till that day, it will be religion, in its basic form, reforming from past mistakes, that will ensure that we do not destroy or tear at each other from observing its laws, bounded and respected by a modern secular voting society to check on tyranny and flawed equal beings, a doctrine our wise ancestors had adopted and served mankind well for eons, and can only be made better as we progress and continue to respect such laws tempered and compromised with pragmatism for an evolving society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the religious are prepared to compromise for the continual sake of society, to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">follow</span> the laws of the land, then why do you, an atheist, an equally flawed human, still choose to take on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">an adverserial  religion persecuting uncompromising stance</span> today?</p>

              <p>Ahhh... so the bottomline u wanna say is because 377A exist.</p>
              <p>As said countless times, why 377A exist is not because it has the support of the majority. And the gov has openly declare they r not going to enforce tis law and it is there because religious people force its existence. Furthermore most of the developed world do not ban 377A. Whether 377A exists or not, it doesn't matter because it just shows the tyranny or religion and not because it is right</p>
