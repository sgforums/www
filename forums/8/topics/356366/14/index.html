              <p><br>Yes I guess you are right. It is not just the simple minded who are easily influenced. These days it is the educated ones even. My own theory is that all extremism comes from feeling oppressed  - this may not be real oppression but just the feeling of being oppressed, the feeling that you have been wronged. Eg either the person feels he is too poor, feel or seen rich people oppress the poor , or have inferiority complex and want to feel powerful. My gauge all fear leads to anger which leads to hate which leads to extremism.</p>
              <p>So I feel that the antidote to that is love and compassion. Because love and compassion promotes openess to why people are the way they are, promotes understanding, gives expansion to personality and worldview. When you are expand and grow in your personality and charactoer, you will fear less, be angry less often, hate less.</p>

              <p>True. So it applies to this Aware saga too. After this, both sides should take time to heal, just accept that they are different and move on to find common grounds.</p>
              <p>Some people at the EOGM kept asking Josie Lau and exco about the amount spent and managed to force them to reveal the figure of $90,000. I know people were  doing this coz J&amp; company has been saying that they are elected according to the constituition, and they always refer to the constituition to back them up. So people are throwing this back at their face, they don't practise what they preach, since Aware's constituition does not allow the exco to spend more than $20,000 per month. They have to ask the general body (the rest of the members) for approval if they do.</p>
              <p>I think J&amp;cmpy needs to explain where they spend the money and why. I think to be fair to them, some of the expenses are not without validity. Eg, given the huge surge in membership, the anger, and the 2 different camps -they need to spend on a bigger venue, security officers, lawyers, auditors to witness and manage the voting process to prevent accusations of vote rigging. And there may not have been time to ask the rest of the members for approval (since possibly half of the members may be supporters of the old guard leaders, my guess is maybe they are afraid they will not get approval? not sure, just my guess). Certainly, they need not have engaged such an expensive lawyer firm (Rajah &amp; Tan) or such an expensive auditing firm (Deloitte &amp; Touche). There are so many smaller outfits they can turn too as the task at hand is quite simple, and the EOGM just needed objective parties on hand to interpret the constituition and ensure the voting process and votes are transparently managed by neutral party. It's kind of wasting money. But I think some of the expenses are needed to prevent violence and accusations on that day. Still, I think the EOGM should not cost more than half of $90,000. So they have some explaining to do.</p>
              <p>Some people have called for J&amp;cmpny to pay back the sum about $20,000. I personally feel that the old Aware exco that has retaken power should exercise discretion and graciousness when considering this. To go by the letter of the constituition would be behaving no differently from J&amp;cmpy. But they also have to answer to the general body. So, if the expenses are valid and not unreasonable, even if it is above $20,000, they should recommend to the rest of Aware members to accept and approve this extra-ordinary expenditure. Afterall, this was an extra-ordinary event. For items that are not reasonable, then J&amp;cmpny would have to be acountable for those items separately.</p>
              <p>This is only a fair and gracious thing to do. Sometime we may have a right to do something, but it may not be wise to exercise our right.</p>

              <p>from the secular standpoint, i am neither pro or anti-gay.... obviously from the biblical standpoint, i do have a take as to whether a Christian should be gay or not.</p>
              <p>it is no different from, say, from a secular standpoint, you want to by 4D, go and buy lah, but if one is a Christian, one should abstain from gambling.</p>

              <p>one of them even asked me if i mind that my children attend those MOE/AWARE sessions. of course not! i say go an attend and be inform.... and come back and we will have a discussion. those who are afraid of such sessions are probably those who are so insecure about bringing up their kids that they are so afraid of their kids being influenced.... i say - if one's parenthood is strong enough, one need not be afraid at all.</p>

              <p>one of them even asked me if i mind that my children attend those MOE/AWARE sessions. of course not! i say go an attend and be inform.... and come back and we will have a discussion. those who are afraid of such sessions are probably those who are so insecure about bringing up their kids that they are so afraid of their kids being influenced.... i say - if one's parenthood is strong enough, one need not be afraid at all.</p>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Yes, I am a Christian too but I think that some Christians need to understand that not everyone subscribe to their world view. Some Buddhists for example (I do not speak for all Buddishts but base on what I read in 1 book) take a more compassionate and accepting view of homosexuality as they believe it is possible that a person may have lived many past lives as a woman and then suddenly he is a man this life and may have problems adjusting. While Christians may not adopt this reincarnation view, so too they should not force their view on others.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Yeah, my experience too is that there are a lot of Dr Thios in churches. I wonder why intelligent people can be so dogmatic. Actually, many such dogmas are positions held by extreme right fundamental churches in USA who tend to have a bigger influence on the Singapore Protestant churches. So it is not surprising to see these right wing positions. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">However, people must realise that no culture or religion is clearly defined. So likewise, Christianity is not a monolithic whole - this means that it is not uniform everywhere. Eg not all Christians hold the same positions on issues such as homosexuality, capital punishment, ordaining of women. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">There are left wing liberal churches in USA that accept homosexuality and ordain homosexual pastors.  At first glance, it seems that these left wing churches are too liberal, take it too easy and have no moral stand (I was taught this by church leaders). But if you really know and understand their thinking and approach, you will come to value that it comes from a very loving, very rational and very scholarly position. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I highly, highly recommend reading books by Bishop John Selby Spong. He is married with grown kids and was the former past head of the American Episcopal church – which is the American Anglican church. Now, I know that many Asian and Africian Anglican churches disagree with their position on homosexuality. And I know that some of Bishop Spong positions can be very controversial and considered heresy by most Christians (eg he puts forward some scholar's postulation that Apostle Paul may be a closet homosexual base on a close study of this writings and abhorance of the same). </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">But I think it is worthy to read and see for yourself? What is the fear right? Then choose after reading. In his books, you will also find the perennial hard questions that many non-Christians ask. These are the same questions that Christians themselves ask but got no answers or just get stock answers that they know in their hearts they cannot accept. Some simple but common questions: Is this the God of Love that sends a death curse to the first born male of all the Egyptians to scare them into releasing the Jews? Isn’t this very cruel? What have the children done to deserve this? Why do God play favourites – in this case Jews over Egyptians? If the bible is the inerrant word of God (that means cannot be wrong one), then why is it that some Christians choose to accept the bible's position that homosexuality is wrong, but do not listen when the bible (more specifically Apostle Paul) says that women must cover their heads and remain quiet in in church? There are so many women church leaders (not necc head of church but bible study group leaders, speakers) - Dr Thio Su Mien one of them, haha! Also, in Leviticus chapter 20, the bible says that homosexuals should be put to death. Er...if Christians agree with the bible that homosexuality is a sin, does that mean Christians going to advocate death penalty too? ("If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltness is upon them." Lev 20:13) </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">You will see that Bishop Spong was himself born and raised in the deep south, in a right wing conservative Christian environment. He has served the church since a young man (he should be 70 plus now) but over the years he has seen so much injustice done, all “in the name of God or the bible” that he started asking the same questions himself. He wrote his books not to destroy Christianity but in the hope that it can be what it was meant to be.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">The 2 books that I recommend are : 1) Why Christianity Must Change or Die, and 2)The Sins of The Scripture: Exposing the Bible’s Texts of Hate to Reveal the God of Love. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I, for one, am so glad the books were ever written. I felt validated that I am not alone. In church, whenever I ask what I believe are common sense questions, I either get no answers or simply brushed off and told just to accept base on faith as the bible is the word of God. I felt so "huh?" Reading Pastor Spong’s books, I felt so validated that that I was not crazy to ask those questions. I realise that being a Christian can mean more than the right wing position I have seen thus far, and that I have a choice and still remain a Christian.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span>I just share with you in case you want to read more about the liberal Christian stance - just to broaden perspective. But only if you choose to, I am not pushing the envelope just because I am a liberal myself, so please don't be offended by what I quoted from the bible.Thanks!</span></span></p>

              <p>christianity may change in its form (traditional to charismatic), but not its values. because God's values don't change</p>
              <p>and God's values are: He loves all of us, but His holy nature cannot accept sins.</p>
              <p>If He can tolerate sins, then He isn't a holy God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i was discussing this with a forumite, my position is this: God gives us all free wills to live for Him or live for ourselves. The way I see it, homosexuality is as grave as any other sins, like lying, stealing, or watching porn, so I don't think it's right to view homosexuality as a "graver" sin. And sin simply means an act of rebellion against God's value system. Whether it's pride, lust, envy, whatever.</p>
              <p>I won't infringe in your right to live your life, but I cannot agree that the lifestyle is righteous and something which God approves. But I believe Jesus died for that sin and paid for it fully with His blood, just like He died for the sins of a liar, thief, or adulteror.</p>
              <p>And just as I would encourage a liar to stop lying to give glory to God, a thief to stop stealing to give glory to God, and an adulteror to stop visiting prostitutes to give glory to God, I will also encourage a homosexual to repent and seek after God and recognise that the life he leads is an act of rebellion against God, no matter how you sugarcoat it.</p>
              <p>But nothing changes the fact that God loves all of us, as who we are. That value doesn't change in my eyes. But that love also means that He won't want us to remain as who we are, because of the consequences that only He knows will happen if we continue to sin.</p>
              <p>and just a point to note: i hate christians who go around with their hate messages like "God hates homosexuals". That's total BS imo.</p>

              <p>I agree too. I sense a great deal of insecurity in the fiery passion of Christians who take a more hard line extreme stand. They seem so afraid of change, and they take it so personally. It seems like they are afraid that they are not being faithful or doing their duty to God if they do not stop other people from "sinning". Funny  - I thought Jesus gives us individual choice so I do not think it serves Him well to force things down people's throats, right? Also right wing Chrisitians seem to fear that God's name may be tarnished if they do not stop people from doing or believing in some things (eg a Christian father thinks his homosexual son is an embarrassment to Christianity and to God). Also funny right - I had thought that God is big enough to handle that ? : )</p>
              <p>Yes! if God meant for the world to change, it will change. What is considered moral or immoral, or sin,  by Christian change over time too. Eg 50 years ago, wearing a bikini is considered immoral, sinful. But today, most people consider it normal - if you dare not wear a bikini (like me) - you are OLD FASHIONED (some people tell me that)! So I pity the first woman who wore a bikini - who must been the Christian public enemy number one and "tart numero uno" (number one tart). If it was 150 years ago, maybe she would have been burned at the stake. Poor dear  -so much for women's rights in the ancient past.</p>

              <p>even back in the days when I do my national service, my OC, a non-Christian is someone i will die for.... as oppose to the super-on OC of the next company, who is a super-on Christian.... i think his men will abandon him during a war.</p>
              <p>i consider myself to be a conservative Christian in doctrine, but a liberal Christian in practice.... what a paradox.... ha ha.</p>
