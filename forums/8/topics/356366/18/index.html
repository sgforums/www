              <p>protecting one's young is not getting upset when things outside run contrary to one's belief, but to mentor one's young so that they can make the right decision when opposite beliefs manifest themselves.</p>
              <p>my feel is that such parents are reacting because they are afraid that they did not do enough to ensure their young's moral structure is strong enough. so whose fault is it - the parents' fault lah.</p>

              <p>Like wat i said earlier, no one really cares what gays do
              to each other. The thing that make parents worried in this
              AWARE saga is the Trainer's Manual which seems to emphasize anal
              sex "can be healthy" and homosexuality is "perfectly normal".</p>
              <p>The terms use are positive towards gay and not
              "neutral" as the old guard has insisted. The old guard had accused
              the ousted exco of being "covert" and using "stealth", but I
              think this may be an issue of the pot calling the kettle black.</p>

              <p>When my bro was waiting for NS, he went to work part-time
              outside. A guy befriended him. Initially my bro tot this guy just
              wanna be friends, who knows he started to make advances and he was
              very persistent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Scared my bro stiff. My parents have to tell that fellow off
              before he stopped. We threatened to call the police. But he was
              very persistent and harassed my bro for quite some time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a 17 yr old like my bro can be scared until like tat, what
              about younger children? Do you think they can make the right choice
              to reject gay advances?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think parents play a very big part in educating and protecting
              their young. </p>
              </div>

              <p>I'm sorry if your brother was severely affected by the incident. But I can't help feeling that your brother, despite being 17 was still "scared until like that" because the male advance hurt his sense of 'decency' and masculinity perhaps. Had it been a woman would your brother been so afraid, even if he did not like the woman one bit? I think not.</p>
              <p>The point is your brother always had the choice to say no and not let a male advance compromise his sense of masculinity. Just say, no thank you I'm straight. Gosh is that so hard?</p>
              <p>Similarly, the young - if they are not gay then they do not have inclinations to be with a man. If they are gay, the normal rules should apply - reach the legal age, have protected sex, like any heterosexua relationship (in an ideal tolerant world, this shld be the case of course)</p>
              <p>The reason why I think guys fear gay advance so much cos it hurts their sense of being a man. But only know that there is not only just one form of masculinity that every man must subscribe to: Not every guy has to be the physical muscular sort, sporty ideal-types etc. every man is masculine in his own way.</p>

              <p><br>unfortunately many parents mix up the issues on imparting education and imparting moral values.</p>
              <p>the schools' role is to impart education - herein i agree to the AWARE definition that anal sex and homosexual is neutral. neutral from the standpoint that these are individual choices that one can make.</p>
              <p>the school's role is NOT to impart moral values - such values differ slightly religion to religion as well as family to family. if the family chooses to allow the school to impart moral values, then if things go wrong, too bad.... however if the family chooses to impart such values actively within the family, what kind of wind is blown outside becomes insignificant.</p>
              <p>... but at the end of the day, MOE is at fault because they are too lax on vetting the vendors and too much autonomy is given to the schools.</p>

              <p>unfortunately, there's now alot of pressure for schools to impart moral values to kids which should be taught by their parents.</p>
              <p>so now schools bo bian, have to shoulder this responsibility, so they should take that into consideration, instead of just thinking that they are imparting only education, and not morals. at least until a clear line has been drawn for them.</p>

              <p>"Singapore is a conservative country and the conventional family, is the norm and building block of our society. <strong>However we recognise that homosexual are part of our society</strong>"</p>
              <p>In short, 377A is NEVER going to be enforced if it is done privately. SO if anyone want to state tat singapore banned gay and we should follow the law, then I say u should read more, follow the stand from the gov and live and let live. Wat they do is their own business and nothing written in your book applies to them if they r not believer.</p>

              <p>Homosexual like people of their own sex. And if u do not expect them to remain as virgins for their whole life they will do 377A.  And tat make them "banned"</p>

              <p>The solution is very simple. They keep to themselves, and u guys keep to yourself. They go to their house they can do watever they want and even if u call the police, they won't do anything. Now the problem is u guys r not keeping to yourself and forcing other people to take your extreme stand. U guys proclaim homosexual is illegal stating they r degenerative and anti humanity and want the whole world to condemn them. Even if some organisation proclaims it is neutral, which is rightly so, u guys will force it down. Who r the ones promoting their belief ?</p>

              <p>I think u really need some proper sex education. Let me ask u a
              question... wat makes a gay a "gay" ? Dressing up as a girl or
              putting make up etc doesn't make u gay. They r called
              transvestites.</p>
              <p>Homosexual like people of their own sex. And if u do not expect
              them to remain as virgins for their whole life they will do
              377A.  And tat make them "banned"</p>
              <p>The solution is very simple. They keep to themselves, and u guys
              keep to yourself. They go to their house they can do watever they
              want and even if u call the police, they won't do anything. Now the
              problem is u guys r not keeping to yourself and forcing other
              people to take your extreme stand. U guys proclaim homosexual
              is illegal stating they r degenerative and anti humanity and want
              the whole world to condemn them. Even if some organisation
              proclaims it is neutral, which is rightly so, u guys will force it
              down. Who r the ones promoting their belief ?</p>
              <p>I think the behavior of witch hunts and religious fundamentalist
              should be the one roundly criticised and penalised.</p>
