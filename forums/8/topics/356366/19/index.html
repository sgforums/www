              <p>....And an even worse misconception mus be cleared, hopefully
              once and for all. 377A is a penal code that ILLEGITIMISE gay
              sex.</p>
              <p>Be a gay all you want. Dress up as a girl as much as you like.
              Walk with a sway on your behind as you wish. Put on makeup and
              boost up your chest all you want.</p>
              <p><br> BUT when you start PROMOTING your lifestyle with the aim for sexual
              conduct or even marriage, that it is one amongst many choices
              avaliable for a free society, then you would have incurred the
              wrath of society and its law.</p>
              <p><br> NO ONE discriminates against homosexuals. They have a right to live
              and contribute to our society.</p>
              <p>It is their LIFESTYLE, and those who PROMOTE such
              lifestyles,  that must be roundly criticised. Keep your gross
              acts of indecency to yourself, keep away from decent families and
              innocent young boys,  and make sure your doors are locked,
              otherwise if a call is made to the police while you are engaging in
              your filth with your degenerate lover, you WILL be penalised, make
              no mistake about that!</p>

              <p>how does a parent explain something they never know enough about? WOW! so the teachers in schools are what? geniuses? every teacher in every school is supposed to know everything about everything?</p>
              <p>i've always felt that the school's responsibility is to impart educational value to the kids. teach them to spell, teach them to count. i think it's absolutely ridiculous to expect them to mother the children. parenting - is the parents' job. imparting specific values should be the parents job. </p>
              <p>and it's ridiculous that everytime a child goes bad, pick up smoking, join gangs, the first thing their parents do is to point fingers at the teacher and claim that they are doing a bad job. so now the line is blurred, where the teacher is expected to teach what the parents are suppose to teach. so they cannot just focus on the mechanics of sex (for example), but also the moral and social implications of it. or in another example, why it's bad to keep bad company? why is it bad to smoke, why is it bad to steal.. which are all the parents' job</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that was why i said:</p>

              <p><strong>Yes, one doesn't need to be religious to have moral values but where do our own moral compasses come from, you bloody son of a bitch?</strong> The swaying a little is bad enough to create social conflict and you claim that you , like Adolf Hitler,  cannot abide the existence of homosexuality as it belongs to the wrong side of morality. My message is that irreligious people can have morals but not all people can be morally right with respect to religion. Hence public schools have to become the great equaliser to public morality. So where else does a sense of common ground for morality come from in Singapore, you smelly cunt? Go read my postings carefully.</p>
              <p><strong>The idea is a common ground for morality education and not that schools have to bear the blunt of teaching morality due to the fact parents cannot  be responsible.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Yes, one doesn't need to be religious to have moral
              values but where do our own moral compasses come from, you bloody
              son of a bitch?</strong> The swaying a little is bad enough to
              create social conflict and you claim that you , like Adolf
              Hitler,  cannot abide the existence of homosexuality as
              it belongs to the wrong side of morality. My message is that
              irreligious people can have morals but not all people can be
              morally right with respect to religion. Hence public schools have
              to become the great equaliser to public morality. So where else
              does a sense of common ground for morality come from in Singapore,
              you smelly cunt? Go read my postings carefully.</p>

              <p>rofl, don't you ever learn to read?? we are at the very least governed by the law. any moral values are at least governed by the law.</p>
              <p>right now, the government stand is, the alternative lifestyle is against the law (even though it's not being actively pursued). so yes, it is a moral issue, right now until the law changes.</p>
              <p>religion has nothing to do about it - rather it's culture and, again, the laws of the state. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>if you don't like it, then ship out and migrate to amsterdam, life sucks (the activity you do every night), too bad?</p>
