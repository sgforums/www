              <p>the point with this thread is about the shocking things happening at AWARE now, not gender wars.</p>
              <p>as far as i know, the old timers and current AWARE veterans, including the top management, were toppled over by some fully newcomers in the recent electoral.</p>
              <p>like what happens in those HK dramas full of company politics etc......</p>
              <p>anyway, this is very shocking to hear such things happening in SG.....</p>
              <p>there obviously is some plot and conspiracy behind all these.</p>
              <p>and that new AWARE chief, that Debbie Lau or something........not sure her name, but surname is Lau........something is fishy about her.</p>
              <p>and now DBS comes into the picture.</p>

              <p>Sometimes, it's good to know what's going on in the organisation of Singapore. As much as they're there to help the women of Singapore whom I believe are most proably grateful, we must also be aware of what's happening within the organisation so that we would know if they're reliable enough for us to depend on or not. </p>
              <p>I didn't start the topic for a gender war, please don't focus on that. And yes, man are allowed to join the organisation from what I read in the papers. </p>

              <p><br>I do hope that such views as yours are a minority. As a male, I do not look at the situation as something of amusement or in any way 'disgraceful' to my fellow female citizens.</p>
              <p>Rather, it shows the strengths and passions of our womenfolk to aspire and fight for what is theirs democratically, a timely awakening from the submissive females their grandmothers had been.</p>
              <p>It is only the way that they conduct themselves that may be an issue which shows a rawness in its public relations management, but only a minor issue of an organisation that is reforming and re-generating itself.</p>
              <p>More critical is what it does to uplift the lives of singaporean women, and not just PR N.A.T.O. talk in public, and should be judged as such.</p>
              <p>The only ones who should be blame for much of the bad publicity would be ex-co. They seemed to be hell-bent on destroying the organisation with their public catcalls where patience would be necessary and better used instead.</p>
              <p>Aware is an organisation that is bigger than anyone of them, for it represents or at least attempts to represent the majority of our womenfolk. Aware is not A WAR.</p>
              <p>It is a concern to our society, for who amongst us males do not have a woman in our lives - vital of all is that, we males issued forth from mothers. </p>

              <p>I listened to their talk that they don't know each other until they decided to join AWARE and coincidentally got themselves elected as exco members. It's such coincidence that many new members decided to vote them to the committee. Coincidentally, they have the urge to join AWARE together. Coincidentally, they share the same conviction that discrimination against 'gay women' is a stand that needs further discussion. Coincidentally, they work so well together to get themselves so organised. I wonder which organisation grouping will be imposing their religious beliefs and 'values' through the new AWARE.</p>
              <p>In future, I will surely scrutinise their motives whenever they are involved in public work and promotions on women matters. The public will want to know how the ulterior motives of these new members and how AWARE will evolve.</p>
