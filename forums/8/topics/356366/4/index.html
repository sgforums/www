              <p><br>Be glad, very glad that there are women representatives who could have easily dont give a damn about others and live out their golden tai tai life, but instead took on extra responsibilities to uplift the lives of their fellow women citizens.</p>
              <p>If not for them, who can claim our women, mothers and sisters, in bad times, will not revert back to the back breaking toil and underpaid samsui women, with no cpf, days off, or medical leave or whatever women of Singapore enjoys today?</p>
              <p>Although we men would always take care of our women fellow citizens, it would be good to hear from women's perspective as well for any major decisions that may affect our society, for we are afterall, only men.</p>
              <p>Therefore, lets not be too harsh but instead give them our support and encouragement to build a better new world and society you and i can create for our common future together.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE : Bringing Aware back to its "original cause" - that is what the new executive committee (exco) of advocacy group, the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE), is planning to do. <br><br>In an emotionally-charged news conference on Thursday, the new guard said AWARE has lost its focus. <br><br>They accused the old guard of steering AWARE into becoming a single purpose organisation. <br><br>Drama erupted even before the news conference started with current Honorary Treasurer Chew I-Jin accusing the new guard of intentionally excluding her from their news conference. <br><br>"I'm utterly disappointed and disgusted because I'm meant to do a presentation alongside you, Lois (Ng, Executive Committee member)," said Chew. <br><br>During the one-and-a-half hour event, the group introduced well-known corporate lawyer Dr Thio Su Mien, as their so-called "feminist mentor". <br><br>Dr Thio is the Senior Executive Director of TSMP Law Corporation and mother of Nominated MP, Dr Thio Li Ann. <br><br>The new exco said AWARE had become a single purpose organisation overly concerned with promoting lesbianism. <br><br>They repeatedly raised examples, like how the old guard had backed a lesbian film screening in 2007 and organised a lesbian-friendly Mother's Day event in 2006. And they wanted to bring the association back to what they say is its original noble cause. <br><br>When contacted for comment, former AWARE president Margaret Thomas said those comments were ridiculous and not deserving of any comment. <br><br>Dr Thio Su Mien also revealed that she had emailed several groups with her concerns about the direction the association was taking, which prompted reporters to ask if the takeover was orchestrated. <br><br>"It depends on what you mean by organising. It is kind of flattering in a way. I'm frustrated, I talk to people, I collect info, I send to different people. You want to join, (then) join. I will help you. We discover that networking helps," said Dr Thio, adviser to the new AWARE exco. <br><br>The new exco said none of them intend to step down, but revealed that taking up office has come with risks. <br><br>Several members received death threats which have been reported to the police. <br><br>"Each day, I fear for the physical safety of my children, my family. There's even a blog site detailing my children's names and which schools they go to," said Josie Lau, AWARE's president. <br><br>The team will go ahead with the extraordinary general meeting planned for May 2 and is looking for a new venue to accommodate its burgeoning membership. It is now 880 and still growing. - CNA /ls</p>

              <p>I am saddened by the fact tat a secular organisation is hijacked by a groups of religious people and becoming religious. I have not written anything religious for a long time but tis topic really make my blood boil</p>
              <p>1) Why the religious people not form their own group and set their agenda as religious with the aim of helping women instead ? R they respecting other people's belief (helping lesbian by the old exco alleged by the new exco) ? R they going to storm into all the other groups tat offer support to lesbian or homosexual to achieve their censorship ?</p>
              <p>2) Those who need support from the group will be pressurised into becoming religious since the whole group is religious and promoting religious belief. If they started off declaring they r religious, I have nothing to say. However they stormed into secular group and declaring they r secular yet r actually promoting religious sentiments. Anti homosexual is religious sentiments</p>
              <p>3) Isn't lesbian women ? So is lesbian a diesease or something ? No. However to some people, they r a diesease and should be "counselled". IMO, bigoty is the real diesease and should be counselled</p>
              <p>4) On one hand they talk about fear, hostility, intimidation and irrational fear, aren't religious doing the same thing to homosexual ?</p>

              <p>2) Those who need support from the group will be pressurised into becoming religious since the whole group is religious and promoting religious belief. If they started off declaring they r religious, I have nothing to say. However they stormed into secular group and declaring they r secular yet r actually promoting religious sentiments. Anti homosexual is religious sentiments</p>
              <p>3) Isn't lesbian women ? So is lesbian a diesease or something ? No. However to some people, they r a diesease and should be "counselled". IMO, bigoty is the real diesease and should be counselled</p>
              <p>4) On one hand they talk about fear, hostility, intimidation and irrational fear, aren't religious doing the same thing to homosexual ?</p>

              I believe the reason why they decided to hijack AWARE instead of starting a new one is because AWARE has a ready pool of 'clients' that they can use readily. These 'clients' are the same one that they want to reach out to undo what AWARE had done (pro-gay/lesbian) previously.  It is a pity that a religion that has been started to unite people, promote peace and love, has now been used to disunite the society...
              	
              People should stop judging others from a high moral ground. My basis for a good religious leader is simply to see if the speeches that he/she make would unite or disunite people. Nowadays, there are religious leaders from various insitutes who would say things that tends to divide and disunite others. To me, this is wrong and I would stop joining such groups. Luckily, most Christians are not like those in the new AWARE group.

              <p>When you start rationalizing the existance of 'shades of grey', you are procastinating on your own necessary moral judgement. Worse still if you condone and allow 'shades of grey' to continue its existance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By your defination and admittance of 'shades of grey' alone, you full well are aware of the moral implication it imposes upon society. Are you proposing we as a society deny our duty to iron out this ambiguity?!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you fear making such decisions, then you should step aside and let others do it on your behalf, without fear or favour.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To condemn others for making a decision which you - a rightful member of society, responsible for the elevation and progress of our members - abrogated, is hypocrisy of the highest order.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You have lost ALL right to cast aspersions or term others as speaking from a 'moral highhorse'. Simply it is because it is a horse you dare not mount to do what is necessary and right for our evolution!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Where shall we draw the line on perceived intolerances? When we come across it, and like any civil society, to bring it to the ears before our community to judge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If there is a number whom feels such tolerances are necessary, so be it. But if not, when a society demands it not be tolerated for the good of all, we must act cohesively and act accordingly to stop it. I remind you, it is against the law for lesbanism and homosexuality here, worse still to promote it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It had been debated on the highest court of our land - the parliament and a decision had been made. No matter how many times it continues to be debated and wasting society's time, our society is still not ready to such abnormalities or 'shades of grey' as you define it. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, that is the law. It may sound harsh, but we as society can tamper it with justice and compassion. Instead of promoting such anti -social activities, we must instead change stubborn minds and perceptions. And it can only done if you and i remain calm, minus the wild allegations, rhetorics and help them come to terms with society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My plea to you is to let the women's civil society do what needs to be done for their womenkind, with the delicate feminine touch and not the strong arms of the law.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do not play up to the tempers, cloud up judgement, over a democratic election, but look upon the critical issue and judge the new members on their performance in the field.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Again i issue another plea, do not make that mistake ever again that it is religion that is requiring the law to be uphold. It is bigger than all the religions combined -Islam, Hindu, Buddhism, Christianity, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is secular society, which you and i, our families and friends belong and am responsible for such a law.</p>

Is it right or wrong or is tis inclusive or immoral, is already left out of the picture. The government just want peace and I agree with them tat it is a wise decision.</p>
              <p>If u wanna look at the "law", why not look at it from a global perspective ? Which countries actually ban homosexual ? If u look at developed countries like Europe, america and australia, homosexual is legal. Only in countries ltat is religious, homosexual is illegal. So if u wanna talk about law and how parliament debates etc, the fact is homosexual is viewed as human right in these developed countries. Is singapore more developed than them ? Obviously not</p>
              <p>In fact if u ask me, wat is the sin homosexual did to society ? The only problem they give is they will not produce children. Tat is the same as nuns, monks and father of religious groups. A classic question anti homosexual like to ask is "How will u feel if your son told u u r gay". My answer is "I will feel sad. but if my son told me he is gonna be a monk, i will feel more devastated.". Gay can still be close to their family. A religious figure have reduced ties with their family and their religion is in the first place. So please tell me wat other harm have they done to society.</p>
              <p>Now lets talk about issue (2) Should a religious group hijacked other secular group to spread their propaganda about anti homosexual</p>
              <p>If u ask me, obviously I find tat distasteful because not everyone subscribes to the same religion. Your religion tell u to do tis and tat but tat is your business, not mine. Do not let your religious practices affect my lifestyle because I do not believe. Why r religious people not keeping to themselves and try to influence the secular world ? Tis group chose to include homosexual. U can choose to form a group against it but trying to use a system flaw and outrun it is regrettable. I find tat as uncomfortable and wonder if one day my lifestyle have to change becauase of other people's religion</p>

Tis group chose to include homosexual. U can choose to form a group against it but trying to use a system flaw and outrun it is regrettable. I find tat as uncomfortable and wonder if one day my lifestyle have to change becauase of other people's religion</p>

              <p>As I can see a gradual softening up of your view on point (1), I will not dwell any further on it, as I do not expect anyone to readily accept anyone else's view, least of all in public.</p>
              <p>So i will dwell on point (2), which you are attempting your best to defend. I had tried to liberally come to your viewpoint, but i cannot reconcile myself your fallacies.</p>
              <p>a.) Hijack:- is a democratically held election and won considered a 'hijack' as you claim? Is Obama a pirate/hijacker too by your defination?</p>
              <p>b.) Again, yet again, you succumbed to your personal ingrown prejudices against the new exco and draw inferences to their religious beliefs.</p>
              <p>Aware is an inclusive organisation. At no time does it say it is limited to only a certain racial group or claim any religious affinity. The only drift is based on sex, which should be rightfully so, so that it may without fear or favour or interference from the opposite sex to present a view from our fellow female citizens as a civil society organisation to our community to discuss or act on, for the furtherment of our society which is made up of female species as well.</p>
              <p>It is with great sadness i felt, as well as many i know, when the ex-co used the dirty trick of race/religious card to present their disatisfaction, which many others foolishly fell for it</p>
              <p>As a child, i made the mistake many did and wondered why there were so many chinese in my school, malays and indians were so few. Only later did i found out majority of singaporeans were chinese, as such, the ratio would be never be a 50/50 in all schools.</p>
              <p>Similarly in working life, it would be impossible to fill an entire organisation with such ratios, because ALL our races(ethnic groups) has the freedom of choice to work anywhere they wish.</p>
              <p>Similarly too in any civil society organisation. That the new committee were of one particular religious affinity is never one of specific intentions, but one of natural coincidence based on their desire to serve society. At no time had this new committee claim it is not an inclusive organisation.</p>
              <p>There are other racially or religiously affiliated civil society, but AWARE is most definately not one of them, as the ex-co and other anarchists are attempting to make it out as a sure thing.</p>
              <p>That they had been single out as religious fundamentalists is ludicrous and in our society's harmonious context, a dangerous mischief and MUST CEASE!</p>
              <p>Worse still are the immatured death threats. How are they going to work on other issues to elevate the lives of our womenfolk if nutheads continue to harp on lunacies?</p>
              <p>I sincerly hope that you see my point. I do not seek that you to agree with me, but please do spend some time, consider and erase that 'religious' affiliation link. It doesnt exists or compromise their attitudes towards serving society, something we in Singapore sorely lacks.</p>
