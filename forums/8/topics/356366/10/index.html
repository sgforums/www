              <p>Pro-choice = Secular. This is better. Anyway AWARE wasn't set up to be a Chinese Christian organisation, it was set up as a multi-racial organisation to focus on women rights. And thus it should be open. Well at least that is the general opinion of the public(and mine, included).</p>

              <p>I would not settle for anything less than Josie and the bitches being hauled to court over financial mismanagement of funds. Well I heard a lawsuit might be prepared and I wish the process would be hastened. It is amazing what Josie and the bitches did in under two months with $90K.</p>

              <p>It is true that the majority are conservative. But the fact remains and states even on CNA that even Christians(well at least quite a few of them at AWARE meeting) voiced out that they don't want a single religion to predominate the AWARE agenda.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A lot of people are conservative. Yes. But many of them also refuse to allow religion, race and politics take over an organisation's core belief and values. I hope you understand my stance.</p>

              <p>IMHO every single slut who stood up with Josie and the rest of the ping pong girls who supported her should be sacked(if they are working). They are grossly incompentent. If they are competent as they say they are, then why the mess being revealed to the media. If they were competent, they would have used PR to silence them. Josie, being what-not of DBS, despite her senior position, did not utilise that. It shows that they are not competent.</p>
