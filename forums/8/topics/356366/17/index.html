              <p>I'm going to try and reply in your context, although I must say you have put it very crudely:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a man comes up and tells your son: "come, I wanna poke your backside" , what your son can say is:</p>
              <p>If your son is gay - "Ok, sure" or "No thanks I'm in a commited relationship with my boyfriend"</p>
              <p>If your son is not gay, "No thanks I'm straight" or "I'm flattered, but no thanks"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You have nothing to do with it. If a man wants to poke your backside, just tell him whether he can or not, depending if you want it or not. You have no right to interfere with his choice of wanting to poke other men's backsides. There is no need to kick up such a big deal. Not gay, just say no. Gay, say yes if he is your type. No need to resort to violence, just act with a bit more civility. Besides, I think gays can tell a mile off whether their target is gay or not. So heterosexuals should not be so worried, I think some of them are not attractive (in male terms) to warrant such a "solictation" anyway.</p>

              <p>Well let me ask u first... wat is your definition of christian ? U know christians come in all shapes and sizes. Some believe Mary while others say mary is not tat significant. Some priests r homosexual and some r women while others said they r not christians. Some literally pin themselves onto crosses while others never attend church all their lives. Some go for inquisitions and terrorism while others fight for world peace.Some say u must follow a lot of the old laws while other say u just need to believe.</p>
              <p>Wat is your definition of christian then ? Is it when he do disgraceful things he is not a christian and if he do good for the society he is automatically a christian ?</p>

              <p>Hitler stopped attending church services and receiving sacraments by WW1, and when the full extent of Nazi ideology was realised in 1937, the Vatican issued encyclicals condemning it. Furthermore, the positive Christianity that was promoted by the party was heretical. Jesus was depicted as Aryan activist against Judaism, the Old Testament was rejected.</p>
              <p>And just because Hitler promoted these beliefs (which were Alfred Rosenberg's ideas) doesn't mean he bought them personally. He knew that Aryanism was a lie that served him well.</p>

              <p>Nope, what he said was to the effect that Jesus and Luther would have supported National Socialism. Prior to 1937 the Vatican remained cautious and circumspect about it. The concordat that was signed in 1933 was NOT a sign of support for the Nazis as Hitler had declared but a treaty that guaranteed non-interference by the state in church matters and the protection of Church legislation.</p>

              <h1>The Building Bridges Conference, Singapore</h1>
              <p>Thursday 06 December 2007</p>
              <div id="intro">
              <p><em>A transcript of the Archbishop's main address at this major conference on Christian-Muslim relations.</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>If you believe what some commentators have to say, one of the major factors provoking conflict in our world is the sheer fact of different religious convictions: in our own country, it seems to be assumed by many that if we could only get the relation between 'faith communities' right, social harmony would inevitably follow. And conversely, any expression of a belief that one's own religious loyalty is absolute, any statement of the belief that I, as a Christian or a Muslim or a Buddhist or whatever, am speaking the truth, is regarded as t<span class="text">hreatening and unacceptable. <strong>Surely the problem lies with this contest over the truth; surely, if religious people would stop speaking about truth and acknowledge that they were only expressing opinions and conditional loyalties, we should be spared the risk of continuing social conflict and even violence. </strong></span></p>
              <p class="text"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But what this hopeful fantasy conceals is an assumption that talking about truth is always less important than talking about social harmony; and, since social harmony doesn't seem to have any universal self-evident definition, it is bound to be defined by those who happen to hold power at any given time – which, uncomfortably, implies that power itself is more important than truth.</span></strong> To be concerned about truth is at least to recognise that there are things about humanity and the world that cannot be destroyed by oppression and injustice, that no power can dismantle. The cost of giving up talking of truth is high: it means admitting that power has the last word. And ever since Plato's Republic political thinkers have sought to avoid this conclusion, because it means that there is no significance at all in the witness of someone who stands against the powers that prevail at any given time; somehow, political philosophy needs to give an account of suffering for the sake of conscience, and without a notion of truth that is more than simply a list of the various things people prefer to believe, no such account can be given.</p>
              <p class="text">So the fact of disagreement between religious communities is in fact crucially important for the health of our common human life. Because these communities will not readily give up their claims to truth in response to the appeal from the powers of the world around to be at one for the sake of social harmony, they testify that power, even when it is apparently working for the good of a majority, cannot guarantee that certain values and visions will remain, whatever may happen. But does this concern for truth mean that there is always going to be damaging conflict wherever there is religious diversity? What about the cost of religious diversity to 'social cohesion' – to use the word that is currently popular in British political rhetoric? Does disagreement about truth necessarily mean the violent disruption of social co-operation? I shall be arguing that it does not, and that, on the contrary, a robust view of disagreement and debate between religious communities may (unexpectedly?) play a major role in securing certain kinds of social unity or cohesion.</p>
              <p class="text">The first point I want to make is about the very nature of religious language. To believe in an absolute religious truth is to believe that the object of my belief is not vulnerable to the contingencies of human history: God's mind and character cannot be changed by what happens here in the world. And the logic of this is that an apparent defeat in the world for my belief cannot be the end of the story; God does not fail because I fail to persuade others or because my community fails to win some kind of power. Now if I believe for a moment that my failure or our failure is a failure or defeat for God, then my temptation will be to seek for any means possible to avoid such an outcome; and that way lies terrorism and religious war and persecution. <strong>The idea that any action, however extreme or disruptive or even murderous, is justified if it averts failure or defeat for my belief is not really consistent with the conviction that my failure is not God's.</strong> Indeed, it reveals a fundamental lack of conviction in the eternity and sufficiency of the object of faith. In plain English, religious violence suggests religious insecurity. When different communities have the same sort of conviction of the absolute truth of their perspective, there is certainly an intellectual and spiritual challenge to be met; but the logic of belief ought to make it plain that there is no defence for the sort of violent contest in which any means, however inhuman, can be justified by appeal to divine sanction. The divine cannot need protection by human violence. It is a point uniquely captured in the words of Jesus before the Roman governor: <strong>'My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight' (Jn 19.36).</strong></p>
              <p class="text"><strong>So the rather paradoxical conclusion appears that the more religious people are utterly serious about the truth of their convictions, the less they will sanction all-out violence;</strong> they will have a trust that what truly is will remain, whatever the vicissitudes of society and history. And they will be aware that compelling religious allegiance by violence is tantamount to replacing divine power with human; hence the Quranic insistence that there can be no compulsion in matters of religious faith. It is crucial to faith in a really existing and absolute transcendent agency that it should be understood to be what it is independently of any lesser power: the most disturbing form of secularisation is when this is forgotten or misunderstood. <strong>And the difficult fact is that it has been so forgotten or misunderstood in so many contexts over the millennia. It has regularly been confused with cultural or national integrity, with structures of social control, with class and regional identities, with empire; and it has been imposed in the interest of all these and other forms of power.</strong> Despite Jesus' words in John's gospel, Christianity has been promoted and defended at the point of the sword and legally supported by extreme sanctions; despite the Quranic axiom, Islam has been supported in the same way, with extreme penalties for abandoning it and civil disabilities for those outside the faith. <strong>There is no religious tradition whose history is exempt from such temptation and such failure.</strong></p>
              <p class="text">Like others, I<strong> have sometimes been very critical of the heritage of the European Enlightenment where it has been used to appeal to timeless and obvious rational truths which are superior to the truths claimed for revelation and imparted in the historical processes of communal life.</strong> But it should be granted that the Enlightenment had a major role in highlighting some of the inner contradictions of religious language and behaviour in the wake of an age when so much violence had been justified by the rhetoric of faith. After the wars of religion in Europe, it was plausible and important to challenge those habits of thought which had made it seem natural to plunge whole societies – indeed, the greater part of a whole continent – into murderous chaos on the pretext of religious dispute. For the major thinkers of the Enlightenment, the contrast was between absolutes that could be defended only on the basis of arbitrary religious authority and absolutes that were established by universal reason; and it was obvious that the latter promised peace because they did not need any reference to authorities that, in the nature of the case, could be accepted only by certain groups.<strong> By forcing religious authorities to acknowledge that they could not have the legal and civic right to demand submission, Enlightenment thinkers in a sense obliged believers to accept what was in fact an implication of their own religious faith – that power in this-worldly terms was an inappropriate vehicle for faith.</strong></p>
              <p class="text">But the <strong>enlightenment dream of a universal rationality proved in the event as vulnerable and questionable as any religious project.</strong> It became entangled in theories and discourses of <strong>racial superiority</strong> (supported by a particular reading of <strong>evolutionary biology</strong>) and the <strong>economic determinism of capitalist theory</strong> and practice; it developed a <strong>complex and unhealthy relationship with nationalism</strong>, which was, increasingly, seen as the practical vehicle for <strong>emancipation and rationalisation</strong>; and its own account of universal reason was (as I noted in a lecture here in Singapore some months ago) <strong>undermined first by Marxian and Freudian theories, then by the structuralist and postmodernist revolutions</strong>. European rationality – and its American manifestations in the Declaration of Independence and the political philosophy flowing from that – <strong>came to seem as local and arbitrary as any other creed; in the world of global politics, it depended on force as much as argument.</strong> And if you come to believe that the values of a certain culture – whether Western democracy or any other – <strong>are absolute and impossible for rational people to argue about, then, when some groups resist or disagree, you have a theory that licenses to suppress them; what is more, because you have no transcendent foundation for holding to these values, you may come to believe that any and all methods are justified in promoting or defending them, since they will not necessarily survive your failure or defeat.</strong></p>
              <p class="text">Thus the Enlightenment hope of universal harmony on the grounds of reason can become a sophisticated version of the priority of force over everything else, a journey back towards the position that Plato exerted all his energy to refute in the Republic. If the power of argument proves not be universal after all, sooner or later we are back with coercion; and when that happens it becomes harder and harder to hold firm to the classical liberal principles that are at the heart of the Enlightenment vision, harder and harder – for example – to maintain that torture or the deliberate killing of the innocent in order to protect the values of society can never in any circumstances be right. It is one of the great moral conundrums posed by the experience of recent years: what if the preserving of civil liberties and the preserving of the security of a liberal society turn out not always to be compatible?</p>
              <p class="text">The reality of religious plurality in a society declares, as we have already seen, that some human groups hold to their convictions with an absolute loyalty, believing they are true and thus non-negotiable. If they thought otherwise about these convictions, they might be involved in negotiations about merging or uniting in some way; there would be no ground for holding on to a distinct identity. Yet they do hold to their claims to truthfulness, and so declare to the society around that certain things are not liable to be changed simply because of to changes in fashion or political theory or political convenience. The lasting plurality of religious convictions is itself a mark of the seriousness of the convictions involved. Some things are too important to compromise. <strong>But if a religious community is as serious as it ought to be about its beliefs, this refusal to compromise is accompanied by the confidence that, whether or not these particular beliefs prevail in any society, they will still be true, and that therefore we do not have to be consumed with anxiety about their survival. </strong>The religious witness is able to confront possible political failure, even social collapse, in the trust that all is not and cannot be lost, even when the future becomes unimaginably dark; what it will not do is to sanction any policy of survival at all costs (including the cost of basic humane conventions and moral boundaries).</p>

              <p>You have nothing to do with it. If a man wants to poke your backside, just tell him whether he can or not, depending if you want it or not. You have no right to interfere with his choice of wanting to poke other men's backsides. There is no need to kick up such a big deal. Not gay, just say no. Gay, say yes if he is your type. No need to resort to violence, just act with a bit more civility. Besides, I think gays can tell a mile off whether their target is gay or not. So heterosexuals should not be so worried, I think some of them are not attractive (in male terms) to warrant such a "solictation" anyway.</p>

              <p>Like wat i said earlier, no one really cares what gays do to each other. The thing that make parents worried in this AWARE saga is the Trainer's Manual which seems to emphasize anal sex "can be healthy" and homosexuality is "perfectly normal".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The terms use are positive towards gay and not "neutral" as the old guard has insisted. The old guard had accused the ousted exco of being "covert" and using "stealth", but I think this may be an issue of the pot calling the kettle black.</p>
