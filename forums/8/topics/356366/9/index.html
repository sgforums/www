              <p>Resigning quiety = Firing in a nicer way. Not a big diff if you asked me. I don't think she would be able to find another job especially in this job climate. Another plus. Disgusting to have this kind of woman in any organisation whatsoever.</p>

              <p style="margin-left: 4.6pt; margin-right: 4.6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Hi all,</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 4.6pt; margin-right: 4.6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I had promised to give an update on the AWARE EOGM that I attended yesterday. I was there at 12.10pm and managed to get in at 1pm and sat there till the meeting closed at 9.20pm. I won't bore you too much as all can be read on ST and seen on Razor TV. But I will just summarise the general atmosphere and highlight some interesting incidents and express my opeinion.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 4.6pt; margin-right: 4.6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Please note that since the "new exco" is not longer the exco, it will be referred to as the "ex-new-exco" haha.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 4.6pt; margin-right: 4.6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I think the Josie Lau and company started the meeting on a really bad footing. IUnderstandably they were very tensed, but they also used strong arm tactics and too early in the meeting - that did not go well with old guard supporters and set the tone of the meeting already even before it started. I quote some examples:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 4.6pt; margin-right: 4.6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">1) Before she opened the meeting, Josie demanded on her mike from the stage that Mr Siew sit at the side reserved for men and foreigners and not with the women. However, the old guards argued that he is their legal counsel and should sit with them - afterall, the ex-new-exo's legal counsel sits with them. Later someone also revealed over the mike that during the last AGM when Josie Lau and cmpy seized power, her own husband sat with the women. At the beginning of the meeting, the ex-new exco kept asking security to escort people out and used this threat often. But later, when they realize their threats will not work, they stopped issuing these orders. But already the crowd was very unhappy.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 4.6pt; margin-right: 4.6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">2) And then the mike for the audience was turned off when Josie Lau wanted to make her president's address. The members were upset and keep calling for the mike to be on as it is the normal procedure for any meeting. Ex-new-exco asked their lawyer who actually confirmed that the old guards are right so the mikes were turned on after a long tussle. But many times the mike for the audience were again turned down so everyone got even more angry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;    ">3) Even at the early parts of the meeting, Sally Ng from the ex-new-exco screamed at one of the old guard members "Shut Up and Sit Down!" I know it was a tense situation but her words were reflective of the hard stance the exco has taken so far and treating adults like children - it did not go down well with the members and she was booed.  To be fair to Josie, she apologised immdiately for Sally's outburst. When Jenica Chua asked Sally to apologise to reduce tension, she said (overheard as her mike was still on) " why should I apologise" but eventually did so. Later someone told her off and said this is the time for us to "Stand up and speak up" </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 4.6pt; margin-right: 4.6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">And of course Dr Thio the feminst mentor was booed and jeered throughout. Funny thing was she is not even on exco but while everyone had to queue up to speak (some more than an hour), she gets the mike whenever she wants. Unfair lor.  But I think she treated all of us like children scolding us and telling us to "respect your elders (her)". Someone later shouted at her and said "Respect has to be earned". Personally, I wonder why for a former law dean, an intellectual, a high flying lawyer and respected member of her church community, behaves like this. She acts like she is a granny to all of us and treats adults like children and with so little respect.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 4.6pt; margin-right: 4.6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Overall, it is true the supporters of the old guard are pretty rowdy at times but one must understand that many of the supporters do not even know the old guard leaders personally but came to support due to their own convictions and was not rallied by the old guard to be so rowdy. There were many reminders sent out to ask supporters to behave with dignity and to accept the outcome no matter what. Leaders that day also keep trying to calm the crowd and I think they did a good job overall.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 4.6pt; margin-right: 4.6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I know many supporters of Josie Lau/Dr Thio and cmpny feel that everyone was so rude and did not give them a chance to talk. While it is true that sometimes there were a lot of jeering, I personally feel that many times the ex-new-exco did not give credible responses to questions and Dr Thio behaved poorly to the audience. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 4.6pt; margin-right: 4.6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">But I must say at the later half of the meeting, the exco kind of got resigned to things, they stopped asking people to be escorted out, they stopped their strong arm tactics. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 4.6pt; margin-right: 4.6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I feel that overall Josie Lau did carry her self well and even smiled when jokes were cracked – despite the trying situation. Although I disagree with her stand and how they came into power, I must still say she was the most courageous of the lot as she was President and was more targeted than the rest of the exco. <span> </span>She was very quick to apologise for Sally Ng’s outburst and that was the right thing to do. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 4.6pt; margin-right: 4.6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Sometimes, I even feel a bit sorry for her because really, the puppeteer was not her. It was Dr Thio. </span></p>
