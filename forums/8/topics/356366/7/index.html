              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Hi, I have been reading some of the posts from this thread. I am just replying to 4sg’s post out of convenience (so no offense ok, 4sg?) and feel that I should clarify some points about Aware that has been raised by others too.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I am an old Aware member (so sad, now I have to state old or new Aware). Aware is a registered society but it is NOT a charity. It is an advocacy group. This means that its aim is to improve society by advocating changes in law. While doing charity work and giving donations are very valuable, at the same time, law changes can be very powerful agents of change and improvement. Aware pitches at this angle and level.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Aware stands for Association of Women for Action and Research. I know to some people it sounds a bit “cheem” but what this means is that Aware conducts research, collects data and take action by lobbying for changes in law. 3 ex-Presidents of Aware have been appointed Nominated Members of Paliament – Kanwaijit Soin, Claire Chiang and Breama Mathi and have spoken up for women in Parliament. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Many who do not follow Aware closely may not know that it has successfully lobbied for law changes to benefit our women and children. For eg:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1987 – the government wanted to give priority of primary school admission to children of graduate women. Aware, eventhough it has many members who are graduates,<span>  </span>opposed this as it felt that the children of all women deserve equal rights and opportunities. The Education Ministry eventually withdraw their proposal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1994 – Aware proposed successfully for a change to the way police handle rape cases so that victims are treated with more dignity and care</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1999 – Prior to this, only Singaporean men who married foreigners can sponsor their spouse's application for PR and citizenship, not Singaporean women. Aware helped changed that. Subsequently in 2004, Aware again lobbied successfully so that Singaporean women (and not just Singaporean men) who married foreigners can apply for Singapore citizenship for their children. If you have women friends, sisters and daughters in this situation, you would appreciate this.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2003 – Aware contributed to the policy change in lifting the quota restricting female intake in the Medical Faculty at NUS so that entry is based on merit.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2005- Aware also contributed to the equalisation of benefits in the medical scheme in the Civil Service for male and female officers. If you have mothers, sisters and wives in the civil service, you would appreciate this too.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">More can be found at </span><a href="http://we-are-aware.sg/achievements"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #c0c0c0; font-family: Times New Roman;">http://we-are-aware.sg/achievements</span></span></a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So, Aware not so “bo-liao” leh, haha! <span> </span>While charity work has its rightful place in society, and giving someone fish for a day is important, it is just as important to teach someone to fish. That is why for a number of years, Aware has been conducting financial literacy classes for women to help them better manage their finances and plan for retirement. The truth is women generally outlive men, and many women are at a loss when their spouse <span> </span>dies and they are left penniless. So part of Aware’s active programme is also about empowering women, because women who are independent and empowered will be in a better position to help not only themselves but other people in society.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It is true that some people have wondered what does a bunch of educated, privileged women at Aware can do for underprivileged women. But I think we should also remember that there are many rich and powerful people other charities who are active in raising funds and doing charity too eg Jenny Chua, the ex-GM of Raffles Hotel has been a long-time volunteer and Chairwoman of Community Chest. My personal opinion is that only when our bellies are full then we can afford time to look around and see what we can do to help (what some people call kaypoh, hehe). So maybe, the more educated and privileged women in society have more resources to contribute.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Actually, the old Aware leaders are aware of this accusation. Mindful of this, (not because they want to deflect criticism) they decided to set up a helpline in 1991 to help women in crisis and to better understand what women of all walks of life go through. This helpline not only gives emotional support, but also acts as a referral to other sources of help available eg financial assistance or legal aid. Aware also employs a full-time professional counselor who conducts face-to-face counseling. The charges are nominal, based on a sliding scale depending on the woman’s financial ability. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In addition, Aware also provides a free legal clinic once a month, managed by volunteer lawyers, so that women can seek legal advise and explore their options. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Aware members are not men haters! Aware believes that men and women are just as important. That is why, in the last few years, men have been admitted as members so that they can give feedback and be engaged as agents of positive change. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I hope this explains a bit better what the old Aware has been up to. They may not directly give charity to “help the lower rung” but they do help improve women's lives and consequently their children's lives  - by advocating changes in law, to eliminate abuse and to ask for equal rights.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I am just sorry that at this time of writing, Aware is going through a very difficult time. As an old Aware member, I really hope to see Aware’s good work and inclusive stance continue. </span></p>

              <p><br>Yes, in 2007 Aware was active in lobbying for a change in the penal code so that marital rape is considered a crime. Prior to that, acts of sexual violence in a marriage was not considered a crime in Singapore. Aware was active in pushing to criminalise offenders so as to protect women from such violence.</p>
              <p>Aware was not able to achieve 100% what it wanted, but it was able to succeed to makine some progress in that direction. The penal code was amended so that a rape in a marriage is considered a crime if the wife had a) obtained a decree of judicial separation b) obtained a personal protection order, or c) obtained an injunction against her husband restraining him from having sex with her.</p>
              <p>Of course in reality, many wives seldom even move to obtain any of these 3 legal protection so it is really not easy to prosecute a rapist husband. Still, Rome was not built in one day and some progress is better than none. </p>
              <p>And for your second question, yes I will be attending the EGM and making my vote count.</p>

              <p>Hi TYING,</p>
              <p>You are welcome!</p>
              <p>And in respond to your question - I am an old Aware member (for at least 3 years) and I am also a Christian. But I support the old leaders at Aware, not the new exco.</p>
              <p>I support the old Aware because of its original founding beliefs - which is to be  secular and inclusive irrespective of race, religion, gender or sexuality. I support them because they have been liberal, moderate and have made improvements for women over the years. </p>
              <p>I do  not support the new exco, and would not do so just because they are fellow Christians. Throughout history, fellow Christians have also stolen, raped and murdered (just check out major events in history like the Crusades, the Inquisition and the Salem witch hunts just to mention a few famous ones - all condoned by the religions establishment of the day, all done in the "name of God".) </p>
              <p>I judge the new exco base on their actions, and what they have said to the media. Although the new exco members have won their positions constituitionally, they have not done so in a dignified or honorable way. I feel that whoever is giving them moral support from their church to do what they are doing, is doing great disservice to Christianity and to women in general.</p>
              <p>I am still not sure if the old Aware members will succeed tomorrow since we may be out-numbered by the new exco's supporters, many whom are likely to be from their church. But if the old Aware does not get enough votes of no-confidence against the new team, it is a sad day for moderates and liberals like me and a very sad day for Christianity and women.</p>

              <p><br>It will definately be a sad day for civil society.</p>
              <p>Actually, the whole saga is quite comic, like a cartoon.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Once upon a time, a team of would-be new Aware exco members conducted a silent infiltration exercise, followed by a surprise siege and conquer programme. They then retreated into their fortress, changed the locks and threw out the gate-keeper. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Despite all the noise below, they refuse to respond to the petty questions nor engage with the lowly commoners, preferring to keep their “dignified silence” (in the words of President Josie Lau). But the noise got louder, the tower got too claustrophobic and the new conquerors started to get death threats (holy cow! What is the world coming to?). </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Finally, they decided to come out and defend themselves. They screamed and cried, threshing their feet like children squealing: “Why don’t people like us? Why do people attack us? We have won it fair and square! (refer to new exco press conference on YouTube) If you bully us, we will tell our mommy! (Dr Thio Su Mien)"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Fearing another battle, they called for reinforcements (other church members). Their sisterhood cried: “We must support our sisters!”. One of their leaders cried: “God has drawn a line and it MUST NOT BE CROSSED!” (the words of Pastor Derek Hong).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Everyday, the new exco try their best to maintain the invisible line (which only they can see because they are the chosen ones) making sure that it is not crossed – as if their lives depended on it. “Anyone who cross this line must be shot!” they tell themselves. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">They are waiting for the second battle, they know they will not loose because God is on their side. They believe that if they win, they will be heroines. If they loose,<span>  </span>then it is God’s will – but at least, they will still be martyrs. "</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">ok, just some satirical entertainment on the situation as reported in the papers. Just me being a bit naughty. </span></p>

              <p><br> It will definately be a sad day for civil society.</p>
              <p>Actually, the whole saga is quite comic, like a cartoon.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'>"Once upon a time, a team of
              would-be new Aware exco members conducted a silent infiltration
              exercise, followed by a surprise siege and conquer programme. They
              then retreated into their fortress, changed the locks and threw out
              the gate-keeper.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'>Despite all the noise below, they
              refuse to respond to the petty questions nor engage with the lowly
              commoners, preferring to keep their “dignified silence” (in the
              words of President Josie Lau). But the noise got louder, the tower
              got too claustrophobic and the new conquerors started to get death
              threats (holy cow! What is the world coming to?).</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'>Finally, they decided to come out
              and defend themselves. They screamed and cried, threshing their
              feet like children squealing: “Why don’t people like us? Why do
              people attack us? We have won it fair and square!” (refer to new
              exco press conference on YouTube)</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'>Fearing another battle, they called
              for reinforcements (other church members). Their sisterhood cried:
              “We must support our sisters!”. One of their leaders cried: “God
              has drawn a line and it MUST NOT BE CROSSED!” (the words of Pastor
              Derek Hong).</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'>Everyday, the new exco try their
              best to maintain the invisible line (which only they can see
              because they are the chosen ones) making sure that it is not
              crossed – as if their lives depended on it. “Anyone who cross this
              line must be shot!” they tell themselves.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'>They are waiting for the second
              battle, they know they will not loose because God is on their side.
              They believe that if they win, they will be heroines. If they
              loose,<span> </span> then it is God’s will – but at
              least, they will still be martyrs. "</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'>ok, just some satirical
              entertainment on the situation as reported in the papers. Just me

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I do agree with you it is not such a simple matter as “those with religion are good/bad and those without are good/bad”. It is not so black and white, so I disagree with AndrewPKYap that religion should be banned. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Karl Marx said that “religion is the opiate (aka opium) of the masses” and he believes that removing religion will give people happiness. But does it? Communism, base on Marx’s idealogy, banned religion but they have created a society that is hollow and sad, and squashed many people’s natural longing for the divine. It is just another dictatorship (animal farm, snort, snort)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So to each his own I say.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But indeed religion and religious people have also contributed a lot to the world, setting up schools, building hospitals, promoting human rights. It’s just that they are other religious people who use religion to abuse. Sad, year?</span></p>
