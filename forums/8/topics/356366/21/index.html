              <blockquote>
              <p>Government states that homosexual has a place in society and should be free; that is of course by means that all wishes to understand it in such a way. But philosophically, isn't the connotative message made by the government clear enough, as such that it would have been relevant to what I have quote with the "...". When the government recognizes our society as conservative and traditional, all of us should have been able to decipher the message: homosexuals are going to stay underground till the day goverment says yes, and publicly announce the acception of them. The only reason government states they are free, and has a place in society was in due fact that nothing could be done in reality and moreover the homosexuals has their liberal rights as human in law terms, unless they are actively promoting homosexualism in public.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Fact is, they r not promoting their gay lifestyle prior to the incident happend at AWARE. I do not recall any gay rally or gay protests or gay publicity and we r living out lives and they r living theirs.</p>
              <p>Now the issue is on education. Surely we should educate people on issues such as homosexual and sex to the children because it is critical to them. If we cover our ears and eyes, who knows we may end up like philipines with a high rate of teenage mothers. Talking about them bring knowledge, awareness and can tackle the problem as informed individual. U think not telling people about homosexual will make hmosexual suddenly become straight and reproduce like rabbits ? U think the AWARE saga, press, forums, internet, peers, hollywood movies does not inform them of the existence of gays ?</p>
              <p>Now lets say a child come over and confess he is a homosexual. R u gonna condemn him, send him to IMH and then tell him he got an incurable diesease ? Or r u gonna tell him to accept life as it is and not be depressed over it. Wat is your choice ?</p>
              <p>BTW, it is already explicitly mentioned tat 377A is not going to be actively enforced.</p>
              <p><em>In his concluding speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong highlighted the point that Singapore remained, as a whole, a conservative society uncomfortable with the notion of homosexuality. Thus to repeal Section 377A could result in a severe schism within the nation. However, in recognition of the fact that homosexuals do contribute to the country, <strong>Section 377A would not be actively enforced. Homosexuals would be left to lead their private lives without harassment</strong></em></p>
              <p>from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_377A_of_the_Penal_Code_(Singapore">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_377A_of_the_Penal_Code_(Singapore</a>)</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>There's duality in things I guess. Saying no to homosexuals was due to the violation of human nature in their terms (religious term you call it), while some accepted them due to the consensus that everyone shares equal human rights. Stucked between the complex ideologies of human's advancement in to the new aeon of chaos and, and humanity's theological views of morals and virtues; what will you choose to follow?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Nah.. I think we view the issues differently.</p>
              <p>To me, it is a case of "discrimination" vs "conservative". Homosexual did not commit any offence or cause harm to society. There is nothing "moral" or "virtues" about the whole issue. In fact I view them as harmful as unmarried religious figures, unmarried singles, married couples who do did not plan to reproduce etc. There r singles tat publicly tell people not to marry and follow their lifestyle (which may include having multiple sex partners) which all religions as well as conservative society frowns about too. Why r they free to broadcast their thinkings while homosexual r discriminated upon even by educating their existence?</p>
              <p>The only reason why i see such a targeted attack on them is basically because some book interprete homosexuals should be stoned (while ignoring other laws such as women keeping absolute silence in church and cover up their head while slavery is highly welcome and women r worth half of men)</p>
              <p>There is really no other physical real reason behind such mentality. So if u r a person who do not believe such a traditional book, why will u discriminate gay ?</p>

              <p>  The law is eminent, and so is 377A. Singapore government does not engage in futile acts nor unecessary integration of campaigns; that is the nation's ruling we all know. I believe none of the citizens out there can deny the existence of 377A nor contemplate for its reason being there yet, supposedly "would not be actively enforced"; the point is: there is no such thing as "would not be actively enforced in law terms. The book of law states every single actively enforced laws, there is no pseudo-enforcement. I am sure of, that everyone of us know its existence undeniably.</p>
              <p>  The government as a body stated that "<em>Singapore remained, as a whole, a conservative society uncomfortable with the notion of homosexuality"; </em>hasn't that been clear and precise in the connotative meaning the government has to convey to very of us? It is very crystal clear in its meaning. I would say that "<em>However, in recognition of the fact that homosexuals do contribute to the country"</em>  was due to the unremovable liberal rights of humanity found in every human being, and then in to a subset of the nation, they are the citizens and the government could not simply strip them of their citizenship nor deny them. The government cannot dictate the freedom of these homosexuals, yet they couldn't allow the influence of homosexuality to spread like wild fire throughout the nation. It is an inevitable way for the government to be announcing this issue in an oxymoron way.</p>
              <p>  I would like everyone to call for better understanding of the Religions via its reasons and approach. All of us must, understand that the Religious leaders though taking their vows of celibacy, they should not dictate the freewill of believers and the public: and if there is, there has to be a reason; a theological reason, a language that these Religious leaders spoke of. Of course there are Religious leaders who became extreme in the enforcement of these Law of God, dictating the freedom of people; but that is not all that you see which gives you the reason to repeat their errors in resonance to the public, the world. We must, as a whole world understand that these Religious leaders are humans, they are who we are and are made in nature to err! It is through the very foundation of the grace of forgiveness and understanding that things can truely be solved.</p>
              <p>  I am no Catholic or member of the Church, but during my studies in Montfort Secondary School, Christianity does not seemed to revolve about book; transcends beyond the utility of Bible. Christianity, is the God's cradle, where in its heart you find the beautiful morals and virtues, not of events referenced from Bible, not of discrimination, not of conservative. Christianity is about Faith, not of events referencing that leads to Belief. It is the believe in God, God's existence, God's love for the people, not of the commandments and rules which are alter-able. Christianity is about loving God and entrusting in Him.</p>
              <p>  The word Conservative should never be used on Christianity and on other religions. The Church is old, indeed; but it sees the negativism of an ongoing world in progression, and if there is no one to halt the world; it could led to the pandemic of diseases in humanity, not just of the physical world we see and touch with senses. The world, our society is young, brashful, naive; we see that progression is required, but we are lost in the midst of our inventions and the benefits we received, but we reluctantly talks about the birth of negativism in our invention till the day our existence are threatened by the overwhelming of it.</p>
              <p>  I wouldn't mind the acception of homosexuals. But what if, the whole world was transformed in to half a population is what seemingly belongs to that of the homosexuals; have you realised how big the pandemic is that actually struck hard in the lives of people? In the lives of the Religious people? In Humanity? That will be a day fulfilled, if the world continues to disencourage the Church and many other religions, to disregard their opinions, to renounce them. It is sad, to see the fall of humanity in such a way. I do not discriminate the homosexuals, but the world is indeed as complicated as I have said; it is not about simply deciding what you think its right by the experimentation of studying something in its own existing term. I have mentioned that the world is torned between the duality of things which led to the pseudo realism of everything, and that accounts for alot of the events in Humanity in fact. Everyone of us, including myself, we all seemed to over look the duality of things, and we chose to believe in what we believe in, in what we think its right, and in what we think its wrong. We obstinately try to oppose, to prove the others wrong; but we have not, we merely lied to ourselves. That if the world is as such simply about: I should believe in what I believe and prove and reason that what we believe is right and theirs are wrong; the world would not have been today. To excercise Grace upon Humanity is the important factor.</p>
              <p>  All of us know the truths about the existence of Religion, especially when rebuking</p>
              <p>"In fact I view them as harmful as unmarried religious figures, unmarried singles, married couples who do did not plan to reproduce etc. There r singles tat publicly tell people not to marry and follow their lifestyle (which may include having multiple sex partners) which all religions as well as conservative society frowns about too."</p>
              <p>We always know the truths about Religions. Is in the mind. You rebuke clergymen only because you know that Religion should not have turned out the way it is.</p>
              <p>  The education about homosexuality, I believe you meant Moral Education about co-existing with homosexuality :)</p>
              <p>  Truth is, homosexuals are there because it is in nature that they are, or relatively influenced. Which to what I feel strongly, is about the facets of influence that caused the growth of numbers in homosexuals.</p>
              <p>AWARE don't really have to be the one tackling it. In fact every single family should be tackling the problem. AWARE, as an organization has much greater calling on other important issues than what the face value of things would not have outlined.</p>
              <p>  Do not say no harm to things that seemed not to on the outer aspects; you never know how harmless that it can be that actually caused the most destructive damage.</p>
              <p>  Again, I stand here, just like that of the Government being neutral, reminding of everyone to realize that there are possibility of things, and duality of issues; it is therefore that we study carefully and be impartial when excercising our judgements, before we put across conclusions which might have seemed rather bias.</p>
              <p>  Whatever it is, let things take on its natural course. Next thread, enjoy people.</p>

              <p>Lets see some of the things tat u have touched. Allow me to do a summary. u can choose to disagree later</p>
              <p>1. U feel there is no such thing as a law tat is not enforced actively. U interprete the gov actions as wanting to ban homosexual but allow them to stay becuase of universal human rights</p>
              <p>2. U believe christianity is about trusting god and god is beautiful in creating many virtues and morals</p>
              <p>3. U feel christianity is not associated with conservative</p>
              <p>4. If christian do not stop homosexual, they will spread and half of the world's population may become homosexual. If we renounce religion, humanity will fall</p>
              <p>5. U believe everybody believe in god and its truth in their heart</p>
              <p>6. The whole society should be tackling the issue of homosexual as they numbers r growing</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well, here is my response to it</p>
              <p>1) The gov is prepared to ban 377A once and for all before a group of people protest against it. They lobbied and pushed and force the law to be in existence even though it is discriminatory. In the end, the law is just symbolic. tis can be found in wikipedia</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_377A_of_the_Penal_Code_(Singapore">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_377A_of_the_Penal_Code_(Singapore</a>)</p>
              <p><em> In view of the lack of precedent of there being a law in the Penal Code <strong>retained only for symbolic reasons, not to be enforced</strong>, plus the ambiguity over what constituted "gross indecency," and the repeal of the original Section 377 criminalising carnal intercourse against the order of nature, some academic lawyers have argued that ironically, homosexual anal sex in Singapore was no longer illegal even though homosexual oral sex still was.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> 2, 3) Well the bible do states many laws. Many is still relevant up till now but most end up being unpractised. Even christians and catholics knew tat god overhauled all his old laws after jesus appear. And even among the new laws, a lot end up being unpractised too such as women rights etc.</p>
              <p>U tell me how beautiful god is etc but it is as useful as buddhist telling u how weak god is relative to the way to nirvana. Unless u can come out with real practical reasons, telling me your impression of your religion is pointless in tis discussion. And the church had known to be giving very conservatives views on the real world. They had stated the world is flat before, sun revolves around earth, world is relatively young, reject evolution, support slavery, support inquisition, support crusades, women should be kept in tight control by men etc. From the perspective of hindsight now, it is clear tat the church had on numerous occasions adopted conservative issues tat is not feasible now.</p>
              <p>4,5) u tell us wat <em>if</em> the world is half homosexual. Tat scenario is really far fetched and pretty unrealistic from tis time frame. Why don't I ask wat if half of the world population become catholic fathers ? They all don't reproduce and the consequences is equally bad. The world will fall as badly as of half of the world population becoming homosexual.</p>
              <p>Now u say tat if we continue to renounce religion, mankind will fall. IMO, human progression is impeded by religion. And tis view is not because I act rebellious or something but because I sincerely, truely, thoroughly do not believe in the existence of god up tis point in time. From my point of view, it appears tat religious people r lying to themselves, to delude themselves in the existence of unverifiable supernatural events instead.</p>
              <p>It may appear strange to u but I am from Montfort Sec myself but I do not believe in catholic</p>
              <p>6) If u ask me, the challenge for the world is to remove homosexual discrimination and not their growing numbers. I do not support homosexual from publicising their lifestyle but I do not support discrimination against them by claiming they r anti humanity and degenerative and not even educating on their existence. I see no real crimes committed by them to society and they can choose the things they wanna do for their life. I also feel homosexual should be educated to the youth in singapore in an unbiased scientific manner. I also do not believe educating people about the existence of homosexual will make people suddenly become homosexual.</p>

              <p>I agree with u on tis. However tis is not the real issue. How about education then ? Should we educate their existence or just "cover up" ? Should it be a neutral term or "degenerative" ?</p>

              <p>  I don't need to read that wall of text in reply to what I have said, I knew it is going to be one that tries to pick and point and finding of faults. Frankly I laughed, not because I couldn't retaliate to those "Extreme Questions" and accusations; I laughed at the folly of people denying and proving others at large for what they believe to be unexisting.</p>
              <p>  My dear stupidsmart, you have answered the argument well enough through the use of words and language; but it seems like you have forgotten to answer what it should have been the heart of my thesis. And it seems like you have not found the equilibrium of things that is mentioned in my thesis, unfortunately, which is the heart of the topic. I understand clearly about your stand, but apparently, it seems more of one that wishes to tackle down any opposition arguments in an unmeaningful way without looking at how the overall explanation is expressed in a certainly well balanced meaning.</p>
              <p>  How radical or acceptable is our thoughts or thesis; I believe readers tell the best, they will know the truth, it cannot be hidden. This is not an argument of proving each other wrong, as I have resonated throughout my previous texts; it is finding and understanding the equilibrium of things due to its duality in nature, and that in as many ways as things can be bad, there are as many ways, it can be good. And that it is because of in duality, that is why we have our world, a world stranded between the duality nature.</p>
              <p>  As I have mentioned earlier, that the essence of things are of duality, and that accounts for the actions of Church and the modern world. We need not be extreme and outrageous enough to count the number of mistakes the Church makes; count the number of rights they did, you will be surprised. But I am not astounded by the fact that much of the people wouldn't, afterall what is to be expected of those who lives in the current day of such chaotic society?</p>
              <p>  Those who strives difference rather than seeking the understanding of things in duality. The accusations and frequent raking up of the old feud, seemed more of a childish way, a foolish act of the laymen in attempt to give themselves excuse to be against the Church. Perhaps they did not realise what has the Church done out of grace to help the world.</p>
              <p>  Whether if there is no God, or there is; we have no rights to go to the extend of criticizing the Church in such manner; for what the Church has brought for mankind, the individuals like us could never have achieved it. Though one could raise up issues about perhaps how the Church might be heading in wrong direction, but certainly not degrading the Church for the glory of the Church for its achievement, is not as if laymen like us could contempt with, clearly. And only those, who hold the extremism belief against the Church, would have revolved again and again around their "Allegations of the wrongdoing of Church". Grace of forgiveness, is a universal language taught, and do not be overwhelmed by anger for it clouds your judgement; that, a common term used among us laymen, is clearly an answer for those who has devoted themselves in to the faults of the others. I say bury the hatchet, but then soon the reply will come saying that the Church has commited mistakes unforgivable. Then I say look at the good things the Church has done; the reply will come swiftly denying all that the good of Church like an epidemic, leaving pain and bitterness. And then I said be neutral, be understanding, the reply will come saying that I am an accomplice of the Church. How glorified that for so many centuries, the Church has tried to please these people in many ways it can, and that alone explains the achievement of the Church that has far explained and account for the mistakes it made.</p>
              <p>  Do remember that whatever that is said, proclaimed, replied reflects the way of your life as a human, and of your thoughts, and your conscience; especially when making serious accusations. There is no definite answer to whether the acceptance of homosexuals, there is only what seems to be the duality of things in nature.</p>
              <p>  Let all those who can see, sees what the truth is; let all those who can hear, hears the truth.</p>

              <p>Perhaps you have been mistaken because you said the homosexials are trying to promote their lifestyles on the heterosexuals but I am sure that is just based on your own thought and assumption - "cool, modern" whatever. Where is your source?</p>
              <p>And homosexual is a sexual orientation, it is not a trend or whatsoever. It had got nothing to do with cool, hip, modern, whatever. Just like being straight. Is being straight equate to cool? That is quite absurd, isn't it?</p>
              <p>Nobody is asking you to 'become' homosexual. You are who you are.</p>

              <p>Wrong, homosexuality and hetreosexuality are not mutually exclusive statuses, there is a status known as bisexuality.</p>
              <p>I want to question you on your posting on approving people's lifestyles based on sexual orientation. Do you actually mean:please do not inform me of your sexual orientation or do not inform me of your acts of sexual passion? Personally, I do not mind being informed of someone's sexual orientation but I do mind if someone's personal intimacies are being described publicly, hetreosexual or not.</p>

              <p>No, I accept homosexuals as people and as friends.  I don't share their views and orientation, but as long as they don't try to sell it to me, I'm okay with them.  Its almost sickening to hear how some blacksheep among them making it sound like, "you don't share our beliefs means you don't condone our existence and want to oppress us!"  Its like forcing the entire heterosexual society to convert to homosexuality or they will cry bully.  I almost feel like I'm held at gunpoint. </p>
              <p>I think everyone needs to take a step back. The homosexuals need to take a chill pill about 377A.  Singapore is not that much of a surveillance state to be able to enforce that.  The rest of the heterosexual communities need to stop ostracising them as fellow men and women. </p>
              <p>Just because you don't share another person's beliefs and opinions, doesn't make them "less human" than you are. </p>

              <p>Wrong, homosexuality and hetreosexuality are not mutually
              exclusive statuses, there is a status known as bisexuality.</p>
              <p>I want to question you on your posting on approving people's
              lifestyles based on sexual orientation. Do you actually mean:please
              do not inform me of your sexual orientation or do not inform me of
              your acts of sexual passion? Personally, I do not mind being
              informed of someone's sexual orientation but I do mind if someone's
              personal intimacies are being described publicly, hetreosexual or
              not.</p>

              <p>The way I see it, bisexuality is part of the homosexuality set.</p>
              <p>Heterosexuality as I define is the sexual attraction to the opposite sex and ONLY the opposite sex.   now known a  "A"</p>
              <p>Bisexuality is as I believe, sexual attraction to both genders.  which is "A-inverse"</p>
              <p>Homosexuality, sexual attraction to the same gender. which is also "A-inverse"</p>
              <p>And I believe, the way I see, is also largely in line with the rest of the more conservative heterosexual society.   This is my world view (possibly "our" world view) on this matter.</p>
              <p>However, why should a person's "world view" of anything make one a lesser person just because his/her world view different or non-dominant?</p>

              <p><br>You are forgetting one more sexuality worldview, the asexuals. I think marriage and civil union rights and family rights does make a person feel lesser.</p>

              <p>rofl, don't you ever learn to read?? we are at the very least governed by the law. any moral values are at least governed by the law.</p>
              <p>right now, the government stand is, the alternative lifestyle is against the law (even though it's not being actively pursued). so yes, it is a moral issue, right now until the law changes.</p>
              <p>religion has nothing to do about it - rather it's culture and, again, the laws of the state. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>Moral values are not governed by law,and if it is so, which set of moral values does one adhere to, you self-masturbating bastard. General moral values are defined by the people of a society but usually differs across religious lines. Laws of a nation does help enforce certain moral values but are powerless when faced with moral values stemming from different religions.</p>
