              <p>Oh I see. I can only say why the numbers in Aware has been stagnating in the past few years. It's just like most Singaporeans who are quite apolitical, a bit bo-chap. Like what ex-Aware President Kanwijit Soin said during the old guard press conference recently, Aware is made up of a lot of moderate, liberal people  - and moderate/liberal ppl are actually quite laid back and easy going, as long as things are ok, anything goes for them.</p>
              <p>I am one of those people. You know for 3 years I was are Aware I never go to AGM to vote for exco? I just volunteer at the crisis helpline as a volunteer but I always felt that things are well taken care of at the committee level by those smart and articulate women - there's really not much I need to do. Blah...so wrong. I am so guilty. Only now when Aware is in crisis then I realise how much I value its secular and inclusive stance.</p>
              <p>So this is my confession piece. I think some people will scold me already - for being partly responsible for the coup by the new exco. Sigh...I accept the bashing.</p>

              <p><br>Thanks.</p>
              <p>Anyway, tomorrow once I come back from the Aware EOGM, I will try to update you guys on what transpired. Will try to go earlier and get a ring-side seat. I heard that there may be so many people there may not be enough seats so EOGM start at 2 to 5 pm but entry starts at 12 noon.</p>
              <p>Must go early for briefing also becoz Old Aware people will give info kit on the issues involved, and also brief all supporters to ensure that they carry themselves in an orderly, dignified way. So that is a good move coz emotions can run high and in a room with thousands passionate women, some of whom are quite angry,  stilletoes make very good weapons - no wonder they are called "killer heels", haha!</p>

              <p><br> Yes, in 2007 Aware was active in lobbying for a change in the penal
              code so that marital rape is considered a crime. Prior to
              that, acts of sexual violence in a marriage was not considered
              a crime in Singapore. Aware was active in pushing to
              criminalise offenders so as to protect women from such
              violence.</p>
              <p>Aware was not able to achieve 100% what it wanted, but it
              was able to succeed to makine some progress in that direction. The
              penal code was amended so that a rape in a marriage is considered a
              crime if the wife had a) obtained a decree of judicial separation
              b) obtained a personal protection order, or c) obtained an
              injunction against her husband restraining him from having sex
              with her.</p>
              <p>Of course in reality, many wives seldom even move to obtain
              any of these 3 legal protection so it is really not easy to
              prosecute a rapist husband. Still, Rome was not built in one
              day and some progress is better than none. </p>
              <p>And for your second question, yes I will be attending the EGM
              and making my vote count.</p>

              <p>Thanks for answering my question Maggie. though I believe justice delayed is justice denied but oh well I'll make do with those incremental steps!</p>
              <p>Wishing the old guard all the best and if you do reclaim Aware, I probably won't mind helping out as a volunteer when i head back to Singapore this summer :P As a duty to ALL fellow singaporean women</p>

              <p>Oh I see. I can only say why the numbers in Aware has been stagnating in the past few years. It's just like most Singaporeans who are quite apolitical, a bit bo-chap. Like what ex-Aware President Kanwijit Soin said during the old guard press conference recently, Aware is made up of a lot of moderate, liberal people  - and moderate/liberal ppl are actually quite laid back and easy going, as long as things are ok, anything goes for them.</p>
              <p>I am one of those people. You know for 3 years I was are Aware I never go to AGM to vote for exco? I just volunteer at the crisis helpline as a volunteer but I always felt that things are well taken care of at the committee level by those smart and articulate women - there's really not much I need to do. Blah...so wrong. I am so guilty. Only now when Aware is in crisis then I realise how much I value its secular and inclusive stance.</p>
              <p>So this is my confession piece. I think some people will scold me already - for being partly responsible for the coup by the new exco. Sigh...I accept the bashing.</p>

              <p>So it is a bit like urban renewal. The kampong is suddenly being slated for redevelopment.</p>
              <p>Except for the Christian element, I am all for renewal.</p>
              <p>I would prefer AWARE membership to be of 300 women of all races, and faiths, economic status than 1000 women of Christian faith.</p>

              <p>Certainly they would have to account for the money when pressed to do so, even without a lawsuit. AWARE's constitution clearly stated that any monthly expenditure in excess of $20k would require approval of the members.</p>
              <p>Even after allowing for $20k to rent the Suntec convention hall, and another $20k for day-to-day operations in one month, there seems to be quite a fair bit of money unaccounted for, considering that $90k was spent in all over the previous month.</p>
              <p>They owe the members a proper accounting no matter what. The members would want to know what that extra money was spent on, regardless of its purpose.</p>

              <p>My speculations:</p>
              <p>Josie Lau will denied any link between her and the $90K bill. This is extremely important for her as DBS will definitely take action if she is found to be responsible. I guess the honorary treasurer who had supported her fully on Talking Point will take the hit.</p>
              <p>Josie Lau may play the "I kana death threats" card, although I'm not sure how it will help her and her exco, other than perhaps winning a handful of sympathy points.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I think there is not much she can do now except to resign.</p>
