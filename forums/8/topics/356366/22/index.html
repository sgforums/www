              <p>Wah liew... you looking for an online sparring partner
              issit?</p>
              <p>No, I accept homosexuals as people and as friends.  I don't
              share their views and orientation, but as long as they don't try to
              sell it to me, I'm okay with them.  Its almost sickening to
              hear how some blacksheep among them making it sound like, "you
              don't share our beliefs means you don't condone our existence and
              want to oppress us!"  Its like forcing the entire heterosexual
              society to convert to homosexuality or they will cry bully.  I
              almost feel like I'm held at gunpoint. </p>
              <p>I think everyone needs to take a step back. The homosexuals need
              to take a chill pill about 377A.  Singapore is not that much
              of a surveillance state to be able to enforce that.  The rest
              of the heterosexual communities need to stop ostracising them as
              fellow men and women. </p>
              <p>Just because you don't share another person's beliefs and
              opinions, doesn't make them "less human" than you are. </p>

              <p>no ah, disagree with you means sparring meh? means cannot disagree with you?</p>
              <p>its because u are contradicting urself in ur first posts</p>
              <p>if homosexuals ''force'' the heterosexuals to condone their existence or anything, isnt it the same as you accepting them which you did willingly..so where is the pressure?</p>
              <p>i dont know who is more confused about themselves, anti gays or pro gays, seriously...</p>

              <p>I guess maybe tat is the whole problem <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> U guys don't read wat the other side has to say</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>How radical or acceptable is our thoughts or thesis; I believe readers tell the best, they will know the truth, it cannot be hidden. This is not an argument of proving each other wrong, as I have resonated throughout my previous texts; it is finding and understanding the equilibrium of things due to its duality in nature, and that in as many ways as things can be bad, there are as many ways, it can be good. And that it is because of in duality, that is why we have our world, a world stranded between the duality nature.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Sure there is duality and equilibrium in issues in the world. WIth the right amount of positive and negative, it can result in neutrality. (such as ph, charge etc)</p>
              <p>The debate however is always on where is the equivalent point. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> On your side it means not even educating people wat is homosexual, or branding them as anti humanity, degenerative and should be treated as dieseased individual who should feel bad about themselves for the rest of their lives and pressured to have sex with things they r not interested in. For my stand is the equivalent point is to educate people rightly tat homosexual is neutral, they should have the right to live their life without fear or guilt BUT they should not go about promoting their lifestyle.</p>
              <p>Tis is already something which I had asked on multiple occasions (on education) which u had ignored for many occasions. Where is your idead of equivalent pt ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>As I have mentioned earlier, that the essence of things are of duality, and that accounts for the actions of Church and the modern world. We need not be extreme and outrageous enough to count the number of mistakes the Church makes; count the number of rights they did, you will be surprised. But I am not astounded by the fact that much of the people wouldn't, afterall what is to be expected of those who lives in the current day of such chaotic society?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>U r talking about duality of things isn't it ? Well u have been promoting how good the church was and tat they shouldn't be branded as "conservative" and always like a beacon of light to humanity and so I simply point the other way and show u how "conservative" they r in many issues and how many massacres and disasters they had created in human history. Then everyone know the arguments of both side and then seek to find an equivalent pt (which may not be common to both) Some people had also used the church for a justification of truth and obviously the other side of the camp had to show many issues which they had been wrong.</p>
              <p>Surely u don't expect people to just agree with everything u had written and not show u the duality of matters. Doesn't tat show it is normal in a debate tat criticism arise and therefore it is your job to criticise the other person stand (<strong>rather than really asking people not to criticise</strong>)</p>
              <p>Maybe u should start telling wat is the right thing they had done to society in detail and highlight certain events other than claiming they done a lot of right things rather than expecting no one should criticise. Then doesn't it become a one way propaganda ?</p>

              <p>I'm fine with homosexuals and they are pretty okay people.  However, I do not approve of their "lifestyle" with reference to their sexual orientation.  As long as they keep those views and lifestyle to themselves, I feel inclined to live and let live.</p>
              <p>But, it seems that some of them are pushing an agenda to create acceptance of their "lifestyle" on a societal level and that has created the tensions we see now.  One worry is that, letting them through with this agenda, a homosexual condoning society slowly becomes influenced to be homosexual approving.  </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>How come I feel all anti homo people come out with the same arguments repeatedly...</p>
              <p>1) Homosexual shouldn't publicise their lifestyle</p>
              <p>I think most people, including me, agree to tis stand. There is no disagreement here</p>
              <p>2) It is felt tat homosexual r promoting their lifestyle in singapore</p>
              <p>Before the AWARE saga, please tell me wat had the homosexual done in promoting their lifestyle in singapore ? If I am not wrong, the issue is AWARE is teaching people tat homosexual is neutral. Wat is wrong with tat ? I have been asking repeatedly wat should educating about homosexual be about ? Should we give minimal information and let them know from their peers (who could be homosexual) and internet or hollywood movies or should we provide as much critical and true knowledge as possible for them to be well informed ?</p>
              <p>3) Then they start to bash homosexual</p>
              <p>In tis case</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Heterosexuality or homosexuality are mutually exclusive status.  You can be one, but not the other. Hence, the conflict cause debates over this tends to be overheated and rowdy.  Honestly, I say live and let live, but don't try to influence each other.</p>
              <p>A man is free to choose between apples and oranges.  Don't let another man come along and force an orange down your throat when you don't like it. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>If I do not read the beginning of your passage, i thought u r pro homosexual. To me, there r a lot of people here who really do not practise live and let live and said tat homosexual r a bane to society and is a pandemic to humanity. And people like Thio from the ex new exco had said she "counselled" homosexual to become heterosexual. I think religious people r the one forcing a man to swallow an orange when he like apple. Otherwise can u provide information on which homosexual in singapore had force a heterosexual to become homosexual ?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The way I see it, bisexuality is part of the homosexuality set.</p>
              <p>Heterosexuality as I define is the sexual attraction to the opposite sex and ONLY the opposite sex.   now known a  "A"</p>
              <p>Bisexuality is as I believe, sexual attraction to both genders.  which is "A-inverse"</p>
              <p>Homosexuality, sexual attraction to the same gender. which is also "A-inverse"</p>
              <p>And I believe, the way I see, is also largely in line with the rest of the more conservative heterosexual society.   This is my world view (possibly "our" world view) on this matter.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Actually I feel tis is one point shotgun had made which made me feel strongly against. Homosexual, by definition, is attraction to the same sex. Beastiality, is probably people who is attracted to have sex with species of animals other than their own species. If u ask me, there is 2 different gauges in here. One is attraction to their own sex and the other gauge is on animals. They r not the same gauge, and people who r found to commit beastiality r mostly farmers instead of homosexuals</p>
              <p>If u incorrectly force two different gauges (attraction to same sex and attraction to beast) to be the same gauge, then I can also use two different gauges and force them to be the same. One gauge is belief in science or religion and the other gauge is IQ high or low. I incorrectly force the belief in science instead of religion to reflect higher IQ and then concluding tat religious people have low IQ. Obviously tat is wrong. And so is your belief tat homosexual = beastiality simply because they do not like people from the opposite sex</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;"><img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/463/5-7-Feature1.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="250"></span></p>

In the run up to that fateful meeting, membership swelled and everyone from ministers to Ministers weighed in—the very soul of the organization seemed to hang in the balance.<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        Now that Aware has disappeared from the headlines and its original intent seems secure, how is the Association of Women for Action and Research moving on from this debilitating and divisive episode? Certainly, the organization has more talent and momentum than ever before—and an unrivalled platform to push its causes.  But it also has something of an image problem, with many people who were previously unaware of Aware forming perceptions based on the hardened tactics of battle. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">         Aware’s once more-again new president, Dana Lam, and her newly elected Executive Committee are picking up the pieces and working to get the organization on its feet as quickly as possible.  <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">         “The first task will be to get our house in order,” says Lam. “We need to review our internal processes and strengthen our systems. The new Executive Committee has only been in office for a month, and during that time, we’ve had to soothe our center staff who have been frazzled by the events of the past few weeks and also touch base with our sponsors, to reassure them that we’ve got our act together.”<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        Lam is already on her toes to ensure that the new volunteers who’ve recently joined Aware are properly managed. “I’m quite anxious; the younger folks have shorter attention spans and are always readily enthusiastic to get things going quickly,” she says. “They can come to you once, twice and three times offering their help, but it takes time to respond and fit them in; if you don’t get back to them swiftly, you’ll lose them.”<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        The newly expanded database of over 3,000 members is one success of the May 2 Extraordinary General Meeting (EOGM) that Lam is keen to count on and to work with. “The EOGM was an immensely rewarding experience,” says Lam. “Many new members may have already gotten used to the fix of instant results; but it’s much slower when it comes to seeing the fruits of our labor on the issues we work on. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        “Some of that excitement will disappear; we will lose some members as we move along, because reality gets in the way, and they will go back to their old lives and jobs.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #000080;">Finances and Fundraising</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br>From an operational standpoint, the provision of new programs and services in the coming months will be reliant on what funds are left in the organization. After all, it was well-documented that the “new guard” Exco spent $90,000 in the one month they were in office. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        Aware’s new honorary treasurer, Tan Joo Hymn, is working flat out to ensure that there will be no repeat of financial excesses from here on. “By year end, we have to ensure that there is a comprehensive set of policies and guidelines in place for good financial management; one that is clearly communicated to all staff and volunteers,” says Tan. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        Aware’s overnight membership growth spurt doesn’t automatically equate to more finances available for more programs. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        “Contrary to the comments made by one supporter of the ousted Exco, increased membership will not recoup the $90,000,” claims Tan. “But rest assured, we won’t be trimming budgets; we’d instead like to raise more money to continue with our programs.”<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        Meanwhile, Lam says that she expects operating costs to rise on account of the increase in new members.<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        “Aware has to raise funds every month,” says Lam. “After doing our sums, we know that we have to raise $20,000 to cover our operating costs.”<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        Among its fund-raising initiatives, Aware teamed up with Wessex Theatre’s production of </span><em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: #000080;">Top Girls</span></em><span style="color: #000080;"> at the DBS Arts Centre, boosting its coffers with charity ticket sales. Another high-profile fund-raising drive is Flag Day in August. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        “Not only must we ensure that there are sufficient checks and balances in place for large expenditures, we are also hounding our fundraising sub-committee to ensure there is enough money for the next year,” says treasurer Tan.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #000080;">Not Entirely a Bad Thing</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br>Although the Executive Committee is currently in overdrive rebuilding the organization, Lam does not view the infamous saga in an entirely negative light, stating that it has given the group the opportunity to reaffirm its values and highlight the core reasons for its existence. The group’s mission, core values and agenda were well communicated in the “We Are Aware” campaign, which the present Executive Committee members mounted during the lead-up to the EOGM. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        “We now have this huge base of volunteers to call upon,” says Lam. “A lot of the new members have already started helping. One of our objectives is to make full use of new media, and members and volunteers have come forward to help with that.”<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        These members, who had signed up to defend a well-respected secular gender-equality advocacy group, bring with them a whole set of skills, from legal expertise, to administrative and organizational capabilities, to database systems know-how and even first-aid skills.<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        “Once we get ourselves more effectively organized, we would no longer have to engage people for IT and database services,” says Lam. “Likewise for legal matters, as we have a good number of lawyers who have come on board.”  <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        And these new volunteers will be channeled into the three main areas Aware focuses on, namely the direct services which provide emotional and psychological support through the Helpline, counseling and legal aid; the betterment of physical and economic well-being of women, such as sexuality education, self-defense, body image and self-esteem programs, and financial intelligence workshops; and intellectual development, where research is conducted in workshops and forums on areas such as work-life balance and sexual harassment. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        Lam says the group will continue to expand and develop the above three areas, and will have a line-up of new initiatives in the coming months. “We have not yet gone to the public with our new programs, as we have only just started plotting the direction we want to go,” says Lam.  <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        Braema Mathi, an ex-president of Aware, a former Nominated Member of Parliament and prominent civil society activist, agrees that some good has come out of this saga. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        “Without the blind self-righteousness of the old Executive Committee, we would not have seen that beautiful day of May 2 when so many women stood up to speak, ask and assert what they will not put up with—it was a beautiful moment of women coming into their own,” Mathi says.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #000080;">Soul Searching</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br>But there is no escaping the fact that the whole saga has made Aware sit up and re-look at the way it has run itself for the last 24 years. It also has to deal with the dilution of its image in the eyes of the public. While many people rose to defend the organization during the difficult period, questions surrounding its motives and agendas continue to dog Aware. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        “We’ve been hurt by harmful misrepresentations of a perceived ‘agenda’ by people who appear to have their own,” says Vice-President Chew I-Jin. “These people find feminism and its advancements in sexual politics a threat to the belief structures that they cling to.” <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        Lam meanwhile reaffirms that she has no regrets about taking a neutral view on homosexuality. “I will never apologize for saying that I take a neutral view to homosexuality,” she says. “I’m not for it or against it; for those who need a reminder, that’s what neutral means.” <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        She, however, said that she baulked when she saw an Aware-issued instructor guide for the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) program which said that anal sex could be neutral or healthy if a condom is used.  <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        “I was shocked to see such a thing in the booklet,” says Lam. “I don’t condone such views. But one has to realize the following: That line was in an instructor’s manual that was strictly confidential. It was not in any student manual. The previous Executive Committee took it out of context and posted it online in a deliberate smear campaign against us.”<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        The statement created such a ruckus that the MOE went from saying that there were no complaints about Aware’s CSE program from students, teachers and parents, to kicking it out of the program altogether. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        “That’s an example of how we need to strengthen our systems,” says Lam. “From now on, when we put out such guides, we need to conduct an internal review process that asks committee members whether they have any objections to the proposed texts within.”<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        Lam adds that Aware will review its CSE package and offer it at a later date to the MOE, which now has a more stringent policy on the outsourcing of schools’ sex-education to external vendors. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        The checks-and-balances approach will be mainstay of the organization as it proceeds from this juncture. Lam has also hinted, but not yet confirmed, that there will be a change to Aware’s constitution to ensure there’s no repeat of a “back door” takeover. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        Among the proposed amendments are rules that could require  members to volunteer with the group for a year before they can be elected to executive office. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        Also, as the group continues to soul search in the aftermath of the saga, ex-president Mathi weighs in wistfully with the thought that all the brouhaha could have been avoided if the “other party” had engaged the-then Executive Committee consultatively. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        “I am still affected that we went through all this for just one purpose—to ‘expose’ us as allegedly having a gay agenda and for sexuality education programs that seem to be problematic,” she says. “If one were that upset by our work, it could have been so easily settled by meeting the Aware Exco as a group of citizens who could raise their concerns—face-to-face, in a petition, in the forum pages… It did not need a takeover to ‘correct’ our ‘bad’ ways. It was the worst form of disrespect shown to an organization that has done more good work than bad. That still rankles.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #000080;">Misconceptions</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br>But the misconceptions remain; there are still large swathes of people who now view Aware in a dubious light, suspicious of its motives and agendas.  <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        “People now view us as having a homosexual agenda,” says executive member Nicole Tan. “The saga has set the organization back and we are being marginalized. But Singaporeans are pragmatic. At the end of the day, if we doggedly continue to deliver on our myriad of programs, public opinion will eventually be swayed.”<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        Another executive member, Hafizah Osman, counters the allegation that Aware is against Singaporean values. “Aware promotes gender equality, non-discrimination and non-violence against women,” she says. “How are these against Singapore’s societal values? Having said that, as an advocacy group and agent for change, we understand that the nature of our work can put us seemingly ‘out of step’ with the rest of society. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        “While we remain sensitive to divergent views, the nature of our organization is that we push the boundaries every so often.” <br>  <br></span><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #000080;">Onward with its Aims</span></strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br>While the factions battled out their standing over the past few weeks, Singaporean women continue to face issues where pat answers can’t be easily found—ranging from concerns for elderly women, to spousal abuse, teenage delinquencies, and sexual harassment in the work place. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        President Lam says that the group has not deviated from its main agenda since day one. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">         “The agenda has always been to develop a gender-based equality—to create opportunities for women, to strengthen women so that they can participate fully in society,” she says. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        Vice-President Chew meanwhile notes the following issues. “We need to help women to lead a balanced life without having to exploit another sector of women [foreign maids],” she says. “Another issue women face is how to go about avoiding the consumerist trap, which makes you feel like you have to keep up with the material aspirations of other Singaporeans. Another important issue is striving to have a positive body-image—everyone is so obsessed with their weight and appearance.”<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        Hafizah says that, perhaps the most important thing is to publicize the programs Aware has to offer—for example, the Helpline services. “It is important that women in distress, regardless race or religion, have access to the services they need,” she says. <br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        Mathi believes that Aware is equipped to deal with the challenges faced by women in Singapore. “Aware remains, till today, the strongest advocate on women’s issues,” she says. “That constancy has to be admired, as it is managed on sheer volunteer will.”<br></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000080;">        Over the next few weeks, Aware will firm up its programs for the coming year, review its standard operating procedures and continue with its work of making Singapore a gender-equal society. The saga has unleashed a huge torrent of goodwill toward Aware, and the ultimate question is whether the newly reinstated leaders can harness that momentum, navigate the tricky waters of public perception, institute closer management of Aware’s process and policy, and use the organization’s newfound fame to further women’s causes like never before. If so, the women of Singapore may be the ultimate winners from the episode, which is what everyone—old guard and new—said they wanted in the first place.</span></p>
