              <p>Whats more important I think number 1 for Singaporean women especially is the issue about working life, are working hours too long, why is there not enough babies, should there be flexible working hours, more maternity leave, why I say it is important, because in Singapore a lot of household have double-income, the woman work outside.</p>
              <p>Then another thing is, whether there is glass ceiling, and why or why not.</p>
              <p>Even if we want to go earlier than that, examine about girls schools. Some educators say girls educated in girls schools especially during teenagehood will outperform compared to if they attend a mixed-school. So why or how come this is the case, what is the root cause. And should AWARE then promote or donate money to build more girls schools to produce future bright leaders.</p>
              <p>All these are very important, please chuck the issues which are unimportant.</p>
              <p>If the current laws in Singapore is pro-choice, then I got nothing to say. I think no need to change anything. And dont change or campaign for same-gender relationship either. This will turn off lots of people and sap the support for AWARE for doing lots of other important tasks like I mentioned above. There are so many of them.</p>

              Pro-choice is the quality and ability to choose what you want, e.g. abort or keep child, no pro or pro to gay, i.e. secular in the sense.
                  
              Pro-life is the quality of life and no-ability to choose, all based on what is defined right. i.e. gay is wrong, kill all gays. In religion, we cannot do abortions, so all women must keep their babies. etc etc etc., basically extremists.

              I think Josie Lau is only a pawn. The main person is Dr Thio Su

              already voiced her opinion in the parliament.</p>

              It is never a shift towards "pro-gay". It simply means not to ostracize or alienate gays, see them as lower human beings. Such is the essence of pro-choice. Everyone has the right to choice on what he/she wants in life, based on their own moral and religious understanding.

              Meatpao, Pro-choice will not open any flood gates, because the freedom of choice is almost the same as the human rights if you see it. And every individual has their own economic situations and family problems, so it is very important for them to be able to choose.
              
              Let me ask you, if your husband abuse you, kicks you and without pro-choice, but dictated by let's say muslims where muslim wives can never divorce their husbands, you will see alot of the women get killed or jump down from their flats. Do you understand the consequences?
              
              Pro-choice guided by good, experienced and caring counsellors and mentors who promotes positive moral values is what we need, never pro-life.</div></blockquote>

              I will just like to add that Josie Lau is never a team player, just talking about not even discussing to join the exco with the DBS top management/directors already show that.
              
              Yes, sure, other people in top management can hold different port-folios and other work outside, but almost all have the basic courtesy of asking permission from HR and the directors first, so as to politely inform them before that. But look as Josie's actions, she xian zhan hou zhou, that is "bu fang DBS board directors in her eyes". She is a sole and opinionated person, and not a team player.
              
              Similarly, for the sacking of the centre manager, hallo, a manager leh, and its sacking some more, at least have the courtesy to inform the rest of the exco etc or have discussions with manager, as in exit interview or to give him/her justice by telling him/her why she fire her and by allowing him/her to rebut or explain certain situations like the email thingy etc. Again, she is never a team player, she just sack her. Somewhat like actions of a powermonger, not a team player that big MNCs or large organizations have ever wanted.
              
              Think about it.
