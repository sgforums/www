              Interestingly, looking through the Razor TV, the old guard's came very well prepared.
                              
              Some points to note:
              1. Giving only 1-5min for new-exco to ponder on their resignation, giving almost no time for the new-exco to consult their legal counsel.
                              
              2. Having nominations and re-election on the same general meeting. This is almost seldom done before. Since EOGM has its own agenda for meeting. Nominations and re-election should be set aside for another AGM.
                              
              3. When nominating and re-electing, there is only 1 person for ALL posts! Oh my gosh, meaning they can significantly cut down voting counting time, since there are no 2 choices. So fast as the person was nominated, she is immediately elected without need for vote counting due to default.
              However, I believe all those that got elected are the old guards, not those that just registered or with AWARE for less than 1 year.
                              
              4.For agenda items 3A, 3B, 3C, you will notice that when Josie announced the results, there is significant polarity of votes. 14++ Yes, 76+ No, for all 3 motions!!!! It is like almost vote rigging, or what I can see is vote polarization.
              Also as in the ex-new exco resignation press conference, the problem is pointed out as to how representative this 14++ votes are to the women population of Singapore. 
                      
              5. The old guard did not given the new exco many chances of explaining their manifasto or what they intend to do with AWARE, this is somewhat unfair. The old guard's strategy is to create a lot of hackling and commotion, and to take control of the EOGM, like plaining high-jacking the EOGM.    
                            
              The newly elected will have to address these issues, especially on how to convince the 76+ voters on their alternate choice of votes to gain their confidence or understand their thinking.

              This are the most neutral views by layman on the streets or those who went to witness the events.

              Have a look at razortv on the cover of the resignation press conference, especially for the last 15minutes, take note that this is a press conference, so what is said is documented and could be made against you for libel etc.
              
              If what is said is true, then the ex-new-exco really didnt do anything wrong. Tune is carefully to the turn of events from the AGM on amendment of constitution to re-election, the turn out of 100+/300+ members and the ex-new-exco having not-know any of their peers or exco members before hand as well. 
              
              What I surmised is the following:
              1. Initiation AWARE membership is falling, then old guard lacks leadership and wanted some new blood since their interests in exco is also dwindling.
              
              2. New members who signed up wanting to tune in on amendment of constitution were approached to support existing old guard in garnering of votes
              
              3. However at AGM, little was discussed on constitution, and focus is on re-election. Women spoke about what they can contribute and then was elected. However, old guard questions them on pro-gay and sexual orientation issues
              
              4. Issues were never supposed to be tabled on AGM, but news got out and PAP came in, news articles were wrote, and the rest is history........

              <p>Interestingly, looking through the Razor TV, the old guard’s came very well prepared.</p>
              <p>Some points to note:<br>1. Giving only 1-5min for new-exco to ponder on their resignation, giving almost no time for the new-exco to consult their legal counsel.</p>
              <p>2. Having nominations and re-election on the same general meeting. This is almost seldom done before. Since <span>EOGM</span> has its own agenda for meeting. Nominations and re-election should be set aside for another <span>AGM</span>.</p>
              <p>3. When nominating and re-electing, there is only 1 person for <span>ALL</span> posts! Oh my gosh, meaning they can significantly cut down voting counting time, since there are no 2 choices. So fast as the person was nominated, she is immediately elected without need for vote counting due to default.<br>However, I believe all those that got elected are the old guards, not those that just registered or with <span>AWARE</span> for less than 1 year.</p>
              <p>4.For agenda items 3A, 3B, 3C, you will notice that when Josie announced the results, there is significant polarity of votes. 14++ Yes, 76+ No, for all 3 motions!!!! It is like almost vote rigging, or what I can see is vote polarization.</p>
              <p>The newly elected will have to address these issues, especially on how to convince the 76+ voters on their alternate choice of votes to gain their confidence or understand their thinking.</p>

              <p>Since I was present at the Aware EGM meeting, perhaps I can respond to some of these comments.</p>
              <p>1) giving the dramatic unfolding of the events, really, even the legal counsel employed by Josie and company said that it is a gracious thing to step down. And I think it is impt that this decison had to be made that night and soon coz the meeting already took so many hours and people like me had sat there for more than 9 hours already. Actually, Josie and company had more than just 5 mins. They took about 20 mins and still did not return and did not even respond to their lawyer's call. Then the old guards decided to give them another 5 mins. Then some reporter said they were seen at the fire exit and a lot of people assumed they have left the building. All in all they had about 30 mins before they returned. Honestly, if it took too long, there is also the issue of angry crowds to deal with. There were also other issues of meeting that needed to be addressed that night or it would be left hanging in the air.</p>
              <p>2 and 3) you will need to elect the new team immediately. Technically, although a vote of no confidence was passed, legally if Josie and cmy refuse to resign, they would remain in charge. The issue would then have to go to the courts or on the spot the meeting decide to vote to remove them - which they did actually before the grop returned. Now, once the Josie and company are removed, there is power vacuum. This needs to be filled or there would be no one incharge at aware and another meeting has to be called to vote people in. So, it has to be done immediately. Really, I can see with my own eyes that the sentiments that night was that all supporters do not care who are in the positions as long as it is people supported by the old guard.</p>
              <p>4) 1 to 1 is polarisation but when the votes are 2 to 1 it is not polarisation but overwhelming majority (that's about 70% for you). But the positions between the 2 camps are indeed polarised. You mentioned that Aware now has to see how to convince the other 700 plus people. Actually, these 700 people are obviously from the same church or faith as they left immediately after the voting results are out - it seems as if they have no interest in Aware anymore. They did not even bother to queue up to speak so the accusations that some made that they were not allowed to speak was not true. I think when there is a polarisation of thinking, it is not easy to convince the other party. It is best to leave those who disagree to simple leave Aware and join or start another group whose values are in line with theirs.</p>

              I am refering to the explanations provided by the ex-new-exco. Thus if what they said was true, then it really seem to me that this is a super big ploy by the old guard, to elect a puppet new-ex-co to temporary "power", and then bring them down so as to generate publicity, and gain exposure for AWARE?....just my thoughts.
              
              Either that or that the old guards "huai hen zai xin" or something, and the sudden lost of their seats may then awaken and seek to gain power back?
              
              Just my nonsense though......but interesting to relook at the resignation press conference and the replies and explanations given, which I think then the ex-new-exco were not given the opportunity to explain due to the haggling going on.

If you are a woman working in the civil service or have female friends or family in the civil service, you will appreciate that the equal medical benefits given to females now available is a result of Aware's lobby work.

              <p>Can't agree more. Eventhough I am a Christian, I feel that the pro-life position (an extreme right position) agnores the fact that there are real issues women who are in the pregnant situation have to deal with. Besies those extreme cases such as rape where very few women would choose to keep the baby, there are also incidences where teenagers are not ready, or poor people who have too many children. </p>
              <p>Now I am certainly not arguing for abortion. There are other choices besies abortion. That's the whole point about Aware's programme. It is pro-choice (so it is a centre neutral position) - not just choice to abort but also choice to keep the baby or choice give birth and give it up for adoption, choice to decide if you want to abstain from sex and choice to decide to use a condom to protect yourself if you choose to go ahead. But all these are possible only with an open availability of NEUTRAL position when disseminating knowledge and education, one that is given without biases. After that knowledge is given in  a neutral way, then it is up to the person to make their own choices according to their own family, racial and religious values. It is all very individual.</p>
              <p>Aware is not pro-abortion, not pro-homosexuals. They are not here to promote the homosexual cause  - there are other organisations and platforms for that. But Aware's stand is that they are inclusive - this means they do not reject homosexuals and lesbians but accept them as they are, and not discrimiate or say this is a sin or it is wrong. So if lesbian women are harrassed at work, raped, or face financial difficulties, relationshio difficulties - Aware will still help her because she is a woman, not because she is a lesbian. She will be helped just as all women are helped. The lesbian women will not be discreminated against. THAT IS THEIR POINT! They are not going around to say "you can be lesbian, it is good, pls be a lesbian". They are saying: "the world is made up of different people and many marginalised  groups on the fringe of society. They deserve respect as human beings, they deserve to be helped when they need help, and they deserve to be accepted for what they are"</p>
              <p>This whole homo issue is such a focus only because it is Dr Thio and her group who chose to focus on this and say that this is the reason why they take over Aware (later of course they also say something else so they are inconsistent). They accuse Aware of being a single focus organisation but ironically Dr Thio and gang are really the ones who focus on this issue (which is really a non-issue because Aware does not promote homsexuality, it just accepts that ppl are different and we should not discriminate even if it happens to be homosexuality)</p>

              <p>Interestingly, looking through the Razor TV, the old guard’s
                  came very well prepared.</p>
              <p>Some points to note:<br> 1. Giving only 1-5min for new-exco to ponder on their resignation,
                  giving almost no time for the new-exco to consult their legal
                  counsel.</p>
              <p>2. Having nominations and re-election on the same general
                  meeting. This is almost seldom done before. Since <span>EOGM</span> has its own agenda for meeting. Nominations and
                  re-election should be set aside for another <span>AGM</span>.</p>
              <p>3. When nominating and re-electing, there is only 1 person for
                  <span>ALL</span> posts! Oh my gosh, meaning they can
                  significantly cut down voting counting time, since there are no 2
                  choices. So fast as the person was nominated, she is immediately
                  elected without need for vote counting due to default.<br> However, I believe all those that got elected are the old guards,
                  not those that just registered or with <span>AWARE</span> for less than 1 year.</p>
              <p>4.For agenda items 3A, 3B, 3C, you will notice that when Josie
                  announced the results, there is significant polarity of votes. 14++
                  Yes, 76+ No, for all 3 motions!!!! It is like almost vote rigging,
                  or what I can see is vote polarization.<br> Also as in the ex-new exco resignation press conference, the
                  problem is pointed out as to how representative this 14++ votes are
                  to the women population of Singapore.</p>
              <p>5. The old guard did not given the new exco many chances of
                  explaining their manifasto or what they intend to do with
                  <span>AWARE</span>, this is somewhat unfair. The old
                  guard’s strategy is to create a lot of hackling and commotion, and
                  to take control of the <span>EOGM</span>, like plaining
                  high-jacking the <span>EOGM</span>.</p>
              <p>The newly elected will have to address these issues, especially
                  on how to convince the 76+ voters on their alternate choice of
                  votes to gain their confidence or understand their thinking.</p>

              <p>This is a view by the producers from razortv without actually voicing any of their opinions, so I guess u can thus say the producers were "neutral".</p>
              <p>However, this may not be the case. I'm sure the producers interviewed several people, much more than than the 4-5 broadcasted. The producers could have chose to broadcast those more supportive of one camp over the other consecutively, hence swaying the audience over to one side.</p>
              <p>Aside from this, a couple of ladies interview said they they wished to hear what the ex-new exco have to say, but was unable to because of the rowdy behaviour by the members. This may give the audience an impression that the ex-new exco was bullied, and not given a chance. We know this is not true. In fact, the ex-new exco could be secretly glad of the rowdy behaviour, as this allows them to "skirt" the tough questions.</p>
              <p>An example of this is seen in Talking Point where Joise Lau n Mareen Ong brought irrelvant areas to avoid answering the questions directly. The hosts have to re-direct them back several times.</p>
              <p>Hence this video by razortv is not a neutral view by layman.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I believe you got the "5min for new-exco to ponder on their resignation" (your item 1) information from the interview with Maureen Ong, who is with the ex-new exco, towards the last few minutes of the video. This is in fact not true.</p>

                                                <p>As far as I can see, the neutral stance on homosexuality has
                                been misconstrued as 'pro-gay'. It's merely informative and the
                                discussion on homosexuality issues is only a small component. I
                                don't see any part of the sex education programme promoting gay
                                rights, and if the students don't complain about the instructors,
                                gay activists shouldn't be less qualified to carry out the

                                <p>Also, legitimisation is different from recognisation, and

                                orientation. Conservative people should not have anything to worry

              I tend to agree with your views. There are people who are pro-gay, anti-gay and those who are neutral about the issue. However, some of those anti-gay perceive those who are neutral to be pro-gay. It is like the 'You're either with me or against me mentality'.

              <p>Well, 10 years ago, if you married a foreign man and had children, you couldn't sponsor their citizenship applications unlike Singaporean husbands of foreign women. That's just to name one example.</p>

              <p><br>Yes! I so agree with you. Aware has indeed made it possible for women to have aifair rights in this area.</p>
              <p>And yes, we do not often realise how patriachal society as many of us have been socialised to accept things as they are (whether positive or negative). If a woman has been taught by her parents to accept a certain world view, if she does not face challenges to change these views during as an adult, she will pass on the same values to her sons and daughters.</p>
              <p>Just to give another point of view - some of my men friends complain that this is a women's world, that many employers prefer women and that many products and services are targetted at women. They feel the encroachment and this Aware saga may cause them to feel this more, as women are in the spotlight. But I feel that while "women hold up half the skies" (in the words of Mao Tze Tong, sorry I have to quote him, haha), this also says that men hold up the other half.</p>
              <p>So women also need to be mindful that the world can only become better and more balanced with men as their partners not enemies.</p>
