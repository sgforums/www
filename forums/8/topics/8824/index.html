            <div class='col-md body'>To XXXXXXXXX<br><br>Thank you for writing the email to me, it was kind of you to still remember me after 3yrs. Hmmm am I being sacarstic? Maybe, but I thought you wanted to put me out of your life totally for good. The mail was a surprise, and of course I do not expect you to leave me with any possible chance to contact you again, thus it is just so fitting that you create a new email addy with yahoo and not use it again after the mail. *smiles* So like you. And I am damn piss because of that.<br><br>Anyway if you are reading this at all, I appreciate the fact that you took the effort to read through all my posts in this forum, but for what purpose I would really like to know. To find out how I am feeling? To see if I have managed to survive without you? Well, you could have just come straight to me and ask me. But you would not want me in your life again, and I understand, and rest assure that people do not know who you are, and I did vow that time not to tell anyone else about who you are. I will keep my part of the bargain. But thanks for the concern anyway.<br><br>You urge me to get over you and move on to find another woman. Well, I thought I already had gotten over you. That is till you wrote the mail to me again. I realised that I have not gotten over you totally, not that I still love you, you would be wrong to think so. I DO NOT LOVE YOU ANYMORE. Yes, I know I do not for after recieving your mail I do not feel hopeful of anything. The only reason I say I haven ot gotten over you would be the fact that I realise why I did not get myself another person after you left. It is because I am afraid to love. I am, you left a deep gash in my life, one that despite the fact that I thought I gotten over in a couple of weeks, I actually did not, I did not know this myself, until now. I question myself, why is it that I met so manty fine woman in my life after you, but yet I only dare tell them I like them, but do nothing to win their hearts. Deep inside me, I am still not confident of bearing the results of a relationship, you are afterall the first woman in my life whom I even thought of marrying, but I must say I was young then, 3yrs in a young man's life does make a lot of difference. So it might be good that you wrote to me afterall, I am now ready to be my old self again, I will not hold myself back and contain my own fears within myself, for I came to understand that you are not worth it.<br><br>I would also like to thank you. You liked me, (note that I did not use the word love) because I am an ambitious man, but without you leaving me, I would not know that I am not ambitious enough. For I now know that I am capable of so much more. Your leaving is the catalyst to this realisation, for I was held back to explore my potential becuase of you. You did not really support me in terms of my career, for you killed them bit by bit little by little, with your over bearing nature. Yes, you can say I was pretty mellowed by you, for you are one ambitious woman yourself. But I am glad, that it happen anyway, for without your bearing at that time, the hot headed young me would not have be able to contain this potential in myself and let it run over me. For that I thank you.<br><br>Of course I really like you then, beautiful, calm, ambitious and capable, a deadly combination I would fall for anytime. But now, I realise I need something else other than all that, I need someone who knows what I am capable of, and not restrict me, I want someone who can stand with me but allow me to shape my life with my own hands, only warning to hold myself back when something is seriously wrong, and that would be the woman who I want to spend my life with, that woudl be the woman who I will cherish like my very own pride. This would be the woman, who to me, pride would not matter anymore, the owman who can make me give up my pride for her, for having her with me would be the proudest thing I can ever achieve in my life. You know how much pride I have, and you are not that woman.<br><br>I dun mind telling you this, for I think I have met a woman who is capable of that, one woman whom despite that fact that I like her so much, I dare not tell her, for I fear losing her altogether. Yes, there is one such woman who exsit. So dun worry for me that I have not gotten over you, I have now, your mail is timely, but I hope that you do not listen to what others say about me being totally affected by your departure. I was not. Maybe, but not as bad as you thought.<br><br>I sure hope that you will write to me again if you read this, I still want to be friends with you, but of ocurse I know it would be impossible, for you are still trap within your own shell of our history. We both share the same story, but the difference being I can walk out of it proud and steady, but you will have to hide this part of you away. I suggest you tell him about it, I am sure that he would not mind, it has been sometime after all, and your child would have been more than enough to convince him that you really love him. I know him to be a gentleman, so do not live in this shell of yours anymore, or it will become the bane of your life. Get out of it, and we might even laugh over this in future over coffee if you ever come back to Singapore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Take care, and I wish you a great family and loving husband.<br><br>Yours truly<br>Callan</div>
