            <div class='col-md body'>well i had a gf when i was in sec1 but that one dun count lar..<br><br>my first love was when i was in the army. i was 18, she 19. was still an NTU student at the time, totally stressed out with uni and i was like totally no time becos i was in NS.<br><br>I do remember alot of things about her. I was your typical bastard then, preferring to go cheonging with my frens (and her if she would come along but parents didn't like her to go out late so that was seldom) on sat nites and sleeping till the cows come home on sun. she would come over to my place late on sun to spend a few hours with me b4 i had to book into camp, which at the time was still quite early, i'd have to leave at about 8+<br><br>I remembered lining up at the phones downstairs my company line while i was in camp at night armed with a $10 phonecard to call her. I remember being very agitated when her bloody piece of shit brother was on the phone and wouldn't hang up for me to talk to her and so i usually had to rejoin the queue. eventually i learnt my lesson and would call late at nite, but the timing had to be right if not she would have fallen asleep waiting for my call. needless to say i would be super tired the next day for training but i don't remember that part liow.<br><br>how much time do u have to read?<br><br>needless to say i remember her like the back of my hand. i remember all of my ex-gfs, not just her.<br><br>they are all special pple, becos they were able to love someone like me.</div>
