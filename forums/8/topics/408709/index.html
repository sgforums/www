              <p>It was my third day in Singapore. It would be the best day because I
              met Andrea. The days and nights will be doomed afterwards, coz' I'd
              never see the glistening you again.</p>
              <p>Andrea,</p>
              <p>It's great if you could see it. At least you know here's someone from Hong Kong think of you always.</p>
              <p>I met you in the Universal Studios in Sentosa. On Thursday, I was
              puzzled about the underlying movie of the Ancient Egypt section. I
              asked a staff-lady in the entrance of the souvenir showroom which was
              also the exit of the thrill game. Maybe my spoken English was quite
              broken, you were misled and told me that inside was a roller coaster!
              But then you were really smart to aware and spoke Mandarin to me. Ahha,
              the movie was Mummy. I felt stupid asking it. However, your smile eased
              my embarrassment.</p>
              <p>You're like an angel. Yes, you are.</p>
              <p>The query was over, I had to go. But I came back several times
              just to see you. "Thank you, Andrea!" was what I told you the second
              time we met (or, frankly, I came to you). Read from your nametag, hoped
              to impress you a bit more. And you smiled again.</p>
              <p>And
              then I really played the roller coaster! I knew after the game I would
              exit through the showroom, where you used to served at! So the thrill
              of the game was easily overcome by the longing to see you again.
              "Impressive!", I said. It was your recommendation. Actually, you're the
              most impressing one, and I was just trying hard to impress you! Stupid
              me...</p>
              <p>Although I deliberately pass by the entrance of the
              showroom several times, I couldn't see you anymore. Expecting to see
              you in the farewell group of staffs when I was leaving, disappointed to
              see no familiar face.</p>
              <p>Andrea, I miss you so much. How amazing it was to run into you in a short trip, and the moments were like lasting for eternity.</p>
              <p>If
              I could make dreams like Inception the movie, I'd come to see you as my
              projection. Though it's unreal, to see you smile again is truely
              wonderful for me to stay in the dream forever.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Best Wishes,</p>
