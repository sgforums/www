            <div class='col-md body'>You have many choices in your life, some trivial and some extremely important. How can you be sure you aren’t being deceived and led astray? How can you know you’re learning true and right values instead of false ones? Even though Satan is much stronger than we are and is a very convincing liar and deceiver, we can avoid his influence. We must live carefully, thoughtfully applying God’s truth to the situations we encounter and decisions we make. And, most importantly, we must ask God for protection, perception and strength.<br><br>Satan’s fate<br><br>1. Read Revelation 20:1-3. What will happen to Satan when Jesus returns to earth?<br><br>2. Satan will be released for a short time after the millennium, but what is his ultimate fate? Read Matthew 25:41 and comment.<br><br>Remember the 911 incident?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometime ago someone came and offered me to renew my life. To change my life for the better. I was listening to his offer.<br><br>Then I told him.<br><br>'How about a counteroffer? I offer you a chance to change your life. I'll make you think twice about approaching me. The devil will come and take away everything you love in your life. You will face trial and jury. You will be persecuted by friends and family. And when you die, you'll be buried and you thought life has ended. No, this torment will carry on. You will be up there, you will watch the ones you love cry at your deathbed, you will watch them die. When judgement day comes, you'll watch them burn in eternal flame for they had not accepted the life you chose. You will live amongst angels and forever, watching them burning in hell, to suffer for all their sins.'<br><br>'This change I'm offering is that you deny him. You deny his torment by refusing to budge. By refusing to accept him in your life so that he will not let the devil come into your life. By refusing to accept him, you will no longer face persecution from friends and family. And when you die, you're nothing but ashes. You won't go to the heaven. It's already too packed. No, it's gone. You don't have to live amongst angels and watch your loved one suffer in hell, under the eternal flame for their sins.'<br><br>'Welcome to the club.
