            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, when i think back the worst screw up of my life and i still remember it every details of it...<br><br>it was during my NS time,<br><br>i was during my sispec instructor tour, appointment was platoon warrant officer, or they call it platoon sergeant in similar, conducting ASLC, appointed store IC for section quick attack live firing.<br>everything was going fine, i have work out the store list, allocated task to my fellow instructors to sort it out and of coz i have to trust my instructors.<br>so on that day of the living firing, everything was good and fine, tables and benches are good, water containers everything and the only hard part was setting up the tele J with the D10 cables, if you seen "enemy of the gates" there is one part when a soldier need to crawl from 1 point to 1 point to lay the cables which is the D10 cable. then things starts to screw up, the D10 cables was damn fucked up, there are cuts on certain lengths and need to reattach it with everything to make a complete connection, and damn, the live firing area has a hill the the cables need to run up there and down again. so after an hour just to fix up the whole damn connection, tracking every inch of the wire connection, dig the ground to cover up the D10 cables, rather tough job. then come to the moment of truth, the testing of the tele J at 3 points, 1 at ammo, 1 at support base which is on a hill, and the last at flanking point.<br><br>"eh.. how come no beeping sound ah?" my instructor at the end asked<br><br>"hmm.. connection problem? no leh, i checked personally liao"<br><br>after some thoughts...<br><br>i put my hand in my face and shake in dismay....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>"cb.......................forgot to bring batteries lah........."<br><br>damn, i was completely defeated in front of my instructors. althought i should trust my instructor to load the stores, but on the other hand it was truely my fault that i should ensure everything which i didn't. i was luckily enough that my csm help me out by returning back to camp and bring the batteries here while on ration run. this was not the end,<br><br>end of live firing....<br><br>1 magazine lost....<br><br>nbccb.<br><br>oc asked me "did u account for the magazine before loading up?"<br><br>"yes sir, the ammo ic did checked the quantity"<br><br>"are you the store ic"<br><br>"yes sir"<br><br>"did u physically checked the quantity of the magazine?"<br><br>"no sir"<br><br>my oc was 110% pissed off with me 1 on 1. so am i was pissed off with myself and with oc too for screwing me infront of the whole company. people will think that losing 1 magazine just sign 1206 will do, but when i think back... what if the magazine lost was a mag loaded with rounds and the trainees threw it away delibrately?<br><br>from that day onwards, i really learnt hard on my lesson, never will this screw up enter my life again.<br><br>which is 1 of the precious values i learnt from NS.<br><br>anyone of u have any screw ups before? say it!!<br></div>
