              <p>Yeah. Its precisely becos languages is relatively linked with culture, that is why we should learn dialect language which inturn leads us on to learn more about our culture. A simple example would be the reason for oranges being used as 'gifts' during chinese new year. Its linked to Cantonese. <em>A dialect is only an expresion of a subculture related to the grand Chinese tradition.</em> (Mak, 1995)</p>
              <p>perhaps that is also why more and more of us dont even respect Chinese traditions like Chinese New Year, Moon Cake Festival, etc. I have to admit to this myself. I believe that dialect helps tie us to our Chinese culture too.</p>

              <p><br>i perfectly agree with you. My reason would be the Singaporeans being too pragmatic. If there is any dialect Festivals (e.g. Hakka Food Festival...) at perhaps Expo, I doubt most Singaporeans would take time out of their busy schedules to make their way there. To us, life would still go as normal and everything would be well even if we do not know our own dialect lang and its culture. It is like the 'bo chap' attitude.</p>
              <p>Would anyone agree to attend or put it bluntly volunteer to attend a 3-days dialect learning journey based on your individual dialect roots?</p>
              <p>I would not mind if its during holidays actually.</p>

              <p>I would not say the government stops you from using dialect per se, but rather the government did not actively promote the speaking in dialects. Your mom has got her reasons. But that doesn't mean that she would not have used dialect to communicate with you.</p>
              <p>I speak to my dad in teochew, my mom in chinese even till now. I picked up hokkien when I was in poly/army. Now picking up cantonese at work. It's whether or not do you want to pick up a dialect. Learning a dialect, or any other thing for that matter, doesn't drop from the sky or pop out of nowhere.</p>

              <p>I would not say the government stops you from using dialect per se, but rather the government did not actively promote the speaking in dialects. Your mom has got her reasons. But that doesn't mean that she would not have used dialect to communicate with you.</p>
              <p>I speak to my dad in teochew, my mom in chinese even till now. I picked up hokkien when I was in poly/army. Now picking up cantonese at work. It's whether or not do you want to pick up a dialect. Learning a dialect, or any other thing for that matter, doesn't drop from the sky or pop out of nowhere.</p>

              <p>lol i have been careless with my words. lets say we were discouraged to use dialect. If only my parents spoke to me in Hokkien. I cant even understand a single thing when my grandparents and parents communicate in Hokkien, except for a word or two though.</p>
              <p>you are right though, in order to learn dialect (emphasis that it is actually our first language) we have to put in effort. will Singaporeans put in the effort?</p>
              <p>well, i have 2 questions:</p>
              <p>If you are a parent, would you wish for your child to learn his/her dialect and its related culture and traditions?</p>
              <p>If you are a youth of today (who doesnt know yourdialect), would you be willing to learn at least the basics of your dialect &amp; culture?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">We only know how to discuss and think about the negative impacts of the loss of dialects and what a pity it is. Shouldnt we actually stand up and do something about it before its too late...</span></p>

              <p>PAP wanted us to speak mandarin is to associate ourselves with PRC.</p>
              <p>Just like PRC, their government don't allow use of dialect. Their Pu Tong Wa is the only official language. TV station, radio and education system only allow use of it and no other. Only some small hardcore radio station in guandong allow some broadcast of cantonese....</p>

              <p>I agree that diversity of a certain root language adds flavour to that string of languages say Sino-Mongoloid languages.</p>
              <p>But lets face reality, will our singaporean chinese children be able to learn their respective dialects in school? doesnt seem very ethical...</p>
              <p>my take: 2nd language should be Mandarin but dont need to enforce mandarin as the only spoken chinese language and allow chinese to speak respective dialects under non-official circumstances.</p>

              <p>We all lost our dialect, because the government want the few, who have to do business with China, to have a large pool of Mandarin speakers, with which to practice the language. The thinking was dialect speakers would impede the Mandarin speakers. There is no need for everyone to speak Mandarin, only those who need to, or those who want to should learn the language.</p>
              <p>The aggressive Speak Mandarin Campaign resulted in a situation where PRCs do not need to know English to come to Singapore.</p>
              <p>At the other end, Indians who come here have to know English or they will be disadvantaged.</p>
