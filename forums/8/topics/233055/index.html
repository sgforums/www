            <div class='col-md body'>the hotel room rates r quite standard.<br><br>and as for high rollers, the rooms will be graded according to how much they spend. and if u spend a lot ur food, transport and even shopping i think is paid for by the casino. as in, say u're the high-roller, you play in a private room with a private buffet table and staff there to take care of u. the more you lose, the better they take care of u.<br><br>how do i noe? my friend's grandad once held the world record for longest unbroken time spent gambling. 36 hours straight, lost quite a few million. he told me they were really well taken care of. limos and fabulous buffets and even first class tickets home. not bad.<br><br>as for not so rich us, the buffets r pretty good. huge lines and really cheap too. but thats only for vegas. been to the buffet at star city sydney, that one is small and expensive. casino too. so not all casinos hv large cheap buffets. oh well, let's see singapore's casinos, sorry i mean integrated resorts. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are plenty of hotels in Las Vegas. However, hotel rooms along the strip can still be quite pricey especially for the high end hotels such as Bellagio and Venetian. These hotels normally give free rooms only to those who are high rollers. If you are a budget traveller, go to Vegas during the low peak period, and try to stay there during the weekdays as hotel rates are cheaper.<br><br>From my experience, there is no point in staying in a hotel that is further away from the strip because its cheaper. Most of ur activities are along the strip. If you stayed in a hotel away from the strip, the rates may be cheap, but you will end up paying alot of taxi fares to and fro.<br><br>On the strip, the cheaper hotels are like the Xcaliber and the Luxor, they are situated slightly south of the strip, around 10 mins walk to Bellagio and NY-NY.<br>The hotels in the north of the strip may be the cheapers, but they are actually very very far from the activites-center which is around Bellagio that area.<br><br>What I would do is, spend a little bit more, stay along the strip, so you dont have to take cab everywhere you go. However, it would be good to rent a car, coz there are nice places in Vegas you could go, such as the outlet malls where u can get designer goods at a discounted price, and some nice sight seeing places like the Hoover Dam.<br><br>I miss vegas, when I was there last august, the temperature was like 40 plus degrees C, even in the evening, Freaking hot. But the ladies like the dress sexy cute outfits at night. HAHA! I definitely would like to go back to vegas again when I have the money. Best is stay from Monday thru Friday.
