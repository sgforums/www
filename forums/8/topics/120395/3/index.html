            <div class='col-md body'>its not so much on the concept of fairness, however, it is about how poor students can afford transport fares. take a look at most of the comments left by others. most speak of $40-50 a week total allowance. with a $52 stamp for mrt only, that's one week's worth of food and survival gone. add in the bus, that's almost two weeks survival gone. how would students survive on such expenses? a typical parent earns $1500 per month. assuming one child in poly or uni, a meagre $50 a week amounts up to $200-250. would every parent from a lower income family be able to fork out an extra $100 so that his son or daughter can at least have proper food for the other two weeks? i doubt many can.<br><br>what i'm disturbed by is that transitlink mentioned adults having to pay higher fares if poly students were to get concessions like those of sec sch and jc. mentioning this only serves to pull away adult support. to me its all cock and bull. with their shares rising like nobody's business, do they really need to charge adults more in order to give poly students lower fares?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The next thing we'll be rambling about is why a 35year old man taking a part time course in poly is paying student fare, while his counterpart taking a course in uni isn't.  Or perhaps a uni student who transited from jc is paying more than what that 35year old is paying. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
