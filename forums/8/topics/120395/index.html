            <div class='col-md body'>my arguement is not whether jc students should be charged poly fares or not. the fact remains that none of us students have an income at all to support fares which apply to people to earn income and maybe even get paid transport expenses.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>so long you are a full time student, you should be entitled to paying a cheaper fare. since they consider poly and university students as tertiary students, perhaps give us a rate that is in between that of an adult and a secondary student. nowadays everything is expensive. poly and uni fees also increase.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yah, its unfair to ask poly to pay adult while jc pay children fare even though the students are the same age...<br><br>but you dun have to buy bus and mrt stamp seperately, you can get choose the "bus &amp; mrt" stamp which is cheaper than buying seperatly.</div>
