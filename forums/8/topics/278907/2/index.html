            <div class='col-md body'>I was still in secondary school, Sec. 2, I think. It was at night if i'm not wrong. Was flipping the channels, as I was flipping pass cnn I thought I saw a bunch of angry bee's. So I thought that seems interesting, change the channel to cnn and it turns out the " bee's " were actually smoke from the world trade centre.<br><br>By the time I watched it, both planes have already crashed into the towers. I called my mum, then my bro came home and saw the news, then my sis, then my dad got back from work. All of them were glued to the news until it was about 1 am. I didn't understand the seriousness of that situation. But I was amazed on how much it affected the world. Like for example I went back to school, and the whole class went, did you watched last night at cnn ?? I was like, since when did everybody in school watched cnn.<br><br>But as years goes by, after seeing the aftermath, the changes the world have became. The fight agains terrorism that still until today have not yet been resolved. I kinda feel a bit sad. On how one single day, could change the world.<br><br>But seriously, september 11 attacks on the united states, and the recent tsunami were the two huge disasters during my lifetime.</div>

With such a big bounty, you would think that there would be some news at least. This is why I'm leaning more toward the conspiracy theory.<br><br>On the other hand, whoever captures Osama will have to face hundreds of  thousands looking for revenge.</div></blockquote>I still wonder that too. How can a powerful country take such a long time (it's been 6 yrs alr since the WTC attack) to locate this one and only Osama? The newspaper alr reported that he's probably hiding somewhere in the south of afghan border. Why not command the troops to search that area?<br><br></div>

It was at night if i'm not wrong. Was flipping the channels, as I was flipping pass cnn I thought I saw a bunch of angry bee's. So I thought that seems interesting, change the channel to cnn and it turns out the " bee's " were actually smoke from the world trade centre.<br><br>By the time I watched it, both planes have already crashed into the towers. I called my mum, then my bro came home and saw the news, then my sis, then my dad got back from work. All of them were glued to the news until it was about 1 am. I didn't understand the seriousness of that situation. But I was amazed on how much it affected the world. Like for example I went back to school, and the whole class went, did you watched last night at cnn ?? I was like, since when did everybody in school watched cnn.<br><br>But as years goes by, after seeing the aftermath, the changes the world have became. The fight agains terrorism that still until today have not yet been resolved. I kinda feel a bit sad. On how one single day, could change the world.<br><br>But seriously, september 11 attacks on the united states, and the recent tsunami were the two huge disasters during my lifetime. </div></blockquote>Same here. I was sec 2 at that point of time and before going to sch, my mom showed the news on tv and told me to see it. I watched the planes crashing into the tower and there was an explosion on the middle top of the building. There were some ppl jumping down from the tower. It was sad they had to jump to avoid getting burnt.<br><br>After seeing the live broadcast, everybody in sch talked about it. Even the teachers were involved. One teacher said that parts of the cooked flesh were found on the grounds after the explosion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br></div>
