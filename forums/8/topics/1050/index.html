But when it comes to meeting parents.. hehehehe.. u get what i mean...<br><br>Also.. would u date a person who is good at talking/words/expressing themselves (and possibly turn out into a 'poet' and engulf u in words they might not mean) or would u date a straightforward person (who doesnt know the least how to pamper u with words) who perhaps makes u think that u're not impt in his/her life..<br><br>^_^ Just pondering~!!!!! =P<br><br>------------------<br>Sometimes..<br>Things are so lost<br>that you begin to doubt urself..<br>Things are so quiet<br>that u question ur purpose of living..<br>Things don't come perfect..<br>You must make them good..</div>

So, u see, im not looking down on guys from other religion, im just following my faith, as it is stated in the bible dat i am not to marry a non-christian guy...gee...im sorry to Ding, and anyone out there who felt that they were put down by christians, i apologize to you all...<br><br>Ding, the reason why i said that the guy i fall for must love God more than me, and by doing so, he will be a better person, is all according to my own opinion.  im not saying that a person who doesnt believe in God is a bad person...maybe its becos, u , as a free-thinker, have your own set of opnions..whereas i have mine (and its from a christian's viewpoint)...cos if my guy loves God more than me, he would try his best to follow the teachings of Christ, for eg. he would make the effort to love others, have compassion, respect his wife, love his kids, etc...and most importantly, both him and myself, can serve God together, and bring up our children in a christian family.<br><br>Of cos, a free-thinker can do the same, except the last 2 points...so im not putting u guys down.  wat i posted was just my own views...sorry for any mis-understanding... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I wanna serve God, and it would be very painful if my other half does not think the same way...i dunno if u understand or not...but dis is how i feel abt the guy dat i would fall for.  I thk, maybe i had posted it too 'religiously', that non-christians may feel offended...but i think christians can share the same views.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
