            <div class='col-md body'>lexelle, had to recycle clothes cos i was dying to capture my audience and the shorter the skirt, the shorter the time taken will be.  thank god you didn't notice my polite, good-mannered korean cousin, if u want to believe this as well, I think I was alone (hmphhhhhh)<br><br>how was boom boom room?  no dancing?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Love,<br><br>I would love to have gone to Fantasy Island with you to catch you in a bikini instead. You were capturing last night, really~ especially the way you grooved.<br><br>Too bad I couldn't get my hands in your bra last night.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Did you find that foil?<br><br>Kekeke... after knowing me for so long, do you think I look at guys as much as you?  :p<br><br>Maybe your cousin stood at my blind spot, I have night blindness. I prefer looking at my drinks. Like you said you were alone...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Boom Boom Room was not too bad, not a place for dancing though. You should go there if you wanna see Kumar. Tet's dancing is almost as comparable to Kumar's - SEXY~ Dancing? Maybe you should stick to your favourites.<br><br>Hee... wanna go groove again? Tet jioing us, on 2nd thoughts you might not wanna join us. You have to accompany your korean cousin, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Sure seems cleaner now...<br><br>Except that the scum is always on the underside...</div>
