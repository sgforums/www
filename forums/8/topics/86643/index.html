            <div class='col-md body'><br>China rejects DPM Lee's reasons for Taiwan visit<br>Chinese Foreign Ministry says the visit damaged China's core interests and harmed foundation of ties with Singapore<br><br>By Jason Leow<br><br>BEIJING - China has rejected Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's reasons for visiting Taiwan recently and said Singapore should use 'concrete actions' to win the confidence of the Chinese people.<br><br>'Lee Hsien Loong... said that if he were to call off the trip at China's request, he would have undermined Singapore's right to make independent decisions and damaged its international standing. Why should Singapore's rights and international standing come at the expense of China's sovereignty and core interests? This is both unreasonable and illogical.' -- CHINA FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN KONG QUAN (ABOVE), IN A STATEMENT<br><br>It said the present difficulties in the two countries' relations are entirely of Singapore's making and hoped the Republic would 'face up to' the gravity of the issue.<br><br>In response to media queries over DPM Lee's written answers to questions about his trip, Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan reiterated that the visit had harmed China's core interests and damaged the political foundation of Sino-Singapore relations.<br><br>Mr Kong's statement was released shortly past midnight yesterday in the form of a dispatch from the state-run Xinhua news agency.<br><br>Relations between China and Singapore have taken a sharp dip since Mr Lee made his three-day private and unofficial visit to Taiwan on July 11 to see friends and get a feel of the situation there.<br><br>China voiced strong objections and warned last week that important exchanges would be affected.<br><br>Central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan then cancelled a trip to Singapore where he was to have given a keynote address at the annual Monetary Authority of Singapore Lecture.<br><br>China's Foreign Ministry also delayed issuing an official invitation for National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan and Senior Parliamentary Secretary (National Development and Defence) Koo Tsai Kee to visit Chengdu, Sichuan province, from July 28 to 30.<br><br>When The Straits Times asked about the delay, it was told this by the ministry: 'Under present circumstances, Sino-Singapore exchanges will inevitably be affected.'<br><br>Watch Channel i news clip here<br><br>In his written responses to questions from the press last week, DPM Lee said it would be regrettable if his trip had affected bilateral ties, which were built on equality and mutual respect.<br><br>Singapore had been long-time friends of both the mainland and Taiwan and conducted relations with them in a way consistent with its 'one China' policy, he said.<br><br><strong>Except for sina.com, a commercial news portal, no other Chinese media reported DPM Lee's response.<br><br>Xinhuanet.com, an offshoot of the Xinhua news agency, and major newspapers such as the People's Daily and Beijing Youth Daily had reported China's angry statements closely but did not report Mr Lee's response.</strong><br><br>Responding to Mr Lee, Mr Kong said in his statement: 'We have noted the reports and we find Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's explanation for his trip to Taiwan difficult to comprehend.'<br><br>On Mr Lee's remark that bilateral ties were built on equality and mutual respect, he said the DPM had disregarded the Chinese government's 'solemn and just' position on issues relating to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.<br><br>By ignoring China's repeated advice and persisting with the visit, he continued, Mr Lee had harmed China's core interests and damaged the political foundation of Sino-Singapore relations.<br><br>He said Mr Lee had also contradicted himself by first calling the visit 'private and unofficial' and then saying it was undertaken to protect Singapore's interests as he was soon to become prime minister.<br><br>'As everyone knows, Lee Hsien Loong has been in the upper echelons of the Singapore Government for many years. Hence, his status cannot be changed by such a statement as 'unofficial and private visit'.<br><br>'Furthermore, while Lee Hsien Loong was in Taiwan, the Taiwanese authorities accorded him a so-called 'head-of-state' reception. Hence, Singapore's explanation is not tenable.'<br><br>Mr Kong also rejected Mr Lee's point about wanting to familiarise himself with the situation in the Taiwan Strait and promote regional peace and stability.<br><br>'But the truth is, his visit has already become one that connives with and lends support to 'Taiwan independence' forces. It is detrimental to regional peace and stability and will ultimately harm Singapore's own interests.'<br><br>Mr Lee also said in his written responses that if Singapore were to call off the trip at China's request, Singapore's right to make independent decisions would be undermined and its international standing damaged.<br><br>Mr Kong's rejoinder yesterday was: 'Why should Singapore's rights and international standing come at the expense of China's sovereignty and core interests? This is both unreasonable and illogical.'<br><br>Concluding, he said that the achievements of Sino- Singapore ties were worth treasuring. Both sides had to protect the political foundation of bilateral relations.<br><br>'The current difficulties in the two countries' relations are entirely of Singapore's making.<br><br>'We hope that the Singapore side will face up to the gravity of the issue and take concrete actions to win the confidence of the people of China.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LHL first mistake b4 taking in PM's office... not for his reason given to insist on visiting taiwan after china's protest, but for his insensitivity to the political sentiments that has plagued China and Taiwan... so much for Singapore down the road when he takes office with an iron-ruling fist...  for the germination of  the idea of visiting Taiwan and went on to visit it...<br><br>It is perfectly alright for the reasons to rebuke China's protest; wat mi dun understand is the very first birth of the idea to visit Taiwan and he went ahead to realise it... is he showing the world that he is not easily trifle with??? Showing off his hard-stance...and disregard of political feelings which he has done tat led to some confrontations back then with my neighbours?<br><br>Hope spore would not deterioriate with his upgrade... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>*sits down and pray hard hard*</div>
