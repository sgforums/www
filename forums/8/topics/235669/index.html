Toshiba Corp was nothing for me before Dec 1, 1999. - </span><br><br><strong>I strongest believe Toshiba Corp killed US Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige on Jul 25, 1987 as a Microwave Mind-control Terrorism of Toshiba COCOM affair to shut Baldrige's mouth.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Toshiba COCOM affair Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…(Â‹@ÂŠB)ÂƒRÂƒRÂƒÂ€ÂŽÂ–ÂŒÂ� is Americans' right rage from 1986 to 1988 for that Japanese companies Toshiba Machine Co Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â‹@ÂŠB, Itochu Corp ÂˆÃ‰Â“Â¡Â’Â‰Â�Â¤ÂŽÂ– and Wakokoeki Â˜aÂŒÃµÂŒÃ°ÂˆÃ• illegally had sold strategically sensitive products, Toshiba Machine Co's sophisticated milling machines 9ÂŽÂ²Â“Â¯ÂŽÂžÂ�Â§ÂŒÃ¤Â‚ÃŒÂƒXÂƒNÂƒÂŠÂƒÂ…Â�[Â‰Ã�Â�HÂ—pÂ�HÂ�Ã¬Â‹@ÂŠB4Â‘Ã¤ with Kongsberg Vappenfabrik's numerical controllers Â�Â”Â’lÂ�Â§ÂŒÃ¤(NC)Â‘Â•Â’u to the Soviet Union in violation of the COCOM export control from 1982 to 1983 and the imports removed the noisy sound from Soviet's submarine. Americans might call it 'The Toshiba-Kongsberg case' or 'The Toshiba incident'.<br>Many Japanese people also wrongly believed the Toshiba's information manipulation 'Toshiba COCOM affair, 1987 was for US-Japan economic friction'.</span><br><br>In Mar 2006 I read 3 Japanese books - 1stly 'ÂƒXÂƒNÂƒÂŠÂƒÂ…Â�[Â‰Â¹Â‚ÂªÂ�Ã�Â‚Â¦Â‚Â½ Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…ÂŽÂ–ÂŒÂ�Â‚Ã†Â•Ã„Â�Ã®Â•Ã±Â�HÂ�Ã¬Â‚ÃŒÂ�^Â‘ÂŠ' (in English, 'The truth of Toshiba COCOM affair and American information manipulation : The noise of Soviet's submarine was gone.') (1993) by Japanese journalist Mikio Haruna Â�tÂ–Â¼ÂŠÂ²Â’j or Washington DC Chief ÂƒÂ�ÂƒVÂƒÂ“ÂƒgÂƒÂ“ÂŽsÂ‹Ã‡Â’Â·, Kyodo News Â‹Â¤Â“Â¯Â’ÃŠÂ�MÂŽÃ� and 2ndly 'ÂƒhÂƒLÂƒÂ…ÂƒÂ�ÂƒÂ“ÂƒgÂ“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â‚ÃŒÂ”ÃŸÂŒÂ€ ÂŽÂŸÂ‚Ã‰Â‘_Â‚Ã­Â‚ÃªÂ‚Ã©Â‚ÃŒÂ‚Ã�Â‚Ã‡Â‚Â±Â‚Â©' (in English, 'The tragedy of Toshiba Corp as a documentary : Who is the next target of America ?') (Dec 10, 1987) by Japanese famous non-fiction book writer Eiji Oshita Â‘Ã¥Â‰ÂºÂ‰pÂŽÂ¡ and 3rdly 'Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…ÂŽÂ–ÂŒÂ�Â‚ÃŒÂ�^Â‘ÂŠ' (in English, 'The truth of Toshiba COCOM affair') (Aug 24, 1987 second edition) by the civilian network against a bill for official secrets Â�Â‘Â‰Ã†Â”Ã©Â–Â§Â–@Â‚Ã‰Â”Â½Â‘ÃŽÂ‚Â·Â‚Ã©ÂŽsÂ–Â¯ÂƒlÂƒbÂƒgÂƒÂ�Â�[ÂƒN (currently, JCA-NET (http://www.jca.apc.org/index-en.html)) and Eco-Peace Kenkyukai ÂƒGÂƒRÂƒsÂ�[ÂƒXÂŒÂ¤Â‹Â†Â‰Ã¯ (currently, Peacenet News ÂƒsÂ�[ÂƒXÂƒlÂƒbÂƒgÂƒjÂƒÂ…Â�[ÂƒX).<br><br>The 1st book says US Commerce secretary Malcolm Baldrige claimed to Toshiba America President Nobuo Ishizaka Â�ÃŽÂ�Ã¢Â�MÂ—Y for the Toshiba-Kongsberg case on Jul 15, 1987 and (after some pages) he died for rodeo horse on Jul 25, 1987. Soon I noticed Toshiba Corp mind-controlled the horse by microwave to kill Malcolm Baldrige and to shut his mouth.<br>The 3rd book clearly suggests Richard Perle, 'the Prince of Darkness' and Stephen Bryen, leaders for the regulation of COCOM control or assistant secretary and deputy assistant secretary of defense for international economic, trade and security policy, battled with Malcolm Baldrige, a leader for the deregulation of COCOM control, and then they killed Malcolm Baldrige. It says Malcolm Baldrige is rather on Toshiba Corp side. It doesn't tell Malcolm Baldrige severely claimed Toshiba Corp 10 days before the his death.<br>The 1st book says, Richard Perle firstly made American action against Japan's Toshiba Corp and he got hepatitis around Nov 1986 and quit his position in Jun 1987. I suspect Toshiba Corp gave him (mind-control abuse) hepatitis by microwave.<br><br>The 2nd book says Kazuo Kumagai ÂŒFÂ’JÂˆÃªÂ’j had a Toshiba side opinion on monthly magazine Bungeishunju Â•Â¶Ã¥YÂ�tÂ�H, Sep 1987 (or 198<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br>After Kazuo Kumagai ÂŒFÂ’JÂˆÃªÂ’j quit Wakokoeki Â˜aÂŒÃµÂŒÃ°ÂˆÃ• for his dissatisfaction to the company in 1985, Kumagai, former Moscow Branch chief of Wakokoeki Â˜aÂŒÃµÂŒÃ°ÂˆÃ•, spoke about the Toshiba incident in Dec 1985 as an informant. Mr William Triplett, Chief Republican Counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, interviewed him for an investigation in Tokyo Â“ÂŒÂ‹Âž in Jul 1987.<br>Wakokoeki Â˜aÂŒÃµÂŒÃ°ÂˆÃ•, a company trading with communist countries, introduced Soviet business to Toshiba Machine Co Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â‹@ÂŠB and Toshiba Machine Co selected Itochu Corp ÂˆÃ‰Â“Â¡Â’Â‰Â�Â¤ÂŽÂ– as the partner. Kumagai played a part of the role.<br>After Toshiba COCOM affair he got a success as writer Hitori Kumagai ÂŒFÂ’JÂ“Ã† in 1993. I think it was a mind-control. He was a Toshiba industrial spy. He might be a member of (originally, communist) Toshiba Union Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â˜JÂ“Â­Â‘gÂ�Â‡, secretly to work for Toshiba Corp as a Toshiba-Ogikai Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â�Ã®Â‰Ã¯ member. There surely is a Kumagai ÂŒFÂ’J, maybe his family member, among Toshiba Union leaders.<br>The 1st book says in Dec 1985 Kumagai said "I may be killed by KGB." But rather, he could have been killed by Toshiba Corp. If he wasn't a secret Toshiba-Ogikai member.<br><br>The 1st book says, 2 American soldiers secretly investigated East Germany's semiconductor CMOS plant Toshiba Corp would illegally export in 1986 and one of 2 American soldiers had a slight wound on his arm for 1 of 7 USSR army's shots in Potsdam, East Germany on Sep 17, 1987.<br>Japanese newspapers, Sep 18, 1987 - The White House opposed US Government's sanctions against Toshiba Corp.<br>I suspect Toshiba Corp mind-controlled Soviet soldiers to interrupt American investigation. The White House might be mind-controlled by Toshiba Corp. The 1st book says Toshiba Corp didn't know even American Echelon spying in the Toshiba incident but of course I don't believe it.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">In the Toshiba incident days from 1986 to 1988 Toshiba Corp absolutely would have revived Japan's anti-America and patriotism to replace the story.</span></strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">After 2000, Leader Katsutoshi Suzuki Â—Ã©Â–Ã˜Â�ÂŸÂ—Â˜ (from 1996 to 2003) and his JEIU said Japan is in American (mind-control) war. Toshiba-Ogikai Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â�Ã®Â‰Ã¯ communists/socialists/democrats occupy Electrical Electronic &amp; Information Union (JEIU) Â“dÂ‹@Â˜AÂ�Â‡ as leaders more than half of the years since the beginning 1953. In the Toshiba incident days, JEIU leader, communist/socialist, might be Toshifumi Tateyama Â’GÂŽRÂ—Â˜Â•Â¶ (JEIU leader from 1975 to 1993? from Toshiba Corp) but I don't know who was Toshiba Union leader.<br>While many Japanese leaders appealed Japan's anti-America or Japan's patriotism after Apr 2001, Toshiba persons completely occupied Japan. Using many Japanese professor on TV and journalists on books, PM Junichiro Koizumi Â�Â¬Â�Ã²Â�ÂƒÂˆÃªÂ˜Y, 'the real Prince of Darkness backed up by Toshiba Corp', and his administration said rascal America moves Japan as cheaters.<br>Japan's Toshiba Corp are occupying the World by microwave of high definition television (HDTV).</span><br><br>The 1st book says Iran-Contra operation was leaked in Nov 1986 and then President Ronald Reagan decreased his power in the US Congress. The 3rd book introduces Iran-Contra affair to argue against America.<br>I think Toshiba Corp might make both Iran-Contra operation and the leak. (I remember Atsutoshi Nishida Â�Â¼Â“cÂŒÃºÂ‘Â�, Toshiba President (Jun 2006 - now), married an Iranian in 1975 (to make business in Iran as a Toshiba employee) and officially, he worked in America in 1992.)<br>According to Mar 29, 2006's news Caspar Weinberger died (in hospital) on Mar 28, 2006 and resigned his post Secretary of Defense in 1987 for the leak.<br>James Bamford's book 'Â‚Â·Â‚Ã—Â‚Ã„Â‚Ã�Â–TÂŽÃ³Â‚Â³Â‚ÃªÂ‚Ã„Â‚Â¢Â‚Ã© Â•Ã„Â�Â‘Â�Â‘Â‰Ã†ÂˆÃ€Â‘SÂ•Ã›Â�Ã¡Â‹Ã‡Â‚ÃŒÂ�Â³Â‘ÃŒ' (Mar 25, 2003) (originally, 'Body of Secrets : Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency') on Apr 26, 2006 says, NSA Director William Odom lost his position for Iran-Contra affair and people called Mr Odom 'the worst NSA Director in NSA's history'. Mr. William Odom was NSA Director from May 8, 1985 to Aug 1, 1988.<br>(I support current Secretary of Defense Robert Gates if he touched Iran-Contra operation not for Toshiba Corp's order. Because I stronger and stronger suspect Toshiba Corp leaked Iran-Contra affair to ruin Ronald Reagan's administration.)<br><br>Now I'm afraid that Ronald Reagan's Alzheimer's disease and Caspar Weinberger's pneumonia maybe would be Toshiba's mind-control abuse.<br><br>I imagine Japan's PM Keizou Obuchi Â�Â¬ÂŸÂºÂŒbÂŽO's May 14, 2000 cerebral infarction and Japan's PM Masayoshi Oohira Â‘Ã¥Â•Â½Â�Â³Â–F's Jun 12, 1980 myocardial infarction also were Toshiba's mind-control murders. Because Toshiba communist/democrat laborer journalists say Japan's PM(s) was/were killed by America's mind-control.<br>Japanese TV repeated that Obuchi, 'Bucchi phone ÂƒuÂƒbÂƒ`ÂƒtÂƒHÂƒÂ“', constantly telephoned America but, in fact, he might telephone a Japanese. Toshiba R&amp;D team developed cellular phone "i-mode" in the inside of NTT and NTT Docomo Corp NTTÂƒhÂƒRÂƒÂ‚ mind-control-sold (unnecessary) i-mode in Japan after Feb 1999 and Obuchi would unfairly get money from NTT Docomo stock. Or Obuchi might refuse the satellite Mbsat plan of Toshiba Corp 'the Historical Thief and Terrorist' with Nobuyuki Idei Â�oÂˆÃ¤Â�LÂ”V's Sony Corp Âƒ\ÂƒjÂ�[ and Bill Clinton's America. Toshiba executives might telephone Obuchi repeatedly.<br><br>The 1st book says in Aug 1988 Japan's NEC Corp was also suspected for COCOM by some news (and it effectively used a big lobbyist). Toshiba Corp would leak it to dilute its own case.<br><br>The 1st book is totally on Toshiba side but it taught me the Toshiba's murder suspicion. I knew Japanese except Toshiba (laborer) persons can't publish any book against Toshiba Corp from long before. The 2nd and 3rd books are perfectly on Toshiba side.<br>Especially, the 3rd book writers also are against America. I think the writers, old JCA-Net members, are Toshiba laborer communists.<br>Book 'Â˜JÂ“Â­Â�Ã­Â�Ã¼Â“Â�ÂˆÃªÂ�Ã©ÂŒÂ¾' (in English, 'The declaration as the unity of labor battle line') (Mar 30, 1983) by Toshiba Labor Union leader Toshifumi Tateyama Â’GÂŽRÂ—Â˜Â•Â¶ says after 1945 Japanese Communist Party Â‹Â¤ÂŽYÂ“} organized and perfectly controlled laborers of many companies and they stationed in Toshiba Horikawa Factory Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â–xÂ�Ã¬Â�HÂ�Ãª but I think Toshiba persons organized and perfectly controlled laborers of many companies as communist elites. The object of the expression is just like Toshiba-Ogikai Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â�Ã®Â‰Ã¯.<br><br>TTAC manager (McLellan ?) Guy Dubois Â‹ZÂ�pÂˆÃšÂ“]Â•]Â‰Â¿ÂƒZÂƒÂ“Âƒ^Â�[(TTAC, Technology Transfer Assessment Center?)Â•Â”Â’Â· Âƒ}ÂƒNÂƒÂŒÂƒÂ‰ÂƒÂ“Â�E"ÂƒKÂƒC"Â�EÂƒfÂƒÂ…Âƒ{ÂƒA, American agency in the 1st book is alive in safety ? I can't find only him. Or he is Guy Dubois ÂƒMÂ�[Â�EÂƒhÂƒDÂƒ{ÂƒÂ�, Cramer President and CEO and (former) PeopleSoft Japan President or former Vantive Executive Vice President ? In 2000 Orix Securities Corp ÂƒIÂƒÂŠÂƒbÂƒNÂƒXÂ�Ã˜ÂŒÂ”, a company secretly occupied by Toshiba persons, used CRM application of Vantive through NTT Data NTTÂƒfÂ�[Âƒ^, another company occupied by Toshiba persons. Now Guy Dubois might be used or mind-controlled by Toshiba Corp.<br><br>The 2nd book, on Toshiba side, says, former Toshiba President Kazuo Iwata ÂŠÃ¢Â“cÂ˜Â¯Â•v, trueborn, said to the writer "... However, the most important is to implore America to stop to make a sanction against Toshiba Corp. If America orders me to show them my penis, I do it or I do even walk around on any street doing it. Even if people laugh at me, I do it for 100 years old Toshiba Corp...

Toshiba-Ogikai Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â�Ã®Â‰Ã¯ persons might have ordered their workers to show Toshiba-Ogikai persons the workers' penises as a punishment.<br>Trueborn Toshiba President would bring the vulgar custom to Toshiba Group. (And Toshiba Corp is a sexual mind-control abuse criminal to me.)<br><br>As a fact Toshiba baseball persons are/were vulgar.<br>On Toshiba Information Equipments Co Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â�Ã®Â•Ã±Â‹@ÂŠÃ­ (TIE)'s baseball tournament day in Jun or Jul 1999, without drinking, Katsumi Kobayashi Â�Â¬Â—Ã‘ÂŒÂ’ÂŽm, 28, Kanto-Toshiba Information System ÂŠÃ–Â“ÂŒÂ“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â�Ã®Â•Ã±Â‹@ÂŠÃ­ÂƒVÂƒXÂƒeÂƒÂ€ (KIS) person maybe from retired Toshiba Fuchu Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â•{Â’Â† baseball player, delightedly put his naked hip on the window of our room in daytime at Toshiba's hotel "Denkiya Â“dÂŠÃ­Â‰Â®" to show outside people it when Shigeru Watado Â“nÂŒÃ‹Â–ÃŽ, about 34, KIS person, ordered him to do it.<br>Hisanori Takahashi Â�Â‚Â‹Â´Â�Â®Â�Â¬, a professional pitcher from Toshiba Corp, often showed people his hip (once, and penis in the back) on TV camera after his joining Yomiuri Giants Â“Ã‡Â”Â„ÂƒWÂƒÂƒÂƒCÂƒAÂƒÂ“Âƒc in 2000. On TV program 'Â‚Â¤Â‚Â¿Â‚Â­Â‚Ã©' in Jan 2001 or 2002 he was proud of the his famous performance as his own performance since Toshiba baseball player days or before. But Tetsu Ooishi Â‘Ã¥Â�ÃŽÂ“O, currently, Toshiba Fuchu Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â•{Â’Â† rugby trainer and maybe retired Toshiba Fuchu Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â•{Â’Â† baseball player, coached him when Takahashi was a high-school player. (In 1999 Ooishi of Toshiba General Affairs Div Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â‘Â�Â–Â± kindly mind-controlled Giants Director Shigeo Nagashima Â’Â·Â“Â‡Â–ÃŽÂ—Y under the agreement of Kouzou Ootagaki Â‘Ã¥Â“cÂŠ_Â�\Â‘Â¢, a manager of Toshiba General Affairs Div Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â‘Â�Â–Â±, to sell Hisanori Takahashi for Takahashi's wish.)<br><br>The 2nd book also taught me a side funny story. Toshiba President (from 1965 to 1972) Toshio Doko Â“yÂŒÃµÂ•qÂ•v ordered all Toshiba persons to turn off all lights out of working time.<br>The Doko doctrine is alive. In 1999 Toshiba Information Equipments Co Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â�Ã®Â•Ã±Â‹@ÂŠÃ­ (TIE) stingy automatically turned off all lights from 12:00 to 13:00 while many employees worked hard.<br>Now Toshiba communist laborers call Toshio Doko Â“yÂŒÃµÂ•qÂ•v 'the father of Toshiba-Ogikai Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â�Ã®Â‰Ã¯'.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The crazy Toshiba-Ogikai Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â�Ã®Â‰Ã¯ leaders, Tomohiro Takahashi Â�Â‚Â‹Â´Â’qÂ�G (Toshiba General Affairs RMG Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â‘Â�Â–Â±RMG (in Jan 2000)), Shigeru Ootsuka Â‘Ã¥Â’Ã‹Â–ÃŽ (Toshiba General Affairs Div Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â‘Â�Â–Â± (in Jan 2000)), Kiichi Ogata ÂƒIÂƒKÂƒ^ÂƒLÂƒCÂƒ` (Toshiba IEG Div Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…IEG (in Jan 2000)) and Toshihiro Sawaoka Ã VÂ‰ÂªÂ�rÂ�G (DVD Sales Sect of Toshiba IEG Div Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…IEGÂ�EDVDÂ�Â¤ (in Jan 2000)), are Toshiba-Ogikai mind-control criminal leaders for me. Their crazy Toshiba group interrupts me harder everyday since Dec 1, 1999 because I only called Toshiba Corp and Toshiba President (Taizo Nishimuro Â�Â¼ÂŽÂºÂ‘Ã—ÂŽO) fool on a day in Apr 1999. They watch me now. Toshiba Corp and Nishida Atsutoshi Â�Â¼Â“cÂŒÃºÂ‘Â�, the Toshiba-Ogikai Â“ÂŒÂŽÃ…Â�Ã®Â‰Ã¯ leader, will label me 'neurotic' the last. Nishida's Toshiba is crazier than ever.<br>My father, not a Toshiba person, was diagnosed with diabetes in Sep 2005 and my mother, not a Toshiba person, has had a trailing for a foot pain since 2000. Toshiba persons gave me awakening for thirst in midnight like diabetes from Apr to Dec 1999 and trailing for a foot pain in Mar 1999, therefore, I suspect Toshiba Corp might give them each symptom. Especially, I'm anxious that my father takes (unnecessary) diabetes medicine and is being worse day by day after Sep 2005 like an Atsutoshi Nishida Â�Â¼Â“cÂŒÃºÂ‘Â�'s plan.)<br>By false patriot Toshiba persons, my mother is mind-controlled to select Japanese Â�Â‘ÂŽY vegetable, fish and meet. While poor my family should prefer low price and good outsiders' foods not high price Japanese. (I prefer Australian beef. I want to try Chinese garlic at the price of one tenth of Japanese. I don't believe only Japanese foods is safe.) By crazy false patriot Toshiba persons, my father was mind-controlled temporarily often in 2006's summer to fall to sing a Manchuria Â–ÂžÂ�B song. False patriot Toshiba persons repeatedly claim against (low price) Chinese goods through my mother and father.</span><br><br>American people touching the sanctions against Toshiba Corp might/will be killed by Toshiba Corp. They are Richard Perle, Stephen Bryen, Fred Ikle, Caspar Weinberger, Ronald Reagan, William Triplett, Duncan Hunter, Edwin Jacob (Jake) Garn, Helen Bentley, Malcolm Baldrige, (McLellan ?)

The Congress persons might/will be interrupted in their elections, if American agency can't protect them from Toshiba's mind-control. Because Toshiba persons are unbelievably snake.<br>Sen John Heinz, the strongest supporter of the sanction against Toshiba Corp, died for airplane crash on Apr 4, 1991. Toshiba Corp might break the airplane by microwave.<br>Rep Wilber C Daniel, the sponsor of H.R.2948, died (for reason unknown by me) on Jan 23, 1988.<br>Rep Charles Wilson, the sponsor of H.R.2698, resigned his position (for reason unknown by me) on Oct 8, 1996.<br>Rep James H. Bilbray (led 78 Reps) ordered Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger not to purchase laptop PCs from Toshiba Corp in early Aug 1987 and he failed for reelection in 1996. Year 1996 was when Toshiba Corp supplied Advanced Television (ATV) System of Atlanta 1996 Olympics for NBC, I care especially.<br>(On the other side, Rep Duncan Hunter, the sponsor of H.AMDT.235 to H.R.1777, and Sen Richard Shelby, the sponsor of S.1399, S.1677 and S.AMDT.355 to S.1420, work for US Congress now.)<br><br><strong>We should know Toshiba Corp maybe supports any memorial institute for Malcolm Baldrige and John Heinz as a false humanist but I believe Toshiba Corp killed Malcolm Baldrige.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Rogues Toshiba Corp and North Korea administration should die together, therefore the best scenario to the World Peace is that the both war. (I mean 'Japan should ruin Toshiba Corp before North Korea because Japan has been ruining North Korea.'.)<br>American people should recall and care Toshiba President Atsutoshi Nishida Â�Â¼Â“cÂŒÃºÂ‘Â� has an Iranian wife for Toshiba's Iran business. Naturally, Toshiba Corp can have supported Iran for Iranian nuke using many dummies.<br>And I really hope Secretary of Defense Robert Gates hates Toshiba Corp, the World's No. 1 terrorist for money. 3 Toshiba Corp's current and future core business are all theft - important NAND Flash memory patent from Lexar Media Inc (USA), important SED TV patent from Nano-Proprietary Inc (USA) and maybe important Nuclear power system patent (for new ABWR 'AB1600') from General Electric Co (USA).<br>(I suspect former Bush's Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld is another 'the Toshiba's real Prince of Darkness' Toshiba industrial spy or Toshiba Corp sent Toshiba industrial spy Donald H. Rumsfeld for Bush's Secretary of Defense to move US Congress.
