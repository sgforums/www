We took everything for granted...we believe that we have the rights to everything...We can wear colored bra, (who cares, i like can liao), six studs in a ear (stylo mah)...shorter shirts (sexy), Vulgarites (sat sat sei)...You may think is stylo or unique...or even appealing to opposite sex...but the truth is...this<br><br>- Colored bra (males will see you as a bi tch) Let us know if you liked to be called a bi tch<br>- Six studs in a ear (nice? for what you act like ang mo?)<br>- shorter skirt (people see you as not a bi tch but a sl ut)<br>- vulgarites (this is the worse. If you wanna find a serious fren, dont find one who speak vulgarites....because its easy to judge someone when he speaks)<br><br>Juz in case you dont know...school is a place with a system...and its in this system can you enjoy what you got now.
