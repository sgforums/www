            <div class='col-md body'>Like it or nt, rules are here to stay. Stop complaining and dont get too personal and try to understand that ur teachers also have to do their jobs.<br><br>If you think rules shd nt be there and are stupid, try volunteer yourself in primary sch or nursery and try to make 40 kids listen and folow your instructions. Then you may understand why your teachers behave in this manner.<br><br>Agree some rules are stupids but since you are in the system just bear wif them.<br><br>For those making "smart remarks" , you can alway get out of the sch system by quitting. Ask you parent to write a letter to the sch to say you are quitting sch due to personal reasons then you dun need to stick to the stupid rules. The sch can sack you due to MOE ruling but you can always quite. I know of at least 5 ppls who quit be N and O due to financial problems. You can fake that too. Dun know how, just absent yourself for few week then ask you parent to submit the letter after being contacted by the sch. I think your parent would agree the rules sux and do wan you to suffer in sch.<br>Then you could enjoy life at home and do all you want with your skirt, ear, hair and whatever. Cant afford the cash then shut up and suffer. There are ppls who want to study and yet dont stand a chance. Well if you have fluant it if dont stuff it.<br><br>I know it common to complain but try to be fair and view both sides stories. As the old folk say, if your teacher dont care abt you they would bother abt you. Ever wonder why the some ppls dont comment on your appearance, cos they don give a damn abt you.<br><br>On a more sensitive topic, your parent dont bother abt your behaviour is really becos they trust you or the new era of parent-child relationship behaviour. Or is it becoz they are too busy with their own things or too tired after their works. How many time have you heard that parent complain that sch keep asking them down to discuss abt their child sch life and it is disturbing their work schdules and they dont  have times. Does that mean their job is more important than their child future?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For goodness' sake... just because of some ear sticks, want to complain already.....<br><br>You may think that school rules are restrictive. Well, what can you do about it? Complain to the MOE? More likely, they'll just laugh at your letter and toss it in the bin.<br><br>I don't want to get into a lecture regarding the state of our youth today. However, I feel that I do have to say something: I feel that our youth today are generally too pampered, too havoc and too unappreciative of what they have. I think it's incredible that I'm saying all this for I'm only 21, and I'm not really THAT old.... am I?<br><br>My 17-year old neighbour for instance has just dropped a tuition assignment, where she was supposed to teach this Primary 6 kid. When I asked her why, she said it's because the kid's house has no air con. Sheesh.... I almost had to move heaven and earth to get my current tuition assignment in order to help pay for my school fees. It's no joke, considering that they're raising the fees in NUS.<br><br>If you think that school's bad, wait till you enter the working world. There are almost no rules out there, and you'll find yourself constantly swimming in a sea of utter confusion.<br><br>While some rules are indeed downright dumb, you'll find that some sense of order and familiarity is far more preferable to utter chaos.

            <div class='col-md body'>Weird point about the sticks.  Some schools actually want the girls to use ear sticks because they're cheap, plain-looking, and easier to regulate than ear studs (which come in greater variety).<br><br>... "ear sticks" remind me of those huge satay sticks in the earlobes of cannibals hahah</div>
