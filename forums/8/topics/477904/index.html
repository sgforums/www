              In food business you make more than 100 per cent profit can even reach to 300 per cent and its hard cash in hand earning daily. See how greedy the food stall owners or the coffee shop owners. That self return tray campaign is not working many of the customer don't bother to place it at the tray area...look at the food court at shopping mall, hawker centres, coffee shops and fast food restaurants...plenty of left over plates on the tables....only a small number of patrons will do that selfless deed...the rest aiyah..don't bother..human nature. Let the stall owners to engage their own stall assistants to clear their own plates and the owner of the eating premises can scold them if they fail to do it..like the old ways.

If everyone return their trays and one guy didnt, he will instinctively do it since everyone is doing it. <br><br>It is just like how nowadays people are queuing up to enter the MRT train.

              <p>When self return tray campaign become more successful, the cheapskate contractors will start reducing to 4, and then 3, and then just maybe 2 cleaners left. Quoting do not need so many cleaners anymore. Those remaining workers will continue to work like slaves.</p>
              <p>By then the remaining x cleaners will also be overworked because there will always be uncleared trays and/or the cheapskate contractors will continue to squeeze and the remaining cleaners will be asked to double-up as washers as well lah.</p>

              I cup of coffee/Tea how much? S$1 to S$1.10. You just need hot water, 1 spoon of coffee powder, a tea spoon of condense milk and a spoon of sugar. 
                  
              Nasi Goreng, some rice, half an egg and a little bit of ingredients for S$3 to $4. 
                  
              You earn more profit if you have plenty of customers and your foods are delicious and famous. If people don't like your food and price...then you can't or have problems covering your rent. In food business you can see your profit within 6 months or even lesser.

                                      <p>It is the culture of returning trays. Monkey see monkey do. If
                      everyone return their trays and one guy didnt, he will
                      instinctively do it since everyone is doing it. <br>
                      <br>
                      It is just like how nowadays people are queuing up to enter the MRT
                      train. A few yrs back no one did. Same thing. It will take awhile
                      for people to do it. Anyway recent studies shows more and more
                      people are returning their trays. It is a good sign.</p>

              That need to be back up by national advertising campaigns over the mass medias like they used to have a successful campaign on the derogating advertising campaigns of "Stop At Two" in the past. Plus penalties to make it more effective. That was how the Singapore Government educate the people over the mass medias. That how Singaporeans are most of the time, they need to be told by the Singapore Government before they actually do it. And the best way to make it more effective is to legislate it like fines for not flushing after using the toilet bowl, no chewing gums, no spitting etcs...lols. Singapore is a city of fines....all the tourists know this.

                  <p>When self return tray campaign become more successful, the
                  cheapskate contractors will start reducing to 4, and then 3, and
                  then just maybe 2 cleaners left. Quoting do not need so many
                  cleaners anymore. Those remaining workers will continue to work
                  like slaves.</p>
                  <p>By then the remaining x cleaners will also be overworked because
                  there will always be uncleared trays and/or the cheapskate
                  contractors will continue to squeeze and the remaining cleaners
                  will be asked to double-up as washers as well lah.</p>

              Get the food stall owners to clear all those plates lah and the coffee shop owners to clear their cups and glasses. They must know how to help and co-operate with one another. If the customers like the hawkers some of them will even send the plates back to your food stalls..isn't that better than to employer cleaners to do the work. Get their children, friends or relatives or someone regardless young or old that need some money to help them at the stall on a daily basis like part time work....the old ways are much more simpler than now which seems like so difficult to solve.

            <div class='col-md body'>They used to have disposal utensils for the customers and still it wasn't working efficiently and effectively...aiyah. Just legislate the law to make them clear their own plates that will do it and they may even wash clean their own plates for the food stall owners or the coffee shop owners lols. They will only do it when their money is burn to pay for fines...lols.</div>

              During my time too, all NS personnel will know how to clear and wash their own utensils because its compulsory and if you don't the Duty BOS or MPs or RPs at the Cook House will catch you. Then you will either get your weekend passes burned or performed extra guard duties. I was trained by my dad to clear and wash my own plate at the age of 6 because he said that if I don't nobody will carry your coffin when you die.
