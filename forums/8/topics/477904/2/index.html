              <p>Nasi Goreng, some rice, half an egg and a little bit of

              Restaurant is a bigger business than the food stalls at coffee shop or at food court. Of course your profit margin will be lower when you employ more staffs and you have no choice because you have to give good service and good ambience for your customers because they pay for that services besides your food sold there....in that sense I agree with you that your profit will be no more than 30% or slightly over 30% because most of the profit go to them, rent, utility bills....the cost of running a restaurant will be much much more then a food stall. For a small food stall you are the staff, the cook, the server, the cleaner and your own boss....and if you think you can afford you will hire a local assistant to help you at the stall...better still if your own family members can help you at the food stall. I had a small restaurant at bali before which I had operated 24 hrs and then a year later I built a hawker centre in another area just outside Kuta. Good, if you can clear and wash your own plates at home than its not difficult for you to help to clear your own plate after your meal at the public eating premises.

              Singapore is a first world country but with low wages....technically that is economic slavery for the workers here. Singapore is one of the wealthiest country in the world but with cheapskate employers especially the SMEs.
