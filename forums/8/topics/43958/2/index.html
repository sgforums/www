            <div class='col-md body'>It has to be Henry though i am not a fan of his. The reason why he would take credit over Nisterooy is that the individual brillance of this guy who can transform a match.

Agreed on your piont abt his individual brilliance that win matches alone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I won't deny the brilliance of Henry n he fully deserved the 2 awards he garnered this yr. But wat separate great players from legends r the ability 2 turn it on when it comes 2 the crunch.<br><br>Henry is way behind Van Nisterooy  when it come to clinical finishing, this point i m sure u guys will agree with me. So even with 8 points ahead at March this yr, everyone can see that Arsenal have problem converting their chances into goals as compared 2 Man U. Commentators have stressed the point that Man U put opponents 2 the sword n steamrolled them, whereas Arsenal lets opponents back as in the case of Bolton.<br><br>Even during the match against Leeds, the commentator remarked which of the match winners among Pires, Berkamp, Wiltord n Henry is going 2 take the match by the scruff, n guess who turned it on, Parlour of all ppl. Jus the reaction of Pires shying away from a chance with Mills give u an insight into the French mentality. They always think they have other chances 2 score n lack that....shall we said ...lvl of full-blooded agression that English players have.<br><br>Arsenal got themselves 2 blame cos they were not able 2 pulverised opponents like they did earlier in the season. And with Wenger saying nonsense like remaining unbeaten thruout the season, u bet their opponents will b more committed against them, not 2 mentioned the juggling n flicks displayed by Henry n co which hinged on arrogance and utter disrespect.<br><br>Arsenal is the best team in EPL w/o a doubt but whether they manage 2 play 2 their potential over a whole season with Europe ambitions 2 boot, remains 2b judged next season. N 4 Henry 2b recognised as numero uno, he needs 2 proved that he can win matches on his own wk in wk out like his compatriot, Zidane.<br><br>At least Van Nisterooy buried chances that comes his way unlike Henry who miss some of the easiest chances seen this season.<br><br>Van Nisterooy n Owen r  natural, goal poachers, 1 with physical prowess, the other with speed. Henry is somewhere in between with brilliant technical skill, until he improve his finishing overall esp with his head. There will be endless debate over the supreme striker that rule EPL.</div>
