It usually starts with the onset of puberty, around age 10-12 in<br>girls and age 12-14 in boys.  Sometimes kids are spared in their teenage<br>years, only to have acne flare when they reach their twenties.  This is<br>particularly common in women.<br><br>The red spots seen with common acne are called "inflammatory papules".<br>Often times there is a second type of acne lesion present called the<br>"comedo".  There are two types of comedones:  "open comedones" are<br>whiteheads and "closed comedones" are blackheads.  The third type of acne<br>lesion is the acne cyst, which is a common variant of acne.  Cystic acne is<br>characterized by multiple hard, red, tender lumps under the skin.  It often<br>affects the face, but also can be seen on the back and chest, under the<br>arms, and in the groin.  Comedonal and inflammatory acne can also affect<br>the back and chest, and rarely the scalp.<br><br>Acne is a disease of hair follicles.  That may sound bizarre, but it is<br>very well documented.  Most of the time, acne is a disease of vellus hair<br>follicles.  These are the tiny white hairs everyone has on their face.<br>Hair follicles contain tiny structures called sebaceous glands, which<br>produce sebum.  Sebum is what accounts for the oily nature of the skin of<br>many acne patients.  Sebaceous glands start to kick into high gear with the<br>onset of puberty, and sometimes over burden the hair follicle.  Think of<br>the hair follicle as a river, and the sebaceous gland sebum as the water in<br>that river.  When things are moving well, no problems.  But when the river<br>starts to move faster and the amount of water (sebum) increases rapidly, it<br>can overflow its banks and create a problem.  Now factor in an additional<br>problem:  a dam!  The opening of the hair follicle is normally wide enough<br>to allow the sebum to flow through it without difficulty, even when sebum<br>secretion increases.  However, in many acne patients the hair follicle<br>opening begins to get smaller, acting like a dam in the river.  Again, this<br>can cause the sebum river to overflow, producing acne.<br><br>The final part of acne evolution is infection.  All of the overflowing<br>sebum sits under the skin in a tiny balloon-like ball.  As it sits, it<br>begins to be attacked by Propionobacterium acnes, or P. acnes for short.<br>Once the sebum becomes infected, that is when you get the big red acne<br>lesion.  If the balloon of sebum ruptures, a cyst forms and the infection<br>and inflammation spread.<br><br>What causes acne?<br><br>Basically, very few things cause acne.  Studies show that nearly 100% of<br>teenagers will get some amount of acne.  Some get more, some get less, but<br>all get some.  Poor hygiene, bad washing habits, too much chocolate, lots<br>of greasy foods:  these are the popular myths about causes of acne, but<br>rarely do these cause acne.  That is not to say you should stop washing<br>your skin, but you don't need to go nuts.  In fact, too much washing and<br>scrubbing are some of the few things that can actually cause acne.  Many<br>parents tell their kids that acne is caused by dirty skin.  Not usually<br>true.  The infection component of acne is very deep within the skin, and<br>washing the surface will not do much down deep.  Just keep your skin clean,<br>but don't try to scrub out the infection.  You may only make things worse.<br><br>Another cause of acne is excess friction, such as from a football helmet<br>chin strap, or holding the telephone against your chin all day.  But most<br>of the people who get acne get it because that is their hereditary<br>predisposition.  The more acne your parents had, the more you are likely to<br>have.<br><br>Stress is one of the wildcards in causing acne.  Most research suggests<br>that stress does not directly cause acne, but many of my patients feel<br>strongly that stress and their acne are related.  What likely happens is<br>that patients already have a bit of acne, and the stress induces then to<br>pick at their acne lesions, which makes them redder and therefore look<br>worse.  Hence the standard advice to acne patients:   DON'T PICK!  For<br>patients who are concerned that acne and their stress are related, consider<br>visiting a website that deals with this and other issues, <a href="http://grossbart.com." rel="nofollow">http://grossbart.com.</a>   While it would be nice if we could make some link<br>between acne and stress, there isn't any scientific evidence to do so as of<br>yet.  That doesn't mean the two won't be linked in the future.  Bottom line<br>is that we all have stress, and it is tough to predict just what that<br>stress does to us.  It affects people in different ways, and the temptation<br>is there to link stress to our acne.  Clearly, stress reduction is good for<br>us in general, and if it helps your acne, all the better!<br><br>Some patients, usually women, develop acne because of hormonal causes.  A<br>consult with your doctor can help to address this issue for you.  A new and<br>popular treatment for acne is the oral contraceptive aimed at addressing<br>this hormonal link with acne.  Although a birth control pill (Ortho<br>Tricyclen) is approved for use as an acne treatment in women, in my<br>experience it is not a magic solution.  It can be a nice addition to a well<br>planned acne treatment regimen, but alone it is not likely to clear your<br>acne.  Clearly, you should consult with your family doctor or gynecologist<br>before going on the birth control pill, even if it is for your acne.<br><br>Simply washing gently with soap and water is a sufficient daily skin care<br>program for most people.  If you have very oily skin you may want to try a<br>soap made especially for oily skin.  But be careful, there are a lot of<br>gimmicks on the market!  If your skin is not too oily, you may want to use<br>a light moisturizer after washing your skin.<br><br>Oily skin is something I get many questions about.  It can be almost<br>impossible to treat, which is frustrating.  Glycolic acid products,<br>salicylic acid lotions, special soaps, and astringents can all be tried<br>with varying degrees of success.  Topical tretinoin (Retin A) and its<br>prescription cousins (Differin, Avita) can have some effect, but often not<br>enough to make patients happy.  Glycolic acid or beta hydroxy acid chemical<br>peels can work some, but again are temporary.  Blackheads often accompany<br>oily skin, and are best treated with topical tretinoin.  A new treatment<br>for sun-damaged skin that is also effective on blackheads and oily skin is<br>called the PowerPeel or DermaPeel.  These are performed in doctors offices.<br><br>Can acne be treated?<br><br>The most improtant consideration in acne treatment is patience, and lots of<br>it!  It will take at least 2-3 months for the acne treatment you are using<br>to even begin to work, no matter what it is.  I constantly hear from people<br>that they used a medicine for a few weeks and it didn't work, and they get<br>frustrated.  This is a critical phase of acne treatment, because pushing<br>ahead often will produce the results the patient is looking for.  One of<br>our jobs as dermatologists is to educate people so they understand what the<br>goals are and why it is important to keep up with the treatment plan even<br>if it doesn't appear to be working.  It is hard for patients to accept the<br>fact that if a medicine isn't working after 3 weeks, that it somehow<br>magically will after 8 weeks, but it does happen.  The reason is that the<br>medicine is actually working at the 3 week mark, but your body just hasn't<br>caught up with it and cleared all of the debris left behind by the acne<br>lesion itself.  After 8-12 weeks, your body and the medicine effectively<br>get "in synch" and work together to clear your skin.  If by 2-3 months you<br>don't see any improvement, then it is very reasonable to ask you doctor to<br>change things around.<br><br>Fortunately, we now have many terrific treatments for acne.  There are some<br>general guidelines that most dermatologist follow in prescribing acne<br>treatment.  The over-the-counter (OTC) treatments such as benzoyl peroxide<br>can be fine for some patients, but that is the exception rather than the<br>rule.  With acne, it is best to get it under control early rather than let<br>it really get going.  Rampant or severe acne can lead to scarring in some<br>patients (to be discussed later), and it is impossible to predict who will<br>get scars.  The best treatment for acne scars is to prevent them, and the<br>best way to do that is to treat and prevent acne.<br><br>One regimen for treating mild acne is to use a glycolic acid lotion twice a<br>day, and benzoyl peroxide 5 or 10% lotion twice a day with the glycolic<br>acid.  The 5% is just as good as the 10%, in fact a bit better because it<br>is less irritating, so try the 5% first.  One product that is potentially<br>good in this regimen is Neutrogena Healthy Skin with glycolic acid or<br>Retinol.  Retinol is a precursor of tretinoin, the active ingredient in<br>Retin A.  It won't work as well as Retin A, but it is a good place to start<br>if you can't get to a doctor.  You can also add a product that has<br>salicylic acid in it as part of this regimen.  Naturally, if you don't see<br>results after 2 months or so, you should strongly consider a visit to a<br>dermatologist.  Although many people have home remedies for acne, and would<br>prefer not to see a dermatologist, the reality of it is that acne can be<br>very stubborn, and the majority of patients would do better with a<br>dermatolgist's help than they can on their own.  Skin doctors have years of<br>training, and our job is to help you clear your acne (as well as to treat<br>other skin diseases).<br><br>I get numerous questions about home treatments such as herbal remedies,<br>using rubbing alcohol, holistic approaches, taking vitamins, Proactiv<br>Solution, and the Igia Clear system.  I have never found any of these to<br>work for my patients.  That is not to say that they can't work, but there<br>is no good scientific evidence to say that they will, and in my experience,<br>they don't offer much benefit in treating acne.  I don't recommend them to<br>my patients.<br><br>Some men also experience aggravation of their acne when shaving.  I have<br>found that a few helpful tips can make this much less of a problem.  I<br>suggest using a shaving gel instead of a cream, and to use a double edge<br>blade razor instead of electric.  The one I prefer is the Gillette Sensor<br>razor.  Also, try to shave in the shower to take advantage of the skin<br>softening effects fo the steam.  Shave in only one direction on each part<br>of the face, the so-called "with the grain" approach.  Don't try to shave<br>too close because that can cause problems.  Also, change the blade after<br>every two uses.  Can be expensive, but it keeps the blades clean and sharp.<br><br>Small comedonal acne (blackheads and whiteheads) is sometimes effectively<br>treated with OTC products such as benzoyl peroxide too.  But usually<br>comedones are best treated with topical vitamin A based prescription<br>preparations such as Retin A, Avita, or Differin.  When the comedones<br>become infected and inflammatory acne develops, then antibiotics should be<br>added by prescription.  Topical antibiotics are effective for many<br>patients, and these usually include erythromycin or clindamycin.  When the<br>inflammatory acne is severe or affects the back, scalp or chest, oral<br>antibiotics become the treatment of choice for most patients.  Common oral<br>antibiotics used by physicians include tetracycline, erythromycin,<br>minocycline and doxicycline.  Many times physicians will use a combination<br>of topical and oral prescription medications to treat acne.  Please consult<br>with your physician if you are using prescription medication for acne, to<br>understand the potential interactions of drugs you are taking and their<br>possible side effects.<br><br>There are some common mistakes made when treating acne.  Topical<br>preparations should not be placed solely on the active lesions.  Acne<br>treatment is preventive, so putting the medicine only on the active lesions<br>does nothing to prevent future acne breakouts, and may not help much at<br>all.  Place the topical medication wherever you tend to get acne, even if<br>you don't have it there now.  Also, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS ON THE<br>PRESCRIPTION.  You need to use the medicine as your doctor intended you to,<br>so read the directions.  It usually takes several months for acne to begin<br>to improve with treatment.  My rule of thumb is 50% improvement every 2<br>months, and most patients will see significant changes after 6 months of<br>treatment.  If you don't see much change after 3-4 months, talk with your<br>doctor.  Sometimes, acne can even flare within the first few weeks of<br>treatment.  Again, talk to your doctor if you have concerns.<br><br>For patients with significant or resistant/persistent acne, the oral<br>medication Accutane (isotretinoin) can be of significant value.  It is a<br>highly effective treatment regimen that is taken for 4-6 months under the<br>careful supervision of a physician.  In some patients, it can even prevent<br>the recurrence of acne once the treatment has been discontinued, and in<br>some a repeat treatment is required.  Accutane has the potential to cause<br>some significant side effects, so not only must a physician monitor its<br>use, but patients need to have a well-established relationship with their<br>doctor, and have a thorough discussion with their doctor before beginning<br>Accutane therapy.  There is more detailed information about Accutane below.<br><br>What about acne scars?<br><br>First it is important to determine and define what a scar is.  A true scar<br>is a permanent defect in the skin caused by an injury to the area, such as<br>an acne lesion.  The key word is "permanent".  Most of the acne lesions<br>that people call scars are really not scars at all, but something referred<br>to as "post inflammatory erythema".  In plain English, the red spots left<br>after an acne lesion are just that...red spots caused by acne inflammation.<br>THESE WILL NEARLY ALWAYS GO AWAY.  It may take 6-12 months, but red spots<br>after acne will fade.  If you want to speed it along, you can try an OTC<br>glycolic acid containing product.  You may also want to talk with your<br>doctor about having glycolic acid chemical peels.  This is usually a series<br>of 4-6 peels which can significantly help to reduce the appearance of red<br>acne lesions.  Some people refer to these red lesions as acne "staining",<br>but many of my patients feel the glycolic acid peels get their skin looking<br>better faster than it would without the peels.<br><br>Dark skinned individuals have a tendency to get brown spots instead of red.<br>These can be a bit more stubborn, but they too almost always resolve.<br>Glycolic acid works here too, but you can also try adding a bleaching agent<br>such as Ambi, Esoterica, or Porcelana.  But be careful not to overdo it and<br>lighten your skin too much!  If you think your red or brown marks are not<br>fading, look at your skin very carefully.  Usually, it is not that the<br>original ones you had didn't fade.  They did, but you proabably got new<br>spots in the same area that makes it look like you still have the original<br>lesions.<br><br>True acne scars are a different matter.  These are the subtle and sometimes<br>not so subtle depressions in the skin that follow acne lesions in some<br>patients.  These true scars are also sometimes red, so if you have<br>questions consult your physician.  If you see a depression in your skin in<br>an area where you had some acne, it may be a scar.  The big problem for<br>physicians is we can't predict which patients will develop scars.  Some<br>people seem to have mild acne but develop severe scars.  Others get severe<br>acne and end up with minimal scarring.  Again, preventing acne is the best<br>way of preventing acne scars.  If you have acne scars, then there are<br>several treatments available for you.  Unfortunately, acne scarring can be<br>very difficult to treat effectively and can be costly and time consuming.<br>It helps to find a cosmetic dermatologic or plastic surgeon who you can<br>develop a working relationship with to have your scars treated because many<br>patients need a multi-step approach to therapy.  Available treatment<br>options include collagen injections, fat transplantation, autologous dermal<br>grafting, Fibrel, other filler substances to lift scars, medium to deep<br>chemical peels, dermabrasion, and laser resurfacing with the carbon dioxide<br>or erbium lasers.  Consult your physician for more information on these<br>procedures.  Be careful about who you choose to actually treat your skin.<br>Ask to see before and after photos of their patients, and ask to speak with<br>patients who they have treated to get a feel for the doctors skill level.<br><br>There are essentially 3 types of acne scars:  icepick, boxcar, and rolling.<br>Icepick scars are deep tiny one millimeter holes that must be treated with<br>surgical removal.  Nothing else works.  Boxcar scars look a bit like<br>chickenpox scars.  These respond well to many treatment modalities,<br>including excision (if they are deep), subcision, collagen injections, and<br>dermal grafting.  They also respond well to laser resurfacing if they are<br>not too deep (more info below).  Rolling scars give the undulating<br>so-called "pock-marked" look to acne scarred skin.  These can be tough to<br>treat, and require a surgeon who is willing to treat these very carefully.<br>I have found subcision, a new procedure for elevating scars, to be<br>excellent for rolling scars, and routinely use this as part of a<br>comprehensive acne scar treatment plan.  Chemical peels, although much<br>talked about for true scar treatment, don't work well at all for this.<br>They are best used to treat the red and brown marks discussed earlier.<br><br>Lasers are a new addition to the surgeon's war on acne scars.  Carbon<br>dioxide and erbium lasers are available opitons, and are used to literally<br>remove layers of skin until the surgeon gets your skin to the point that it<br>is smooth.  This is a very involved, expensive, precise, and complex<br>surgical procedure for acne scar management.  It is a superb tool in the<br>right surgeon's hands, but you must be careful to choose your doctor<br>carefully.  As you can see, there are many treatment options for acne<br>scars, and you should ask your doctor which of these s/he performs.  If the<br>doctor only performs laser surgery and does not have a colleague s/he works<br>with for the other surgical procedures (ie. subcision, excision), then be<br>careful.  Even if the doctor is a superb laser surgeon, results may be<br>limited because it is often a comination of the procedures discussed above<br>that gives truly superb results.  On average, one can expect 40-50%<br>improvement in acne scars from laser treatment alone, and the percentage<br>improvement can rise significantly when laser therapy is combined with<br>other procedures.<br><br>Summary<br><br>As you can see, acne is a multifactorial disease with multiple treatment<br>options.  Nothing can replace a consultation with your physician, and you<br>should be examined if you have any concerns regarding acne or other health<br>problems.<br><br>Accutane Information<br><br>Accutane (isotretinoin) is a good drug.   It is usually reserved for 2<br>types of patients.  The first is the patient with cystic or nodular acne.<br>The second type of patient is the one with acne tht has been resistent to<br>treatment with the other conventional regimens.<br><br>The nice part about Accutane is that some of the patients who are treated<br>with it will be cured of their acne forever.  Some studies suggest the<br>number may be as high as 85%.  For most people, their acne will be much<br>more manageable after they finish Accutane.  The typical treatment course<br>is 20 weeks, but I will often push that to 24 weeks if the patient is<br>tolerating it well.  The ideal dose is 1 mg per kg of body weight.  That<br>means a 140 pound person (about 60 kg) should have an ideal dose of 60 mg<br>per day.  I'll usually start them at 20 mg per day to let them get used to<br>the medicine, and then increase to 60 mg per day over the first 4 weeks of<br>therapy.  It takes 2-3 months to begin to see results.<br><br>The main side effect is dry skin, as well as dry eyes, hair, and brittle<br>nails.  A small number of people complain if hair loss, but this has always<br>been reversible in my experience.  These symptoms are usually dose related.<br>Patients who wear contact lenses can have a particularly tough time because<br>of the dry eyes.  They use a lot of artificial lubricants, or simply switch<br>to wearing glasses.  I recommend Aquaphor ointment for the dry lips.  A<br>good cream moisturizer will help the dry skin.  Other side effects to watch<br>for are headaches, fatigue, changes in behavior, joint pains (particularly<br>if you have broken a bone in the past), and stomach pains.  Accutane can<br>affect the liver, so it is a good idea to stay away from alcohol while on<br>treatment.<br><br>There are two main areas of concern when taking Accutane:<br><br>1.	Accutane can cause your Cholesterol and triglycerides to become<br>elevated.  Your doctor will need to monitor your blood tests on a monthly<br>basis to make sure this is not a problem.  If you have a particularly<br>strong family history of heart or cholesterol problems you may not be a<br>candidate for Accutane.<br><br>2.  Pregnancy in women is the biggest Accutane issue.  If a woman gets<br>pregnant on Accutane, she has a very high likelyhood of having a baby with<br>birth defects.  Only one way to prevent this if you take Accutane...DON'T<br>GET PREGNANT!!!!  A recent study showed that at least 3% of women get<br>pregnant while on Accutane, despite signing forms saying they won't get<br>pregnant and getting mountains of information about it.  This is the one<br>area where the patient needs to take responsibility for her own actions.  I<br>can't stress enough how important it is to be careful and not get pregnant.<br>I'd like to clarify what happens after stopping Accutane.  Once a woman has<br>comleted 1 (and I tell my patients 2) full menstrual cycles after stopping<br>Accutane, she is no longer at risk.  What that means is that 2-3 months<br>after stopping Accutane, woman have no increased risk of having a baby with<br>birth defects other than the risks they would have had in the absence of<br>Accutane.  Men are a different story.  Because of the way Accutane works,<br>men are not at risk of transmitting birth defects to a fetus if they get a<br>waman pregnant.  Having said that, I caution my male patients about getting<br>a woman pregnant.  This is simply because if the woman were to have a baby<br>with a problem, there would always be that little tug of doubt about<br>whether the Accutane contributed.  The answer is no, but when dealing with<br>pregnancies and babies, it is in my opinion best to avoid all prospects of<br>doubt.<br><br>If a patient who has taken Accutane begins to get acne back after finishing<br>Accutane treatment, I will often give a second or even third and fourth<br>course of the drug.  I try to separate the treatments by 6 months to give<br>the body a chance to recover.<br><br>I hope this information about acne and Accutane has helped.<br><br>Dr. Kaminer<br></div>
