            <div class='col-md body'>My classmate, a girl, owes me $100 bucks for 5 months already. The first time I asked her back for it (in a nice, polite manner) was before CNY, and I assumed that out of good cause, she'd have the sense to save part of her redpacket money to pay me back. THEN, after the CNY holiday, she comes back to school and I overheard her saying to another friend, "Wahhh...my angbao money all gone liao laaaa...spent on gambling, clubbing, etc etc." <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">. I didn't pursue this matter till last week, where I sent her an sms again, to ask her when she can actually pay me (again, I did it nicely). So she replied me, saying she really can't raise the money now, as she has to pay her phone bills and her mom gives her very little pocket money. Of course after hearing this I replied her that it'd be good if she could kindly try her best and raise the sum by the end of may, and that if she should not be able to do it by then, kindly drop me an sms. The thing I don't get is, a close friend of hers came and told me that she gets $10 a day and her phone bills add up to a max of only $20+ a month. AND, she isn't really making an effort to save up money- she takes a cab most of the time to her boyfriend's house etc- To make things worse, she actually owes 3 others money, adding up to close to $200, all not returned yet. She also complains that it is really stressful when people want their money back from her. I mean, if she knows she can't return the money, why did she even borrow it in the first place? I don't think I'm being unreasonable here, am I? I gave her 5 months to return a hundred bucks. If she took the effort to save up a measly dollar everyday, I'm sure she'd be able to pay her dues aready.<br><br>How?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

You definitely have to be prepared to forgo the loan cause there's really nothing much you can do if the borrower refuse to pay back, except ending the friendship and all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>You can get a few people together and apply "peer pressure" but then again, I'm not one to do that.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well dun mind me saying this but if she decided not to return then its juz too bad that one have to sacrifice it away with the $100 &amp; no point pressing it as your fren is juz as good as bankrupt..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I'm not trying to break up your friendship with this girl or something i juz want u to take note about her behavioural when it comes to borrowing money. But of course if u can juz learn to say a simple "no" in a nice manner when she borrows your money again.<br><br>If not u can try to snook her abit saying u yourself owe ppl too much money so have to save up &amp; pay them back.

            <div class='col-md body'>Funny leh, I lent money to my friends a few times, but I never encounter this kind of problem. They always pay me back.<br><br>I think lending money to friends is actually a very good and sincere gesture, it is a help just like any other help, so I disagree if some people say don't lend money to friends. In fact the true test of a friendship is whether someone will be willing to lend money or not, in times of difficulty.<br><br>If want to know whether your money will be back, actually you can tell beforehand, from the strength of your relationship, and the other person's character. If you have good relationship, good trust between you, and you know the person character is reliable and honest, he will most definitely pay you back no matter what happens. In this case, if he ask you for money, you lend him with confidence. This will actually strengthen your friendship. But not only that, there is such thing called compassion and love. Your friend is in trouble, of course you try to help.<br><br>If you have doubts about your relationship strength, or his character, then in this case it's up to you, if you are not willing to lend your money, just say you dont have money to lend.<br><br>Anyway for threadstarter case, I think you can try calling her parents, or ask your parents to call her parents. Like this, most definitely you will end up getting the money back.</div>
