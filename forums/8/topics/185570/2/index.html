            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LizV:</div><div class="quote_body">My classmate, a girl, owes me $100 bucks for 5 months already. The first time I asked her back for it (in a nice, polite manner) was before CNY, and I assumed that out of good cause, she'd have the sense to save part of her redpacket money to pay me back. THEN, after the CNY holiday, she comes back to school and I overheard her saying to another friend, "Wahhh...my angbao money all gone liao laaaa...spent on gambling, clubbing, etc etc." <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">. I didn't pursue this matter till last week, where I sent her an sms again, to ask her when she can actually pay me (again, I did it nicely). So she replied me, saying she really can't raise the money now, as she has to pay her phone bills and her mom gives her very little pocket money. Of course after hearing this I replied her that it'd be good if she could kindly try her best and raise the sum by the end of may, and that if she should not be able to do it by then, kindly drop me an sms. The thing I don't get is, a close friend of hers came and told me that she gets $10 a day and her phone bills add up to a max of only $20+ a month. AND, she isn't really making an effort to save up money- she takes a cab most of the time to her boyfriend's house etc- To make things worse, she actually owes 3 others money, adding up to close to $200, all not returned yet. She also complains that it is really stressful when people want their money back from her. I mean, if she knows she can't return the money, why did she even borrow it in the first place? I don't think I'm being unreasonable here, am I? I gave her 5 months to return a hundred bucks. If she took the effort to save up a measly dollar everyday, I'm sure she'd be able to pay her dues aready.<br><br>How?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote><span style="color: green;">best ways to deal with this b!tch,<br><br>give her bf a call, tell him abt it nicely.<br><br>inform her parents.<br><br>remember after u got back your money, don b friend with her ever!</span></div>

The first time I asked her back for it (in a nice, polite manner) was before CNY, and I assumed that out of good cause, she'd have the sense to save part of her redpacket money to pay me back. THEN, after the CNY holiday, she comes back to school and I overheard her saying to another friend, "Wahhh...my angbao money all gone liao laaaa...spent on gambling, clubbing, etc etc." <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">. I didn't pursue this matter till last week, where I sent her an sms again, to ask her when she can actually pay me (again, I did it nicely). So she replied me, saying she really can't raise the money now, as she has to pay her phone bills and her mom gives her very little pocket money. Of course after hearing this I replied her that it'd be good if she could kindly try her best and raise the sum by the end of may, and that if she should not be able to do it by then, kindly drop me an sms. The thing I don't get is, a close friend of hers came and told me that she gets $10 a day and her phone bills add up to a max of only $20+ a month. AND, she isn't really making an effort to save up money- she takes a cab most of the time to her boyfriend's house etc- To make things worse, she actually owes 3 others money, adding up to close to $200, all not returned yet. She also complains that it is really stressful when people want their money back from her. I mean, if she knows she can't return the money, why did she even borrow it in the first place? I don't think I'm being unreasonable here, am I? I gave her 5 months to return a hundred bucks. If she took the effort to save up a measly dollar everyday, I'm sure she'd be able to pay her dues aready.<br><br>How?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's the issue with human compassion.<br><br>We can't reject their pleas cos they are our friends, and thus often we get ourselves into a fix.<br><br>Me had lent to one of my friends a amount of $24k, and she promised she would return this amount over a period of three years, but everytime me had to discreetly message her to pay her dues. It was fine for the first 2.5 years that she would pay a few $k every quarter of the year. Lately she suddenly gone 'disappeared' and no response from her.<br><br>Me don't think me would be able to get my balance back anymore. Just had to treat it as a expensive lesson learnt to understand her.</div>

They always pay me back.</div></blockquote>Hmm tt all depends lo.<br><br>I gt this frin last time when i hav the money to lend always borrow from me, but he nv fail to return. He's a buddy of mine since pri, i trusted him alot. Nowadays he still ask from mi buti don hav much left to lend though, but i sure will if i hav the moeny to lend him.<br><br>However i also hav some frins tt only borrows, then say by when by when will return but nv does and nv even bother telling me he cant or didnt return till i ask him again after the deadline.<br><br>Anyway to threadstarter, the one solution is u tell ur frin in her face, well not needed for angry tone or wat, "i heard ppl is saying u gt 10 bucks a day and hp bills is 20+ lo, r u lying to mi or something? It was be4 CNY u say will return lo, now how long le. U didnt even bother to tell mi u nt returning or wat lo after CNY. Don like this leh, frin frin when i lent u the money i see u as frin tt's y wanna help mah. Now u doing this to mi, u think is nice meh?"<br><br>Even better to ask others to accompany u, i mean some of the frins of both of u lah, so tt she wont feel being bullied. Best is ask the person who told u abt her 10 bucks a day and 20+ bill a mth to join so tt she cant lie when u tell her tt.</div>
