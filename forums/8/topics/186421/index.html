            <div class='col-md body'>I juz curious, since for internship in poly, it is basically having a semester in the attached company. There will not be any lessons or tutorials and most students will not be using the school facilities at all. So why do they still need to pay school fees for that semester?<br><br>Any comments ?</div>

Fully agreed.<br><br>Ill-treating of employees could be complained to Ministry of Manpower also, and I believed that those employed as interns would be protected by the Employment Act ? [anyone can verify?] So, dun see the point.<br><br>They act as middle man when communication breaks down between the student and the company? Couldn't they sort it out on their own, student and the company directly, may it be the boss or whatsoever? If the student can't accept criticisms nicely, why work? Nxt time go out work also like that wat. Where got everything so smooth sailing. Making facilitator sounds like a nanny.<br><br>"They make sure we learn things on the job that will apply?"<br><br>You mean, they make sure the company will teach us skills that will be related to our course of studies? So do we have the right to refuse work that is beyond our job scope? [no more coffee making!!] Would that ever happen?<br><br>I do think that it is unreasonable, and I feel that paying 100% of the school fees could not be justified. May be 40% or less?<br><br>Let's avoid transpot issue. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
