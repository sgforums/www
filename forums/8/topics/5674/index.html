            <div class='col-md body'>Why I Am Not A Christian<br>by Bertrand Russell<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Introductory note: Russell delivered this lecture on March 6, 1927 to the<br>National Secular Society, South London Branch, at Battersea Town Hall.<br>Published in pamphlet form in that same year, the essay subsequently<br>achieved new fame with Paul Edwards' edition of Russell's book, Why I Am Not<br>a Christian and Other Essays ... (1957).<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>As your Chairman has told you, the subject about which I am going to speak<br>to you tonight is "Why I Am Not a Christian." Perhaps it would be as well,<br>first of all, to try to make out what one means by the word Christian. It is<br>used these days in a very loose sense by a great many people. Some people<br>mean no more by it than a person who attempts to live a good life. In that<br>sense I suppose there would be Christians in all sects and creeds; but I do<br>not think that that is the proper sense of the word, if only because it<br>would imply that all the people who are not Christians -- all the Buddhists,<br>Confucians, Mohammedans, and so on -- are not trying to live a good life. I<br>do not mean by a Christian any person who tries to live decently according<br>to his lights. I think that you must have a certain amount of definite<br>belief before you have a right to call yourself a Christian. The word does<br>not have quite such a full-blooded meaning now as it had in the times of St.<br>Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas. In those days, if a man said that he was a<br>Christian it was known what he meant. You accepted a whole collection of<br>creeds which were set out with great precision, and every single syllable of<br>those creeds you believed with the whole strength of your convictions.<br><br>What Is a Christian?<br><br>Nowadays it is not quite that. We have to be a little more vague in our<br>meaning of Christianity. I think, however, that there are two different<br>items which are quite essential to anybody calling himself a Christian. The<br>first is one of a dogmatic nature -- namely, that you must believe in God<br>and immortality. If you do not believe in those two things, I do not think<br>that you can properly call yourself a Christian. Then, further than that, as<br>the name implies, you must have some kind of belief about Christ. The<br>Mohammedans, for instance, also believe in God and in immortality, and yet<br>they would not call themselves Christians. I think you must have at the very<br>lowest the belief that Christ was, if not divine, at least the best and<br>wisest of men. If you are not going to believe that much about Christ, I do<br>not think you have any right to call yourself a Christian. Of course, there<br>is another sense, which you find in Whitaker's Almanack and in geography<br>books, where the population of the world is said to be divided into<br>Christians, Mohammedans, Buddhists, fetish worshipers, and so on; and in<br>that sense we are all Christians. The geography books count us all in, but<br>that is a purely geographical sense, which I suppose we can ignore.Therefore<br>I take it that when I tell you why I am not a Christian I have to tell you<br>two different things: first, why I do not believe in God and in immortality;<br>and, secondly, why I do not think that Christ was the best and wisest of<br>men, although I grant him a very high degree of moral goodness.<br><br>But for the successful efforts of unbelievers in the past, I could not take<br>so elastic a definition of Christianity as that. As I said before, in olden<br>days it had a much more full-blooded sense. For instance, it included he<br>belief in hell. Belief in eternal hell-fire was an essential item of<br>Christian belief until pretty recent times. In this country, as you know, it<br>ceased to be an essential item because of a decision of the Privy Council,<br>and from that decision the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of<br>York dissented; but in this country our religion is settled by Act of<br>Parliament, and therefore the Privy Council was able to override their<br>Graces and hell was no longer necessary to a Christian. Consequently I shall<br>not insist that a Christian must believe in hell.<br><br>The Existence of God<br><br>To come to this question of the existence of God: it is a large and serious<br>question, and if I were to attempt to deal with it in any adequate manner I<br>should have to keep you here until Kingdom Come, so that you will have to<br>excuse me if I deal with it in a somewhat summary fashion. You know, of<br>course, that the Catholic Church has laid it down as a dogma that the<br>existence of God can be proved by the unaided reason. That is a somewhat<br>curious dogma, but it is one of their dogmas. They had to introduce it<br>because at one time the freethinkers adopted the habit of saying that there<br>were such and such arguments which mere reason might urge against the<br>existence of God, but of course they knew as a matter of faith that God did<br>exist. The arguments and the reasons were set out at great length, and the<br>Catholic Church felt that they must stop it. Therefore they laid it down<br>that the existence of God can be proved by the unaided reason and they had<br>to set up what they considered were arguments to prove it. There are, of<br>course, a number of them, but I shall take only a few.<br><br>The First-cause Argument<br><br>Perhaps the simplest and easiest to understand is the argument of the First<br>Cause. (It is maintained that everything we see in this world has a cause,<br>and as you go back in the chain of causes further and further you must come<br>to a First Cause, and to that First Cause you give the name of God.) That<br>argument, I suppose, does not carry very much weight nowadays, because, in<br>the first place, cause is not quite what it used to be. The philosophers and<br>the men of science have got going on cause, and it has not anything like the<br>vitality it used to have; but, apart from that, you can see that the<br>argument that there must be a First Cause is one that cannot have any<br>validity. I may say that when I was a young man and was debating these<br>questions very seriously in my mind, I for a long time accepted the argument<br>of the First Cause, until one day, at the age of eighteen, I read John<br>Stuart Mill's Autobiography, and I there found this sentence: "My father<br>taught me that the question 'Who made me?' cannot be answered, since it<br>immediately suggests the further question `Who made god?'" That very simple<br>sentence showed me, as I still think, the fallacy in the argument of the<br>First Cause. If everything must have a cause, then God must have a cause. If<br>there can be anything without a cause, it may just as well be the world as<br>God, so that there cannot be any validity in that argument. It is exactly of<br>the same nature as the Hindu's view, that the world rested upon an elephant<br>and the elephant rested upon a tortoise; and when they said, "How about the<br>tortoise?" the Indian said, "Suppose we change the subject." The argument is<br>really no better than that. There is no reason why the world could not have<br>come into being without a cause; nor, on the other hand, is there any reason<br>why it should not have always existed. There is no reason to suppose that<br>the world had a beginning at all. The idea that things must have a beginning<br>is really due to the poverty of our imagination. Therefore, perhaps, I need<br>not waste any more time upon the argument about the First Cause.<br><br>The Natural-law Argument<br><br>Then there is a very common argument from natural law. That was a favorite<br>argument all through the eighteenth century, especially under the influence<br>of Sir Isaac Newton and his cosmogony. People observed the planets going<br>around the sun according to the law of gravitation, and they thought that<br>God had given a behest to these planets to move in that particular fashion,<br>and that was why they did so. That was, of course, a convenient and simple<br>explanation that saved them the trouble of looking any further for<br>explanations of the law of gravitation. Nowadays we explain the law of<br>gravitation in a somewhat complicated fashion that Einstein has introduced.<br>I do not propose to give you a lecture on the law of gravitation, as<br>interpreted by Einstein, because that again would take some time; at any<br>rate, you no longer have the sort of natural law that you had in the<br>Newtonian system, where, for some reason that nobody could understand,<br>nature behaved in a uniform fashion. We now find that a great many things we<br>thought were natural laws are really human conventions. You know that even<br>in the remotest depths of stellar space there are still three feet to a<br>yard. That is, no doubt, a very remarkable fact, but you would hardly call<br>it a law of nature. And a great many things that have been regarded as laws<br>of nature are of that kind. On the other hand, where you can get down to any<br>knowledge of what atoms actually do, you will find they are much less<br>subject to law than people thought, and that the laws at which you arrive<br>are statistical averages of just the sort that would emerge from chance.<br>There is, as we all know, a law that if you throw dice you will get double<br>sixes only about once in thirty-six times, and we do not regard that as<br>evidence that the fall of the dice is regulated by design; on the contrary,<br>if the double sixes came every time we should think that there was design.<br>The laws of nature are of that sort as regards a great many of them. They<br>are statistical averages such as would emerge from the laws of chance; and<br>that makes this whole business of natural law much less impressive than it<br>formerly was. Quite apart from that, which represents the momentary state of<br>science that may change tomorrow, the whole idea that natural laws imply a<br>lawgiver is due to a confusion between natural and human laws. Human laws<br>are behests commanding you to behave a certain way, in which you may choose<br>to behave, or you may choose not to behave; but natural laws are a<br>description of how things do in fact behave, and being a mere description of<br>what they in fact do, you cannot argue that there must be somebody who told<br>them to do that, because even supposing that there were, you are then faced<br>with the question "Why did God issue just those natural laws and no others?"<br>If you say that he did it simply from his own good pleasure, and without any<br>reason, you then find that there is something which is not subject to law,<br>and so your train of natural law is interrupted. If you say, as more<br>orthodox theologians do, that in all the laws which God issues he had a<br>reason for giving those laws rather than others -- the reason, of course,<br>being to create the best universe, although you would never think it to look<br>at it -- if there were a reason for the laws which God gave, then God<br>himself was subject to law, and therefore you do not get any advantage by<br>introducing God as an intermediary. You really have a law outside and<br>anterior to the divine edicts, and God does not serve your purpose, because<br>he is not the ultimate lawgiver. In short, this whole argument about natural<br>law no longer has anything like the strength that it used to have. I am<br>traveling on in time in my review of the arguments. The arguments that are<br>used for the existence of God change their character as time goes on. They<br>were at first hard intellectual arguments embodying certain quite definite<br>fallacies. As we come to modern times they become less respectable<br>intellectually and more and more affected by a kind of moralizing vagueness.<br><br>The Argument from Design<br><br>The next step in the process brings us to the argument from design. You all<br>know the argument from design: everything in the world is made just so that<br>we can manage to live in the world, and if the world was ever so little<br>different, we could not manage to live in it. That is the argument from<br>design. It sometimes takes a rather curious form; for instance, it is argued<br>that rabbits have white tails in order to be easy to shoot. I do not know<br>how rabbits would view that application. It is an easy argument to parody.<br>You all know Voltaire's remark, that obviously the nose was designed to be<br>such as to fit spectacles. That sort of parody has turned out to be not<br>nearly so wide of the mark as it might have seemed in the eighteenth<br>century, because since the time of Darwin we understand much better why<br>living creatures are adapted to their environment. It is not that their<br>environment was made to be suitable to them but that they grew to be<br>suitable to it, and that is the basis of adaptation. There is no evidence of<br>design about it.<br><br>When you come to look into this argument from design, it is a most<br>astonishing thing that people can believe that this world, with all the<br>things that are in it, with all its defects, should be the best that<br>omnipotence and omniscience have been able to produce in millions of years.<br>I really cannot believe it. Do you think that, if you were granted<br>omnipotence and omniscience and millions of years in which to perfect your<br>world, you could produce nothing better than the Ku Klux Klan or the<br>Fascists? Moreover, if you accept the ordinary laws of science, you have to<br>suppose that human life and life in general on this planet will die out in<br>due course: it is a stage in the decay of the solar system; at a certain<br>stage of decay you get the sort of conditions of temperature and so forth<br>which are suitable to protoplasm, and there is life for a short time in the<br>life of the whole solar system. You see in the moon the sort of thing to<br>which the earth is tending -- something dead, cold, and lifeless.<br><br>I am told that that sort of view is depressing, and people will sometimes<br>tell you that if they believed that, they would not be able to go on living.<br>Do not believe it; it is all nonsense. Nobody really worries about much<br>about what is going to happen millions of years hence. Even if they think<br>they are worrying much about that, they are really deceiving themselves.<br>They are worried about something much more mundane, or it may merely be a<br>bad digestion; but nobody is really seriously rendered unhappy by the<br>thought of something that is going to happen to this world millions and<br>millions of years hence. Therefore, although it is of course a gloomy view<br>to suppose that life will die out -- at least I suppose we may say so,<br>although sometimes when I contemplate the things that people do with their<br>lives I think it is almost a consolation -- it is not such as to render life<br>miserable. It merely makes you turn your attention to other things.<br><br>The Moral Arguments for Deity<br><br>Now we reach one stage further in what I shall call the intellectual descent<br>that the Theists have made in their argumentations, and we come to what are<br>called the moral arguments for the existence of God. You all know, of<br>course, that there used to be in the old days three intellectual arguments<br>for the existence of God, all of which were disposed of by Immanuel Kant in<br>the Critique of Pure Reason; but no sooner had he disposed of those<br>arguments than he invented a new one, a moral argument, and that quite<br>convinced him. He was like many people: in intellectual matters he was<br>skeptical, but in moral matters he believed implicitly in the maxims that he<br>had imbibed at his mother's knee. That illustrates what the psychoanalysts<br>so much emphasize -- the immensely stronger hold upon us that our very early<br>associations have than those of later times.<br><br>Kant, as I say, invented a new moral argument for the existence of God, and<br>that in varying forms was extremely popular during the nineteenth century.<br>It has all sorts of forms. One form is to say there would be no right or<br>wrong unless God existed. I am not for the moment concerned with whether<br>there is a difference between right and wrong, or whether there is not: that<br>is another question. The point I am concerned with is that, if you are quite<br>sure there is a difference between right and wrong, then you are in this<br>situation: Is that difference due to God's fiat or is it not? If it is due<br>to God's fiat, then for God himself there is no difference between right and<br>wrong, and it is no longer a significant statement to say that God is good.<br>If you are going to say, as theologians do, that God is good, you must then<br>say that right and wrong have some meaning which is independent of God's<br>fiat, because God's fiats are good and not bad independently of the mere<br>fact that he made them. If you are going to say that, you will then have to<br>say that it is not only through God that right and wrong came into being,<br>but that they are in their essence logically anterior to God. You could, of<br>course, if you liked, say that there was a superior deity who gave orders to<br>the God that made this world, or could take up the line that some of the<br>gnostics took up -- a line which I often thought was a very plausible one --<br>that as a matter of fact this world that we know was made by the devil at a<br>moment when God was not looking. There is a good deal to be said for that,<br>and I am not concerned to refute it.<br><br>The Argument for the Remedying of Injustice<br><br>Then there is another very curious form of moral argument, which is this:<br>they say that the existence of God is required in order to bring justice<br>into the world. In the part of this universe that we know there is great<br>injustice, and often the good suffer, and often the wicked prosper, and one<br>hardly knows which of those is the more annoying; but if you are going to<br>have justice in the universe as a whole you have to suppose a future life to<br>redress the balance of life here on earth. So they say that there must be a<br>God, and there must be Heaven and Hell in order that in the long run there<br>may be justice. That is a very curious argument. If you looked at the matter<br>from a scientific point of view, you would say, "After all, I only know this<br>world. I do not know about the rest of the universe, but so far as one can<br>argue at all on probabilities one would say that probably this world is a<br>fair sample, and if there is injustice here the odds are that there is<br>injustice elsewhere also." Supposing you got a crate of oranges that you<br>opened, and you found all the top layer of oranges bad, you would not argue,<br>"The underneath ones must be good, so as to redress the balance." You would<br>say, "Probably the whole lot is a bad consignment"; and that is really what<br>a scientific person would argue about the universe. He would say, "Here we<br>find in this world a great deal of injustice, and so far as that goes that<br>is a reason for supposing that justice does not rule in the world; and<br>therefore so far as it goes it affords a moral argument against deity and<br>not in favor of one." Of course I know that the sort of intellectual<br>arguments that I have been talking to you about are not what really moves<br>people. What really moves people to believe in God is not any intellectual<br>argument at all. Most people believe in God because they have been taught<br>from early infancy to do it, and that is the main reason.<br><br>Then I think that the next most powerful reason is the wish for safety, a<br>sort of feeling that there is a big brother who will look after you. That<br>plays a very profound part in influencing people's desire for a belief in<br>God.<br><br>The Character of Christ<br><br>I now want to say a few words upon a topic which I often think is not quite<br>sufficiently dealt with by Rationalists, and that is the question whether<br>Christ was the best and the wisest of men. It is generally taken for granted<br>that we should all agree that that was so. I do not myself. I think that<br>there are a good many points upon which I agree with Christ a great deal<br>more than the professing Christians do. I do not know that I could go with<br>Him all the way, but I could go with Him much further than most professing<br>Christians can. You will remember that He said, "Resist not evil: but<br>whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also."<br>That is not a new precept or a new principle. It was used by Lao-tse and<br>Buddha some 500 or 600 years before Christ, but it is not a principle which<br>as a matter of fact Christians accept. I have no doubt that the present<br>prime minister [Stanley Baldwin], for instance, is a most sincere Christian,<br>but I should not advise any of you to go and smite him on one cheek. I think<br>you might find that he thought this text was intended in a figurative sense.<br><br>Then there is another point which I consider excellent. You will remember<br>that Christ said, "Judge not lest ye be judged." That principle I do not<br>think you would find was popular in the law courts of Christian countries. I<br>have known in my time quite a number of judges who were very earnest<br>Christians, and none of them felt that they were acting contrary to<br>Christian principles in what they did. Then Christ says, "Give to him that<br>asketh of thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away."<br>That is a very good principle. Your Chairman has reminded you that we are<br>not here to talk politics, but I cannot help observing that the last general<br>election was fought on the question of how desirable it was to turn away<br>from him that would borrow of thee, so that one must assume that the<br>Liberals and Conservatives of this country are composed of people who do not<br>agree with the teaching of Christ, because they certainly did very<br>emphatically turn away on that occasion.<br><br>Then there is one other maxim of Christ which I think has a great deal in<br>it, but I do not find that it is very popular among some of our Christian<br>friends. He says, "If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that which thou<br>hast, and give to the poor." That is a very excellent maxim, but, as I say,<br>it is not much practised. All these, I think, are good maxims, although they<br>are a little difficult to live up to. I do not profess to live up to them<br>myself; but then, after all, it is not quite the same thing as for a<br>Christian.<br><br>Defects in Christ's Teaching<br><br>Having granted the excellence of these maxims, I come to certain points in<br>which I do not believe that one can grant either the superlative wisdom or<br>the superlative goodness of Christ as depicted in the Gospels; and here I<br>may say that one is not concerned with the historical question. Historically<br>it is quite doubtful whether Christ ever existed at all, and if He did we do<br>not know anything about him, so that I am not concerned with the historical<br>question, which is a very difficult one. I am concerned with Christ as He<br>appears in the Gospels, taking the Gospel narrative as it stands, and there<br>one does find some things that do not seem to be very wise. For one thing,<br>he certainly thought that His second coming would occur in clouds of glory<br>before the death of all the people who were living at that time. There are a<br>great many texts that prove that. He says, for instance, "Ye shall not have<br>gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of Man be come." Then he says,<br>"There are some standing here which shall not taste death till the Son of<br>Man comes into His kingdom"; and there are a lot of places where it is quite<br>clear that He believed that His second coming would happen during the<br>lifetime of many then living. That was the belief of His earlier followers,<br>and it was the basis of a good deal of His moral teaching. When He said,<br>"Take no thought for the morrow," and things of that sort, it was very<br>largely because He thought that the second coming was going to be very soon,<br>and that all ordinary mundane affairs did not count. I have, as a matter of<br>fact, known some Christians who did believe that the second coming was<br>imminent. I knew a parson who frightened his congregation terribly by<br>telling them that the second coming was very imminent indeed, but they were<br>much consoled when they found that he was planting trees in his garden. The<br>early Christians did really believe it, and they did abstain from such<br>things as planting trees in their gardens, because they did accept from<br>Christ the belief that the second coming was imminent. In that respect,<br>clearly He was not so wise as some other people have been, and He was<br>certainly not superlatively wise.<br><br>The Moral Problem<br><br>Then you come to moral questions. There is one very serious defect to my<br>mind in Christ's moral character, and that is that He believed in hell. I do<br>not myself feel that any person who is really profoundly humane can believe<br>in everlasting punishment. Christ certainly as depicted in the Gospels did<br>believe in everlasting punishment, and one does find repeatedly a vindictive<br>fury against those people who would not listen to His preaching -- an<br>attitude which is not uncommon with preachers, but which does somewhat<br>detract from superlative excellence. You do not, for instance find that<br>attitude in Socrates. You find him quite bland and urbane toward the people<br>who would not listen to him; and it is, to my mind, far more worthy of a<br>sage to take that line than to take the line of indignation. You probably<br>all remember the sorts of things that Socrates was saying when he was dying,<br>and the sort of things that he generally did say to people who did not agree<br>with him.<br><br>You will find that in the Gospels Christ said, "Ye serpents, ye generation<br>of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of Hell." That was said to people<br>who did not like His preaching. It is not really to my mind quite the best<br>tone, and there are a great many of these things about Hell. There is, of<br>course, the familiar text about the sin against the Holy Ghost: "Whosoever<br>speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this<br>World nor in the world to come." That text has caused an unspeakable amount<br>of misery in the world, for all sorts of people have imagined that they have<br>committed the sin against the Holy Ghost, and thought that it would not be<br>forgiven them either in this world or in the world to come. I really do not<br>think that a person with a proper degree of kindliness in his nature would<br>have put fears and terrors of that sort into the world.<br><br>Then Christ says, "The Son of Man shall send forth his His angels, and they<br>shall gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and them which do<br>iniquity, and shall cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall be wailing<br>and gnashing of teeth"; and He goes on about the wailing and gnashing of<br>teeth. It comes in one verse after another, and it is quite manifest to the<br>reader that there is a certain pleasure in contemplating wailing and<br>gnashing of teeth, or else it would not occur so often. Then you all, of<br>course, remember about the sheep and the goats; how at the second coming He<br>is going to divide the sheep from the goats, and He is going to say to the<br>goats, "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire." He continues,<br>"And these shall go away into everlasting fire." Then He says again, "If thy<br>hand offend thee, cut it off; it is better for thee to enter into life<br>maimed, than having two hands to go into Hell, into the fire that never<br>shall be quenched; where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched."<br>He repeats that again and again also. I must say that I think all this<br>doctrine, that hell-fire is a punishment for sin, is a doctrine of cruelty.<br>It is a doctrine that put cruelty into the world and gave the world<br>generations of cruel torture; and the Christ of the Gospels, if you could<br>take Him as His chroniclers represent Him, would certainly have to be<br>considered partly responsible for that.<br><br>There are other things of less importance. There is the instance of the<br>Gadarene swine, where it certainly was not very kind to the pigs to put the<br>devils into them and make them rush down the hill into the sea. You must<br>remember that He was omnipotent, and He could have made the devils simply go<br>away; but He chose to send them into the pigs. Then there is the curious<br>story of the fig tree, which always rather puzzled me. You remember what<br>happened about the fig tree. "He was hungry; and seeing a fig tree afar off<br>having leaves, He came if haply He might find anything thereon; and when He<br>came to it He found nothing but leaves, for the time of figs was not yet.<br>And Jesus answered and said unto it: 'No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for<br>ever' . . . and Peter . . . saith unto Him: 'Master, behold the fig tree<br>which thou cursedst is withered away.'" This is a very curious story,<br>because it was not the right time of year for figs, and you really could not<br>blame the tree. I cannot myself feel that either in the matter of wisdom or<br>in the matter of virtue Christ stands quite as high as some other people<br>known to history. I think I should put Buddha and Socrates above Him in<br>those respects.<br><br>The Emotional Factor<br><br>As I said before, I do not think that the real reason why people accept<br>religion has anything to do with argumentation. They accept religion on<br>emotional grounds. One is often told that it is a very wrong thing to attack<br>religion, because religion makes men virtuous. So I am told; I have not<br>noticed it. You know, of course, the parody of that argument in Samuel<br>Butler's book, Erewhon Revisited. You will remember that in Erewhon there is<br>a certain Higgs who arrives in a remote country, and after spending some<br>time there he escapes from that country in a balloon. Twenty years later he<br>comes back to that country and finds a new religion in which he is worshiped<br>under the name of the "Sun Child," and it is said that he ascended into<br>heaven. He finds that the Feast of the Ascension is about to be celebrated,<br>and he hears Professors Hanky and Panky say to each other that they never<br>set eyes on the man Higgs, and they hope they never will; but they are the<br>high priests of the religion of the Sun Child. He is very indignant, and he<br>comes up to them, and he says, "I am going to expose all this humbug and<br>tell the people of Erewhon that it was only I, the man Higgs, and I went up<br>in a balloon." He was told, "You must not do that, because all the morals of<br>this country are bound round this myth, and if they once know that you did<br>not ascend into Heaven they will all become wicked"; and so he is persuaded<br>of that and he goes quietly away.<br><br>That is the idea -- that we should all be wicked if we did not hold to the<br>Christian religion. It seems to me that the people who have held to it have<br>been for the most part extremely wicked. You find this curious fact, that<br>the more intense has been the religion of any period and the more profound<br>has been the dogmatic belief, the greater has been the cruelty and the worse<br>has been the state of affairs. In the so-called ages of faith, when men<br>really did believe the Christian religion in all its completeness, there was<br>the Inquisition, with all its tortures; there were millions of unfortunate<br>women burned as witches; and there was every kind of cruelty practiced upon<br>all sorts of people in the name of religion.<br><br>You find as you look around the world that every single bit of progress in<br>humane feeling, every improvement in the criminal law, every step toward the<br>diminution of war, every step toward better treatment of the colored races,<br>or every mitigation of slavery, every moral progress that there has been in<br>the world, has been consistently opposed by the organized churches of the<br>world. I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion, as organized in<br>its churches, has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in<br>the world.<br><br>How the Churches Have Retarded Progress<br><br>You may think that I am going too far when I say that that is still so. I do<br>not think that I am. Take one fact. You will bear with me if I mention it.<br>It is not a pleasant fact, but the churches compel one to mention facts that<br>are not pleasant. Supposing that in this world that we live in today an<br>inexperienced girl is married to a syphilitic man; in that case the Catholic<br>Church says, "This is an indissoluble sacrament. You must endure celibacy or<br>stay together. And if you stay together, you must not use birth control to<br>prevent the birth of syphilitic children." Nobody whose natural sympathies<br>have not been warped by dogma, or whose moral nature was not absolutely dead<br>to all sense of suffering, could maintain that it is right and proper that<br>that state of things should continue.<br><br>That is only an example. There are a great many ways in which, at the<br>present moment, the church, by its insistence upon what it chooses to call<br>morality, inflicts upon all sorts of people undeserved and unnecessary<br>suffering. And of course, as we know, it is in its major part an opponent<br>still of progress and improvement in all the ways that diminish suffering in<br>the world, because it has chosen to label as morality a certain narrow set<br>of rules of conduct which have nothing to do with human happiness; and when<br>you say that this or that ought to be done because it would make for human<br>happiness, they think that has nothing to do with the matter at all. "What<br>has human happiness to do with morals? The object of morals is not to make<br>people happy."<br><br>Fear, the Foundation of Religion<br><br>Religion is based, I think, primarily and mainly upon fear. It is partly the<br>terror of the unknown and partly, as I have said, the wish to feel that you<br>have a kind of elder brother who will stand by you in all your troubles and<br>disputes. Fear is the basis of the whole thing -- fear of the mysterious,<br>fear of defeat, fear of death. Fear is the parent of cruelty, and therefore<br>it is no wonder if cruelty and religion have gone hand in hand. It is<br>because fear is at the basis of those two things. In this world we can now<br>begin a little to understand things, and a little to master them by help of<br>science, which has forced its way step by step against the Christian<br>religion, against the churches, and against the opposition of all the old<br>precepts. Science can help us to get over this craven fear in which mankind<br>has lived for so many generations. Science can teach us, and I think our own<br>hearts can teach us, no longer to look around for imaginary supports, no<br>longer to invent allies in the sky, but rather to look to our own efforts<br>here below to make this world a better place to live in, instead of the sort<br>of place that the churches in all these centuries have made it.<br><br>What We Must Do<br><br>We want to stand upon our own feet and look fair and square at the world --<br>its good facts, its bad facts, its beauties, and its ugliness; see the world<br>as it is and be not afraid of it. Conquer the world by intelligence and not<br>merely by being slavishly subdued by the terror that comes from it. The<br>whole conception of God is a conception derived from the ancient Oriental<br>despotisms. It is a conception quite unworthy of free men. When you hear<br>people in church debasing themselves and saying that they are miserable<br>sinners, and all the rest of it, it seems contemptible and not worthy of<br>self-respecting human beings. We ought to stand up and look the world<br>frankly in the face. We ought to make the best we can of the world, and if<br>it is not so good as we wish, after all it will still be better than what<br>these others have made of it in all these ages. A good world needs<br>knowledge, kindliness, and courage; it does not need a regretful hankering<br>after the past or a fettering of the free intelligence by the words uttered<br>long ago by ignorant men. It needs a fearless outlook and a free<br>intelligence. It needs hope for the future, not looking back all the time<br>toward a past that is dead, which we trust will be far surpassed by the<br>future that our intelligence can create.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Electronic colophon: This electronic edition of "Why I Am Not a Christian"<br>was first made available by Bruce MacLeod on his "Watchful Eye Russell<br>Page."

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, I read that book. Bertrand Russell has gotta be one of the biggest non-religious philosopher of all time. He has morals, but he wants to display them in such a way that they aren't influenced from any divine entity -- check out the section on What I Believe in the book. He feels that the realm of religion, not only that of Christianity has contributed little to mankind..

There are a<br>great many texts that prove that. He says, for instance, "Ye shall not have<br>gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of Man be come." Then he says,<br>"There are some standing here which shall not taste death till the Son of<br>Man comes into His kingdom"; and there are a lot of places where it is quite<br>clear that He believed that His second coming would happen during the<br>lifetime of many then living. That was the belief of His earlier followers,<br>and it was the basis of a good deal of His moral teaching. When He said,<br>"Take no thought for the morrow," and things of that sort, it was very<br>largely because He thought that the second coming was going to be very soon,<br>and that all ordinary mundane affairs did not count.<br><br>For this argument, it is YOU and other human being's INTERPRETATION! When Jesus says Ye, Christians will know that it means mankind and not that group of pple listening to Him at that moment... and further verses tell us that God delays Christ's second coming for more pple to be saved... how compassionate...<br><br></div>
