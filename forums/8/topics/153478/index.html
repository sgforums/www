            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>you are welcome to post comments here about Creative and Ipod's MP3 players.<br><br>Actually Creative is the first to come out with MP3 players.. but how come they lost to Apple in this war even though their product features are better than Ipod (From what I know, Ipod doesnt have radio and it is really expensive to own 1) .. Is it because Creative's advertising is not good enough?<br><br>So who will win the branding war in the end?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to my lecturer, here is his analysis<br><br>Creative<br><br>Better Feature, Lower Price. Rightfully should appeal to most people casue value for money. Logically, this should be the product everyone want. However, please see below<br><br>Ipod<br><br>Higher Priced, feature lost out to creative, BUT, the image it protray or at least the percieved image of having a ipod is that of cool, Most if not all, music listener uses emotion to appreicate music.<br><br>Logic vs emotion,<br><br>Logic tell us that what is a good product, emotion drive us to actually make the pruchase.<br><br>The winner is clear enough in this case.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>seriously though, say what you want about show off for ipod and value for money for creative. form factor aside, ease of use would definitely rank in quite high on consumers' lists. personally, i think creative is crap in this aspect. one friend of mine had one of those creative 5gb thingies, and another had the ipod mini. both brought them to camp(we were stay in), and within a week, the whole bunk could master the ipod. can't say the same for the creative though. everyone gave up using that within the first 10 minutes. it is that frustrating.<br><br>apple stuff aren't exactly all that easy to use,but they're easy to learn. once you've learned and mastered it, you'd be amazed at how much it can do. it becomes almost intiuitve after awhile. creative on the other hand...lose out in this area.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Apple built it's market on it's foolproof products. It's so simple that even if you are THAT stupid... you will use it with great ease. It doesn't scare you or anything... it's that easy.<br><br>Creative on the other hand... tries too hard... and fails... it keeps throwing in features but never really hear what it's consumers wants...<br><br>Would you want a mp3 full of crapload functions that could do some serious confusion or one that is simple easy and good?<br><br>Besides, I personally feel the click-wheel is better than creative's touchscreen</div>
