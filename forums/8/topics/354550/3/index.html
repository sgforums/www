I told her that she had my IC then she say if she need to check for every customer then she will be very busy. I didn't want to spoil the day with my fren so I just laughed it off and asked her to return us the overcharged politely. She slam her slam there, bang this bang that, then give back our money. Sianz....this is customer service??</p>
