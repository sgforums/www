Is it can marry also not enough?<br><br>Your postings on this subject is a veiled jibe at catholics. So can I say because the high numbers of incestuous crimes are committed by Bumis, so better to cut off the bumis's xxx like what you'd suggested that catholic priests do, to prevent further crimes?  Have you gone for castration?    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Duh<br><br>ps: I am not a Catholic.<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by blurblop (edited 24 May 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by blurblop (edited 24 May 2002).]</div>
