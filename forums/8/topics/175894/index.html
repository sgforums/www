Those foreigner ask for lower cuz they intend to endure maybe 5 years save up a lump sum go back their country convert they are rich ppl. For local like us we still need to survive in spore and cope with the living cost. So in a way, we are being ousted from our job cuz we ask for higher pay.<br><br>One way to beat the foreigner is to be able to do job that they cannot or hard to do.

I think there are getting more and morefree loaders here in Singapore, including this forum.  What you are suggesting here is simply trying to make singaporeans (especially the younger generation) more lazy and be more stuck up because they are singaporean. Why should government reserve the job for them when they themselve are not hungry for the job.<br><br></div>
