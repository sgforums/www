            <div class='col-md body'>yeah... multiple orgasms can happen and yes... the converse can happen too... so bear with me a bit while i try to list a few factors...:-<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Its the guy's fault</strong></span><br>Haha sorry to burst any men's egos out there... but seriously some of the reasons could be due to the guy itself. For one... the guy orgases too early, even before the girl has a chance to build up anything good... or hmm.... for two.... the guy simply has no skill.... haha<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Different positions has got different effects</span></strong><br>Different girls will have different preferences... and some positions just feels better and more easily orgasmic than others... i know my own preferences but hehe.. i aint telling...<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">How much do you love/like the other partner</span></strong><br>Hmmm this factor may not necessarily apply to all but i thought i should list it down anyways cos from my personal experience... the more in love or interested i am in the other party... his every touch and every move is enough to send lightning jolts down my spine.. One tend to be more sensitive when the other is more important to you as compared to others... I guess one example i can think of now is like a prostitute.. who does it all the time... its purely work for the money.. so i dont think she really wants an orgasm but more like getting it over and done with... This is just an opinion cos err.. i dunno any hookers... but am only using it as an example.<br><br>Tat's all i can think of now... Might pop in laterz if i can list more reasons.... Cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Right, these are my opinions only.<br>I can share wif u the experiences I have enjoyed tremendously.<br>If you wan your lady fren to have multiple org. your partner has to be really "horny"....honestly.<br>BOTH of u must be in the mood... this is the most impt thing.<br>Once u have the above, there is nothing that can stop you all from a night of pure pleasure... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Also, this is my opinion again, the lady will have multiple org. if you are receptive to her needs, some where or another if she wants to have more of it, she will give out the instructions....this is common, i am sure you've experienced this before.<br>From there, aha, you proceed.... cautiously....gd luck!</div>
