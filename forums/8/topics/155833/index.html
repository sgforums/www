            <div class='col-md body'>well, just to share my 'experience'. My step-brother is 13 this year. Just last month, my sis found out that $1500 is missing from her locked drawer. After interrogation, he admitted that he's the one who took it. Of the $1500, only $200 was left. The rest...spend on 2 hps, mp3 and food. The money was actually to be used for renovation, and it was a loan from my mum's boss. After probing, he admitted that it was not the first time he did it. He actually used to take some money bit by bit from the house. A few days after the $1500 incident, he took a handful of coins from my elder sis room again.<br><br>My sis took my brother to the police station and asked the policemen to "warned" him that if he ever do that again, the next solution will be to send him to the boys' home.<br><br>So far, no more stealing incidents....either because my family members more careful with their money, or the policemen really freaked him out.<br><br>So, better to deal with it now.......or it's too late.</div>
