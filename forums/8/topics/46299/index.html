Now the client thinking<br>to sue his company (the health care admin).<br><br>My friend now very confuse.. he feels very bad to his manager and bosses<br>he is thinking to bear the damage by his own money..<br>I oso confuse..what advice should i give to him? what's is<br>your opinion guys?girls? do u think my friend should bear the damage?<br>or is there any other solutions?<br><br>any comments, suggestions would be very appreciated<br><br>thanks</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ask your friend not to worry too much. Ask him to let his manager handle all these and keep all the emails related to this incident should there be a legal case later on. As what you've said,they are thinking of suing your friend's comapny which I think they will not. A legal suit will definitely cost more than 2k and your friend had already taken the initiative to apologise to em n asking their HR to deduct the payment. I think the other party is jus threatening your friend's company....tell him not to give in to their advances...!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No.  He should not.<br><br>It was an honest mistake... and his actions are very commendable and he was honest.  He would feel bad... and your support for him is very necessary now.  Support him in whatever he decides to do, but I feel he shouldn't try to pay the amount.  If everyone did, there'd be bankrupts everywhere... and his family would suffer too.<br><br>Just say this:  If the blasted Ministers can turn to the people and say that they made an "honest mistake" in the Singtel-IDA debacle, and they are not personally accountable for the millions lost, he should not be accountable for something he did in error.  Instead, he should learn from his mistakes and be more careful, making checklists so that he does not overlook anything anymore.<br><br>Let this be a learning experience.<br><br>At least that's my take on this situation... good luck!</div>
