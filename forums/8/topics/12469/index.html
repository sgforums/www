            <div class='col-md body'>i personally find that this is quite true among teenagers. If all your friends have a gf, and yet you don't have one, naturally you will feel that is it becos you are not as attractive. Also, when you see that your friends have someone there for them whenever they are feeling down and you can only cry all by yourself at nite, you will have the urge to find someone to be there for you.<br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take. If you<br>think  something will make you happy, go for it. Remember that we pass this way only  once.<br>Bottomline :<br>Time don't wait. If you think you might have found the  right one, treasure him/her. Don't let he/she go away. Don't let fear hold you  back.<br>Give it a try else you might regret later... No one other than  yourself<br>knows what can truly make you  happy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Generally, very few couples in JC survive beyond their graduation years. This is a general consensus. Most (if not al) guys chases gals becoz of their looks.<br><br>Their "love" is never serious becoz their effort to committment is seldom an accurate reflection to how much they really mean to each other. Call it puppy love if u will.<br><br>During this time, ppl can change partners as many as 12 times without remorse. To my knowledge, i'm only aware of a few who are still together, one of which started since sec sch!<br><br>Take every relationship seen and experienced with considerable thought. It's never a good thing to rush into one for the sake of it, or like weiwei says: peer pressure...remember, a relationship can only kick off if both parties agree to it.<br><br>And always spare a thought for the reasons behind it: do u want it to work or just to have fun?</div>
