As far as I can see Singapore in recession means eating in Mcdonalds instead of some posh restuarant, congradulations.

He has actually done a lot for Malaysia and although corruption is still widespread, it is much less than b4 he came to power. He deserves credit for that..<br><br>Whether he does more for malays is not the issue. Strictly speaking, that is MALAYSIA...ethnic malays and malay-speaking chinese form the dominant population. It is only natural that such a country adopt rules tat favour malays. The chinese are still doing well so wat's there to crow abt? Would u rather the whole Malaysia be run by Parti Islam rather than UMNO?<br><br>One thing he does provide is stability in Malaysia with regards to S'pore. One can only wonder wat will happen when he steps down...the main issue should be his current successor or who it's gonna be...anwar is in jail and zainuddin stepped down...not exactly a carnival atmosphere u know...<br><br>ppl will always see things from a perspective. But it's always fair to understand the politics of the matter b4 passing verdict, especially on an influential person like Dr M.<br><br>Please note that i'm not defending him or suporting him.
