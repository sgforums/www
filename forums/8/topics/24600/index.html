            <div class='col-md body'>Fireice<br><br>Wondering why you did not get back to me on the few questions I posted earlier on? Perhaps you do not know the answer since you don't really live on Pulau Ubin as you claimed? Or perhaps it is my mistake that I did not address the questions clearly. If it is the latter case, my apologies to that. So to make thing clearer, I would rephrase my questions.<br><br>What is the approximate length of time for you to leave your house (presumedly that it is located somewhere on Pulau Ubin) and get to NUS?<br><br>Next, with a busy night life, how will you get back to Pulau Ubin in the early hours of the morning when the last boat to that island leaves around 10 pm and does not resume until about 6 am?<br><br>Appreciate it if you can answer the questions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, that's a start. My reasons are not as "very" simple as yours.<br><br>1. I am a busybody, and I am really interested to know the length of time to get to the uni from an island. And since the govt might be developing outer island for housing in the future, it might not be a bad idea to get a house there, away from the hustle and bustle of the city and with a beach around the corner to throw in.<br><br>2. Just think that you are one hell of a liar and I am trying to determine if my deduction was correct.<br><br>So, before I go. Thanks for proving point number 2. And you can laugh all you want.
