            <div class='col-md body'>THE gun was centimetres from his head. The next few seconds would bring one of two things - life or death.<br><br>In those horrifying moments, time seemed to stretch.<br><br>'I thought of my family, especially my elderly parents. I regretted not saying goodbye to them before leaving for Jordan,' said Mr Tan.<br><br>He pleaded with the men not to harm him.<br><br>Mr Tan did not want us to use his real name as he still fears for his safety.<br><br>Staring at the barrel of a gun was not the only ordeal he suffered during his six days in captivity in the Middle-Eastern country.<br><br>Mr Tan, 26, was twice beaten mercilessly and given only one meal a day throughout.<br><br>It has been eight months since he and the CEO of the company he was working for were kidnapped.<br><br>Mr Tan, who resigned from the company after the incident, said he did not know what had happened to the CEO, an Indian national based in Singapore.<br><br>He would not give us any details, not even the name of the company, but said the CEO had transferred some money, apparently as demanded by the kidnappers.<br><br>He and the CEO were in Jordan to seal a petroleum deal that was said to be worth $11 million.<br><br>On 17 Oct last year, they were told to meet some Jordanian men at a farm on the outskirts of the capital, Amman, for dinner.<br><br>A driver and an escort met them at 9.30pm and drove them to a deserted house near the Syrian border.<br><br>The first hint of trouble came when Mr Tan said they saw 'eight or nine face-covered guards standing outside the house with guns'.<br><br>When they were led into the house, they saw two more masked gunmen.<br><br>Mr Tan said: 'I sensed something was wrong when we were directed into a bedroom with ropes and chains placed nicely on the bed. When I turned to one of the masked men, I was hit on the head and pulled to another room.'<br><br>And when a gun was pointed to his head, he thought he would be shot.<br><br>He said: 'I was afraid and disappointed that I would not make it to Singapore.'<br><br>His captor later forced him to strip and empty his pockets.<br><br>His mobile phone was confiscated and the SIM card and battery removed fromit.<br><br>His captors recorded the incident on a video camera.<br><br><strong>BEGGING &amp; SHOUTING</strong><br><br>Mr Tan said: 'The kidnappers asked me if I'm his (employer's) partner. I said no and told them I was new in the company. They checked with my boss and found that I was telling the truth.'<br><br>Mr Tan said he had been working for the Singapore-based oil company for 10months And fortunately, it was his 'inexperience' in the company which saved him from more physical torture by his captors.<br><br>His boss, who was held in the next room, was not so lucky.<br><br>'All I heard was shouting and begging from the next room,' Mr Tan said. 'I heard the kidnappers saying something like they wanted their money back.'<br><br>He added that he was not sure why they were held captive, though he suspected it might have had something to do with the deal that they were negotiating.<br><br>All this was a far cry from the wonderful reception Mr Tan and his boss had received when they arrived in Jordan on 13 Oct last year.<br><br>During their two-day trip, they dined at good restaurants and were shown tourist attractions in Amman.<br><br>The meeting was good and everything seemed 'on track' for their deal, which concerned an oil project in Nigeria.<br><br>They returned to Singapore, only to be told that they had to go to Jordan again the next day because the deal was ready for them to sign.<br><br>And it is on this trip that they were bundled off to the farm where they were held for three days.<br><br>Mr Tan said he was kept locked in a room. Once, he was hit with a stick because a guard thought he had gone to the toilet without permission.<br><br>He said: 'Only dinner and water was served every day. For three days, I could hear begging, shouting and torturing noises coming from the next room.<br><br>'I kept hoping, when they told me that I was going back that night. But of course, they lied.'<br><br>On 20 Oct, they were driven out of the farmhouse and taken to an office in Amman, where Mr Tan understood his boss transferred an undisclosed amount of money via the Internet.<br><br>They were told they would be released soon after, but that's not what happened.<br><br>Instead, they were then taken to a hotel suite, which was guarded by two armed men.<br><br>There, Mr Tan's boss saw an opportunity to escape because the guards were 'lenient and were watching television' in the living room.<br><br>Mr Tan said: 'My boss told me they will not release us even if they get the money. They will either kill us or frame us with drugs.'<br><br>His boss felt that as Mr Tan had done National Service, he could try to overpower the guards and take their guns.<br><br><strong>DASHED OUT </strong><br><br>He did not try that, but when the guards were elsewhere in the suite, they dashed out.<br><br>At the reception downstairs, Mr Tan said his boss created a scene, telling the staff to call the police as they had been kidnapped.<br><br>Unfortunately, the men's captors realised what had happened and angrily took them back to the room. They also forced them to call the reception and say that it was all a misunderstanding.<br><br>The next day, while their captors were busy preparing dinner, Mr Tan said his boss managed to make a secret phone call to his wife, who was then in Singapore.<br><br>She was told to inform the authorities here.<br><br>Soon after that, Mr Tan was separated from his employer, and taken away.<br><br>He said he had never seen his boss since then.<br><br>Mr Tan was then taken to another hotel in Amman, where he stayed two more nights.<br><br>The captors showed him an air ticket and passport, and said he was scheduled to leave at 1.50am on 23Oct.<br><br>But the flight was to London, not Singapore.<br><br>He said the men handed him his passport, air ticket and US$500 ($760) just before he left.<br><br>Once he was in London, Mr Tan said he contacted his CEO's wife and the authorities here.<br><br>They told him to return to Singapore immediately on a flight through Dubai.<br><br>But Mr Tan didn't do this.<br><br>'At the airport, I decided to buy a Singapore Airlines ticket direct to Singapore, which I felt was safer,' he said.<br><br>It was a bitter experience, said Mr Tan.<br><br>His advice to other Singaporeans: Do your homework before deciding to do business overseas.<br><br>In a phone interview, he said: 'I wanted to forget the whole experience. I was so traumatised that I immediately resigned from the company when I returned to Singapore.<br><br>'When doing business deals with foreigners, Singaporeans must first do a background check.<br><br>'I think all this happened because we were too trusting.'<br><br>Mr Tan has since lodged a report with the Singapore police.<br><br>A Singapore police spokesman confirmed that Mr Tan had made a report and said they had looked into the matter.<br><br>'After careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, and in consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers, police are taking no action,' the spokesman said.<br><br><a href="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4136,133931,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4136,133931,00.html?</a><br>_________________________________________________<br><br>Seems like a scene in action movies. Come to think of it, what happen to the  boss afterwards?<br></div>
