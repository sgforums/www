              <p class="MsoNormal">I recently talked about <a href="/forums/8/topics/317033">YouPorn being the #21
                  most popular site in Singapore</a>, which resulted 5 days later in the <a href="/forums/8/topics/317033?page=3">MDA swiftly
                  blocking access to several pornography sites referenced in Alexa’s list of top
                  100 most popular sites in Singapore</a>. I think the government might be facing
                  an identity crisis over how to handle pornography – which brings me to the
                  question – is legalising porn the next logical step for Singapore?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">To the government, there is very little reason <em>not</em> to legalise porn. Prostitution is
                  already legal in Singapore,
                  and we are building several massive casinos, both of which are, in my opinion,
                  far worse vices than pornography. We also train our children as young as 16 to
                  kill people (in defence of our country). Pornography is already legal in many
                  developed 1<sup>st</sup> world countries like the US,
                  UK, Australia, Japan
                  - with its traditional and conservative society - and even deeply religious
                  countries like Israel!
                  There is very little we can do to enforce or control pornography on the
                  internet. Legalising pornography would be in line with the government’s policy
                  of encouraging breeding amongst our population. We can become the “porn hub” of
                  S.E.A, and of course, “Singaporn” would be a great brand name!</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">On the other hand, there are many downsides. Pornography might
                  erode our society’s moral values, corrupt our young, encourage deviant and
                  unacceptable sexual behaviour, increase sex crimes, lead to more unwanted
                  pregnancies, single parents, broken families, STDs, unsafe sex, premarital sex,
                  and so on. However, sometimes it is just easier to push the blame onto
                  something else other than poor parenting and supervision, and lack of
                  education.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Would you support or oppose the legalisation of porn in Singapore? If the government were
                  to propose to legalise porn, how would you respond?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>An interesting question would be whether pornography actually increases vices such as prostitution, unsafe sex, unfaithful husbands (or wives) as assumed, or whether it actually decreases them. Let's face it, even with pornography being illegal, our youth are faced with sex and sexual images. Fashion magazines, TV shows, even from the army itself (I'm sure all of us who have been through NS knew a buddy or sergeant who used to love telling stories about his Geylang adventures. I even had a CSM who encouraged us to go to celebrate promotions and "become a man" that way). So I don't think you can blame pornography for that. Instead, maybe it helps? I mean, it's a big taboo and all here, but young men masturbate (not in camp ok!!). Isn't encouraging that as a way of sexual release better than them going off to Geylang, or having affairs, or having unsafe sex?</p></div>

              <p>Frankly, I kinda prefer the status quo: Block a few porn sites, and don't actively hunt down people who visit non-blocked sites.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I don't think there have been cases of people who have been prosecuted for downloading porn per se..... more commonly, their houses were searched for some other unrelated offences, and the possession of porn is then added to the charges should any porn be found in their posession. Don't take my word for it, though.</p>
              <p>Whatever the case, I feel that the first line of defence against porn should be left to parents. It's up to them to monitor, regulate, and educate their children on responsible internet behaviour.</p>

              <p><br>While I agree on your point of legalising porn, I have to disagree on these so-called 'downsides' of the legalisation.</p>
              <p>Yes, it may cause broken families. But, erodsion of moral values, corruption of youth, encouragement of deviant and unacceptable sexual behaviours. Who defines what is 'moral values', 'deviant and unacceptable' in the first place?</p>
              <p>So what if people in our society gets more sexually open-minded? Will it cause the downfall of our society? In what way will an increase in sexual activities within youths bring harm to other people as long as it's done between two consenting person (extra-marrital affairs excluded) and done with sufficient protective measures?</p>
              <p>Increase sex crime? What are the statistics? Increase unwanted pregnancy? Surely a person can't get pregnant by watching porn! They get pregnant mostly (I didn't say all) through lack of exercising their logical sense.</p>
              <p>So what's wrong with porn?</p>

              there is nothing wrong with porn, but there is always fear of excessively addicted to it. It is just like gambling. well, if they think porn is such an issue, why legalised gambling as well? isnt it double-standard? 
              
              I will rather, that its either all or non. you cant just ban 1 thing, and legalised another.
              
              however, in such modern and free society, i seriously doubt the govt should treat pp like kids, and block sites that are supposely "unharmful". Everybody should have their own opinion of whats right and wrong. Even said so, no matter how the govt tries to block, there will always be other sites coming up. 
              
              personally, i have nothing against or for porn. I just feel that having the right to surf the net freely is what i should deserved in this free virtual world.
              
              Educating/emphasing the kids on moral values is what the govt should do so as to guide them to differentiate rights and wrongs.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>           Jason, you argued that it is on the basis that prostitution is already legalised and that more vices like the casino are already emerging, pornography should be legalised. However it is in the light of such circumstances that we should even more prohibit the legalising pornography to prevent our society from degrading further. Yes, legalising pornography is the next logical step that entails the previous endorsment of vices in the subtle name of entainment, but the logical step to what?...the logical step to achieve an immoral society...history has shown such communities do not prevail for long...should we be a porn hub and be called the whore of south east Asia?</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>If the government were to legalise pornography, it would send a wrong message to the citizens. Legalising it would sort of make people think that it is perfectly okay to view pornography and maybe even encourage some to do it. I think that the government should not legalise it nor should they ban it. They should just let pornography be available online. I am sure there are better methods to prevent children from gaining access to it and becoming addicted to it. There's always sexuality education and parental control.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The problem is that you can't really say whether pornography is "immoral" - immoral by whose morals? Singapore is not going to be seen as "the whore of southeast asia" because the vast majority of first world countries have no problem with pornography, even religious countries like Spain. The United Nations is not going to mock Singapore for becoming a more open nation. On the contrary, being a country that criminalizes pornography lumps Singapore in a category with countries like Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and so on in terms of restrictions on freedom - is that really the kind of company we are proud to keep?? It is far, far more embarrassing in this modern world to have a government that says you can't watch pornography, than it is to be a nation that honestly believes that it is perfectly okay to view it.</p></div>
