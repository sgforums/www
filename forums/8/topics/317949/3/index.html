              <p>The problem is that you can't really say whether pornography is
              "immoral" - immoral by whose morals? Singapore is not going to be
              seen as "the whore of southeast asia" because the vast majority of
              first world countries have no problem with pornography, even
              religious countries like Spain. The United Nations is not going to
              mock Singapore for becoming a more open nation. On the contrary,
              being a country that criminalizes pornography lumps Singapore in a
              category with countries like Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and so on in
              terms of restrictions on freedom - is that really the kind of
              company we are proud to keep?? It is far, far more embarrassing in
              this modern world to have a government that says you can't watch
              pornography, than it is to be a nation that honestly believes that
              it is perfectly okay to view it.</p>

              <p>I think most people serf porn as a way of entertainment .</p>
              <p>So i think the goverment should not ban such sites .</p>
              <p>Cause if one day the goverment block all porn sites .</p>
              <p>Teens will be very bored and find other fun stuff to do .</p>
              <p>Then maybe they`ll go in to durgs , smoking , fighting and stuff like that .</p>

              <p>there is nothing wrong with porn, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">but there is always fear of excessively addicted to it. It is just like gambling.</span></strong> well, if they think porn is such an issue, why legalised gambling as well? isnt it double-standard?</p>
              <p>I will rather, that its either all or non. you cant just ban 1 thing, and legalised another.</p>
              <p>however, in such modern and free society, i seriously doubt the govt should treat pp like kids, and block sites that are supposely “unharmful”. Everybody should have their own opinion of whats right and wrong. Even said so, no matter how the govt tries to block, there will always be other sites coming up.</p>
              <p>personally, i have nothing against or for porn. I just feel that having the right to surf the net freely is what i should deserved in this free virtual world.</p>
              <p>Educating/emphasing the kids on moral values is what the govt should do so as to guide them to differentiate rights and wrongs.</p>

              <p>Aiyah, how many times can one fellow wank himself? 3 times, 5 times, 10 times? And within what time frame? Unless that guy is a super stud I don't think any ordinary guy will continue watching once they reach their 'zenith'. And I know majority of the men will lose interest in sex once they reach their goal. So addiction is not an issue here for the everyday joe. Of course if the guy is a sex fiend then that is a different case. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>This post should have been made at Speaker's Corner.....otherwise u are sabotaging your own forum......</p>
              <p>Anyway..</p>
              <p>For me I think this question will be like section 377A (or whatever the number, I forgot).</p>
              <p>It is just an useless academic debate/ theoritical debate, with little practical impact.</p>
              <p>I can already imagine the way it will be debated in parliament, in the media, etc.</p>
              <p>In the end it wont be legalized.</p>
              <p>As I said.....this issue is too much intellectual-ized, theoritical, ideological, u can see it from legal point of view, social, politics, etc, but so much theory in the end....actually has very little bearing in people's day-to-day lives. But people will be abit scared and uncomfortable if there is a move towards legalization and some groups will spring to oppose it....and in the end it wont happen.</p>
              <p>This is very similar with 377A, and since 377A issue has been debated rather recently, and since Singapore's society or value system hasn't changed much from the 377A debate time, the outcome will be the same.</p>
              <p>For me I sometimes wonder whether these kind of 'social/ ideological' issues are actually a big energy sucker. It is like an empty drum, u hit it will make a big noise and can be interesting, but actually meaningless and pointless.</p>

              <p>I don't support the legalisation of Porn in Singapore cos it will degrade the reputation of Singapore girls/women.</p>
              <p>And don't forget, those people who supported this legalisation still have mothers, girlfriends, aunties, daughters, and other love ones(mistress...hahaha). And their horniness and immorality will cost them dearly when foreigners start to call Singapore girls/women "sluts".</p>
              <p>What will Singaporean guys feel if something like this happened to Singaporean girls?</p>

              <p>                         Yes, i guess the issue of morality is relative, therefore defining pornography as immoral is from a subjective point of view. Nonetheless,we must take a stance and there must be an absolute measurement of morality we should adhere to but how is that possible in a secular society? The relevance of religion can be seen here, subliminally enforcing morality and defining the right social conduct for where does an atheist gets its morality from? And it is also from history that one can affirm its standards of morality to be viable or not, we examine communities in the past and we examine how pornography, in its widespread form of propagation which would promote promiscuity(highly plausible since there is demand to legalise it), would bring more benefits than problems.</p>
              <p>Well, i coined the term 'whore of south east Asia' is in response to the saying by Jason that being a porn hub or singaporn would be a good brand name, which made it different from other vast majority of countries which you mentioned since Singapore in this case blatantly and consciously promotes such a brand name while other countries in their case promotes the concept of liberalisation which is in line with religious principles of freedom of will(for the religious countries whcih you refer). If there would be derogatory remarks(or remarks of appraisal to some) about them being a porn haven, this would be the negative aspect of their liberal based laws and policies. Such negative aspects would be curbed by things like sexual education, underrated leaders of the society like pastors and religious leaders.</p>

              <p>I think blocking these FREE sites is a good idea because ANY one, even a kid CAN access it. I myself have accessed and honestly enjoyed these FREE sites but at the same time I get so turned off by A LOT of the undesirable actions that are portrayed and I did think about the kids that has accessed to this. I applaud the government in their actions but why now? not sooner? and it's also very close timing with the posting of the 'Youporn rankings' entry in sgforums.</p>
              <p>Not that I dislike pornography cos I watch it myself. I believe that it's better to restrict access to it because children who are very young has not yet reached a maturity level to understand what sex is and what are its consequences if not handled properly. Only those aged 18 &amp; above can view &amp; access. I envision a time where a citizen in Singapore has to go through online checks to prove that they are 18, and finally access to healthy pornography is legal.</p>
              <p>But..not all 18 yr olds are the same. It all comes down to education &amp; awareness while growing up!</p>
              <p>Yes, that's what I'd like to call it - Healthy Pornography.</p>
              <p>Cos I've seen some undesirable ones and it appears to be unhygienic, careless, violent and some of them deviant. But there's also good porn that I believe is very beneficial for humans sake!</p>
              <p>One thing that irritates me is that when some people see the word 'PORNOGRAPHY', they tend to think it's all about men having sex with women. And we have people saying that it is actually degrading women. Well, I do agree partly with that but that's a whole other subject.</p>
              <p>Is viewing nude photos/videos that involves NO SEX not considered pornography?</p>
              <p>People know PlayBoy but do they know there's also PlayGirl? There are also same sex porn in the whole mix.</p>
              <p>Personally, currently I do view pornography onlne that deals mainly with males and in no way are these people who participates do any sort of destructive actions that could harm them or anyone else (physically or emotionally). and voila! No women involved!</p>
              <p>Since we are all humans, I believe we are all NATURALLY attracted to beautiful faces &amp; bodies. To surpress the need to freely view &amp; appreciate this natural beauty is simply nonsensical. I'm talking strictly about the simple naked body..</p>
              <p>I myself have gone through some bad experiences because like many of us, we are told that this or that is 'dirty' and so we repressed parts of ourselves. I reached my teens and without going into a long story, I went on a search for pictures of nudity and for a long time looked out for those vcd pirates that sells porn vcds but there are none that can be easily found. It turned frantic at some point. Once I found the internet, I finally, and it's a BIG FINALLY, finally, I get to see a real naked body of a grown up, something which I've not been exposed to while growing up. Isn't there something wrong there?</p>
              <p>Here's what happened - Viewing the pictures brought out some sort of convulsions &amp; shivers from within me! It's a feeling of pleasure but intense. All this just by viewing the naked body that is not even doing any sexual act. I know this sounds crazy but I believe this energy is actually all the REPRESSED thoughts and feelings that are stored in some part of me throughout the years. Soon, this shivers dissipates and stop recurring. I believe the release of this 'repression' was very beneficial.</p>
              <p>Throughout the years, I continued to view porn when I can &amp; honestly I'll say that now at the age of 25, I've developed a good sense of what is good &amp; bad about sex and how to deal with it properly. I can look at it and even control myself appropriately.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure what an extremely sexually repressed person will be as time goes by but I know for sure that it is not healthy for the mind &amp; body.</p>
              <p>Education from young age is crucial. Knowledge of the the broad subject of sex will also do good. This is totally another topic to be discussed. For eg. too much sex is too much and...conserving of one's sexual energy has great benefits.</p>
              <p>Sometimes we read news about sexual abuse &amp; also about some priest doing something undesirable. These are signs that some part of them have not been explored &amp; expressed properly. It's unfortunate growing up repressed and furthermore in a repressed community.</p>
              <p>But I'll also say this - Sooner or later, mature ones will outgrow their need for sex (and porn). Be it because of old age or other matters like spirituality which I myself is considering.</p>
              <p>Legalise porn but only allow healthy pornography. Wow, that is a big challenge for the government here? Educate your children well too.</p>
