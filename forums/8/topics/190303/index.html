Sometimes, you end up as the liability towards the company you intend to work with instead because you might be expose to things you're not allowed to tell others outside.  Even the smallest companies have their trade secrets too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
