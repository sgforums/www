            <div class='col-md body'>I really need all the advice I can get.<br>Ok..there is this guy whom I have known from the net for a year or so. We seldom meet but even when we do we'll always end up going to some park to make out. The things is he never contact me or call me. But when we are in the irc, we'll always somehow talk a lot and he mostly like to talk abt sexual stuffs. He said he always feel horny when talking to me. He started being that way after our first meeting.<br>I actually like him a lot. When we meet and make out, the feeling was so intense and was so passionate that I tot it would be the beginning for both of us. We are both sexually intense....fulfilling our lust for each other.<br>But as soon as it is over, he acted as if we never even did it. It makes me feel cheap sometimes. Ok...to cut the story short....met up with him recently and as usual we made out and this time somehow our feelings for each other were more intense even though we didn't say it verbally.<br>Before we met I did ask him if he likes me coz he like making out with me or what. He said he likes me but I know his main interest is in the physical action. I dun deny that I like making out with him but I like him for other things too.<br>When we make out, I always like to think that he really likes me or even love me but issit just lust?? And he said that I'm the first and only girl he make out intensely with.<br>I'm just scared that one day he will find a girl he really like. He may have given me his body but gave his heart to someone else. I dun know if I should continue doing this with the hope that something good might come out of it or should I just stop?<br><br>------------------<br>~If it's wrong to love you, then I dun wanna be right~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To snowie:<br><br>Stop what you are doing with this guy.  From what I read, it appears that he is more interested in your body than you in person.<br><br>From what you decribed if accurate, he is obviously taking advantage of you.  Yes, it does make you look cheap when he treats as nothing happens after making out. So, stop him from taking advantage of you before you get too seriously hurt at the end.<br><br>There are guys out there who just want to screw girls for fun; they are not doing it b'cos they love the girl or for commitment.  So watch out!  In fact, bastards like this really pisses me off! I don't mean all guys are like that; there are lots of honest ones out there. But you are gonna get some bad eggs once in a while.<br><br>The decision is ultimately yours!  Only you who know him better than anyone else in this forum here!  So, judge with your own eyes and be wise!<br><br>Sorry for sounding harsh!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, honestly tt's a bad "relationship" to be in. if it's merely physical attraction on both sides, then what qianjun28 says is perfectly fine if you're ok w it. however, if you like him.... i wld advise you to get out of there. :/ tt's what happened in my last relationship and i tell you... it doesnt wk out. a guy who likes you tt much wldnt "cheapen" you like tt. it honestly shows how much, or rather little, respect he has for you. and after "giving" so much, you dont have much "bargaining power" in tt sense in the relationship. afterall, who has more to lose?<br><br>my advice? get out of this "relationship" before thgs get any worse. you'll just feel worse and worse... and can you imagine if he starts telling other pple abt this? trust me, this will definitely come up to no good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FROM A GUY WHO HAS BEEN IN ON THE GAME:<br><br>If you still have any self respect left for yourself, I suggest you pull out of this game immediately. In my younger days, about 2 years ago, I was in on this game also. Meeting girls I know from irc. I was younger and more curious then and it wasn't difficult to get intimate with them.<br><br>In my experience, it is usualyy the unattractive(ugly?!!) ones who are far more willing to do this but who cares right? You don't care if they are ugly, I just wanted the experience and if they are so cheap anyway, why should I bother?<br><br>I knew in my mind taht the future gf I was looking for would NEVER be anything like these people ( I do have a gf now, by the way, and I respect her for the person she is, intelligent,pure and sweet, nothing like those people I have met in irc).<br><br>Some of the girls have asked" do you love me?" and I say "I do". Why not? If by that simple sentence I could get what I want and they like it too? It doesn't change my view that they are cheap and easy.If they could do this with me, they could have done it with any other guy.I don't feel like I owe them anything.How can it ever amount to LOVE?<br><br>I look back on my past and regret very much. I have a wonderful gf now but she doesn't knwo about this and I am afraid that if she finds out, she will leave me because she is everything that is sweet and pure and she is the type that can get upset easily.<br><br>I feel I have to write about my experiences because I know too well what this is all about and I know that there are many many guys like me out there. Stop! Someday you will find someone you truly treasure and love and you will be as scared as I am to lose her.<br><br>As for girls, NEVER do this, we just think you are cheap and good for some fun when we need it and will never amount to gf material.Sorry, but that's the truth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i actually plans to give some "advice" but so many people given their advices. You don't need mine. It will be the summary of all theirs. Just one advice. F**king forget that guy. He is not worth it. Even if you want to enjoy making, find someone who will love you in return, not just your body. There are many more other worthy guys out there who should be given the chance to love and be loved. Give your love to one of these guys. Don't waste your love, time, money, feeling for this guy. I believe there are a few girls here. Talk to them more often, they will give you better advice. Good friends can be found on the net. I found a few. Blieve in platonic friendship. Why don't you give yourself a break. When the guy call you out, DON'T GO. Try to pick up some hobbies to forget this guy. If you need to find some lady to talk to, let me know. You can email some of my lady email friends. They will definitely be happy to help you. Email me to let me know if you want.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Snowie,<br><br>It's good that you know "his main interest is in the physical action". However, I'd say it is his ONLY interest. If you are going out with him for physical things also (and nothing else), then it doesn't do anyone any harm. But judging from your letter, it is not so. This 'relationship' is going to hurt you badly if you don't end it NOW. Make a clean break with him. Stop seing him altogether. Don't call. Don't answer his call. Don't talk to him on the Net. Forget about him. Find someone new. I know it is easier said than done. But one day you'll be glad you make this decision, trust me.<br><br>From someone who understands.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanx for all ur reply. It seems most or all of u think the same way. BTW RiffRaff u implying I am ugly issit?<br>Anyway me and that guy may have indulged in physical stuffs but never sex. I never allowed him to have sex on me even though he wants it. Somehow I dun think he likes me enough for me to have sex with him.<br>Maybe I am just stupid or naive thinking he will like me more than just physical attraction. Some may find me cheap doing these things but I only did it with him and no other guys. I'm not just some cheap girls who are willing to do anything with a lot of guys. But that's not me. I dun even do sex. To me sex is making love and in order for me to really enjoy it I must do it with someone I really love and who love me in return.<br>I already forsee that I may be the one hurting most in the future coz how can I be so sure he's not doing it to get sex from me.<br>Actually he's quite good looking and I'm not that bad either but that's besides the point. The point is I'm sure there are girls who will fall for him and I may be put aside.<br>How to tell if he's serious abt me meaning it's just not the physical attraction but by who I actually am<br><br>------------------<br>~If it's wrong to love you, then I dun wanna be right~<br><br>[This message has been edited by ^snowie^ (edited 14 November 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, I pity you for getting into this mess. I think quite a lot of girls had this experience before - I maybe wrong, but that's my observation.<br><br>One of the thing I notice is that a lot of them will act according to what your quote dictates "If it's wrong to love you, then I dun wanna be right"<br><br>I don't see the point of it. Maybe you really love the person very much, but do you want to get hurt loving him?<br><br>Just remember this. Love is simple. So problems arising it will be simple and requires simple solution. Don't try to think too complicated and wondering whether you should do it or not.<br><br>The choice is yours and I do hope you make a sensible choice. Just remember there's no right or wrong choice in this aspect. It all depends on you.<br><br>[This message has been edited by BlueMoon (edited 14 November 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Snowie,<br><br>First of all I don't think you're cheap. But if you do love him, I'm sure it is just one-sided. And I believe you'll be the ONLY one who's going to be hurt. I can assure you that he's meeting you for sex ONLY. As you said "he never contact me or call me. But when we are in the irc, we'll always somehow talk a lot and he mostly like to talk abt sexual stuffs." Isn't it clear to you? If he is serious about you he'll call you often, see you regularly, want to know more about you, etc. Pls don't get so carried away by your feelings, learn to control them with your brain. And be aware that this 'relationship' is doing you more harm than you know. It is not only hurting your feelings, it is DAMAGING your self-esteem. Stop worrying about losing him. Yes, "there are girls who will fall for him" but don't forget there are guys who will fall for YOU and most of those guys will treat you better than he does.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there Snowie,<br>I am sure you heard of this verse: Love is blind. But don't let it cloud your mind of what this guy is doing to you. A guy love you for what you are, someone to talk to and care for.....not as a sex object. You may feel that you are only showing love but to him, you are like home-delivery deserts. Although I know it is hard to forget about someone whom you may love, but for your own future, recognised for what this guy is doing and stop denying the fact. True he may have shown care and concern for you, sweet-talk to you......but this does not deny the fact that you are only a sex-object to him. I hope that after reading all these postings from strangers who really care about you, even though they never met you nor talk to you before, you get the idea!!! Leave the guy and forge a new path for yourself. There are many guys waiting for you out there..... the first place is actually "Yuan zai tien pian, jing zai yen qian"...namely here in this forum. I just ended a 4yr relationship cos my gf found someone new, but I got over it and I am sure you can too.....forget about him. If you ever need help....all you have to do is post in this forum.<br><br>------------------<br>Godfrey AKA Lightningbolt<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Snowie,<br><br>I do not know what do you actually mean by making it out; having sex or just heavy petting. However, I am sure that eventually, he only wants sex. Now you still can say you will not have sex with him. But due to the fact that you are afraid of losing him, you may finally give in.<br><br>I belive you have read enough from others. So I need not say more. Listen to us. Leave him. You are the one who will evetually to lose everthing. He may be a flirt in IRC and also have sex with many girls before. Is it worth risking any disease or pregnancy for a man who doesn't even love you?<br><br>You still have a future ahead. I always advise my female friends who are single, marry late rather than marry the wrong man.<br><br>[This message has been edited by mousehunt (edited 15 November 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wah Liao Eh!!!<br><br>Snowie, how young r u? Still haven't grow up yet??<br><br>U can tell by yrself tt the guy's only focus on yr body, can u feel love from him or not?<br><br>If u just want to enjoy the making out part with him only, then so be it. But if u're looking for love, see if he still treat u well when u stop letting him touch u, under the clothes.<br><br>I think u probably are still a young little gal who's dreaming for love, but please take care of yrself. U wouldn't want to think back a few years down the road and regret. U'll hate yrself, u know?<br><br>If u ask me, as a man, I honestly admit tt I won't be able to resist if a young and pretty gal wld want to make out with me, I would take u on if u try to offer. But the point is, I see it as just Fun for us, and it'll never cross my mind about marriage.<br><br>Stop right now!! It's never too late for it'll not be later than later.<br><br>Take care n the rest is up to you... ...<br><br>------------------<br>I may be Dirty, I may be Old, but I'm a GOOD MAN.</div>
