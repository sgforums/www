His being somewhat slow exemplifies that message, I reckon.  I remember watching the show Dowun Under and laughed my head off whenever ithe show prompted how he was the one who uncovered the Watergate Incident.  But when I watched it in Singapore, I ewnded up being the only one laughing in the cinema.  People were giving me the stares.  So in true possum fashion, I just looked at them and said, 'the Watergate Incident, guys.  Nixon?  Hullo?'<br><br>Oh...  Pulp Fiction...  So many classic quotes come from that show...  My personal faves include...<br><br>"Does Mr Marcelo look like a bitch to you? (After some further questioning and a gun shot would to the leg)  Then why are you fucking him like he was one?!'<br><br>"Man, everytime I touch a piece of brain, I turn into superfly TNT.  And why am I on brain duty?  You're the one who shot him!!'<br><br>"Pork is good, bacon's good...

But when I watched it in Singapore, I ewnded up being the only one laughing in the cinema.  People were giving me the stares.

Honestly, the key things to look for in PF was the biblical parallels that the show was conveying, the awesome script and the chemistry between Sam and John.  And I reckon the sequence in which the show was presented was also different to shows of the time ('92).  But then again, we're talking about a movie made by the same dude who made From Dusk to Dawn and Reservoir Dogs.<br><br>Like Kevin Smith's movies, you'll notice they're really dirt cheap to make.  Honestly!!  Acting was really minimal 'cause it's about conersations, so the script is heaps important.  Of course, there has to be at least some acting capability.<br><br>Bring it on!!</i></div>
