            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, those pen fairy games kids play, usually are harmless in a way, because the rituals are not right.<br><br>as a christian, either way its dangerous la, strongly not encouraged. after all, we don't believe in ghosts and spirits of the dead, so they must be demons.<br><br>i've talked to my friend, whose grandmother is those type well versed in those taoist rituals and stuff, she also said its very dangerous, and told us not to play aorund with it.. if you really perform the real deal, easy to invite them, difficult to ask them to leave.<br><br>you think these spirits perform free consultation services ah? so free nothing to do come and answer your question.. sure got strings attached.</div>

Just go play the game with 4 persons for 3-4 weeks, everyday for 2hrs min per session. You definitely cannot play this by yourself alone and 2 persons can cheat to make it like what you wanted to believe. 4 persons - no one can cheat to make a favourable outcome.<br><br>And dun try to contact known dead persons. You have the person's name in your head, you can surely imagine you are contacting the known dearly departed.<br><br>Once you have played the game for weeks, comeback here and tell us your encounters!!  Play the English Ouija version. Otherwise, STFU and stop making comments about this being fake. Just do it man, unless you have a tail between your legs, than what can I say!!<br><br>Btw, have you ever seen those chinese Deity Gods, up close and personal, that were placed on the red sedan chair, carried by 6-8 muscular type persons from one place to another??  Have you seen the chairs, at certain point of it's journey, swing widely from side to side and also becoming so heavy that more men have to go help to carry it?? Have you noticed the Deity God did not slide off the chair, even though it is not buckle down onto the seat?? Are you gonna say it is all a fake too??<br><br>People playing Ouija Board game can also invoke wandering spirit to partake in the game.</div>
