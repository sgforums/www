But if one is not reached after six months, the bank will assume that 'borrowers have lost interest in the property and...prefer the bank to exercise its rights under the mortgage to recover the loan outstanding'.<br><br>However, ABN Amro head of consumer banking sales Seah Boon Ching said: 'We...do not conduct ourselves like pawnshops and sell collaterals at the first sight of a default.'<br><br>He added: 'In fact, we avoid repossession and forced selling of a mortgage property as it is a no-win solution for both the owners and the bank.'<br><br>None of the other lenders would say how much time a defaulting borrower could expect before a loan is foreclosed. Most said they would adopt a case-by-case approach while emphasising a desire to treat cases sympathetically through payment restructuring.<br><br>Examples of payment re- structuring cited by POSB and HSBC included lengthening the overall payment period, reducing monthly payments for a limited period or finding a guarantor to assist in payments.</div>
