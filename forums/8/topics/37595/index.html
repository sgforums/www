            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>It was pretty early in the morning when I left the club. I looked at my watch. 3.00am. Still early for me to go home. I called my friend, Desmond. Â“Hey dude, where are you?Â” Â“Hey Nat, IÂ’m at home now with David and Angel, drinking and chatting. Come over to my place if you want?Â” Desmond asked. Since I didnÂ’t want to go home that early, I might as well popped over to DesmondÂ’s. I agreed and drove over to his Tanjong Rhu apartment.<br><br>As I was driving towards DesmondÂ’s place, a lot of events come rushing into my mind. Within the same month, I lost my boyfriend to a divorcee and I lost my job. Things werenÂ’t going well for me. I need to talk to someone or somebody. I knew that Desmond and gang are able to listen to my grumbling. In less then fifteen minutes, I reached his place.<br><br>Everything was like a slow motion film. It took ages for me to reach the doorstep. I pressed the bell once. There was no reply. I pressed it the second time and I heard someone fumbling at the door. Angel opened the door and I hugged her. She reeked of alcohol and I wondered how much the guys had been drinking.<br><br>I entered the house, took off my shoes and placed it at the shoe rack. I went to the clothes rack and hang my bag and jacket there. In fact I have been in and out of this house for a million times. Desmond is my intimate friend. I knew where everything was and one glance at the cellar, I knew they drank 3 bottles of red wine.<br><br>I walked over to DesmondÂ’s side, surprised to see him sober. David was lying on the couch. Angel walked unstably to the washroom, and I heard her puke. At that instant, I wished I were alone. How am I supposed to talk to Desmond, when David and Angel are drunk?<br><br>Â“IÂ’ll get David into the guest room,Â” Desmond said, reading my mind. Â“I know you want to talk to me.Â” Â“Thank you,Â” I said to him, with a faint smile. Â“IÂ’ll bring Angel to the guest room as well.Â”<br><br>Angel was asleep in the washroom. It took me quite a while to pull her up onto her feet and dragged her into the living room. Desmond came to help me and together we placed her on another bed next to David.<br><br>I went to the mini bar counter and fix myself a drink, while Desmond closed the door of the guest room. I seated myself on the couch and he came to my side.<br><br>Â“Now, shoot.Â” Desmond said. HeÂ’s always like this. When he knew I am having problems, he wants me to come straight to the point. Â“ I lost Steven to Mandy and I lost my job. Both things that are important to me, in the same week,Â” I broke down as I tell him the details. He never said a word but he gave me the attention that I need. He stroked my hair as my head rests on his chest.<br><br>Â“Since you lost your job, move back here. You wonÂ’t be able to afford the rent of your apartment now. So I suggest you move in like before, and we can sort things out.Â” He suggested. I never expect him to give me such an offer as I had betrayed him by being together with Steven. From the start, he knew Steven was right for me. I just didnÂ’t want to admit it.<br><br>I looked at him in the eye and was about to say something when he interrupted me. Â“DonÂ’t say anything. You need not to. I understandÂ” This is all he said. I nodded.<br><br>He, who was my lover, treated me like his girlfriend. Always pampering me and never once reproached me on my mistakes. He loved me for who I am.<br></div>
