            <div class='col-md body'>Here's a curious topic to chit-chat about.<br><br>People start companies for a variety of reasons. Whatever those are, a business must at least make enough money to sustain itself.<br><br>That is the bottom-line.<br><br>So it is expected that entrepreneurs should like money. In fact that should be a strong motivating factor. They must be quite ambitious, driven, visionary and greedy.<br><br>But if they are too greedy, they may destroy the start-up long before it reaches sustainability. Even powerful businesses often start slow and lose money for years before they become profitable.<br><br>So entrepreneurs should also be patient, and not be affected by money-losses too much.<br><br>How do they balance these powerful, contradictory forces?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

If a business doesn't make money, it doesn't always mean they failed... It might be something like, they didn't get the business model right... Or they didn't manage their cash flow well...
