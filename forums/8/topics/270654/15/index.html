If they don't sell, because Shin is in Thailand, they will have a difficult time and how can you make money when you are having a difficult time?<br><br>In the same way, and this time it is the USA, the USA is making fools out of the rest of the world.<br><br>What they did was, to knowingly or unknowingly sold bad "papers" but definitely risky papers to the rest of the world.<br><br>It is the most brilliant con-job that the world had ever seen. If you want to compare con-jobs... the Temasek con-job was "nothing".<br><br>The estimate of this con-job is US$100 billion to US$ 1 trillion.<br><br>What they did is this.... they lend money to people in the US (to buy house) or  used their house as collateral.<br><br>Sounds very normal, right? Singaporeans owe lots of money with their house as collateral, also, right?<br><br>They problem is, those people the "syndicate" lend to, no one else would lend them because they have no money to pay.<br><br>The syndicate lend them the money and let them pay, initially, say $500/- a month... which those people can afford.<br><br>After six months, they have to pay $800/- which they might find it difficult but doable.<br><br>After nine months, they have to pay $1200/- and so on.<br><br>The thing is, many of the borrowers did not know that! They thought that it is $500 per month forever!<br><br>How is the syndicate going to make money, and how did the banks get involved you might ask....<br><br>...to be continued</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well... the syndicate then "package" all these dubious loans, backed up by houses as collateral, and sell them to the banks...<br><br>hahaha, get this, (everything is still uncertain at this point, you know) but it is possible that some of the houses are in a few "packages"....<br><br>They package say, the loans for a hundred different houses into a piece of paper or document... and then sell the piece of paper to the banks...<br><br>house number 20 to 55 could be in package A, B and C at the same time... ! hahaha...<br><br>What a con-job. First, the homeowners will not be paying back the loans, now it turns out the same house might be in a few "packages..."<br><br>.... to be continued....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>another problem is... when the banks try to get back the houses, all they have are these pieces of papers... hahaha... how are you going to take people's houses until you can prove that you own the house. How are you going to prove that you own the house when all you have are these pieces of papers?<br><br>hahahahahahaha!!!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>so now, firstly, you have loans to people that they will not be paying... then the same house is used in several packages to syndicate the loans to the banks... thirdly, the banks might not get back the houses unless they can prove to the courts that they own the properties... .... hahahahahaha!!!!! brilliant con-job...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>how did the con end up around the world?<br><br>Sometimes, you can see on top of buildings, "CAPITAL LAND"<br><br>CAPITAL LAND might or might not own the building bit instead a "trust" owns it... and CAPITAL LAND is the trusts manager....<br><br>That is to say, the building is now split into many shares (pieces of papers)... that you can trade (buy and sell...)<br><br>In the same way... the syndicated loan packages of the houses in the US can be traded.<br><br>So the banks buy and sell the "packages" to each other....<br>One bank can trust another bank, right? Apparently nobody asked if the papers can be trusted. On the surface it looks OK because the papers are backed up by real estate!<br><br>Why does it take so long to "evolve"?<br><br>You remember in the beginning I said that the home owners pay a little in the beginning and then more and more until a point where they cannot afford to pay?<br><br>So the problem is pushed back... they can pay in the beginning.... and everyone is happy...<br><br>As it becomes less and less affordable, more and more people cannot pay...<br><br>The problem does not surface at once... it takes time... and so the panic spreads because nobody has any idea when it will stop... and all they know is that it gets worse every month.<br><br>So the estimate ranges from US$100 billion to US$1 trillion.<br><br>The stock market, when they think that it is US$1 trillion it crashes... and when they think it is only US$ 100 billion it recovers....<br><br>hahahahhahaha... so now you have a ding dong stock markets...<br><br>but on a downward trend because... with everything so uncertain, who is so stupid as to put money into the stock market?<br><br>I ran for cover in July... but Temasel bought some more Barclays bank shares in July!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>There is a difference between gross stupidity and calculated risks....<br><br>... to be continued....</div>
