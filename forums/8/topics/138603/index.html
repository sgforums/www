            <div class='col-md body'>think it's a both party thing bah. there r some customers who are polite and understanding too. but u have some customers who would wanna throw off their weight around because of some trival stuff.<br>then there's those in the service line  who would not even care about ur existence and andwer ur question rudely.<br>it's all about what kinda treatment u give to get wat kinda treatment in return. i think if nicely talk to the person but the service person still answer back rudely... then he/she isnt right for this line.<br>it's also about the mentality when servicing, i had to admit quite a number of service people i came across were lacking in that kinda mentality with poor service and still hopes that you'd buy from the shop.</div>
