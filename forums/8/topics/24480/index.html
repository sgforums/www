            <div class='col-md body'>ok lah just for once i don't talk nonsense eh.<br><br>for a hacker to retrieve information, there must be willingness on BOTH parties to transmit information, hence the importance of clearing of malignant programs/codes/files(antivirus) OR the blockage of information transmission(firewall)<br><br>to protect your computer from hackers/malicious users like what recently occurred in the dbs fiasco, all you need is 1 of 2 things. either an up-to-date antivirus scanner, or a properly configured firewall. this is of course assuming that your windows is up to date(if you're using windows) and the patches downloaded. if they have not been downloaded, or you are using a 56k connection that makes it impractical to download the updates, a good firewall would do the trick as well.<br><br>1. antivirus<br>any properly updated antivirus would do, be it mcafee, norton or pccillin, amongst many others. the idea of such a program is to properly scan trojans and hopefully disable them. some trojans do require special removers or people competent in registry editing to remove them, but can usually be disabled by other means as well. a trojan is a file that runs in the background of the operating system without the user's knowledge, allowing the malicious user over the internet to control the computer physically or to receive and edit data without the local user's knowledge. there are some "fun" trojans out there that allow the malicious user to open and close the person's cdrom drive and switch on the computer's music etc. as well.<br><br>2. firewall(software)<br>properly updated and configured one will prevent sending of data, DESPITE presence of trojan in the computer because the malicious user is unable to command and activate the trojan via the internet. firewalls are different from each other, some are effective, some less so. the best ones are zone alarm, norton personal firewall and the inbuilt windows XP firewall. there are others like blackice defender, but they are usually much more difficult to configure and may not be as effective as well.<br><br>zone alarm is free.<br><br>norton is reasonably priced, but free over file sharing networks like kazaa if you're not inclined to pay.<br><br>the inbuilt windows firewall in XP can be activated/deactivated by right clicking "my network places" on windows desktop and then right clicking on your internet connection's icon. then click on "advanced" and you can then choose to enable or disable the firewall.<br><br>when software firewalls like these are not properly updated/configured, there sometimes may be problems receiving or sending files to others.<br><br>hardware firewalls are present in some routers/switches, which most people don't use, and i have no knowledge of anyway. they are usually inferior to software firewalls and more difficult to setup as well.<br><br>finally to test your computer's safety, you can try out this site.<br><br>http://www.symantec.com/cgi-bin/securitycheck.cgi<br><br>note that, even if the thing shows your computer to be insecure, you are still generally safe IF you are not running a trojan or other malicious program, and no exploits are present. ie, if your antivirus certifies your computer ok, you should be pretty safe.<br><br>trojans:<br>when i used to be interested in computers, the known ones to me were<br>1. subseven<br>2. back orifice<br>3. hack-a-tack<br><br>amongst many others. the abovementioned 3 also had many different variants. i do not know if they are still the hot ones out there, but they would definitely still work!<br><br>summary:<br>1. do not open files with .exe or .bat since they could be trojans and you could just be helping someone else activate your computer to the millions of casual end-user hackers out there.<br><br>2. run an updated antivirus with auto-protect function, and set it to scan all incoming emails automatically<br><br>3. (optional) run a reliable and updated firewall<br><br>4. don't let any nut have physical access to your computer. anyone with basic knowledge and physical access can set your scanner to exclude the trojan from its scanning, and then retrieve things from you at their convenience</div>
