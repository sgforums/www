            <div class='col-md body'>The song "Wonderful" is abt how a kid sees the divorce of his parents. It tells of the emotions that he is going through...how confused and devastated he is to see his parents fighting all the time.<br><br>"Go to school and I run and play<br>I tell the kids that it's all ok<br>I laugh a lot so my friends wonÂ’t know<br>But when the bell rings<br>I just don't want to go"...<br><br>Personally, here's my fav part of the song.<br>Isn't that sad?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Oh, and I read from somewhere that the song's actually from the personal experiences of Everclear's lead singer.<br><br>Check out the band @ <a href="http://www.everclearonline.com" rel="nofollow">www.everclearonline.com</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i love this song because it captures the emotions a kid or anyone (in this song, it's the kid) would feel when a couple falls out of love, fights all the time and hoping that everything could have remained unchanged or saying that things will be better again when it's not likely to be. the melody is also beautiful, especially the na na nana ... and the chorus about promises being everything while one is little, in fact i think promises mean everything even when one is old.<br><br>simply beautiful.<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 21 September 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's a beautiful song and yup,it's from the singer,Art Alexakis own personal experiences and he had quite a hard life coming from a broken home and being a former junkie.The MTV shows him wiping his eyes at the end which is kinda touching and the best part of the song for me ending when he shouted "I don't want to meet your friend,i don't want to start all over again" which pretty sums up the whole song for me.The acoustic versions sounds a lot better than the studio 1,ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Drooling is not to be drooled to the extreme.<br>Burping is not to be done to the extreme.<br>If eating is done to the extreme.<br>Your tummy will bring you to the toilet.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Waiting for Diablo 2 Add-on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
