            <div class='col-md body'>Ah Ma (not her real name) had a son who worked in San Francisco. Ah Ma had been putting off visiting her son because like what you mentioned, could barely understand English. Earlier this year, her son had a little boy, so Ah Ma went over but warned that she wouldn't stay for anything more than 2 weeks.<br><br>She did not return until more than 4 months later. Ah Ma met new friends in San Francisco. In the morning, her son will drop her off at China town where she will wail away time shopping the markets, or chatting with the other old folks, many of whom are migrants from Hong Kong. In the evening, Ah Ma takes her grandson for a walk in the park. The caucasians speaks not a word of mandarin but their sincerity was apparent when many stopped to smile and play with her cute little grandson...hardly the kind of gesture Ah Ma will expect in Singapore.<br><br>I read this article on Zaobao a few weeks ago and was instantly reminded of the typical Singapore granny who refuse to go anywhere furthur than the neighbourhood provision store. The signboard at the MRT stations were in English, even the arrival announcements slangs with a wierd taste. The thought of getting lost was hardly encouraging but you couldn't blame the old folks, for like your parents, they couldn't speak English.<br><br>I wonder about the validity of a disgrunted Singaporean's reason to refrain venturing away from the norm. Is it simply a nicer version of "I am unhappy with the current situation, but don't expect me to risk getting out of my comfort zone to try for a better life. Let me just curse and swear and hopefully, my life will improve somehow."<br><br>If you wish to live the life you wish, then you have to risk it. The stakes are the network of friends and contacts, the familiar environment you have established over 23 years. The world is your oyster. Just find a place that will fit your aspiration.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
