Serangoon Harbour is not a harbour but the sea channel between the northeastern islands (Pulau Ubin, Pulau Ketam and Coney island) and the mainland.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</span> Taken from <a href="http://www.ura.gov.sg/dgp_reports/punggol/main.html" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">here</span></a>.<br><br>Kampong Punggol, which was located in the vicinity of the Punggol Jetty, was believed to have existed 200 years ago, even before Sir Stamford Raffles founded Singapore. It was one of the oldest settlements in Singapore. The original settlers were predominantly Malays. Fishing was then the main activity. Villagers also planted fruits and vegetables.<br><br>In Malay, Punggol (also spelled Ponggol), means hurling sticks at the branches of fruit trees to bring the fruits down to the ground. It also refers to a place where fruits and forest produce are offered for wholesale.<br><br>The early Chinese immigrants, who settled in Punggol from the mid 19th century onwards, were engaged in plantation work (mainly rubber). As more and more Chinese immigrants settled in Punggol, poultry farming and pig rearing activities flourished.<br><br>Trading on farm produce, fruits and vegetables was carried out in the marketplace at the former eighth milestone of Punggol Road.<br><br>The Serangoon River mouth became the docking point for fishing boats where fishermen gathered to sell their catch.<br><br>In the 1960s, basic amenities like piped water, electricity, paved roads, and drainage systems were introduced through government and self-help programmes. It was also at this time that television became popular and antennas could be seen installed on many kampong rooftops.<br><br>Poultry and pig farms were gradually phased out when redevelopment commenced in the 1970s. Land vacated by resettled farmers were then tendered out on short term leases for non-pollutive agricultural activities (eg. vegetable farming).<br><br>Punggol was also known for its sumptuous seafood and boatels that provided services like docking and renting of boats for boating, water-skiing and skin-diving lessons. These seafood restaurants and boatels have since been relocated to facilitate reclamation works.</div>
