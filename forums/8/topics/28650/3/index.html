There's 2 gals who love u very much... Qualitywise, they r both equally on par... But gal A is a virgin and gal B is not.. Who would u rather choose... The truth is that most would go for the first gal...This is probably the double standard that guys have... Seriously speaking most guys would want their partners to be virgins in the first place... This is not about experimenting but its the fact of life...<br><br>Although, i know some would go for the so called more 'experienced ones'.... But as stated in my previous post, if gal B has changed for the better...then i wouldn't mind accepting her.... But if she is the one who doesn't really value her precious 'assets' then its too bad......<br><br>So i hope gals (i do have respect for them) do not easily give away their virginity to guys... No offence intended... And guys shouldn't take advantage of them either... Love doesnt only constitute sex rite ?<br><br><strong>To each his own.....

            <div class='col-md body'>i think that people can only expect their gfs to be virgins if they themselves are determined to retain theirs till the wedding nite. If not, they will just be some selfish idiots...like those ridiculous people who say that pre-marital sex is ok for them but they expect to their wives to be virgins!<br><br>Anyway, not being a virgin doesn't mean a girl is loose or easy. Maybe she did it with her ex then and they were truely in love at that time, just like wat you and your gf might be doing now.<br>Even if not, wat's past is past...if she could be faithful to you now, why bother about the fact that she had slept with a few guys before....<br><br>To me, I really dun think it's important whether my gf is a virgin or not...and yes, even if i'm torn between choosing one of two girls where one is a virgin and the other is not, the virgin girl will not get any advantage in winning my heart...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh sheesh... well children... let grandpa tell you y...<br>In every society, there is always a division and a spectrum of ppl. Take for instance premarital sex. So some of you favour and maybe others won't. Its a social mechanism thingy. Some think premarital sex roks while they in honeymoon stage then fine. Some despise it downright. These comprise of the vast diversity of ppl in society.<br>See, if you take premarital sex(kindly assume you are the counterpart) upon your partner as a personal thing then you must observe both sides of the story. Y did he/she(trying not to be sexist here) and how did he/she lose virginity? Free will or coerced? if free will y and if coerced how.... does your partner seek temporary gratifaction or prefers subtle consistent relationships? did partner dress in any particularly provocative way tt might arouse unnecessary sexual attention?<br>Then there are charateristics or the person and situational stuff and issues about doin it for money(big"p") and so on so many larger more powerful factors come into play my darlings....<br>Oh ya the ME part...other than for health reasons (to avoid the big"A") ya i think itz okay and maybe better wif someone to guide you along(snigger) sex isn't as huge a topic as ya think it is...<br>After all, you will make love one day... and when it comes you want to make it pleasurable and oh well you know the "therapeutic" effects of sex and stuff... like reduced ageing and yes itz a great fat burner too... Cos ya see, sex is the emblem of love, its eventual fruit... and yes if your partner chooses to misuse that gift he/she faces the oppurtunity cost of undermining true love... that which comes thru wif love is all the desirable traits in a person care and tenderness... so next time you ppl embark on sex think of love 1st and if you still think you wanna do it(hopefully for love) then congrats... you have taken a bolder step toward the epitome of the human heart...</div>
