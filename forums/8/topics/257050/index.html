            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;My name is Sandra Tan.  It is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;with great disappointment and distress that I am filing a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;complaint to you with regards to my situation.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;My family (including myself, my husband, my<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;daughter, and my son) planned a Darwin holiday for<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;the March school vacation period and was supposed to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;depart on 09 March. Unfortunately, we were put in a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;situation by the security officers at the departure terminal,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;that was way beyond our control and we were not able<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;to make our trip. The following is an account<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;of what had happened : -<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I entered the Immigration gantry at about 7.15pm<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;with my daughter (Belle Lee , 13 yrs old) to have our<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;passport scanned and our hand carry luggage<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;checked whilst my husband ( Lee Ming Chong) stayed<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;behind with my son ( Caius Lee, 8 yrs old) at the ticketing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;counter to sort out my son's visa. After having mine and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;my Belle's passport scanned, we proceed to the security<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;gantry to have our hand luggage and our bodies<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;scanned. Belle passed the security gantry first,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;whilst I followed right behind her. A lady officer<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;asked me to remove my boots for scanning, and I did<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;as told immediately and put my boots inside the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;basket provided, for it to be scanned together with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;my hand luggage. I then proceed to the metal<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;detector of which I cleared without the gantry<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;beeping or detecting any metal objects. I was then asked<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;to collect my luggage and my boots. In the mean<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;time, Belle was throwing away a sweet wrapper<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;and retuning to me and saw me putting on my boots.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Belle then asked casually "Mummy, why do you have to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;remove your shoes?"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Whilst putting on my boots, I replied her and said<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;that "they (the security officers) are afraid that we<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;might keep bombs in our shoes (which is why I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;need to take it off to have it scanned)"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Immediately, a security officer standing at the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;conveyor belt ( Stephen S Naidira) who was standing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;in front of me said with a very rude tone "repeat<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;what you just said". I clarified with him what he<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;meant - is it for me to repeat what I had told my<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;daughter? He said loudly again, to repeat what I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;had just said. So I did exactly what he told me. I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;said to him that "my daughter asked me why I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;need to take off my shoes, and I told her that you<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;guys (the security officers) are afraid that we will<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;keep bombs in our shoes." He immediately asked<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;me to stand aside and said that he had to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;report it to his superior that I said the word<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;"bomb" twice. Then an Indian lady (Sivamalar)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;at the customs started hurling at me and my<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;daughter and said that I said the word "bomb"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;twice and it is against the law and I can be<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;sent to jail and they are calling the police. She<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;(Sivamalar) was so loud and rude and she<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;shoved us to the side, and refused to listen to my<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;explanation. In fact, she got so aggressive that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;another officer Ricky Lim (I guess it's her supervisor)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;had to come forward to stop her from further<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;attacking me and my daughter verbally, and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;specifically asked Sivamalar to "shut up". I told<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Ricky Lim that I would like to know the names of his<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;staff because their attitude and rudeness were<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;simply beyond any acceptable level. Immediately<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Sivamalar got so angry and aggressive that she started<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;charging at Ricky Lim and hurled "What?! What?!<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;What?! She (she meant me) said the word "Bomb" twice,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;so what is wrong with arresting her (which is me) and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;we were told that if we heard the word twice, we will<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;arrest!!" At that time, Stephen S Naidira came to me again to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;intimidate me further by asking me to repeat what I said<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;earlier to my daughter again. I refused to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;repeat again then because I believe he was<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;deliberately asking me to repeat so that he can count the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;number of times that I mentioned the word "bomb".<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I also believe that that the officers were deliberately<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;provoking me by being rude and intimidating, in the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;hope that I will retaliate in kind, thereby making their<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;unreasonable actions justifiable.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Despite my anger and the fact that my daughter was<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;scared to tears by the situation, I knew I had to keep<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;my cool. I sat aside with my daughter taking down<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;names of the personnel involved on my mobile phone.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I was told to wait for another officer of a higher rank to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;decide on the matter, and I was still hoping whoever<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;the higher ranked officer that was coming will<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;have the logical thinking to acknowledge that what I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;had said to my daughter was a simple, harmless<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;private conversation taken completely out-of-context.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;At about 7.30pm, the Sergeant-in-charge, Amran Buang<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;came. After I explained the full context of the incident to him,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;he refused to make a decision and decided to escalate it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;further to the Auxilary Police and State Police. He said<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;that the word "bomb" is very sensitive and I should<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;not have mentioned it twice. I explained to him that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I did not know saying the word "bomb" is against the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;law, and I further explained that I did not say the word<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;"bomb" in a threatening context to the officer, the word<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;"bomb" was taken completely out of context as part<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;of an answer to my daughter's question. Despite my<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;explanation, he said he cannot make the decision and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;my case has to be escalated to higher authorities.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Meanwhile, at about 7.40pm , my son's visa cleared<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;and my husband and my son came in through the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;customs. After knowing what had happened, my<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;husband tried to talk to Sergeant Amran Buang,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;further explaining to him that we are just a family<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;going on holiday and what I have said to my daughter<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;had been taken out of context. Again, no one was<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;bothered to listen. And again, we were told to wait<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;for another officer with an even higher ranking. With<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;time ticking away and at 7.55pm with no sign of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;higher authorities appearing, we knew then our hope<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;of boarding our flight had diminished.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Whilst waiting, Stephen S Naidira (the security<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;officer) gathered with a few security officers at the side,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;including Sivamalar to discuss how they should present<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;their statement to the police when they arrive later to make<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;sure that they are adequately covered, and that they<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;are just following the rule and doing what they were told<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;to do. They said by insisting that they are taking actions<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;"by-the-book", they would be ok.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I hope by now you have a clear picture of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;situation. My kids were both crying then, with more<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;and more policemen arriving which scared the living<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;daylights of them, and with no hope to continue our<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;holiday plans. I believe every action inside the terminal<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;is recorded and I would insist that your review the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;CCTV recordings on that night to know that I am only<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;stating the truth without exaggeration. You can also<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;see that during the entire episode, I was not at any<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;point defiant or rude or refused any further check by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;the officers, despite the infuriating situation that me<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;and my family were put through.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I know it is important to stay vigilant to protect<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Singapore . I have young children, I know how<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;important it is, which is why I complied without<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;complaining when I had to remove my boots for<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;scanning. However, here is an obvious case of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;security officers trying to get away with their<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;rudeness and aggressiveness by taking things way<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;beyond what was necessary,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;in the name of following the security protocol. They<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;were really angry when I asked for their names from<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Mr. Ricky Lim , and they knew very well then<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;that they can abuse their power to make things very<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;difficult for me and my family.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;At around 8.05pm , we were informed by the Tiger<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Airways personnel that the plane will have to depart<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;and they will off-load our luggage from the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;plane. At around 8.10 p.m., the State Police and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;other policemen arrived to take our statement.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;In the entire episode, the State Police and the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;SWISS PORT personnel were the only ones who<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;conducted themselves professionally and offered us<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;consolation and meaningful advice. They have also at<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;some stages expressed their personal views that they<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;acknowledged this incident was gravely mis-handled<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;on the part of the security officers. The State Police<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;further confirmed that there is no case against us,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;and they would just need to complete the paperwork.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;The Budget Terminal manager came to meet me and said<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;that whilst he empathized with our situation, it is an airport<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;security protocol and frankly, it's "just too bad" that this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;happened to us.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;My statement and my daughter's statement only<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;completed at about 10.45p.m.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;The counter service staff, Ms Nur Aisah Bte Ali<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Hassan was very helpful and advised us on our<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;next steps. She was kind enough to ask us to return the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;next day to change the traveling dates and advised<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;the additional charges involved.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I am not given a report for this case, but my case<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;number with the State Police is P/20070309/0015.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I was already told by the State Police that the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;case is closed without further action.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;For the ordeal that my family had been put through,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I would want an official reply from CAAS and all relevant<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;authorities addressing the following : -<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Whether the security officers were trained to handle<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;passengers with such bad attitude and rudeness and if such<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;actions by them are condoned by authorities. I would insist<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;you to refer to the CCTV recordings during<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;the period of the incident.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;What actions would be taken by CAAS and all relevant<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;authorities with reference to both the security officers, Mr. Stephen<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;S Naidira ad Ms. Sivamalar, for their unruly behavior and attitude?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Surely, characters as such do not belong to a national airport that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;aspired to be a world class traveling hub.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;What actions would be taken by CAAS and all relevant<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;authorities with reference to Sergeant Amran Buang , who<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;had the authority to end this episode promptly, but instead<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;decided to prolong our ordeal for no justifiable cause? Is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;it a protocol that even after establishing the facts that we, as<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;a family poses no security threat, there is still a need<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;to escalate the matter to the authority and have the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;State Police and other policemen carry out a full<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;investigations only to end up in vain? Why is it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;that even at level of Sergeant, whom I reckon is<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;better educated, experienced, and able to make<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;logical sense of the whole situation, refuse<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;to make a simple decision and end our ordeal<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;quickly? Is this a Singapore civil service practice<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;where decision making is pushed and shoved from one<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;level to another no matter how obvious what the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;final decision should be from the very beginning?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Whether all the officers concern are properly<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;trained and competent to handle such situation.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Besides hardware ( i.e. the protocol book), are they<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;taught to apply the software ( i.e . common senses)?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Is it really a protocol that as long as the word "bomb"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;is mentioned twice by a person (once being<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;asked to repeat by the officer) ??then no matter<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;what context, tone, situation and profile of the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;person who said it, it would not be taken into<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;consideration? What if my daughter instead of asking<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;me a simple question about my shoes, decided to say:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;"mummy, according to news report, there are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;speculations that the recent Indonesian air crash<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;may be attributed to a bomb inside the plane." Would<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;your security officer would come up to her and ask<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;her to repeat one more time, and she would be put<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;under arrest? Your staff kept telling me that saying<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;the word "bomb" in the airport is illegal and I can<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;go to jail. They quoted newspaper examples of how<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;people have gone to jail because of that. I think<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;your staffs need to be trained to understand and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;differentiate situations and circumstances. As far<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;as I knew, the people that went to jail had VERBALLY<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;THREATENED staff members in the aviation service or<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;had DELIBERATELY caused public alarm using sensitive<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;words. My case was clearly none of the above. Even<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;if, I am saying if, indeed its illegal to mention<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;the word "bomb" in the airport no matter what<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;context, the person involved need to be warned ahead<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;of time. You cannot arrest a person for committing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;something illegal when the person has no idea that the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;word is illegal in the first place. Your staff could have<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;given me a verbal warning to say that such sensitive<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;words should be refrained in the airport and I would<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;have walk away remembering the warning. But instead,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;they decide to let the matter escalate further.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Who is to compensate for the expenses that are<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;already incurred and forfeited for this trip, and our<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;emotional stress and duress during the entire episode?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;The total cost incurred, including air tickets,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;accommodation, and land tours amount to about<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;$4,200. We had to put up with hours of humiliation<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;with more than twenty policemen and officials<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;surrounding us, questioning us, checking our luggage<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;through and through.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;We had put up with never-ending questioning from<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;different departments, and best of all, repeated<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;checks on my same pair of boots. My kids were<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;terrified, puzzled, disappointed and exhausted from<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;this entire ordeal. My husband and I are left with one<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;week of applied leave and no vacation and holiday to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;look forward to.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I would like to state that not everyone that we came<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;across in this episode had been unpleasant. I wish to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;empathy shown by the State Police and the SWISS PORT<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;personnel.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I will be waiting for your reply. Please let me know<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;when to expect it in email. In the mean time, I may<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;seek legal advice for my rights and entitlement in this<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;incident.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Yours sincerely<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Sandra Tan Hong Lian<br></div>
