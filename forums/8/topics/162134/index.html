            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Everybody,<br><br>I started smoking when I was 15, now I'm 40, but yesterday at 7.30am I stopped COLD TURKEY. Today, at this time 3.45am, I have NOT smoked a single cigarrete.<br><br>Why am I writing this? Because I want to share with those of you who are still smoking, the experience of quitting an expensive, deadly habit, &amp; stubborn addiction.<br><br>How I feel now:<br><br>Now, I don't feel the urge to light up and puff after pulling pass the initial 8-16 hours. The urge to smoke has weaken considerably, such that I can simply refuse to light up. Food tastes funny now (not bad, just funny), because I just only stopped smoking, so it may take some while for my taste to revert back to normal - most people say food will taste better when or once you stopped smoking.<br><br>All that I am having now is a cup of black coffee with not milk and little sugar, I feel mentally alert without cigarettes, abd can still do my work without it. Concentration is not affected by lack of nicotine after 22 hours.<br><br>I'm not having insomnia being up this early, because to avoid being bothered by the urge to smoke I slept really early last night (around 9.45pm). Now I'm up and the urge to smoke has become really weak.<br><br>I am happy with progress and my efforts, but I have identified dangerous situations wherein I may be pulled back into it, so I will avoid these situations.<br>Yes I may have to stay away from office for a few days, and conduct work from home office for the sake of pulling pass the first week as a normal person who does not smoke. I really want to quit this addiction.<br><br>Side effects? Yes, IRRITABILITY. Yesterday, within the first 8 hours, due to withdrawal I accidentally raised my voice at my employee. I apologised later, but he says he knows why I yelled at him, and told me to keep up my efforts to stop smoking. I was so touched - I knew then I have good people as emplyees. I bought him dinner.<br><br>And then later, I nearly smashed my PDA phone on the ground because I couldn't hear the other party due to bad connection, but my colleague stopped me. Thank goodness, otherwise I'd be spending more money replacing it.<br><br>Well, that's all for now, will come back and update as I go along.<br><br>I tend to stay smoke-free forever. But even if I fail, I will come here and say that I failed and reverted back to smoking, stating cause and reasons.<br><br>But PERSONALLY, and RESOLUTELY, NO i don't intend to fail in this final attempt.<br><br></div>

I went into digital music production - expensive crap, but so is smoking!!<br><br>I put aside about $12 per day, I get $360 per month. This amount I used for paying off some equipment I bought under instalments of 18mths, will ensure that I can't default in my plan to stop smoking. Of course I can just pay it all up one shot, but this way, it's more CONVICTING to succeed in QUITTING!<br><br>All these years of about $10 per day, I could have bought hell of a lot of stuff!<br><br></div>
