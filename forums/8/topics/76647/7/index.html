Of the three people sent to hospital, two have been discharged after examinations by doctors. Three others are still unaccounted for.<br><br>PowerGas confirmed that a section of a gas pipe along the highway was damaged by the collapse, but that engineers had shut off the supply. Gas supply to the area has, however, not been affected because alternative pipes are being used.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its quite fishy.CNA is not known for its balanced coverage of local issues..Especially since this station broadcasts overseas..Why wold they be open all of a sudden.The common things which I have noticed throughout the many different posts are that,<br><br><strong>1</strong>.It happened at 1530hrs or so.Construction sites around that time are not empty shells..They are busy with activity, furthermore this being a tunneling project, it would be full of workers and machinery.To say that only a few men are unaccounted for, is pure hogwash.<br><br><strong>2.</strong>Some people reported that the Navy has sent MPA to patrol the area, true or not, we need some corroboration.Since the Coast Guard squadron is nearby..Why isn't there any word of sorts from them?Why is this surveillance necessary unless there is suspicion of "foul play"...<br><br><strong>3.</strong>The pictures provided by CNA seems to be quite staid and it revolves around the few scenes they show..the top view of the station.From what I've heard , its not that small, especially the radius of damage..Are we seeing a sort of media censorship happening here?<br><br>Well, these are my findings..Heh, of course I pray hard that its just a harmless gas blast and they manage to rescue as many people as possible.I just want to bring to the attention of all you fellas the "weirdness" of the situation.Comments?</div>
