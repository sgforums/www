            <div class='col-md body'>taken off someone's blog site. blogger says he is the son of an LTA engineer who's place of work is at the site of the cave in.<br><br>While i cannot vouch for the authenticity of his claim, I feel that what he wrote does seem to be more in line with what has actually happened. here it is:<br><br>Our government here is really capable in covering up. Sure you would have heard the news about the collapse of Nicoll Highway by now which happened in the afternoon yesterday.<br><br>According to news reports given by the authorities, only 1 has been confirmed dead so far and only 3 are still missing as well as 2 others discharged from the hospital. That's absolute rubbish.<br><br>The place of the explosion happens to be where my dad was working yesterday. Being an LTA staff, he's currently involved in the new MRT Circle Line Project and his work site is located at the place where the bridge went down yesterday, and i must say, i almost lost him.<br><br>He was working as usual when he saw part of the pillar that was being used to support the temporary bridge collapse and after that, the strong smell of gas could be felt. That's where he knew something bad was gonna happen and immediately got out from the worksite and ran for his life. Moments after that, the whole bridge came crashing down, causing an impact on the gas pipes that were below, resulting in an explosion and fire. What he saw next was horrifying. All vehicles that were travelling along the highway went crashing down together and got crushed and buried. <span style="color: red;">There were also 2 SBS Buses carrying passengers that went crashing down.</span><br><br>So, why was all these not in the news? Why were they not reported? To me, it's obvious the government is just trying to cover things up, making the accident sound like it's not so bad after all, trying to protect Singapore's reputation.My heart goes out to all the passengers in the bus and vehicles that got crushed and buried and yet not made known to public. I sympathise with the relatives of the victims whose deaths were not made public. I can understand the pain of losing their loved one.<br><br>Just like for me, when the authorities could not locate my dad after the incident, they assumed he was dead and made a call to my mum, saying that he was missing and his body could not be found. You can imagine how my mum reacted to the news who then called me up to break the sad news. Worst of all, when my mum rushed to the scene, she was not allowed to get inside for fear of more collapses and none of the police and civil defence officers were very keen to help. All they did was apologise.<br><br>The great relief came when i found out my dad was only brought to hospital as he had suffered some shocks after the impact and after hearing about the deaths of his Bangaladeshi workers.<br><br>So, how did the government derive that only 1 was dead and a few missing? Thanks to my dad who was an eye witness to that accident or i'd be stupid enough to trust the news.</div>
