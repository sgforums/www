            <div class='col-md body'>office politics never die.. why? this is because, everyone wants to be better if they had a choice, and if they dont, they have to make that choice. the office politics and etc are examples of people trying to become better than others. become more recognised and superior. that is why the bosses will favor them most of the time. think of it this way, people will do anything for what they want. it varies for different people, and most of the time, people will have fun playing office politics to get to a better position, or into the bosses good books. if no one is trying to be better than the other, then how will bosses choose important positions for his workers by evaluating an amount of equally skilled people. im not saying that office politics is the only way to become superior, im just saying that people will not mind doing it to get better</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree on why people dun mix around.. coz they worry if others know them too well, thier weakness will get exploited. But if u remain too silent.. office will just become like attending the subject u hate the most..  But remaining totally silent gives others the feel that u may one day go postal... coming to work with an Ak-47 lol...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
