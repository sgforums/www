              <p>You can use CpF to finance only local tertiary education.</p>
              <p>or , if they are academically gifted, they can seek out scholarships or sponsorship to pay for their overseas education.</p>
              <p>If not I suggest you be honest to your children about your financial situation. </p>

              complete their full-time studies up to the GCE 'A' Levels or
              Polytechnic Diploma (or their equivalent), both locally and
              overseas, before enlisting for NS. Those who have already embarked
              on their full-time studies but who do not meet the deferment
              conditions, will have to disrupt their studies and be enlisted for
              NS at the earliest opportunity scheduled by the Central Manpower
              Base (CMPB), including those who take up Singapore Permanent

              <p>If I am not wrong, children 13 years and older need the bond.. Your children are currently still young , I think they are still exempt untill they become 13 and holding a Singaporean citizenship.</p>
              <p>Here's what I found on another forum. You may need to verify all information as posted below.</p>
              <p>"This is often a nightmare for those who are leaving Singapore. The govt 
              has never ever revealed the criteria for inclusion. Until Aug 2006, 
              these were main operating criteria. <br> <br> 1) The child must have PR visa for a foreign country before his reaches 
              11 years of age and must actually leave by age 11. Until Aug 2006, all 
              male Singapore passport issued before the age of 11 expired at age 11. 
              Now it is 13 years of age. <br> <br> 2) Any renewal of the passport indicates that the child is now enjoying 
              the privilege of citizenship. Any return to a local school, taking up 
              NRIC etc is also considered falling under the criteria of enjoying the 
              privilege of citizenship. Once the child enjoys the "privilege of 
              citizenship" he must do NS. <br> <br> 3) This journey does not stop here, it carries on until the child 
              becomes an adult at the age of 21. The 2 important steps that must be 
              followed. <br> <br> 4) Step 1 - having migrated, at the age of 13, the child must apply for 
              exit permit which can be done by e-mail. As this considered migrating 
              for good. No bond is required. The clerk will tell you that a bond is 
              required, don't give in. Deal with the Officer. If you fail to apply 
              when the kid reaches 13 and the application is late, a notice of an 
              offence committed will be issued which can be compounded with a fine. 
              They will then grant you the exit permit.<br> <br> 5) Step 2 - The exit permit is valid until age 16 1/2. Once this is 
              expired, you need to seek deferment until the age of 21 and indicate 
              that you do not wish to return to Singapore. A deferment will be granted
               and when the child reaches 21, you will asked to renounce the Singapore
               citizenship. If your kid suddenly realises that PAP is the party for 
              him, he then must renouce his foreign country citizenship and return to 
              do his NS. If the latter happens you can assume that you failed as a 
              parent or your kid is just not smart. <br> <br> 6)During this journey, your child can travel in and out of Singapore 
              with no issues. Your child can also work in SIngapore once he reaches 21
               and enjoy privilege of being a talent while having a safety net in a 
              developed country."</p>
