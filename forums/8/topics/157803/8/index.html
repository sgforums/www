Theory of Evolution (note: THEORY not FACT) assumes that the origin of all life from is from the SEA... from some water-based mono-cellular slug thing (much like what u drink down everyday in ur water...). Something like that anyway, read so many years ago forget liao...<br><br>Anyway the story goes that they became fish first, then u get the mudskipper type that crawl onto land and eventually became land animals...<br><br>I was talking abt birds... not suicidal lemmins... doubt fishes come from them... genes don't really do much good if u're not alive to pass em on...<br><br>Same goes with fish trying to grow lungs &gt;.&lt; Gene evolve as they struggle on land trying to breathe... but never gets passed on cos they die... Well, unless they're so smart to flip back into the sea after the genes evolved, and convinced their siblings its fun to keep trying it... I think all u'll get are fish that can do backflips really well...</div>
