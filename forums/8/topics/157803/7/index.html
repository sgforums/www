            <div class='col-md body'>Here is one insight I read from the web.<br><br>Can we all assume, whether we are believers or non believers, at least for the sake of argument, that GOD is perfect?<br><br>If we agree GOD is perfect, then consider this: Scripture does say (or at least suggest strongly?) GOD cannot lie!<br><br>There is no strong objection that Adam and Eve had free will (or they wouldn't disobey GOD). Ask yourself one question: does GOD have free will? If He cannot lie, so does He have free will?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>If a perfect being has no free will .. then it is very much debatable a free will being can be labelled perfect.<br><br>The next question is: does it mean GOD, a perfect being, cannot possibly create a free will being, aka imperfect being?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So let's just conclude only GOD is perfect. Adam and Eve were not. There is always the danger of equivocation. I suggest we refrain from using the term "perfect" to label Adam and Eve.<br><br>We can only say, GOD declared Adam and Eve "good",  they were created "good", model human beings. Too bad they sinned. But the Gospels present Jesus, who is what Adam should be from the beginning - obedient to God, love God, love neighbours, blah blah.</div>

We are as we are, with Free Will and all. But God keeps all of us well fed, everyday wake up you have food to eat. Anytime the weather goes out of control He would say the word and everything is back to normal.<br><br>So basically, there are no worries. Everyday from the moment you wake up you are fed. No danger, cos under God's protection.<br><br>Give us a million years from creation and we'll STILL be naked, don't even know how to take care of ourselves. A farcry from what we are today...<br><br>Perfect world? As a parent would you want that for your children? I would do that to my pet, but not my child.<br><br><strong>All part of the plan baby</strong><br><br>Its a decision made from the beginning. That we will be given the necessary tools (our 2 hands 2 legs and a smarter than the average ape brain), and even a headstart - clothing so the first 2 dudes don't die from the weather...)<br><br>If we take the Biblical version of man's beginning, Adam and Eve were given time in the garden to learn about ALL the plants and animals there are. Basically given the knowledge they need to survive before finally being released into the wild, the TRUE beginning and God hands-off from there. To me, Satan did not win by succeeding in tempting Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit. God allowed that to happen. It was all part of His grand plan. The final gift to complete our Free Will. To be given the power to CHOOSE. Could Satan have tempted them before they were ready? No way... the TIME was chosen by God. Smart as Satan thought He was, God is a billion steps ahead.<br><br><strong>Show us You're God</strong><br><br>God did step in to show the way to Him every now and then. And finally He did walk among men once more. As a man. Why a man? I believe His purpose was not to prove that He existed. Come on, there are enough evidence that He exists. It was to take away the excuses that man had been giving throughout their existence. That they cannot live up to God's expectations. That His instructions are too harsh and difficult to follow.<br><br><strong>Here comes the interesting part.</strong><br><br>Then people argue, But Jesus is God, of course He can do it. So we admit He is God yea? And if He is God, then what He said should be heeded as words from God isn't it?<br><br>Oh, then we say, nah Jesus isn't God at all. So how did He do what no one has ever been able to do? No, not all the miracles. But to live a life free from Sin! If He isn't God, then ANYONE of us can do it. Prove He isn't God by doing it!<br><br>Argue all you want... Say that the people who wrote about Him idolised Him and left out the places where He succumbed to Sin. You know how true that is. If the leader you believed in and lived for one day turned out to be a fraud, would you continue convincing others he is authentic and even give your life for him? Put yourself in the Disciple's shoes.<br><br><strong>Back to Show Us You're God..</strong><br><br>People saw Him, touched Him, were cured by Him. He told them He is God. Yet there were still people who did not believe. What more do you want? Would anything change if He came in our time instead? If we believe now because we saw Him, would our decendants centuries down the road believe because of what we saw? Given the technology then, they would brush off the whold thing as a gimmick, a fraud, the way we are right now wouldn't they?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">John 20:29 - "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed." </span><br><br>(Told to Thomas who insisted on seeing the resurrected Christ before believing...)<br><br>How would you have done it if you wanted to have a creation that had free will, maximise their potential, and eventually come to know their Creator?[/b]</div>

Who would bother to read the bible when there are so many contradictions. God is perfect but the followers are not. Therefore the interpretation are all full of flaws. They interpret what they want to preach. They rebutt for the sake of rebutal. This is one example of expecting everybody to understand what is in bible to rebutt. Typical of their approach.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
