They can't even see him anymore or hear his voice...<br><br>Only those who are very holy like the priest (representing the people) are allowed into the Holy Tent (like the Celestial Palace)... if the priest is unholy, he would be struck dead in the tent, they often wear the chains that make sound when they go into the Tent, when they walk the chains will make a noise, but if it suddenly stops, the people outside will have known what had happened...<br><br>Now, since He loved us so much and sent his SON, we are able to be righteous again and pray to HIM... He listens... Praying is communicating, but we can't see HIM no more</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>like for example, today is my church's 12th anniversary celebration.<br><br>one of my friend invited her relatives all that, then the kids are all gangsters, dress funky, coloured hair, ear holes and are all primary sch level la.<br><br>then my own disciple group kids come complain to me say that the guests were bullying them, pushing them and threatening and challenging them to fights.<br><br>and they were all confused to what they should do, on one hand they wanted to fight back, but on the other, i've been teaching them about forgiveness, tolerance when people try to push them around, and basically "offering your right cheek when someone slaps your left cheek"<br><br>so we were just sitting down, i was sitting near them to watch over them la, when suddenly, one of the gangsters lifted a chair and wanted to throw at my kids, and shouting vulgarities at them, so i had to come in and break it up. my kids started to lose their temper also joined in shouting at the guests. so i had to scold them also.<br><br>i explained that these people are guests, and are the loved ones of a sister in the church, she has been trying really hard to share the gospel with them, if you like that treat them, how will their attitude be towards our sister? etc.<br><br>my point is, don't think our lives are all so merry. while we're as much exposed to disasters like non-believers, we have many other things to worry about and to tolerate.<br><br>you lose your temper just because someone preaches to you,<br><br>we can't afford to lose our temper when people pushes us around and treat us like sh!t.<br><br>who's at the losing end? us christians.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
