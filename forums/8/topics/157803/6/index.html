U guys blame why GOd didnt save them  from earthquake , Tsunamis and the bull shiet'..  why dun u think of it as the hand of God giving a piece of his thoughts huh ? Lets take the latest into account.. Hurrican Katrina , u guys must be wondering..HEY! WHY GOD LET THIS HAPPEN! have u thought that maybe God just wanna waste that city,,coz comeone.  no conventional weapons or country can take on the mighty USA!  One whack..n thats more powerful then any Terror attack on US soil. U guys maybe saying.. O.. thats some natural phenomenan! Its BOUND to happen... well, TOO BAD.. coz every reason supplied..u mofos will jsut supply more excuses..n this debate will go ON n ON n ON..<br><br>Oh.. someone also says , the bible is a book. Written. But funny thing is.. all these books have facts and evidence to spport it with. U must be saying.. O.. i can write a book! Well, u go write a book n see if its gonna last 2000 yrs. I dun think ur book is gonna even reach 1000 ppl.. not to say the 2000 yrs. Let me tell u someting, u can go check it out. In the bible it says that when the Isreals were expelled.. He will punish those that expelled them by giving them drought on the very lands they will conquer. So the land of Israel was a piece of wasteland.. a god damn desert until the Country was formed again..n WALA.. Grapes, Apples, Olives..  if that aint something.. i dun know what is! You guys that dun believe in God i am cool with it.. coz when i am up there sipping on my pina colada.. i am gonna laugh at u losers down there eating maggots for breakfast.<br><br>U guys must be thinking i am so PRO - GOD well, i have been doing lots of reading and research , n well.. i have to come to a verdict personally. that , there is a higher being.. a GoD.

Let me answer your questions and maybe ask u a few questions.. coz obviously your brain is not moving at the right direction.. or the lack of DEEPER understanding towards the questions involved. I hope you are sober when u aked these questions n not like some of my stupid friends that asks questions like this when they are mega drunk.. normally  i just open another bottle shut thier mouths up.. but for ur case.. i will make it an exception.<br><br>U asking why God do not appear? What are the main things that make us human is that we have choice. We aint animals or any lower mammal..we have a choice to decide. The Freedom of choice. If God comes out n start kicking your ass.. SURE as hell u will believe.. but u will believe in FEAR ! u are then FORCED to believe. that aint called freedom no more n soon .. u will start bitching for choice..of WHY? What happens if he punishes those that do Genocide.. but doesnt punish those that rape n steal.. u gonna say.. ' OH GOD WHY U SO GODDAMN UNFAIR!' u know what '? all of us including ur sorry is gonna be vaporised ..unless u never sinned in ur life before.. i am sorry.. ur @$$ is coming down to hell with the rest of us. Now with choice.. u decide ur own fate.. u believe or not..its up to u..  the decisions of ur choice will be the end result. Tell me.. u choose COke Or Water? U choose COke u GET coke.. cokes flavour.. the fizziness.. n also comes with the colouring n teh sugar content..  U chose water ? ...stale.. tasteless... ugh.. but clean. So u cannot be bitching why u got cancer when u smoke! If God turns up.. he cant be selective in his punishment.. Coz u want him to exact punishment rite ? If not.. then why u want him to appear?! U want a FAIR GOD.. or u want a GOD thats gonna impose ur freedom.. make u feel the fear in ur own room.. scared to even think about masturbating  or how u wanna grope  this chio bu in the bus.<br>Because the hand of God is gonna smite u down.<br><br>I hope i answer..SOME of your questions and ur doubt. But if not.. feel free to question the very existence. n Refute my points in this thread.</div>

Angels are created perfect but men are created "a little lower than angels". you see, God created angels first, and made them perfect. so much so that when they commit a wrong, there is no room for redemption. they become fallen angels. and they cannot come to the likeness of God himself.<br></div></blockquote>If Angels are created perfect, then they should not commit wrongs and why is there a fallen angel? What happened to Lucifer? Isn't Satan once an angel? So it seem God did not create any perfect<br>things. Or was it meant to be this way? An imperfect world. We are just a creation in God's game.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by starblue:</div><div class="quote_body">God thus created men, in hope of helping him grow to his perfection, to be on equal standing with him ultimately. men have room for mistakes, thats why he has room for growth.<br><br>but unfortunately, some men do not seek to grow in the Lord. they want God to do everything for them, and when God doesnt, they say he doesnt love them....<br><br>oh boy... </div></blockquote>When you have the power to create a perfect human, why create him just to grow into perfection? Isn't is God's game to see his creations unvail before his eyes and knowing what will happen eventually when he already laid the path as to what is going to happen? Then the followers blindly read the bible and follow his plan not knowing that they are just part of the game.<br><br>Poor thing..<br></div>

But somehow as it turn out, human violate the rule and eat the forbidden fruit leading to the expulsion from Garden of Eden. To paraphase, human was created to be perfect but turns out to be imperfect.<br><br>So now and then G*d will have a Big Flood, destruction of Sodom and Gomorra cities, killing all first born Pharoah Sons etc to eliminate all those humans beyond redemption. G*d is seeking perfection from his creation that gets out of hand. A simple game initially becomes such a mess that cannot be cleared up to the extent need to send his Son to Earth to wash away all our sins by shedding his blood <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>PS... do you entertain the thought that the so called G*d could be an alien from outer space?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>About the spread of the C and M faith? Some ppl tell me it all started at the time about Issac (Abraham with Sarah) and Ishmael (Abraham with Hagar) story. Now that is new news to me. You all concur? Seem Hagar and Ishmael were sent away but they were not forsaken by G*d. Maybe Hagar was a maid and Sarah was wife status hence they (Hagar and Ishmael) were despised? Hagar was an Egyptian. So there the stories of two diverted paths start to unfold from there onwards with the descendants of Issac and Ishmael later on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Sarah is an unforiving wife lah. If that time no despise them then all under one faith but fussy wife left behind a legacy saga that spans centuries till this day. Abraham also weakling or maybe at that time he too old to pick a fight with his wife... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
