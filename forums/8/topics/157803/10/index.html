Perhaps you can refine a bit, remove some variables and add in others. There is constant refinement. The process does not stop at the "next best answer".<br><br><blockquote>If you study science, theories are never taken as facts. Facts are proven theories that will never ever be disproved.

Even if someone proves a previous theory wrong, it does not mean the previous theory is not science. The scientific method does not guarantee you get the real answer at the end of the day.<br><br><blockquote>It is funny how people choose to believe what others theorise "I think ah..."

(Faith is the belief of things not seen and things not heard) and if you dun believe in him, you will not see miracles. simple as that.<br><br>people who believe in him experience miraculous cure from cancer and near escapes from deadly car accidents and such. but most times, other people pass it off as a glitch on the doctor's part or pure luck or something else. only when u have experienced a miracle will you know the goodness of the Lord.<br><br>well, that is wad most christians will tell you anyway...<br><br>i didnt say i agree with that. but i grew up with this kinda teaching.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
