            <div class='col-md body'>Hi pple, dunnoe how many pple knew what's i am writing abt on the subject so guess i have to do some explaination. got this idea rite now, heh.....<br><br>There's these function from a temple below my flat now, u know, those u normally see during 7th lunar mnth....... where they took out something for pple to bid, and a MC will stand on the stage shouting ' $400 $400 $400 going once, going twice .......*oh that lady in the corner, $430 ....$430 ....' and so on lar......<br><br>Just curious to know, how many of u all or yr relative actually took part in all this events? Frankly speaking , i find that its incredible that no matter how expensive the thing is, there will always be some1 to buy it.<br><br>For e.g, the price of 2 big sweep tickets can have a starting price of $50.<br><br>Or a children BMX cost $300 plus sometime.<br><br>Or some 'fa-gao' (Cake make from egg n flour) can go up to $50, where u can get it for $2 in the market.<br><br>or some (good luck) black charcoal 'wu-jin' can go up to thousands of dollars' ....... can't even eat or use them.<br><br>Just curious, how come pple are so willing to spend on these things when the amount they pay can get much better things ..... or what's the most expensive bid u ever saw? Or where these money goes to eventually?i just find it kinda incredible.......<br><br>Well just wanna seeu pple's view ..... cos i still can't believe that some pple will fight over 10 cent if overcharge, but there's pple who r willing to buy something that's 10 times more expensive. Well..... hopefully  they will end soon cos i need some peace~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to attend such occasions as well once a year. It is interesting to see how the prices skyrocketed especially for objects like charcoal(black gold to them), rice containers, coin deposit boxes and all. Mainly most pple bid believing that it will bring good luck and fortune.<br>Yes part of the moeny goes to charity and the best part is that all the products are donated. Some people even bid for the items and after getting it, give it back up for auction which means that they are paying for nothing. The tradition also goes that how much in total you bid this year will imply how many seats you get at the same occasion next year. My area has something like every $100 you bid this year gives you a seat at the table next year.<br>I go mainly for the food since I got no $$$ to bid anyway but the waiting is always very long between dishes. Until the last dish or so, there will be very few people left and I can eat to my heart's content especially the dessert. *heehee*</div>
