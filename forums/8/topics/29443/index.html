            <div class='col-md body'>for this discussion, we will limit to sg women with americans (since they seem to be more common here ) .<br><br>i have seen some sg chinese women with ang mohs hand holding. and with children in tow at supermarkets b4. and it it seemingly getting more and more common in the society that is getting more liberal ( correct word or not ) . my parents have a rather conservative mindset, therefore forbiding my sis and I not to marrying angmohs....<br><br>so what's yr take ? u can include anything on asian men with angmoh women.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think recent newspaper got report on something along this line. Well the usual reasons women gave is angmo more communicative, open, caring and know how to do things to please those women etc etc. Local men all cannot make it lor. Wake up, work, home, TV, sleep -&gt; repeat routine kinda boring to them women.<br><br>So we can see a trend while local women go for angmo, we local men hunt for ladies (foreign talent) from Msia, Vietnam etc. Hmmm..tit for tat situation or it is just a logical phenonmenon going around?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When love happens, it does not matter what skin color you are??  I agree causcasians are more open in their feelings than our asian men because of our upbringing and conservative culture.  But seriously, dating amd marrying men of other races does not really matter as long as both are really in love.</div>

Just another couple on the street (except that they tend to produce really good looking offspring. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">)<br><br>But that is as long as the woman doesn't has some phoney accent when they never lived abroad in their whole life. (living with an angmoh in  spore does NOT constitute living abroad 'vicarously'.)<br><br>Or when they act like they have been brainwashed by pauline hanson.<br><br>but men 'buying' chinese/vietnamese brides..that's another story.
