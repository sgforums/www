            <div class='col-md body'>rinoa,<br><br>don't get me wrong. i concur with you. my point is although personality is paramount for many, for many others beauty IS the most important thing.<br><br>another point i was trying to make is that beauty counts for opportunities to meet the opposite sex. if there are two girls with the same personality and intelligence but one drop dead gorgeous and one drop dead ugly, which do you think will elicit the most attention? granted that if some bloke were to take the time to get to know the drop dead ugly girl he may be pleasantly surprised but can you blame guys for trying with the beautiful one first?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terence<br>Well,of cos to some extreme cases where if there is a choice of a handsome guy with great intellect over an ugly guy with intellect, I will too choice the outstanding one. But the problem is do u have the capability to retain the heart of the latter? I do believe ppl of this calibre will have an unusual high expectation of their partner-to-be. So it all voice down to the conclusion, if both of u are compatible...rather then just want the person as it is.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its undeniable that beauty is what attract us. Even 2 girls, we will try to talk to the the prettier one. What i'm trying to say is physical attraction is what makes us take the first step. Then whether can anything proceeds from there depends on the character.<br><br>That doesn't mean that less physically attractive ppl will not be able to find any bf/gf. Not attractive ppl with a nice personality is like a diamond or gem covered by mud. It is harder to discover the gem but it will be discovered eventually by those who take the effort to remov the mud or in the other words by ppl who looks beyond looks.</div>

These nuances might be a major distinction of what guys categorised woman as " beautiful"...<br>More intellectual woman prefer to talk to men which shares the same interests and topics. To them, a pretty face is a plus but man of similar wavelength is an attribute.<br><br>As for beautiful woman who go for the likes as in the shadow of thyself, is normally for short term relationships.

            <div class='col-md body'>rinoa,<br><br>you are practising the same bias-ness most men are accused of. how do you know there is a major distinction between what intellectual women look for and what men look for? can you speak for every woman and man?<br><br>and if the intellectual woman values similar wave length over a pretty face, why do you think the intellectual man doesn't?<br><br>also, why do you assume the intellectual woman will necessarily value wave length over looks? being intellectual has nothing to do with sensitivity or the desire for a vibrant personality? you may be a tad bit guilty of generalising.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>lastly, as for women attracted to good-looks: there is nothing to suggest that they change bfriends like they do clothes. all i'm saying is that goodlooks equally attract the same amount of attention from the opposite sex.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good looks attract more attention, but good character retains the attention.<br><br>Some observations I made:<br>- Girls/Guys who are just normal looking can attract lots of pple from the opposite sex if they can talk about anything under the sun. People like to look for them coz it's fun to chat wif them<br><br>- But also realise that guys wouldn't really mind the character of the girl if she looks good. Some guys get overwhelmed by good looks alone. So if the character of the girl is not that horrible, good looks help.<br><br>- Girls get attracted to good looking guys, will ooh and aah over them, but once they get to know them, if the guy cannot present themselves well/does not talk intelligently/no good character, girls will lose the attraction they had for them<br><br>actually not to bad to have a slightly plump bf/gf...they'll be nice to hug!!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>terence,<br>This is only my point of views not trying to say every woman are like that of course!!Anyhow, that is only my humble opinion. If you beg to differ from my opinions, there is nothing I can say.<br><br>Alex...<br>It is quite hard for me to define what is nice but I will not be basing of my standards so it is fair. I will see if you can be a bf of their expectations...but if you want to know some wannababes, then sorry !Cos,my frens are really nice and simple..and to me that is a form of virtue too...and I dun want them to get hurt in forms of all sorts. I believe they won't mind knowing a nice fren... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
