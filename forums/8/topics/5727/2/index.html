(think i commented on this b4)  however, every individual's opinion on wat good looks mean may differ.

            <div class='col-md body'>Fey, thanks for your flattering 'potential' remark, but to be honest, i'm too lazy to realise this 'potential'.<br><br>besides, and this brings another dimension to the topic, looking for 'potential' or the ability to make it big strikes me as somewhat calculative. i know women who do this as well. Fey man, what do you think? i see it as women judging a man on what he can offer in the future, as opposed to the kind of man he is NOW. what if for some reason he doesn't fulfil the 'potential'? is she gonna dump him since her going out with him was based on this initial requisite?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 19 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terence, I believe that the girls are not going out solely with the guys on the "initial prerequisites" alone. Guess having the potential to make it big in the future is one of the enticing factors for such females.<br>If in the long run, the guy really does not fulfill all the expectations of him, as long as the relationship has been good all the way, probably the girl will not just dump him  unless she is really that materialistic and does not appreciate the years of happy r/ship she had with the guy.</div>

They want to find someone simple, easy going and comfortable to be with.

It's always easy to forgive someone who is more pretty when they made mistake, right ?  Sometime your urgly look give people an excuse to find fault with you.

            <div class='col-md body'>I will answer a definite "YES". Looks does matter to ALMOST everyone.. matter of to what degree and how much it will influence the person. To some it matters, but it doesn't affect his/her decision in choosing a partner much. To some, die die also want a hunk or chio bu.<br><br>About size, well, depends on individual. (Not much help but it's true  :p) Some ppl see nice bod and can throw the face away.. "Cover the face, find the base..." Or whatever other way it is coined... some see face can throw the figure away.. so see what u like lor.<br><br>In the end, character matters most.

            <div class='col-md body'>Fey,<br><br>i agree with you on the whole. these girls you refer to hook on guys with 'potential' because it promises them a type of lifestyle - be it security, highflying or prestige or whatever.<br><br>this is why i'm never judgemental of guys who only go for beautiful girls because women do their mental calculations too upon meeting a guy. of course some women would argue that they look for personality, character blah blah blah, but i don't believe they do not weigh everything a guy has to offer to see if he can provide or usher her into a prospective future. women do this mental calculation at sometime or another during the relationship and i don't think its wrong - just like i don't think its wrong for a guy to go out with a woman only because she is beautiful for the same reasons the woman goes out with a man with 'potential'.</div>
