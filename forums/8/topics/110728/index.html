            <div class='col-md body'>1.  Have never tried programming, but from what I hear, it's not good in Singapore.  Perhaps, it's good in the States, don't know.<br><br>2.  Almost zero of what I studied got applied at work.  But, the ideas are there, I mean the basic understanding.<br><br>3.  What is lacking is that education only focuses on programming, as if it's the one and only type of IT-related work.  In reality, so many jobs are non-programming.  What is useful?  A little bit of everything, to give the students a feel of the different parts in IT.<br><br>4.  Advice?  Same advice, I gave someone else here ... never ever, "just take" the first job.  More often that none, the first job is the one you're stuck with (or related).  Otherwise, if you decide to switch, the next pay cheque is gonna hurt bad.  Of course, if money is a concern, then try your best to choose the one you think is gonna be good.  Another advice, speak to a few in the industry.  Why a few and not just one?  Cause IT is so diversified.</div>
