I know that what I am going to say sounds cruel, but I am also telling myself the same thing every time when I dream of my ex, and woke up, scorned by the harsh reality that she is gone, feeling sad and depressed that I am still in the same position.<br><br>The pain which you are experiencing will be get lesser and lesser as time goes by. The amout of tears will decrease with time until one day, you realize that you can live on your own again or perhaps with another man who would come to your life. The person that you are once in love with is gone, and you are alive, and so live!!!<br><br>I know that it is hard to do that.. *patpat* and after those harsh words, I can tell you that I understand how you feel..

Believe me, you will survive like the many others who survived. They have been through worst. But I am not comparing, as always the case, no one is worser than anybody, as love cannot be measured. But I am just assuring you that, you are not the only one. I too have been through it, if you read about my post. And I am alive and kicking here. I can understand your doubt if I were to tell you that I left my house and check into a hotel and stayed there for 2 days and did not come out just to think things over. But hey, things are not that bad. I would advise you to talk to many people about this. And I meant really many, not just over the internet or something like that, it will be better if you are talking to someone in person. It works for a lot of people I have dealt with.(BTW I work with the psy unit for a uniform group now while I am serving NS.) This process is to help you understand that if you can just say it out, it seriously ain't that bad. Also I urge you to go back to your normal lifestlye as soon as possible if you have not done so already, to go back to normal is simply to be what you were b4 the incident! Understand? Hope you understand me.<br><br>Well, if need somemore help, I will try my best, mail me too, if prodigal is not enough for you to pour your woes.*laffs*<br><br>littlecallan@pacific.net.sg<br><br>Just my $0.02 worth.</div>

For you to be so sad the relationship probably brought you some happiness. Why seek to forget all of that?<br><br>So it didn't work out. Shit happens. You can try accepting that as part of your life, something that you encountered in your existence which made parts of it fun.<br>It might hurt the next time you think of it, but it becomes easier after sometime.

And yes, I think I should help to enlighten.<br><br>sparkle:<br>Perhaps I would be in a better position to speak in if I've the background knowledge of the problems you and your ex are facing before the eventual breakup.<br><br>But nevertheless, I'll still post something; hopefully it helps, though it would be pretty repetitive as I think I've written it before.<br><br>Firstly, I think you should question yourself why are you crying? Are you crying for him or crying for yourself?<br>Whether he's worth it or not is not the question. Whether you loved him is.<br><br>If you loved him, but you two go on separate ways because both of you are incompatible because of so and so reasons, then why are you crying? If this is a better ending, you should be happy that you stopped a tragedy from happening.<br><br>Sometimes, people met their right partner, but at the wrong time. They might be too young, too naive, too immature. Or perhaps there are other obstacles to cross. Some need to learn how to treasure by feeling the pain of a precious loss. Some need to understand how to care and love. Others might need to overcome the obstacles separately before meeting each other again.<br>If this is your case, be patient. It will hurt him(if he loves you) to see you in such state. Perhaps both your understanding of each other isn't that deep yet. Use this opportunity to discover more of each other, and more of the world. Use this independent period to enrich yourself with valuable experiences.<br><br>But remember, never engage in self-pity.<br><br>I will not give you my email address. But if you wish to talk to the ocean, you can meet in #sgcafe. Just let me know the time, I'll try to make it.<br><br>Take care.<br><br>[This message has been edited by ocean (edited 29 January 2000).]</div>

I guess previously, I didn't want to worry anybody, so at home, I would just try to act as though I'm ok, and only hide in my room to cry by myself. But yesterday, I broke down in front of my mummy...and somehow, I feel much better after that. I really hope that this feeling will last, and it's  not just a one or two day kind of thing. I did not cry today.<br><br>Bishamon:<br>Thanks for the invitation..but I guess I won't be joining u pple coz today I just went shopping for 8 hours!
