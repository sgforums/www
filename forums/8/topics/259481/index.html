            <div class='col-md body'>i played at ochid country club and at discovery centre.names are tag paintball and crossfire paintball respectively.prices are such<br>tagpaintball: to enter or whatever i think its 15 or 25.paintballs are 250 for 1000.after u but 1000 it becomes 200 for 1000 balls.<br><br>crossfirepaintball : enter i dont know how much but its 15 for one magazine (20paintballs) or 20 for 2 magazines...may seem like its alot more expensive but crossfire is more of a 1 shot 1 kill situation when its tactical and tag is more "meng" where u shoot more to cover your teammates while they run to get the objectives<br><br>Shant give out further information dont wanna be spoiler  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>HAVE FUN!!<br><br>EDIT: personally i find tag paintball more fun..more excitement as more balls are flying overhead...crossfire u run from cover to cover so yeah..btw for the fun to begin u must hav brave teammates who dare to move up..those i had were so scared they stayed behind and did nothing</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>paintball is like running around with water-like pipes shooting mini balloons at each other. the range of a paintball marker(notice the word "gun" is rarely used in paintball jargons, as you well see later) is very much limited and thus restricts the size of the field playable.<br><br>the gears painballers don are generally colorful and tournamentish looking, which in the eyes of mil-sim fans such as airsofters, an attempt to break away from the misconception of war-loving violent atmosphere(very untrue) which mil-sim players tend to potray to the unfortunate opinion of the general public . to some extend, some newbie paintballers think the same as the former.<br><br>believe it or not, paintball first started out as a tool for marking trees in plantation(can't remember as to why but you can read that up if you're interested). it later became popular and thus heavily marketed as an "extreme sport", which explains the flashy gears and markers so as to mould it into a more accepting sport.<br><br>it's a sad thing airsoft is still illegal in singapore(apart from some clubs which are springing up but still, it's only IPSC at best and you must store your guns in an armoury, which of course they will charge u, not the mention the already high cost of the gun itself). it's a hugely potential niche market and if it ever becomes an open market, paintball might very well face extinction albeit some hardcore fans will remain loyal to their beloved sport. this is what is happening in Hong Kong.</div>
