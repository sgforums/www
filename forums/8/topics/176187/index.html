That was precisely the reason why I pick SP. SP brand name is unbeatable.

You just go to the respective poly websites to read their course structure. Alternatively, go to their open house next year.<br><br>ACCA is a professional accounting body, well-known worldwide. Most of their courses last for about one year or so, some more, depending on which course you took. I am not sure if you can apply for a course directly after your O Levels. Besides, you don't even take POA, that probably lowers your chance of getting in.<br><br>One very good source to know more about these courses is every Monday Classified Ads. There is a section on education, whereby the schools will advertise their courses. Go check them out. Usually around page 10 of the Classified Ads.</div>
