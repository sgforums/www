            <div class='col-md body'>For business courses, SMU &gt; NTU &gt; NUS. That's what being make known to us. SMU for its 100% employment for its business graduates and quite high starting pay. NTU for its recognitions by don't know what associations or whatever. Never heard anything good about NUS except for its brand name.<br><br>As for the NTU hostel issue, NTU guarantees all freshmen a hostel slot. So, do not worry of not able to get a hostel. But a point to note, it's only for the freshmen, after the 1st year, whether you can secure a slot depends on some credit system.<br><br>Not relevant to this topic, can someone answer my questions on the A Level sticky topic?
