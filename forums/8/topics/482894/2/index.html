              today went tampines courts megastore, since bad experience at courts jurong pointbut today made a trip to megastore but turned out sama sama again lah. was at level 1 looking at electric oven with a friend, within the electric oven area its left and right rows of electric ovens and there was a staff attending to 2 customers, so total in the lane 5 of us. then my friend was looking at electric oven and i surfed net on smartphone, then i noticed suddenly 2 courts staff a male and female standing right at the end of the lane, guy senang diri and female eyes floating around, again same feeling they were watching us closely, i immediately walked toward her and when she made eye contact, quickly zoomed off, the guy still standing there looking straight. i told my friend leave. few years back in jurong point courts also the same, i was looking at some printer inks, and a blue polo shirt courts staff walked outside courts and moved toward the lane i was in took a peekd at me and then walked down to escalator, think i dont knwo he is wearing blue courts staff meh siao. also only in courts megastore, they have more promoters then staff, and the staff is wearing brown beige colour with an A sign besides their short sleeve and the have a base salary so you will see they wont chiong towards you harass you to buy but those blue colour shirt are promoters, earn most of their pay from selling items so they will chiong towards you force you pay and hope you dont use smartphone to compare prices. dont let them think for you or you end up pay high price. in tampines mall also the same, the courts staff will watch at you until you leave or harass you to buy and think for you.
              
              to sum up once you enter courts store, you stand to lose. why? because their male and female staff will always treat you as thief first until you buy then you become customers, regardless of how your wear unless you are ang moh la as they treat white men better like the same in orchard road. then their tactics is to stand at one end of a lane looking at you and if you approach them why they keep staring at you to treat you as potential thief, their standard reply is: oh no la we thought watnt to standy here to serve you immediately if you need help, but if such a case then they should come forward and ask if we need help and not standing faraway watching you. what a stupid and lame excuse. then if you never buy they cant make commission but the male and female staff have already oggled at your boyfriend or girlfriend, husband or wife enough liao loh thats why they stand faraway at one end of the lane mah. 
              
              go goh ah bee or kong tai buy, trick is if courts online price has a sale price, its the same sale price in store so you can call goh ah bee or kong tai to compare price no need go to courts anymore, if there is no sale price in courts online, there maybe a sale price in courts store but experience has proven that goh ah bee and kong tai and other shops hae already knew the price as its public anyone can check out so they will also undercut courts in store sale price so no need go court store also. just go courts online check model and price and call goh ah bee or kong tai or others easily and simple, no need go out, goh ah bee will just send to your house and you pay them on spot, no need even go to goh ah bee pay deposit. 
              
              for furniture, go to the brand you like their own showroom. but you definitely need a staf to guide you along and you ask intelligent questions sound the staff out about price and product knowledge to gain experience no need to buy, but you can walk around also no one will harass or watch  you carefully because furniture to big to steal man. 
              
              courts sg better wise up, learn from the passive staff behavior from ikea, popular bookstore, times bookshop, cold storage, if you ask then they respond if not they leave you alone totally in your own dream world, ntuc fairprice cannot  as they employ many ex-police uncle they will prey and track you one by one every minute - why fairprice no money install sensor and sticker on all items meh haiz.

              changi point not a good place to shop, very bad experience. gain city at changi point, was there searching for mitsubishi electric yet the male chinese staff with specs point to me the exact location, only later i found out they also have mitsubishi, guess he is in charge of promoting mitsubishi heavy aircon so other brands he got no commission, but such sales behavior sucks leh gain city managment should know how to train up such poor judgement staff man. he cant even explain whats the difference between the 2 almost same brands. a check online by me shows they are actually a keiretsu, same group but different subsidiary, mit electric is more in consumer and mit heacy as the name suggest more toward industry, as simple as that, gain city staff better wake up and please polish up your english language too dont bring in too much dialect hokkien accent shows your kar nar lan only.
              
              changi point ajisen put menu with price outs for customers to check and compare yet they have 2 aunty staff stand there not serving yet use hokkien to ridicule customers checking price not eating, what a fuck man think young people cant understand hokkien meh, my friend immediately retorted back using hokkien and went to eggs and berry spend $100 to prove ajisen not worth such an amount with poor staff attitudes and behaviors, aunty next time want to use hokkien or your own dialect, please go home use dont insult your self like kar nar lan.

              <p>Well, I do not think this is applicable to shopping malls in Jurong.</p>
              <p>Previously, Jurong had only Jurong Point. Now, there is JCube, JEM, Westgate and Bigbox. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">With three new shopping malls already opened and one new shopping mall opening soon, the shopping experience in Jurong is becoming more exciting as there is now competition among the shopping malls in Jurong, unlike previously when Jurong Point was kind of a monopoly here.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Meanwhile, at Jurong Point, things are becoming more interesting, as JP upgrades itself to be on par with the new shopping malls and remain attractive in the increasingly competitive shopping scene here.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">As someone who goes to Jurong Point almost every week, I have witnessed how Jurong Point was affected whenever a new shopping centre opens.</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">JCube only affected Jurong Point in its first few weeks of opening, probably because people want to check it out, and the crowding level at JP was just as high subsequently. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">JEM almost affected Jurong Point big time, as it has more shops and more brands, but the impact was greatly reduced with the negative news reports on JEM. Similar to JCube, the crowding level at JP was reduced only in the first few weeks when JEM opened.</span></li>
              <li>Westgate, on the other hand, is a big rival to Jurong Point, and has been affecting the crowding level at JP ever since it opened. </li>
              </ul>
              <div>The opening of Westgate seems to have triggered Jurong Point to renovate and improve itself to make it a better shopping mall. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">There has been many additions and alterations at Jurong Point recently. For instance, the floor spaces at the second and third storeys of JP1 were expanded, and the "marketplace" area of JP2 was revamped and given some china theme. Right now, there are some works ongoing at JP2 basement one and level one, and JP1 level one. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">With so many changes happening at Jurong Point, I would say that Jurong Point is actually becoming more interesting, instead of getting boring.</span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In short, the shopping malls in Jurong are actually becoming more exciting and interesting now, instead of getting boring. </div>

              <p>not sure why. I only started online shopping about 3 years back. Perhaps I was a little worried regarding the online situation.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I am quite comfortable now buying stuffs. Most expensive was a watch which was &gt;$400</p>
