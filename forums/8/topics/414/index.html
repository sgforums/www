            <div class='col-md body'>Guys,<br>this may sound untrue, but believe me, it is the truth.<br>I was on my way to my poly that morning and the bus was so damn crowded cos it is every morning as it was the only bus stop from the interchange to the 2 polys.<br>Many ppl crowds this bus stop every morning. When i got up the bus,everyone was rushing to it cos the previous one had already been gone since 20 mins ago and everyone in my poly was trying to get up this bus as no one wants to be late. I was quite lucky to have just squeezed in the boarding steps at the front entrance of the bus. Ther was this pretty lady who was also making her way up and was able to just make it behind me. As soon as the next stop was reached, few ppl got off and we finally get to shift up a bit as the driver shouted at the back passengers to accomodate space for those in front. I was finally pushed up off the steps and my right hand was still stretching out &amp; holding on firmly to ther side railing. The girl was also shifted up but as she was in an awkward position and she had nothing to hold on to, she had no choice but to hold on to the railing i am holding whivh already has a lot of hands on it and incidentally, both her breasts was touching and resting on my stretched right forearm. I was shocked at this as I never expected this to happen as most girls tend to be super sensitive and would try all ways to 'siam' this and get her tits in a better protected position. But to my surprise, she did not mind at all and the rest of the journey till our poly was all the way like that.I still remembered vaguely that at times when the bus was jerking(stopped abruptly at red lights &amp; continuing at green lights &amp; stopping to let passengers off), her breasts would also move accordingly, constantly pressing against my forearm. Wow, the feeling was just great. There was even one time where my elbow was jsut at the tip of her left nipple, i think...<br>Truthfully, I also made full use of this chance by constantly moving my forearms up and down stroking her boobs in the of cos slightest moments lah...<br></div>
