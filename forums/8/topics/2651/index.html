            <div class='col-md body'>yes, the god that be has finally given his reply. So i gathered the thread have been moved to a more "adult" content page. Great, would u mind telling me the criteria u set???<br>For example, it is ok to comment on transsexual vis-a-vis  "Why do some people like to crossdress?" and it is fine to to tok about gays vis-a-vis  "Gays and Women in the Military" BUT it is not ok to tok about the oldest profession in the world?!?!!?<br>Do tell me the logic here...as i have mentioned, there is no vulgarity in the "removed" thread and nor is the content too risque, WHY is the thread removed?!?!!<br><br>There are alot of ppl unsatisfied with this ruling and would it be possible for the gods to be to explain further their rationale behind this action?<br><br>To John:<br>i agree that topics about masturbation and blow jobs do test the boundary of good taste. However, it would be going abit too far to say sex stinks and and prostitution sucks. Man perspire and stink, sex do not per se sinks and prostitute does indulge in oral sex while the industry itself does not.<br>Catch the drift of my argument and ur rhetorics???<br>By the way, ur thread prompt immense laughter from my stomach but i shall refrain from flooding this thread with hahaha.Me lowlife is better than some ranting fool.

            <div class='col-md body'>There are times that things do have to be decided by arbitration. It is simply not possible to list out every single criteria to do certain actions. An attempt to list out the rules will be commendable and promotes transparency but an attempt to cover EVERY scenerio will likely result in either (1) over broad rules that stifles creativity or (2)too specific rules that can be circumvated with some effort.<br>I guess the current situation is that the moderators(as reflected in their title) have the ability to decide how to treat each thread.

There was absolutely no reference to where the best chicks is and where the best whore house is.

They are more risque and vulgar, not to mentioned graphic. Where was ur voice then(???)in condemning them and those who post the tread.

It's still here, and the avid viewers of such topics will know where to find them.  As for the censorship, I believe if a P6 kid were to say "whore" in the class, not even aiming it at anyone, the teachers will feel compelled to send the kid to the counselling session.  Words like whore-house shouldn't be seen by young ones, don't you agree?<br><br>and don't argue with john wong, he's actually writing a parody because many of us here have lambasted him with something like that before =)<br><br></div></blockquote>sigh, maya, listen to my story.<br>I was kidding around with F&amp;U and pokemon in the irc when this topic came out. They joked about me being a part time pimp and stuff like that and our dear horny bastard pokemon posted that thread. Me pop in and try to provide some humourous ancedents to this issue. The next thing i know, it "disappear" from the main!<br>Well, hence the posting of this thread. I can understand the condemnation if i wrote in full graphic details where and what is the best chicks in town. But i DID not!!! I can't understand why worst posting than mine escaped the sissors while my one was chopped off to some deserted island.<br>u have read the whole thing i presume, the whore thread. Is my writings really too muuch??? Apart from the title, (Some ppl have posted more titillating titles) i can't see anything wrong with my article. Sigh, since it is now in the Adults section, i shall stop my arguments now<br><br>Sorry for wasting u guys time by such outbursts from moi here. Enjoyed the rest of the posting in the forum and have a nice day.<br><br>"All writing is essentially bricks of plagarism secured in place<br>by the mortar of original thinking."<br>--William Dukane<br><br>------------------<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>
