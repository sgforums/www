Such population movements often increased nutritional and physical problems and disease, they said.<br><br>"The number of people adversely affected by El Nino-related weather events over three decades, worldwide, appears to have increased greatly," it said, referring to the weather pattern caused by warming of the Pacific Ocean off South America.<br><br>The review called for research to identify groups vulnerable to climate change and said health concerns should be included in international policy debates about global warming.<br><br>"Recognition of widespread health risks should widen these debates beyond the already important considerations of economic disruption," they said.<br><br></div>
