'fang ker wei zu' is the term in chinese. what hospitality should they expect?<br><br>your best bet now is to treat your SG friends with sincerity because they're not blind. when you turn out to be different from their negative perception, you not only win them over for yourself but your race also<br><br><img src="http://membres.lycos.fr/cedbrain/gifs_animes/donnie_yen.gif"></div></blockquote>Eurasians favoured for exec &amp; professional posts? That's incredible. Singapore always prided itself in meritocracy, rubbishing KL govt's affirmative action. And such blatant double standards exist in our midst. WTF!</div>
