            <div class='col-md body'>3 times, i guess.<br><br>1st time was in 1999, coming back from school. alighted from the busstop, about to cross the junction. it was still a red man, and the cars were still driving, and all of a sudden i crossed the road without thinking. the only thing that crossed my mind was that it was rather wierd, because the bus was blocking my view and i couldnt see the cars behind it, and i thought that it seemed extremly stupid, but i still crossed anyway. fortunately i didn't get hit...even though there were alot of cars on the road. right after i crossed the road it just hit me all of a sudden what i was doing. several drivers driving by me also scolded me in their actions.<br><br>2nd time was less than a month later. exact same thing, same junction and even same direction, but fortunately my sister stopped me the moment i put my foot on the ground to cross. god know what would have happened if she wasnt there.<br><br>3rd time was in 2001, my father asked me and my sister to help him carry some stuff dowm to his car. anyway, the moment we stepped out of the hdb flat a window from the 8th floor came falling down right next to me and my sister. i have no idea how, but it barely missed us by less than 10cm. i was standing beside it while my sister was standing behind it. up to now i still have no idea why we were walking in such an odd position when we were carrying it... *sigh* suffered a few minor splinters from the shattered glass, but nothing serious.</div>
