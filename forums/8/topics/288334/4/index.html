            <div class='col-md body'>yes, I always go out alone. Even if I go out with friends, I will still spend time doing things alone. I go town , I go clubbing alone, I go jogging alone, I go rollerblading in East Coast park alone.<br><br>I go out alone and I make friends along the way. I go clubbing alone, and I make friends with guys and girls over there.  I always become the 1st 1 to dance at the dance floor, showing to guys how whimpy they are, and very often the girls in a group surround me and dance with me.<br><br>I go rollerblading , I go alone and chat up and make new friends at the park.<br><br>The problem with lonely people is they always need people around to make them feel at ease.<br><br>The man of aloneness rarely feel lonely, because they simply feel good about himself and he choose to be alone not because he cannot find friends.<br><br>Are you an Eagle who fly alone? or are you sheep in a pack?<br><br>So guys, if you want to feel the power in you, learn to go out alone and feel good and people start to follow you and come to you instead.<br><br>Even when you want to chat up girls, it's better to be alone and do it alone.<br><br>I wrote a post to my blog<br><br>Here  it is..<br><br>Desperation and Loneliness<br>Understanding Loneliness.<br><br>If you want to attract more girls and have a sense of Male Power back to youself, 1st learn to be alone and be happy with it.<br><br>An eagle will not cry loneliness. Only Sheep will live in a flock.<br><br>Are you an eagle alone ,mysterious and proud of it? Or are you a sheep who got lost from the pack?<br><br>Remember, a girl can smell you out. It is inside your heart and soul.<br><br>Desperation for companion will not solve the loneliness in you. You are depending on someone to make you feel good. You have to learn to love yourself 1st, without needing a girl before you able to give love. After you can love yourself for being yourself and feeling good to be with your ownself, then you can give love to a girl or Girls.<br><br>People who seems to be alone most of their time rarely feel lonely. This is because they feel good about themselves and their lives.<br><br>In contrast, many other people who are usually surrounded by people who care about them,a loving partner, family and friends- are desperately lonely and unhappy.<br><br>The initial starting point for guys, who are confident and love themselves and those guys who are desperate are different.<br><br>Desperate guys mind will go.." Shit leh.. no girlfriend leh, friends got girlfriends so good, I alone leh.. very sianz"<br><br>Confident Guys who choose to be alone most of their time , their mind will be " Let me see... which girls life are feeling lonely now.. wish to express their sensually yet no one appreciate them? Let me be the one to give them love and alsot make them feel hot and sexy.."<br><br></div>
