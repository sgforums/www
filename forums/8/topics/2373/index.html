            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, i agree thaqt sometimes what your parents say may not be what you want to hear. They might be unreasonable.. wicked or plain downright silly at times with their actions and antics. We dread their incessant drowning, nagging.. constant advice on our counterparts, be it their behaviour, dressing, or just 'kan bu shun yan'.<br><br>On the other hand, they did 'ate' more salt then we ate rice. They saw more than us. So, what they say might not be all wrong. A fire starts not by itself. There must be something that fuels it. So instead of just one ear in, one ear out, why not take a little time to listen to your parents, and think through what they say. You may not agree, but that's fine, what they say is not for you to accept them all, they just want you to take this alternative view and gove it a second thought.<br><br>Most parents, i would assume love their kids, am i not right? So why not just give them a chance?<br><br>------------------<br><strong>I consider myself an Expert tomato gardener since all of my friends tell me I have the most colourful and sweetest tomatoes.</strong></div>

This spills over to relationships.<br><br>Young people are forced to study fer grades, work for money.. etc..etc.. So this is how the criterias come out.

This thing in e past would be a norm.<br><br>How bout this? Nowadays when u goto orchard road or somewhere in the crowded urban area.<br>Try taking a poll or survey in the teenagers there. How many relationships do they have so far? chances are it's more than 1 and possibly juz a bit less than 10! and their ages could range from 13 to 19? changing steads could be as easy as changing clothes! But try telling that to our (supposedly) more conservative pple of the past. they'll be scoff and amazed by our 'idle' commitment.<br><br>thus both generations' thinking and actions cannot really be compared and relied on completely!<br><br>If ur parents one day knows that u'll dating an ex-convict. chances are that they would advice u not to and say bad things bout that guy/gal. Would u becoz of their one-sided opinions ditch tat ex-convict gal/guy? If u do, then i believe that u r not fitted to be involve in any BGR coz u'll only be living in ur parents' shadow where first impression counts more than the substance in that person.<br>U should noe that person more than ur parents do and ultimately the decision shld always lie in u! i dun mind discarding ur parents advice altogether but do consider them and make a logical decision; dun live in the past ancient age where they oways say," parents have e final say when it comes to deciding a child's other partner!" ney!!!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well...I guess it's hard to make a straight forward decision. Alot of people are wishy washy...dun we see it everywhere. I mean, the front of your palm is your flesh, the back of your palm also your flesh. Maybe it's always easy to say we'll listen to our parents cos we love them, wanna be filial to them or we can say we'll follow our heart and stick by our love...but easier said than done. How many people can really forsake their families for their love? Some like only sons in the family...can they really strink their responsibility towards their parents...but to ask them to give up their love...hmmm...tough decision.<br>I'm considered fortunate as my bf and I are both A level graduates and have the same goals in life and though both of us can't make it into the local university though we passed our A levels, we are both pursuing higher education through private universities. And our parents approved of us too. My parents even loan their car to him whenever they are not using it. He got to drive my dad's BMW home when he went overseas with my mom. While his parents always invite me to their family dinners and to his auntie's house. His mom will also make my fave food.<br>But I try not to take such things for granted. For those who do not get the approval of their partner's parents, they must work hard to 'boot lick' them. Like I will buy mooncakes for his family during lantern festival, queue up and buy 'BBQ meat' from Chinatown for Chinese New Year and give his parents, give them respect, be polite to them and let them know that you'll take good care of their son/daughter...then I guess, they'll feel more assured in putting their son/daughter in your hands. For me, I got the chance to prove to his parents that I could take care of him cos when he was hospitalized due to asthma, I travelled to the hospital everyday and stayed there to look after him from morning till night. I travelled all the way to Changi Hospital when I actually stayed in the West side. I guess, to earn approval from your partner's parents is not that easy too.<br>I dun have a really close knitted family so if I really need to choose, I can definitely say I'll choose my love. Now, he is my everything. We are working hard for our future. But for those with a closely knitted family, this decision on love or family will be a tough choice.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FireIce:</div><div class="quote_body">why cant there be a straightforward answer?<br>it is either u continue to be with ur love and explain to ur parents u want zi you lian ai, or have a clean cut and hide back under ur mommy's feathers...<br>dun tell me u want to drag both sides and in the end bu huan er san?<br><br>no doubt tt parents have sort of "been thru it" b4 and definietly could offer some advice..but no one else knows better wat u urself and ur partner wants...<br><br>a rship is dang ju zhe qing...pang guan zhe are too objective(and biased) and under influence of past generations' thinkings..<br><br>men dang hu dui this thing belongs to pre-republic of china...<br>fu mu zhi ming, mei shuo zhi yan is way way rusty oredi...<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Buying goodies on special occasions of cos is something like 'boot licking' them...cos you wanna get them to like you. Buying things for them means caring for them meh? Caring for them would mean something else for me. Like when my bf's father was sick, I even bought lunch for his dad...that is caring for him. But New Year time is a time to boot lick everyone! Including my own parents! Hehe..<br>Sense of security and happiness...the meaning is quite subjective and based on personal views. Some may think money gives security and happiness. For me and my bf, our own happiness is not enough...and as the only son (though he has two sisters), it is his responsibility to be filial to his parents and to have both sides' parent's blessing in our relationship is very important cos that gives us a big sense of security. Imagine if one side's parents object, and we need to secretly go pak toh...does that gives us any security? If our parents are not happy, do you think we will be happy? His first relationship failed becos his ex-gf's (who is his first gf and I'm his second lah) mom objected to their relationship and even phoned his mom to warn him not to see her daughter anymore. He was under a lot of pressure and hence, the relationship came to an end...which is why, to him, parent's approval is very important and I understand that he is very family type of people so I need to work hard to gain his folk's approval mah. I think alot of people need to learn to respect the elderly...that is the most basic. They may be grumpy and may not like you...but the least you can do is bear with it...at least for the sake of your partner, do bear with it and be respectful. I'm sure you won't want them to quarrel or break ties with his/her family becos of you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Zeraph:</div><div class="quote_body">waaah<br>the way u say it is as though u purposely go and booot lick them, not because u care about them lehhh~<br>heheheh<br>aiyarh, you got this kind of relationship, as long as you are happy can liao right?<br>i guess sometimes we look for happiness as well as a sense of security, i think these two are the main factors deciding a relationship...<br>waddya think?</div></blockquote>[This message has been edited by Twiggie (edited 28 November 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some mothers very possessive one. I used to have a colleague (when I was part timing), she say when her son first got a gf, she very not used to it. When her son got married, she even wanted to follow them on their honeymoon. But now she say she got out of it liao lah. Though her son now stay near the in-laws' house, she is contented that her son goes to her house once a week for dinner. She also got along better with her daughter-in-law.
