            <div class='col-md body'>I like to read Bookworms Short Stories in my primary school days .<br><br>And this chinese newsletter , Zhi SHi Bao or something like that.. that comes every week. The chinese teacher will tell students to order and then they will distribute to us one. Got contest to join also but the prize is terrible : a ball-point pen<br><br>And also I like to play on the recorder. We will learn it during music lessons one. The high notes were ok. But I always have problems blowing the lower notes as my fingers were short<br><br>Then my primary school days session will alterate every year one . I think Primary 1 , 3 , 5 on afternoon. 2, 4, 6 in the morning. Afternoon session is cool coz I will go to school early to play before going for the afternoon sessions.<br><br>I like to sing those songs i learn in school one. Let me recall... Think got one song about this spider one.. must sing and do action using your hands to imagine the spider crawling. And those National days songs  - Five Star Arising , Chan Mali Chan.. etc<br><br>Well .. those are my thoughts....</div>

You will squat by a drain with all your classmates beside<br>you, and brush your teeth with a coloured mug.The teachers said you must<br>brush each side 10 times too.<br><br>3. You know what SBC stands for.<br><br>4. You pay 40 cents for Chocolate or Strawberry MILK every week in class.<br><br>5. You watch a very popular Malay dubbed Japanese drama on RTM1 about<br>schoolgirls who possess powerful skills in volleyball called Meoro Attack.<br><br>6. You find your friends with pagers and handphone cool in Secondary<br>school.<br><br>7. SBS buses used to be non-airconditioned. The bus seats are made of wood<br>and the cushion is red. The big red bell gives a loud BEEEP! when pressed.<br>There are colourful tickets forTIBS buses.The conductor will check for<br>tickets by using a machine which punches a hole in the ticket.<br><br>8. Envelopes given to us to donate to Sharity Elephant every Children's<br>Day<br><br>9. You've probably read Young Generation magazine.You know who's Vinny the little vampire and Acai the constable.<br><br>10. You were there when they first introduced MRT here. You went for the<br>first ride with your parents and you would kneel on the seat to see the<br>scenery.<br><br>11. Movie tickets used to cost only $3.50.<br><br>12. Gals are fascinated by Strawberry Short Cake and Barbie Dolls.<br><br>13. You learn to laugh like The Count in Sesame Street.<br><br>14. You longed to buy tibits called Kaka(20 cents per pack),and Ding<br>Dang(50 cents per box), that had a toy in it and it changes every week not<br>forgetting the 15 cents animal crackers and the ring pop, where the<br>lollipop is the diamond on the ring.<br><br>15. You watched TV2(also known as Channel 10) cartoons because Channel 5<br>never had enough cartoons for you.<br><br>16. Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, The Three Investigators, Famous Five and<br>Secret Seven are probably the thickest story books you ever thought you<br>have read. Even Sweet Valley High and Malory Towers.<br><br>17. KFC used to be a high class restaurant that serve food in plates and<br>let you use metal forks and knives.<br><br>18. The most vulgar thing you said was asshole and idiot and THE MOST<br>EXTREME WAS 'super white'...you just couldn't bring yourself to say the<br>hokkien relative.<br><br>19. Catching was the IN thing and twist as the magic word.<br><br>20. Your English workbooks was made of some damn poor quality paper that<br>was smooth and yellow.<br><br>21. CDIS were your bestfriend.<br><br>22. The only computer lessons in school involved funny pixellised<br>characters in 16 colours walking about trying to teach you maths.<br><br>23. Waterbottles were slinged around your neck and a must everywhere you<br>go.<br><br>24. Boys loved to play soccer with small plastic balls in the basketball<br>court.<br><br>25.

We carry out experiments of our own to get ourself badges for being a<br>Young Zoologist/Botanist etc.<br><br>29. Every children's day and national day you either get pins or penswith<br>'HappyChildren's Day 1993' or dumbfiles with Happy National Day1994'.<br><br>30. In Primary six you had to play buddy for the younger kids like big<br>sister and brother.<br><br>31. We wear BM2000, BATA, or Pallas shoes.<br><br>32. Your form teacher taught you maths,science and english.<br><br>33. The worksheets were made of brown rough paper of poor quality.<br><br>34. You went to school in slippers and a raincoat when it rained, and you<br>find a dry spot in the school to sit down, dry your feet, and wear your<br>dry and warm socks and shoes.<br><br>35. School dismissal time was normally around 1 pm.<br><br>36. There would be spelling tests and mental sums to do almost everyday.<br><br>37. Your friends considered you lucky and rich if your parents gave you $3<br>or more for pocket money everyday.<br><br>38. You see Wee Kim Wee's face in the school hall.<br><br>39. You freak out when the teacher tells you to line up according to<br>height and hold hands with the corresponding boy or girl.<br><br>40. Boys like to catch fighting spiders.<br><br>41. Collecting and battling erasers was a pastime for boys<br><br>42. Autograph books were loaded with "Best Wishes", "Forget Me Not", and<br>small poems like "Bird fly high, hard to catch.Friend like you, hard to<br>forget".<br><br>43. Class monitors and prefects loved to say "You talk somemore, I write<br>your name ah!"<br><br>44. There were at least 40 people in one class.<br><br>45. Large, colourful schoolbags were carried.<br><br>46. You brought every single book to school, even though there was one<br>thing called the timetable.<br></div>

You longed to buy tibits called Kaka(20 cents per pack),and Ding<br>Dang(50 cents per box), that had a toy in it and it changes every week not<br>forgetting the 15 cents animal crackers and the ring pop, where the<br>lollipop is the diamond on the ring.<br><br>15. You watched TV2(also known as Channel 10) cartoons because Channel 5<br>never had enough cartoons for you.<br><br>16. Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, The Three Investigators, Famous Five and<br>Secret Seven are probably the thickest story books you ever thought you<br>have read. Even Sweet Valley High and Malory Towers.<br><br>17. KFC used to be a high class restaurant that serve food in plates and<br>let you use metal forks and knives.<br><br>18. The most vulgar thing you said was asshole and idiot and THE MOST<br>EXTREME WAS 'super white'...you just couldn't bring yourself to say the<br>hokkien relative.<br><br>19. Catching was the IN thing and twist as the magic word.<br><br>20. Your English workbooks was made of some damn poor quality paper that<br>was smooth and yellow.<br><br>21. CDIS were your bestfriend.<br><br>22. The only computer lessons in school involved funny pixellised<br>characters in 16 colours walking about trying to teach you maths.<br><br>23. Waterbottles were slinged around your neck and a must everywhere you<br>go.<br><br>24. Boys loved to play soccer with small plastic balls in the basketball<br>court.<br><br>25. Teng-teng, batu lesung, chapteh, hentam bola and zero point were all<br>the rage with the girls and boys too...<br><br>26. Science was fun with the balsam and the angsana being the most<br>important plants of our lives, guppies and swordtail being the most<br>important fish.<br><br>27. Who can forget Ahmad, Bala, Sumei and John, eternalized in our minds<br>from the textbooks. Even Mr Wally &amp; Mr. Yakki. What abt Miss Lala??? And<br>Zaki and Tini in Malay Textbooks?<br><br>28. We carry out experiments of our own to get ourself badges for being a<br>Young Zoologist/Botanist etc.<br><br>29. Every children's day and national day you either get pins or penswith<br>'HappyChildren's Day 1993' or dumbfiles with Happy National Day1994'.<br><br>30. In Primary six you had to play buddy for the younger kids like big<br>sister and brother.<br><br>31. We wear BM2000, BATA, or Pallas shoes.<br><br>32. Your form teacher taught you maths,science and english.<br><br>33. The worksheets were made of brown rough paper of poor quality.<br><br>34. You went to school in slippers and a raincoat when it rained, and you<br>find a dry spot in the school to sit down, dry your feet, and wear your<br>dry and warm socks and shoes.<br><br>35. School dismissal time was normally around 1 pm.<br><br>36. There would be spelling tests and mental sums to do almost everyday.<br><br>37. Your friends considered you lucky and rich if your parents gave you $3<br>or more for pocket money everyday.<br><br>38. You see Wee Kim Wee's face in the school hall.<br><br>39. You freak out when the teacher tells you to line up according to<br>height and hold hands with the corresponding boy or girl.<br><br>40. Boys like to catch fighting spiders.<br><br>41. Collecting and battling erasers was a pastime for boys<br><br>42. Autograph books were loaded with "Best Wishes", "Forget Me Not", and<br>small poems like "Bird fly high, hard to catch.Friend like you, hard to<br>forget".<br><br>43. Class monitors and prefects loved to say "You talk somemore, I write<br>your name ah!"<br><br>44. There were at least 40 people in one class.<br><br>45. Large, colourful schoolbags were carried.<br><br>46. You brought every single book to school, even though there was one<br>thing called the timetable.<br></div></blockquote>That time handphone and pager not popular yet... cos they were as big as bricks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
