            <div class='col-md body'>It wasn't too bad a movie for that time.  I remember the best fighter from the Korean side was a "one-eyed Jack" (had a patch covering an eye).  And I remembered the first part of his final fight, where he cheated.....he hopped forward and used his rear hand to give a short hook to his opponent's face/eye or something like that.<br><br>From my limited knowledge, there are only two ways to get shows:<br><br>(1) Get it from the shops (you've tried this already).<br>(2) Get it from overseas on-line (usually they'll mail it t you).<br><br>Since (1) is a dead end to you, you have no other choice but to try (2).  If you don't have a credit card, can't you borrow from your parents or relatives or boy/girl-friend or something?  If you offer to pay them up front once the order is made on-line, it should be OK right?<br><br>Or the guys at the movie forum will know of other ways to get old movies which we aren't aware of.
