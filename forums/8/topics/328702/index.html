              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">You perceive the world with
              particular attention to humanity. You focus on what’s in front of you
              (the foreground) and how that fits into the larger picture. You are
              also particularly drawn towards the shapes around you. Because of the
              value you place on humanity, you tend to seek out other people and get
              energized by being around others. You like to deal directly with
              whatever comes your way without dealing with speculating possibilities
              or outcomes you can’t control. You are in tune with all that is around
              you and understand your life as part of a larger whole. You prefer a
              structured environment within which to live and you like things to be
              predictable.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">You perceive the world with particular attention to humanity. You focus on the hidden treasures of life (the background) and how that fits into the larger picture. You are also particularly drawn towards the shapes around you. Because of the value you place on humanity, you tend to seek out other people and get energized by being around others. You like to ponder ideas and imagine the many possibilities of your life without worrying about the details or specifics. You are in tune with all that is around you and understand your life as part of a larger whole. You prefer a structured environment within which to live and you like things to be predictable.</p>

              <p class="raw-score">You perceive the world with particular attention to nature. You focus on what's in front of you (the foreground) and how that is affected by the details of life. You are also particularly drawn towards the shapes around you. Because of the value you place on nature, you tend to find comfort in more subdued settings and find energy in solitude. You like to deal directly with whatever comes your way without dealing with speculating possibilities or outcomes you can't control. You are highly focused on specific goals or tasks and find meaning in life by pursuing those goals. You prefer a structured environment within which to live and you like things to be predictable.</p>
