If me, i confirm get nightmare every night for th rest of my lfie...<br><br>And yes, what's disappointing is also the lack of apathy from singaporeans. Did they bother to Push the "stop train button"? Or did anyone even went to the Passenger Control and tell the authorities that someone is on the track? It might be too late but it would have been worth a try... Or at least better than standing watching him get killed... Or they could at least helped the fiancee pull the man up... Although that would have eben risky...<br><br>But seriously... What was he thinking going down to the tracks to get his shoe!!! Did he even check like how long more before the train arrives? Or did he just did it on impulse and jumped in... Only to realise that the train is approaching?<br><br>Oh well. This world never ceases to amuse me.<br><br>God bless the Fiancee and his family...

            <div class='col-md body'>I think not that people don't want to help, but maybe their thoughts were:<br><br>i)Wah, so hero, go down track pick shoe, act movie ah? aiyoh, don't get myself into camera and spoil their scene.<br><br>ii)what is this, some candid camera? don't siay suay myself by helping him.<br><br>Then accident happen, bam, too late, everyone stunned. Poor guy, I must say. But not to shift blame to just the passengers who stood around, where was the SMRT staff? If they're watching the survillenace(sp?), surely they must see the guy.<br><br>I pass by Buona Vista station a few times per week. The last time I pass by there, there was nobody inside the control station. Where were they? All drinking coffee?<br><br>Again, read news report. No recording of the incident was done. Hah, another wayang done by SMRT that backfired on them. Install camera for show. Oh yah, where are the "search my bag" personnel? I hardly see them nowadays. I await further news reports about this</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A few questions to be answer:<br><br>1) Where are and what are the staff doing inside the control room aka 'fish tank' at the time of incident? They supposed to be monitoring the cctv monitor.<br><br>2) What the h_e_ll the train driver ( 3060 magic number ) looking at? Was he reading newspaper or listening to his CD/MP3 player as I mentioned earlier in my replies.<br><br>3) Even if passengers hit the Emergency Stop Button, will not, I repeat again, WILL NOT stop the train. It will only stop the train from moving off once the train stops. So blame fully on those passengers who were there at the platform. And what the h_e_ll that malay woman doing? Why she didn't stop her bf from going down the tracks? So stupiG till you allowed your love ones to go die???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>call me unsympathetic, but the fiancee really deserved to be scolded.<br><br>i followed the report from lianhe zaobao. seemingly when this man decided that he want to retrieve the shoe, neither of them know whether how fast the train is going to arrive. this shoe is supposedly less than one yr old and one of this man's favourite.<br><br>when he decided tt he wants to retrieve it, she told him to go quickly because the train hasnt arrive yet.<br><br>she then said, after the accident, that there were many people standing at the platform (which i believe that was why they didnt realised of the train any earlier), and no body stopped the man from going down the tracks. if the fiancee herself feels it's ok for him to go down, how is it justified that later she said no one stopped the man.<br><br>and when he tried to climb back, she realised he was having some difficulties, so she shielded his head (hu4 zhe4 ta1 de4 tou2), and pulled his right arm in a attempt to assist man from climbing up.<br><br>if pulling at right arm, i'll naturely associate as she is using her left arm to pull at his right arm and using her right arm to shield his head.<br>which is very qi guai, cos why do you need to shield his head when you should be tugging at him with both hands? and why left hand?(ok, shall take it as she is a left-hander)...<br><br>ok, nvm, shall stop before i am branded as cruel.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i wonder whether the man looked at the tv monitor to see how long is the train going to arrive before going down. cos seriously, if one is to do such a dangerous stunt, it'll be common sense to first see the monitor and find out how much time he have right?<br><br>which brings me to a far-fetched but possible theory, maybe he did look at the monitor but the monitor is <span style="color: red;">showing some stupid advertisments instead of the arrival time of the train.</span> can that be one of the reason which contributed to his death?<br><br>cos think of this, the time for one to go down to the tracks, pick up his shoe takes no longer then 1 minute. i don't think anyone stupid enough after looking at the monitor and see the train arriving in a minute and is still stubborn enough to go down retrieve his shoe.<br><br>therefore i got this to say to SMRT.<br><span style="color: red;"><span class="large"><strong>"STOP PLAYING THOSE STUPID ADVERTISMENTS WHEN IT IS SUPPOSED TO SHOW US THE ARRIVAL TIME!"</strong></span></span><br><br></div>
