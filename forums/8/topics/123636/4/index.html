            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes there's a limit to how much the authorities can do. And in the period where we are trying to reduce the need for government support/intervention,this over-emphasis on improving/blaming the 'system' is ironic. What ever happened to personal responsibility? Shouldn't the guy know better than to go down the tracks? Shouldn't his future wife warn him not to do that? Shouldn't anyone who saw a guy going down the tracks, immediately press the emergency button/switch? Shouldn't the driver made sure the tracks was clear? People should be educated on what to do in these types of  situation but education too, has its limits. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to make his own choices. If we rely too much on the authorities to limit or make the choices for us, they will only be a crutch for a weakening society. A balance has to be made.</div>
