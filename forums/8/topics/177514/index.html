After that I can go to any private institute to study business for a degree (there are plently in the private institution such as AMPI etc...and you can get a degree within a short period of time)<br><br>My reason is that poly will provide me with knowledge on the know how (pratical aspect ). Business course may teach you how to run a business but the question will still be what kind of business.<br><br>a sec 2 student 2 cents worth of thought.<br></div>

After that, he went on a holiday in Hawaii. He was on the beach and he saw a man who could catch a few big fishes within a short time everyday.<br><br>This man would stop fishing after about 4 fishes and would pack up and go. So Paul decided to talk to this man. He asked the man why he would stop fishing after about 4 fishes. The man said that he would bring home 2 fishes home for the family and sell the other 2 fishes at the market for money. After that he would look for his friends to play chess or buy some voldka for himself.<br><br>Paul decided to advise this man with his business skill. He told the man that he should catch more fishes to sell for more money. With the money, he could buy a boat so that he could catch even more fish. Then with the more money he could buy a fleet. He should also set up a fish stall to sell the fish himself to do away with the middle man. With the even more money, he could start a coldroom to keep all the fishes. He could also start a factory to process the fish and make even more money. Then after that he can retire.<br><br>So the man asked Paul what he would do after he retire. Paul said that after he retire, he could just look for his friends to play chess or buy some voldka for himself. The man asked Paul how long it will take before he can retire and do the above,  Paul estimate that it would take about 20 years.<br><br>The man than told Pual " Am I not doing that now?"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
