"EH BROTHER WANT BUY SHIRT?"<br><br>they should totally change their sales tactics, it puts me off.</div></blockquote>yaya, they like to say this. And their tactic is forced selling if u notice. They like 3somes i guess because there will always be at least 2 staff, sometimes 3 to serve one customer esp when theres only one customer in the shop . 3 person serve one !!They will just keep on bullshitting bout their shirts without u even having a chance to browse peacefully. Think bout that. The 3 of them will rotate pulling out shirts from the rack and show it to the already stressed and pressurised customer. Judgin from the replies to this thread, there must be a lot of bad experiences from this renowned shopn at Far East. And i dun we can just lodge a complain to CASE just like that, we need to be a member or sth. Stomping them is the best way to expose them !!!</div>

Anyway, its very ez to find out who he is.

Just looking at them makes u want to do sth to them, but then think again, they have the guts to beat up customer already, it wouldnt be surprising if any of us here r the next one.

If u really get beaten, my advice is to bring down your close friends and beat the shit out of them. What u need is manpower, not strength to deal with those humpty dumpties.<br>I was told that the police were called in, creating a scene that invited many onlookers. But still nothing seems to happen to the shop ppl.

Sucky salesperson. Far East plaza really sucks. If anyone noticed this shop ' Mobile Soft', read the board above their second hand mobiles on the display. Sucky way to do business.
