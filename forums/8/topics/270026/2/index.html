            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I had the same experience at the shop.<br><br>After trying on some tops and deciding not to buy, they guailan by saying "I thought money's not a problem?" and "what a waste of time"<br><br>Hmmm of course money's not a problem, I just wouldn't spend in on your fucking 40 dollar tshirts that dont even fit well.<br><br>they were lucky my friends were in another shop. Or else...<br><br>But in the end, I had a good experience in another shop in the FEP. So it took my mind off this shop.</div>

Theres 2 plump guys in the shop in their early 30s and their wife or what i dunno and some other staff. There was once back in march or april this year, they actually beat up a customer ,and its 3 men against one poor chap and the police came. dunno what happen after that but i heard from my friends who worked in far east that their selling tactics r outta this world. Once, my friend went in and browsed tru some of the tees. then one of the plump guy asked him, "hey got bring $$$ a not ?"  how will u feel if u in my friend's position ? Lucily my friend being smart replied by saying Yes i do and i have enuff to buy over your shop and they said gd buy more then. thats not all. Another friend of mine went in and he was somehow forced to try on one one of the tees which he did reluctantly, because their faces very fierce he told me. B4 he could even take a look in the mirrorm, the staff said 'wah damn nice' sure kana girls one. Then he changed back to his own tee. when he slide open the curtain the plump man went to take the tee he tried and put into their carrier bag and get ready for my friend to pay. ALL THIS WHEN MY FRIEND DIDNT EVEN SAY HE'S GETTING IT !!!.in the end, the plump man LL take out the tee from the bag and put back on the rack. CHAMPION THIS SHOP REALLY GROOVE DESIGNS. they occupy a big shop next to this sneaker shop in far east. if u don't believe me, u can go ahead and be the next victim. Check out the groove design experience.</div>

Its like you need to freakin' make <span style="font-style: italic;">them</span> speak to you in order to ask about their products. Like the people running Image 2001, LeftFoot and Parallel for example. They are nice folks but I had to start the conversation instead of what you people say, getting hounded by them. Anyways, I'd still shop there cuz its still the best place to get the coolest, most unique and rarest fashion products.</div>

They are just going tru the motion and if there r ppl who walk pass the shop they will signal to the guy to come in.and there r some poor ones who fall for their trap only to come out feeling regretful most of the time.Sometimes while waiting for my colleague, i purposely stood one side and observed them and i realised that they keep rolling the same shirt haha. unless they really roll and unroll the very same piece. Extremely Lame. I always go to far east to have my meals and will see them doing this esp. when theres not much crowd. If im not wrong, the boss used to have a stall at heeren b4 selling some skate products. Anyone know bout it ?</div>
