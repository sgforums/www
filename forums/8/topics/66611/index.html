            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Barry recounts how action his new yearÂ’s party was in his imaginary diaryÂ…</span><br><br>Gaylord of the Rings: The Return of the Kinky<br><br>24 December 2003 (Wednesday) Â– The festive season is here again, and it is party time. The phone rang. It was Â‘The FellowshipÂ’, a secretive brotherhood and it is time for its annual reunion. A shiver ran down my spine. A Fellowship party is like no other party. There are parties and there are parties.<br><br>I wore my favourite costume; it was pink and had netting and feathers. I also stuck a diamond through my right ear. Dear wife wore trousers, and carried a whip. She looked real manly.<br><br>When we reached the party venue, the regulars instantly recognized me. Â“Hello, Gaylord,Â” they purred to me. Â“Hello sir!Â” they saluted dear wife.<br><br>Wacko Jacko had already arrived. As in all previous year, he brought along a boy.<br><br>Went into the house. Passed the home theatre room and saw that the were screening a movie Â“Fellatio of the RingÂ”. There were two hobbits watching, arm-in-arm. Hobbits in Singapore? I went forward for a closer look. It was Frodo Wong in his costumer. And as usual, his gardener was with him. These two are inseparable. In reply to gay rumours, Frodo WongÂ’s excuse was that he needs his gardener for karaoke sessions because Wong canÂ’t sing. Two short arses, I thought to myself.<br><br>Walked out of that room and accidentally went into a wrong room. Steve was there, with what looked like an Indonesian maid. Steve was in the buff and holding a camera. The maid was in her bra. Just refreshing my photography skills, Mr. Chia explained.<br><br>Heard women screaming in another room. Peeped in. There was a Hen party going on. A man had climbed out of a birthday cake and was performing a strip tease, to the delight of the birthday girl and all the Women In White (WIW). He wore a white surgeonÂ’s clothes and was peeling them off piece by piece. The women were stuffing dollar bills into HenÂ’s g-string. Well, Eng Hen deserves it, I thought to myself, as he claimed that he took a severe pay cut to give up a surgeonÂ’s career to enter politics.<br><br>Finally reached my destination: a secret passageway that led into a secret room. This is the secret meeting place of the Kinkys, a place for those that love to screw people in the arse, or who loves being screwed. Membership has jumped this year.<br><br>There was masturbator Woo Eng Wan. He was chasing a female doctor round the room. Â“Examine me. Check my semen,Â” he was pleading with her. Over at the sofa, Whanker Aiyar was trying to undress an obviously drunk TV presenter who kept saying: Â‘Take me home.Â” Or did I hear just: Â“Take me!Â”<br><br>Marlboro Tan was being teased mercilessly by a team of eleven girls wearing soccer boots and nothing else. Â“Shoot! You canÂ’t shoot! You canÂ’t score!Â” they teased.<br><br>There was White Wizard Gandalf Tony Tan. He was banging away at a female Navy officer who kept screaming: Â“Steer left! Steer left!Â” There was Health MiniSAR Hairdo Lim. He was doing it to a nurse, Japanese AV-style. He was muttering to himself: Â“Make babiesÂ…make more babies.Â”<br><br>There was Rear Admiral Dunking Teo doing it bukakke style. He was trying to drown his commando officer in his cum.<br><br>There was also Acting Mini-star for Health Cow Boo Wan. He was into bestiality, and was humping a cow. Obviously he is not afraid of mad cow disease. He was not the only one. Over in another corner, Cedric Fool was licking the arse of a white horse.<br><br>And there was Swee Say, the pretty boy. He was just dancing about on the bar top and pleasuring himself. Transport Mini-star Gostan Yeo really loves it from the reverse. He had a train driver and a bus driver taking turns to drive into him from the reverse. Â‘Forward-reverse-forward-reverseÂ’ they went.<br><br>When they all saw me, they all collectively moaned: Â“HelloÂ…ooohÂ….GaylordÂ”. Please carry on, I said. What a Â“re-unionÂ”, I thought to myself.<br><br>I went over to the corner where two women were waiting for me. Â“Hi D,Â” I said to one of them, who was deliciously pregnant. Â“Good job about your other half. That must have been a real Kodak moment for him.Â”<br><br>Â“YouÂ’re welcome. ThereÂ’s nothing I would not do for an old flame,Â” D purred.<br><br>ThereÂ’s one more thing you can do for me, I told D. Can I have your maid?</div>
