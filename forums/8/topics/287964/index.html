            <div class='col-md body'>1. Every person has cancer cells in the body. These cancer cells do not show up in the standard tests until they have multiplied to a few billion.When doctors tell cancer patients that there are no more cancer cells in their bodies after treatment, it just means the tests are unable to detect the cancer cells because they have not reached the detectable size.<br><br>2. Cancer cells occur between 6 to more than 10 times in a person's lifetime.<br><br>3. When the person's immune system is strong the cancer cells will be destroyed and prevented from multiplying and forming tumours.<br><br>4. When a person has cancer it indicates the person has multiple nutritional deficiencies. These could be due to genetic, environmental, food and lifestyle factors.<br><br>5. To overcome the multiple nutritional deficiencies, changing diet and including supplements will strengthen the immune system.<br><br>6. Chemotherapy involves poisoning the rapidly-growing cancer cells and also destroys rapidly-growing healthy cells in the bone marrow,gastro-intestinaltract etc, and can cause organ damage, like liver, kidneys, heart, lungs etc.<br><br>7. Radiation while destroying cancer cells also burns, scars and damages healthy cells, tissues and organs.<br><br>8. Initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiation will often reduce tumour size. However prolonged use of chemotherapy and radiation do not result in more tumour destruction.<br><br>9. When the body has too much toxic burden from chemotherapy and radiation the immune system is either compromised or destroyed, hence the person can succumb to various kinds of infections and complications.<br><br>10. Chemotherapy and radiation can cause cancer cells to mutate and become resistant and difficult to destroy. Surgery can also cause cancer cells to spread to other sites.<br><br>11. An effective way to battle cancer is to starve the cancer cells by not feeding it with the foods it needs to multiply.<br><br>CANCER CELLS FEED ON:<br>a. Sugar is a cancer-feeder. By cutting off sugar it cuts off one important food supply to the cancer cells. Sugar substitutes like NutraSweet, Equal,Spoonful, etc are made with Aspartame and it is harmful. A better natural substitute would be MÃ¤nuka honey or molasses but only in very small amounts.Table salt has a chemical added to make it white in colour. Better alternative is Bragg's aminos or sea salt.<br><br>b. Milk causes the body to produce mucus, especially in the gastro-intestinal tract. Cancer feeds on mucus. By cutting off milk and substituting with unsweetened Soya milk cancer cells are being starved.<br><br>c. Cancer cells thrive in an acid environment. A meat-based diet is acidic and Meat also contains live stock antibiotics, growth hormones and parasites,which are all harmful, especially to people with cancer.<br><br>d. A diet made of 80% fresh vegetables and juice, whole grains, seeds,nuts and a little fruits help put the body into an alkaline environment. About20% can be from cooked food including beans.<br><br>Fresh vegetable juices provide live enzymes that are easily absorbed and reach down to cellular levels within 15 minutes to nourish and enhance growth of healthy cells. To obtain live enzymes for building healthy cells try and drink fresh vegetable juice (most vegetables including beansprouts)and eat some raw vegetables 2 or 3 times a day. Enzymes are destroyed at temperatures of 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).<br><br>e. Avoid coffee, tea, and chocolate, which have high caffeine. Green tea is a better alternative and has cancer-fighting properties. Water-best to drink purified water, or filtered, to avoid known toxins and heavy metals in tap water. Distilled water is acidic, avoid it.<br><br>12. Meat protein is difficult to digest and requires a lot of digestive enzymes. Undigested meat remaining in the intestines become putrefied and leads to more toxic build-up.<br><br>13. Cancer cell walls have a tough protein covering. By refraining from or eating less meat it frees more enzymes to attack the protein walls of cancer cells and allows the body's killer cells to destroy the cancer cells.<br><br>14. Some supplements build up the immune system (IP6, Flor-ssence,Essiac,anti-oxidants, vitamins, minerals, EFAs etc.) to enable the body's own killer cells to destroy cancer cells. Other supplements like vitamin E are known to cause apoptosis, or programmed cell death, the body's normal method of disposing of damaged, unwanted, or unneeded cells.<br><br>15. Cancer is a disease of the mind, body, and spirit. A proactive and positive spirit will help the cancer warrior be a survivor. Anger,unforgiveness and bitterness put the body into a stressful and acidic environment. Learn to have a loving and forgiving spirit. Learn to relax and enjoy life.<br><br>16. Cancer cells cannot thrive in an oxygenated environment. Exercising daily, and deep breathing help to get more oxygen down to the cellular level. Oxygen therapy is another means employed to destroy cancer cells.<br><br>(PLEASE FORWARD IT TO PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hate posts that present well known things and try to spin them to be something shocking and scary..<br>A lot may be true but without scientific background it's like one of those documentrys where they've quoted half a sentence when the rest of it is 'it's not...'... i've added some explanations where I can.<br><br>First of all may I say that a 'cancer cell' is merely a cell where the allele to control reproduction has been turned off, damaged or is not present - in themselves they are not dangerous it is when they multiply out of control creating more cells with constant reproduction, producing a cancerous <strong>tumour</strong> that they become dangerous because they take the place of useful cells.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by phantom010436:<br><strong>1.

These could be due to genetic, environmental, food and lifestyle factors.<br><br><span style="color: red;">bs. cancer has numerous causes that can be random mutation and radiation, neither of these are caused by deficiencies. please understand what cancer is before trying to be like those annoying mothers who only buy organic in the assumption it'll stop cancer</span><br><br>5. To overcome the multiple nutritional deficiencies, changing diet and including supplements will strengthen the immune system.<br><br><span style="color: red;">A large number of said supplements have found to be carcinogenic in large quantities, even just two or three pills a day for some. if you're gonna try and prevent anything by keeping your immune system healthy the best way is always to keep a balanced, healthy diet. if you do you don't need supplements unless your body is unable to produce enough of vitamins such as vitamin D which are actively produced by our bodies as well as in our diets</span><br><br>6. Chemotherapy involves poisoning the rapidly-growing cancer cells and also destroys rapidly-growing healthy cells in the bone marrow,gastro-intestinaltract etc, and can cause organ damage, like liver, kidneys, heart, lungs etc.<br><br><span style="color: red;">no shit sherlock... you pump a drug cocktail into anyone you're gonna have issues... it's a case of the benefits outweighing the side effects... </span><br><br>7.

When the body has too much toxic burden from chemotherapy and radiation the immune system is either compromised or destroyed, hence the person can succumb to various kinds of infections and complications.<br><br><span style="color: red;">And also hence treatments are done in cycles and not constantly... the medical society, shockingly are well aware of that too...</span><br><br>10. Chemotherapy and radiation can cause cancer cells to mutate and become resistant and difficult to destroy. Surgery can also cause cancer cells to spread to other sites.<br><br><span style="color: red;">resisting radiation? do i need to go into how radiotherapy works? if someone shot you lots do you think you'd start being able to catch the bullets? they can become resistant to certain drugs like all diseases which is why chemotherapy is a mixture of different drugs, and different mixtures can be used should there be problems.

I'm not even gonna bother. Tap water is often acidic however... just a random thing for you there lol</span><br><br>12. Meat protein is difficult to digest and requires a lot of digestive enzymes. Undigested meat remaining in the intestines become putrefied and leads to more toxic build-up.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Which relates to cancer... how? it makes your farts smell bad...</span><br><br>13. Cancer cell walls have a tough protein covering. By refraining from or eating less meat it frees more enzymes to attack the protein walls of cancer cells and allows the body's killer cells to destroy the cancer cells.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Ok, cancer cells have cell walls now? Let me take you back to first year biology... plant cells and viruses have cell walls, cancer cells are human cells, they do not have cell walls...</span><br><br>14. Some supplements build up the immune system (IP6, Flor-ssence,Essiac,anti-oxidants, vitamins, minerals, EFAs etc.) to enable the body's own killer cells to destroy cancer cells. Other supplements like vitamin E are known to cause apoptosis, or programmed cell death, the body's normal method of disposing of damaged, unwanted, or unneeded cells.<br><br>15. Cancer is a disease of the mind, body, and spirit. A proactive and positive spirit will help the cancer warrior be a survivor. Anger,unforgiveness and bitterness put the body into a stressful and acidic environment. Learn to have a loving and forgiving spirit. Learn to relax and enjoy life.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Oh give me a break... yes it has been shown that concious attitude can have an effect but please... be a bastard and you'll get cancer? I presume your doctorate was simply a change of name from Mr X to Mr Dr X?</span><br><br>16. Cancer cells cannot thrive in an oxygenated environment. Exercising daily, and deep breathing help to get more oxygen down to the cellular level. Oxygen therapy is another means employed to destroy cancer cells.<br><br><span style="color: red;">no cancer cells just love that choking co2  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ... and I've never heard of o2 therapy for it... if it is it'll be one of those bs alternative therapies with which you'd be better off on your knees praying... i'm not condemning all alternative therapies as some do have beneficial effects but... i'd like to see the research that claim is based on. either that or you've taken it completely out of context as to where tissue oxygen (not o2 therapy) is used as [b]part</span></strong> of one particular treatment.<br><br>(PLEASE FORWARD IT TO PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT)<br><span style="color: red;">Or a small African child will die *wipes tear away*</span><br>[/b]</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*shakes head* Some are partially correct, some not, for layman, it is actually quite an effective guide. Do not assume that it has no basis in it. It really does.<br><br>Cancer is a genetic disease. Cancer cells are cells that have uncontrolled, rapid proliferation, avoids apoptosis, promotes angiogenesis, invasive, resistant to extracellular signals and have the characteristics of being able to metastasize. A tumor can be benign or malignant. Malignant cells are cancer cells, and they are able to metastasize, that's why malignant cancer are deadly, but not benign tumors, if excised as soon as possible.<br><br><blockquote><br>Originally posted by phantom010436:<br>1. Every person has cancer cells in the body. These cancer cells do not show up in the standard tests until they have multiplied to a few billion.When doctors tell cancer patients that there are no more cancer cells in their bodies after treatment, it just means the tests are unable to detect the cancer cells because they have not reached the detectable size.<br><br><span style="color: green;">True. Every person has cancer-potential cells in the body, but usually these cells are arrested and undergoes apoptosis before they can become out of control. However, environmental triggers that alter the genetic construct of cancer-critical genes, such as the tumor suppressor gene p53, can lead to development of cancerous cells. </span><br><br>2. Cancer cells occur between 6 to more than 10 times in a person's lifetime.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Genetic damage are a norm. You get them everytime you are exposed to mutagenic substances, retroviral transductions, transposons translocation, ionizing radiation, even DNA replication can lead to genetic damage. But the cells have efficient repair mechanism for that, but no things are perfect. Cancer cells derived from an accumulation of genetic damage in the cancer-critical genes. </span><br><br>3. When the person's immune system is strong the cancer cells will be destroyed and prevented from multiplying and forming tumours.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Again, have to depends on whether the potential cells have activated its respective oncogenes, and deactivates its tumor suppressors. They mimic the likes of normal cells and normal CD8 T cells are not able to recognize them, if they can, why is there a prevalence of cancers then? Don't exactly agree with this, but generally the best protection one has against cancer-development is the cells themselves, if they have their genes screwed up,you're screwed as well. </span><br><br>4. When a person has cancer it indicates the person has multiple nutritional deficiencies. These could be due to genetic, environmental, food and lifestyle factors.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Not bullshit. When you lack of the required nutritions, your cell repair mechanism are impaired. Cancer is a genetic disease, if there is mutation, or replication errors, the cell repair mechanism is there to correct it. Without the required nutritions you're imapiring the cell repair mechanism, subsequently allowing the cell to get away with the genetic damage. </span><br><br>5. To overcome the multiple nutritional deficiencies, changing diet and including supplements will strengthen the immune system.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Good, keep this up. </span><br><br>6. Chemotherapy involves poisoning the rapidly-growing cancer cells and also destroys rapidly-growing healthy cells in the bone marrow,gastro-intestinaltract etc, and can cause organ damage, like liver, kidneys, heart, lungs etc.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Non-specific cytotoxic treatment. What to do? We are still not very advanced when it comes to cancer treatment...</span><br><br>7. Radiation while destroying cancer cells also burns, scars and damages healthy cells, tissues and organs.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Correct. Why the intergumentary system gets the worst blow? Because radiation comes from the outside and into your body through your skins. </span><br><br>8. Initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiation will often reduce tumour size. However prolonged use of chemotherapy and radiation do not result in more tumour destruction.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Symptomatic treatment are not the elixir for eliminating cancers. Which is why it is better to live healthily than thinking that the treatment can save you. </span><br><br>9. When the body has too much toxic burden from chemotherapy and radiation the immune system is either compromised or destroyed, hence the person can succumb to various kinds of infections and complications.<br><br><span style="color: green;">True. </span><br><br>10. Chemotherapy and radiation can cause cancer cells to mutate and become resistant and difficult to destroy. Surgery can also cause cancer cells to spread to other sites.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Explains why this post is here. Cancer is a problematic disease.</span><br><br>11. An effective way to battle cancer is to starve the cancer cells by not feeding it with the foods it needs to multiply.<br><br>CANCER CELLS FEED ON:<br>a. Sugar is a cancer-feeder. By cutting off sugar it cuts off one important food supply to the cancer cells. Sugar substitutes like NutraSweet, Equal,Spoonful, etc are made with Aspartame and it is harmful. A better natural substitute would be MÃ¤nuka honey or molasses but only in very small amounts.Table salt has a chemical added to make it white in colour. Better alternative is Bragg's aminos or sea salt.<br><br>b. Milk causes the body to produce mucus, especially in the gastro-intestinal tract. Cancer feeds on mucus. By cutting off milk and substituting with unsweetened Soya milk cancer cells are being starved.<br><br>c. Cancer cells thrive in an acid environment. A meat-based diet is acidic and Meat also contains live stock antibiotics, growth hormones and parasites,which are all harmful, especially to people with cancer.<br><br>d. A diet made of 80% fresh vegetables and juice, whole grains, seeds,nuts and a little fruits help put the body into an alkaline environment. About20% can be from cooked food including beans.<br><br>Fresh vegetable juices provide live enzymes that are easily absorbed and reach down to cellular levels within 15 minutes to nourish and enhance growth of healthy cells. To obtain live enzymes for building healthy cells try and drink fresh vegetable juice (most vegetables including beansprouts)and eat some raw vegetables 2 or 3 times a day. Enzymes are destroyed at temperatures of 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).<br><br>e. Avoid coffee, tea, and chocolate, which have high caffeine. Green tea is a better alternative and has cancer-fighting properties. Water-best to drink purified water, or filtered, to avoid known toxins and heavy metals in tap water. Distilled water is acidic, avoid it.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Not entirely sure about this, but on point c, specifically, acidic environment + red meat is indirectly the cause of gastrointestinal cancer. A metabolic byproduct of digesting meat in prevalent acidic condition is the nitrosamine, a carcinogen. </span><br><br>12. Meat protein is difficult to digest and requires a lot of digestive enzymes. Undigested meat remaining in the intestines become putrefied and leads to more toxic build-up.<br><br><span style="color: green;">No comments. </span><br><br>13. Cancer cell walls have a tough protein covering. By refraining from or eating less meat it frees more enzymes to attack the protein walls of cancer cells and allows the body's killer cells to destroy the cancer cells.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Enzymes are substrate specific. Enzymes digesting your meat are not the same enzymes that attacks the cell membranes. And what? This is too far-fetch. Not really true.</span><br><br>14. Some supplements build up the immune system (IP6, Flor-ssence,Essiac,anti-oxidants, vitamins, minerals, EFAs etc.) to enable the body's own killer cells to destroy cancer cells. Other supplements like vitamin E are known to cause apoptosis, or programmed cell death, the body's normal method of disposing of damaged, unwanted, or unneeded cells.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Keep a healthy body with a balance diet, with ample vitamins, minerals. </span><br><br>15. Cancer is a disease of the mind, body, and spirit. A proactive and positive spirit will help the cancer warrior be a survivor. Anger,unforgiveness and bitterness put the body into a stressful and acidic environment. Learn to have a loving and forgiving spirit. Learn to relax and enjoy life.<br><br><span style="color: green;">In some way, this is true. A stressful environment leads to death of normal cells and cancer cells take advantage of the lesser competition to garner more nutrients and proliferate more. Nobody wants that to happen.  </span><br><br>16. Cancer cells cannot thrive in an oxygenated environment. Exercising daily, and deep breathing help to get more oxygen down to the cellular level. Oxygen therapy is another means employed to destroy cancer cells.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Oxygen therapy in the form of oxidative stress? It is also non-specific cytotoxic treatment.</span><br><br>(PLEASE FORWARD IT TO PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT)<br>[/b]</blockquote>Take the facts with a pinch of salt, but do follow the fact that we need to keep ourselves healthy by regulating our diet and exercising more often.</div>
