            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361091"><br>Claudia Schiffer<br>She is everyone's favourite perennial supermodel. Spotted at a nightclub at a young age, Claudia is now an established supermodel. Maybe it's the hair, the lips or the never ending legs, whatever it is, she is very sexy.<br><br><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361090"><br>Kashmira Shah<br>She's got a damn good pair of legs and she makes sure that the world gets to see it and admire it, and we agree. We would love to see more of Kashmira in those swimsuits and itsy bitsy skirts.<br><br><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361089"><br>Nina Manuel<br>Aha! Legs. Talk about them and not have Nina Manuel in the list. The ramp simply loves her for it and so do we.<br><br><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361088"><br>Michelle Alves<br>A girl with brains is intriguing and a girl with great physical assets is hard to resist. Enter Michelle Alves, a gorgeous, worldly model whose brain power is almost as developed as her looks. At 5'11", Alves has the shape and stature of a typical supermodel. However, her piercing green eyes teamed with her silky hair and long slender legs have helped her stay at the top for many years.<br><br><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361086"><br>Elle MacPherson<br>One of the finest pair of legs in the world belongs to her. It would take us hours and hours to examine and check out those legs. An extended feature of this stunner, her legs stand out amongst the other features she has that we can't get enough off.<br><br><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361085"><br>Alessandra Ambrosio<br>She was part of the deluge of Brazilian models that took the fashion fraternity by storm after the path was paved by Gisele Bundchen. This , light-brown haired chick has done very prestigious assignments and ramp shows. Ambrosio walked the Victoria Secret runway for the first time in 2001 and has continued to be a fixture in subsequent shows. No need explaining why...<br><br><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361081"><br>Karolina Kurkova<br>This leggy blond from the Czech Republic is one of the few models who aren't just skin and bones. To compliment her assets would be stating the obvious. Just staring at her in one of the Victoria's Secret lingerie outfits is enough to induce bouts of rampant drooling. Czech mate!!<br><br><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361079"><br>Sushmita Sen<br>She started out in the modeling world with two long stick thin pair of legs which have gradually and thankfully filled out and are now a source of eye candy. Now whether in a mini or leather pants, Sush sure know how to flaunt those lethal legs.<br><br><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361076"><br>Christy Turlington<br>A household name, Christy is an exquisite example of innocent sensuality. It is almost a given that a model as well known as Christy would have an incredible body and shape. Her legs however are one of her finest features. Perfectly formed, her legs seem to go on and on and on...<br><br><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361073"><br>Deepal Shaw<br>They are not only long but they are sexy and she looks great as she shows them off in her tiny school uniform skirt. The producers of the video knew what Deepal had and they made sure the world got to see it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361069"><br>Julia Roberts<br>Better known for her 1000 wattage smile, Julia's legs have been neglected for quite a while. Well, not anymore. She probably has one of the best legs amongst actresses in her league. Let's just hope that unlike her armpits, she takes better care of those gorgeous legs.<br><br><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361066"><br>Shruti Sharma<br>If there was one thing everyone noticed about Shruti when she participated for the Femina Miss India contest, it was her legs. They just kept going and going, making her stand tall amongst the rest. But where are you now Shruti? We neither get to see you or those long assets of yours.<br><br><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361065"><br>Sheetal Malhar<br><br>Unfortunately Sheetal does not do movies, so we don't get to see them too often. But those occasional ads and photographs where she flaunts those amazing legs can last a lifetime. But it doesn't hurt to be a little more generous Sheetal...<br><br><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361064"><br>Milla Jovovich<br>This model/actress has created a large growing fan-base ever since she set foot into the industry. In the fashion world, where how you look is the prime basis of your longevity, we expect to see her for a long time. What do men love about her? Simply put, she is beautiful with or without makeup, which is something not all models can boast about.<br><br><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361063"><br>Vidya Malvade<br>Television has been good to this model while Bollywood still has to shower it's blessings on her. Vidya with her pretty face may still have a long way to go, but we are sure those sexy legs of hers will carry her far.<br><br><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361062"><br>Namrata Shirodkar<br>This ex-Miss India may not have had the same impact on the silver screen as she did on the ramp, but her legs sure did. The only sad part is that we see less of it nowadays. C'mon Namrata give us a treat once in a while.<br><br><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361061"><br>Cindy Crawford<br>She has set standards and raised bars for models all around the world. She remains as good looking as she did when she just joined the industry as a young girl. Now a wife and a mother, Cindy has been on the cover of more than 400 magazine covers! Maybe it our obsession with her mole and her legs, but if she wasn't this stunning she wouldn't have reached where she has today.<br><br><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361060"><br>Yukta Mookhey<br>When Yukta went for the Miss World contest, for once Indians felt proud that their beauty queen could stand head to head and shoulder to shoulder with the Venezuelans, Russians and the other tall babes. Here's saluting those long long legs of Yukta.<br><br><img src="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=1361058"><br>Laetitia Casta<br>It is almost impossible to ignore the physical specimen that is Laetitia Casta, and nearly improbable that any red-blooded male hasn't at one time or other drooled over Laetitia's considerable assets. This French beauty is in the middle of starting a family, and with a budding movie career, she seems to have gone into semi-retirement from appearing in the world's most prestigious publications.</div>
