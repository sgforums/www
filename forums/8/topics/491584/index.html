              <p>my friend and i have been selling tshirts on carousell for about 4 months to make a small profit and also so that we can keep some for ourselves. basically to spend money online shopping and selling them so we can break even on costs. pretty normal for anyone to do so, right? somemore carousell is a really simple mobile buy and sell platform.</p>
              <p>so we sell tumblr tshirts and band tshirts like metallica etc and only recently started selling branded tshirts. all shirts were purchased from the usual alibaba china website. </p>
              <p>what happened was that we received a letter from some big law firm representing this brand of company we had been selling tshirts with their logos on, claiming that we had been infringing trademarks! my friend and i are so stressed out because we do not know how to approach this situation and we know nothing about this. we simply wanted to shop, try, maybe sell a little just like any normal carouseller. </p>
              <p>so we have sold less than 10 pieces of that tshirt. so the letter claimed it was unoriginal. we called the guy and took the listing down immediately. the letter wants us to give up all pieces and claim we actually did infringe the brand? it also says we might be paying damage costs and legal fees? we  really do not have much money and we are just students. it is a really serious matter but my friend and i are 18 year old jc students and we do not know much about all this law stuff and trademarks. i really need some advice. please do help, thanks.</p>

              <p>iCounsel, an online legal advice portal allows residents to seek free
               legal advice simply through the added convenience of video 
              conferencing. It is the first of its kind for the community and a 
              collaboration between PA and Jamiyah Singapore. The pilot project was 
              launched at Kaki Bukit CC on 23 January 2015 and has been available at 
              both Eunos CC and Kaki Bukit CC since 24 Feb 2015.</p>
              <p>On top of being
               a online legal advice portal, iCounsel allows residents to choose their
               appointment, lawyer and language they are comfortable with. To use the 
              service, residents will need to use the special iCounsel Kiosks located 
              in the CC, which are equipped with a computer, a webcam, speaker and 
              microphone and a scanner to scan relevant documents if necessary.</p>
              <p>President
               of Jamiyah Singapore, Prof (Adj) Dr Mohd Hasbi Abu Bakar said “The 
              collaborative effort between PA and Jamiyah would make legal advice 
              service more convenient and accessible for individuals and families in 
              need. Jamiyah Singapore also hopes that with the added convenience 
              provided through iCounsel, more lawyers would also come forward to 
              provide their time to give back to the community.”</p>
              <p>Dr Kee Wei 
              Heong, JP, BBM, Adviser to Kaki Bukit GROs said, “Kaki Bukit is honoured
               to be one of the pilot sites to kick-start this new and exciting 
              initiative. To engage a lawyer for legal advice is expensive and by 
              having the online legal advice portal to complement the face-to-face 
              sessions that are already available, this would provide more avenues for
               residents to get the pro-bono legal advice required.</p>
              <p>The iCounsel
               virtual legal clinics will operate every second and fourth Tuesday, 
              7.30pm-9.30pm.Booking an appointment is a simple 3-step process:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Log on to <a href="http://icounsel.jamiyah.org.sg">http://icounsel.jamiyah.org.sg</a> and click on the "REGISTER" button</li>
              <li>Fill up all required fields in the iCounsel registration form</li>
              <li>Once
               the form is completed, scroll down to select an appointment date, 
              language, lawyer and whether a syariah-trained lawyer is required</li>
              <li>A
               notification email will be sent to clients upon successful 
              registration. Clients will also receive a reminder SMS three days before
               the appointment date at the CC.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Hi Jason, we can only imagine the burden of stress that you and your friend are going through right now man.. Its true that there are some brands which only allow retailers to sell their own stuff. Exclusive rights to sell the brand they might call it. But what makes it interesting for your case is how fast they clamped down on you... like in a matter of 4 months??Then what about the other shops like pasar malam, queensway and all selling so many brands of clothes?? Why havent they clamped down on them yet? Are you the only ones on Carousel selling this brands? Are there any other listings from other sellers who sell the same brands as you do?</p>
              <p>My point being, is that sometimes your competitors are trying to take you out by playing this kinda game. And their purpose is to put a stop to your business. Verify first.</p>
              <p>I'd check the legibility of this law firm before you or your friend commit to anything in writing(or verbal). Check out whether this law firm is legit; try https://www.lawsociety.org.sg/forPublic/FindaLawFirmLawyer/FindaLawFirm.aspx</p>
              <p>Share with us more once you're exhausted all the above. And we'll try to advise you on what to do next!</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
              <p>Patsy.</p>
