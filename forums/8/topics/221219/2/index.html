In fact, the mega-rich are usually very humble. It's only those who are slightly rich or have just recently become rich are proud and arrogant. Anyway, the sales people are always exposed to people with poos attitude and the ya-ya papayas. Handling these unpleasant people is all part and parcel of the sales job. Learn to take it with a large dose of humour and you'll be fine........ Been there, done that but cannot tahan so I'm no longer in that line.

Those who are damn arrogant usually are not really rich.. they just feel that they are richer than others, which can afford them to be arrogant.</div>

However as we are having promotion on product B, which is very similar to product A, so i ask if she is interested as the price is alot cheaper. Then she said," what! you think i cannot afford is it? i drive a BMW ok? My salary is much more than your cheap labour" then she ask to see my manager...i was like WTF, i m trying to give her a better deal and she said something lidat. Luckily my manager understand and so did not reprimand me. My point here is tat these rich people think tat they got some money they can be so demanding and overbearing. They dun even care what others feel. i am still a student loh, how can my salary be so high. wahlao dun even use her brain.

            <div class='col-md body'>When i was working P.t in a phone shop some years ago, a  male customer came in to buy a phone on contract. It was my mistake that i 4got to let him sign one document,so we called him up and kindly asked him to come back to the shop within the next few days.When he did not come on the 3rd day we call him again..He say he was busy at CHURCH then cursed and swear at us for wasting his time.He finally came down and we tot the thing settled.<br>Guess what? He complained to Starhub main office that we/this matter caused him NIGHTMARE &amp; distress every night <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> So my boss called him up and offered him a small gift..He accepted.one week later he complained to starhub AGAIN that he was still troubled over the matter <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>This time nobody bother about him liao.Such a minor thing will cause him depression meh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
