Yesterday got this lady walk into the shop and ask me about the info of product A (in a very rude manner). i then told her some basic info on it. However as we are having promotion on product B, which is very similar to product A, so i ask if she is interested as the price is alot cheaper. Then she said," what! you think i cannot afford is it? i drive a BMW ok? My salary is much more than your cheap labour" then she ask to see my manager...i was like WTF, i m trying to give her a better deal and she said something lidat. Luckily my manager understand and so did not reprimand me. My point here is tat these rich people think tat they got some money they can be so demanding and overbearing. They dun even care what others feel. i am still a student loh, how can my salary be so high. wahlao dun even use her brain. I juz cant stand people like her.<br><br>sori to stereotyping here. i know not all rich people are lidat... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  </div></blockquote>hmmmm most people who brag about something usually dont have it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
