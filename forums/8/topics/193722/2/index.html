Logic is such tat it can described every possible occurences. If u already believe in an illogical event happening, then I can also say the trigger tat caused the creation of everything is out of logic too and it is an unintelligent incident (big bang etc), not being (god), tat caused the creation.<br><br><blockquote>Millions of plant and animal types present in the world stand out as evidence that proves the existence and might of our Creator.<br><br>All of these living beings, a limited number of which will be described as examples here, deserve to be examined individually.

This evolutionary scenario also suggests that amphibians evolved into reptiles, creatures living only on land. This scenario is again implausible, due to the enormous structural differences between these two classes of animals. For instance, the amphibian egg is designed for developing in water whereas the amniotic egg is designed for developing on land. A "step by step" evolution of an amphibian is out of the question, because without a perfect and fully-designed egg, it is not possible for a species to survive. Moreover, as usual, there is no evidence of transitional forms that were supposed to link amphibians with reptiles. Evolutionist paleontologist and an authority on vertebrate paleontology, Robert L. Carroll has to accept that "the early reptiles were very different from amphibians and that their ancestors could not be found yet."30<br><br>Yet the hopelessly doomed scenarios of the evolutionists are not over yet. There still remains the problem of making these creatures fly! Since evolutionists believe that birds must somehow have been evolved, they assert that they were transformed from reptiles. However, none of the distinct mechanisms of birds, which have a completely different structure from land-dwelling animals, can be explained by gradual evolution. First of all, the wings, which are the exceptional traits of birds, are a great impasse for the evolutionists. One of the Turkish evolutionists, Engin Korur, confesses the impossibility of the evolution of wings:</blockquote>another interesting book..<br><br><a href="http://www.harunyahya.com/evolution06.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.harunyahya.com/evolution06.php</a></div>

All have the expected possible morphologies (see Figure 3.1.1 from Prediction 3.1 for a few examples), including organisms such as Protarchaeopteryx, Caudipteryx, and the famous "BPM 1 3-13" (a dromaeosaur from China now named Cryptovolans pauli; Czerkas et al. 2002 ) which are flightless bipedal dinosaurs with modern-style feathers (Chen et al. 1998 ; Qiang et al. 1998; Norell et al. 2002). Additionally, several similar flightless dinosaurs have been found covered with nascent evolutionary precursors to modern feathers (branched feather-like integument indistinguishable from the contour feathers of true birds), including Sinornithosaurus ("Bambiraptor"), Sinosauropteryx, Beipiaosaurus, Microraptor, and an unnamed dromaeosaur specimen, NGMC 91, informally called "Dave" (Ji et al. 2001). The All About Archaeopteryx FAQ gives a detailed listing of the various characters of Archaeopteryx which are intermediate between reptiles and modern birds. </blockquote>And there r probably a few hundred evidence tat prove evolution is true. Nylon eating bacteria(nylon is manmade, invented by modern man), whales with hindlegs found (antavism, mutation of animals can only be found with existence body parts or "latent" parts, legs with toes found in a few whales), fossils(bones foudn of the past very different from ones found now). There r so many evidence of evolution tat is is a well known scientific fact tat virtually made biology.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Frankly I seem to be explaining about evolution for probably a million times.<br><br><blockquote>as "logical" as it sounds, its super retarded to believe everything came from a one cell organism </blockquote>Well, I think it is harder to believe tat <strong>1 day </strong>ago the earth is deviod of all living things beings and a day after there r thousands of trees and animals tat actually is more than a few years old(one day ago they r not here and a day after they r a few years old... wierd) so tat these species (lions can't eat a 1 day of deer) can last till now. It is also puzzling tat all the beings of the past present and future is all created in tat day. I mean, SARS bacteria is already with men since men is created. The bird flu is always with birds since birds r found, the spanish flu, AIDS and black death is also with men when they r just created. Look at the domesticated animals like dogs, cats, pigs, sheeps, chickens cow etc. It is well known tat they can't live in the wild. How do they survive the few thousands years before men knew how to rear animals for food ?

The idea of God was not a lie but a device of the unconscious which needed to be decoded by psychology. A personal god was nothing more than an exalted father-figure: desire for such a deity sprang from infantile yearnings for a powerful, protective father, for justice and fairness and for life to go on forever. God is simply a projection of these desires, feared and worshipped by human beings out of an abiding sense of helplessness. Religion belonged to the infancy of the human race; it had been a necessary stage in the transition from childhood to maturity. It had promoted ethical values which were essential to society. Now that humanity had come of age, however, it should be left behind.
