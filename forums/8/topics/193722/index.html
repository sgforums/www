            <div class='col-md body'>Abraham Lincoln<br><br>"The Bible is not my book nor Christianity my profession. I could never give assent to the long, complicated statements of Christian dogma."<br><br>- Abraham Lincoln, American president (1809-1865).<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Albert Einstein<br><br>"I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religion than it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it."<br><br>"I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own -- a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotism."<br><br>"I do not believe in the immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it."<br><br>"If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for a reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed."<br><br>-Albert Einstein, German-born American physicist<br><br>-------------------------------------<br>Arthur C. Clarke<br><br>"It may be that our role on this planet is not to worship God, but to create him."<br><br>"Religion is a byproduct of fear. For much of human history, it may have been a necessary evil, but why was it more evil than necessary? Isn't killing people in the name of God a pretty good definition of insanity?"<br><br>Arthur C. Clarke, author<br>---------------------------------------<br>Charles Darwin<br><br>From the age of forty he was, to use his own words, a complete dis-believer in Christianity. He professed himself an Agnostic, regarding the problem of the universe as beyond our solution, "For myself," he wrote, "I do not believe in any revelation. As for a future life, every man must judge for himself between conflicting vague probabilities."<br>"The mystery of the beginning of all things is insoluble by us, and I for one must be content to remain an agnostic."<br><br>"It appears to me (whether rightly or wrongly) that direct arguments against christianity and theism produce hardly any effect on the public; and freedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men's minds which follows from the advance of science." [Quoted in How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science by Michael Shermer.<br><br>Charles Robert Darwin, English naturalist (1809-1882).<br>--------------------------------------------<br>Benjamin Franklin<br><br>"I have found Christian dogma unintelligible. Early in life, I absenteed myself from Christian assemblies."<br><br>"Lighthouses are more helpful then churches."<br><br>-Benjamin Franklin, American Founding Father, author, and inventor<br>--------------------------------<br>Marilyn Manson<br><br>"Who wants to go to Heaven with all those asshole angels?"<br><br>-Marilyn Manson, American rock musician<br>--------------------------------------<br>Napoleon Bonaparte<br><br>"Religion is excellent stuff for keeping common people quiet."<br><br>"Religion is what keeps the poor from murdering the rich."<br><br>"All religions have been made by men."<br><br>-Napoleon Bonaparte, French emperor<br>-----------------------------------------<br><br>Thomas Edison<br><br>"Religion is all bunk."<br><br>"I cannot believe in the immortality of the soul.... No, all this talk of an existence for us, as individuals, beyond the grave is wrong. It is born of our tenacity of life Â– our desire to go on living Â… our dread of coming to an end."<br><br>- Thomas Edison, American inventor (1847-1931).<br><br><a href="http://www.wonderfulatheistsofcfl.org/Quotes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderfulatheistsofcfl.org/Quotes.htm</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this one from freud, psychologists is good<br><br>Freud certainly regarded belief in God as an illusion that mature men and women should lay aside. The idea of God was not a lie but a device of the unconscious which needed to be decoded by psychology. A personal god was nothing more than an exalted father-figure: desire for such a deity sprang from infantile yearnings for a powerful, protective father, for justice and fairness and for life to go on forever. God is simply a projection of these desires, feared and worshipped by human beings out of an abiding sense of helplessness. Religion belonged to the infancy of the human race; it had been a necessary stage in the transition from childhood to maturity. It had promoted ethical values which were essential to society. Now that humanity had come of age, however, it should be left behind. [A History of God]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks for the source dude. i'll just like to point out the intelligence of atheists. einstein and edison. neff said. and researches have shown that high IQ people tends to be atheists or less religious. --&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religiosity_and_intelligence" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religiosity_and_intelligence</a>. mine is 140+ if u're interested.<br><br>so what's my point? the higher intelligence in us pointed out that we have the logic and complicated thinking inside us. we are able to analyse everything to come to a conclusion that there's truely no god in this world and universe and certainly, we're not created by god. and what does the religious ppls argue their stand of there's god? a book said so? they can feel the presence of god? god answer their prayers? blah blah blah.. but the lower intelligence of them could tell us that they did not really go and deeply think whether god does exist. but failing to do so, they failed to question the existance of god, leading them to think there's really god. know the story of 'the emperor's new clothes'? ppls are just tricked into believing that the 'invisible' clothes exist and they just denied themselves the truth that is shouting at their face. and it takes a small boy to shout out the fact to everyone. unless u tell me that religion is such a complicated matter that a small boy cant understand, den u can ask a small boy(uninfluenced) whether there's god in this world.</div>

They all have different body systems, diverse defence tactics, unique ways of feeding, and interesting reproduction methods. Unfortunately, it is not possible to describe all living beings with all their features in a single book. Encyclopaedias of many volumes would not be enough for this task.<br><br>However, even the few examples we will discuss here will be sufficient to prove that life on earth can in no way be explained by coincidences or accidental happenings.<br><br>Is then He Who creates like one that creates not?<br>Will you not receive admonition?<br>(The Qur'an, 16:17) </blockquote><a href="http://www.harunyahya.com/Existence_of_God2.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.harunyahya.com/Existence_of_God2.php</a><br><br>dont things like this make u guys think?</div>
