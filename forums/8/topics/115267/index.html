            <div class='col-md body'>the main reason local girls dont wan to give birth is they worry about their shape. ONce give birth, your body will grow sideway and you got to try very hard to get back on shape.<br><br>And i remember i read about a article from another forum , this girl her shape start to grow sideway after give birth and she was trying very hard to get in shape but she jus cant. She was so sad and the worst part is her hubby.. start to mind about her appearance.  He dont even encourge her but wat he did was  start to criticize her.  When they go out.. the hubby dont even dare to hold her hand.<br><br>And btw dont always said local girls suck,  guys think about yourself first!!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u sound so damn freaking sexist!<br>Hate males like you that blame on gals on everything...<br><br>Seriously, there are other reasons why birth rates are so low.<br>Think about it.<br>If u think that women are after $$ then can give birth...u are right partially BUT it's because the damn society damns that we pay on having kids. FYI: just to give birth hor...e.g. KKH, consulation for 9 mths cost almost $1k. When give birth (for those 2 days in the damn hospital) cost another $1k-$2k and it's even more after if ur child or wife have problems. So the cost can actually go up to $5k and above!<br><br>As for women going for cars, I guess u think about it...it's not all that do that! And talking about that...why GUYS must go after only those SLIM and PRETTY gals and not those plump and average leh????<br><br>Why only go for LOOKS?<br><br></div>
