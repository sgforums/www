            <div class='col-md body'>Let me tell you guys. To raise a family is not easy; especially the high living cost in Singapore.  Setting up a family.<br><br>You need to look into;- Down payment for freaking HDB housing, housing loan instalment... if your CPF is insufficient you will need to top up with cash, and buy loads of household stuff with freaking high GST, monthly water, elect, gas bills, conservancy charges, renovation, Tv licence fee, fire insurance, life insurance, food and expenses, garments.<br><br>With two or three children, milk powder, medical fee, insurances for your child, educational fees, school transportation fees,  food and expenses, garments, tuitional fee...well if your wife is not working, she may teach your child but what if she needs to supplement the family needs..so she has to work and who will take care of your children?<br>A maid?....your parents?...and still you need to support you parents financially or wages for your maid wah... what if one of your parent is disable or too old?  And you think... is it fair for them to take care of your children..? when they are suppose to retire and rest after being so..... busy over working for so many years to support you, your brothers and sisters.  The above are the most basic needs of your life.<br><br>Would you let your child to lose out with other children? No, then you will need extra cash to groom them right?<br><br>If your income say... S$2500 or S$3000 gross pay. Beside the above expenses, what about your own personal expenses?<br><br>I find that is very miserable to face all of the above if you are just merely can afford to sustain a family for an income of S$2500 or S$3000.<br><br>I regretted to get married and having kids..man. Is so stressful, miserable and pressure.</div>
