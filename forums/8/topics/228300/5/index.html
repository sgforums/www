            <div class='col-md body'>Oh here's my 2 cents. (btw im almost retained during sec 3, very scary experience, luckily got teacher saved me..)<br><br>During orientation, this "chain effect" thingy will make things easy for you. During the first day, just look around and find the most approachable guy or at least the person near or somebody that you always happen to see. for example, some people you can recognize easily or they somehow make an impression on you the fastest. just stick to him, or if you're a gal, find a gal instead. (same gender better, you don't wan pple gossiping on the first day right?). talk to this person, find out many things about him, like where he stay. throughout, just randomly pop up some questions and find out more about him. when you know enough, let him know some stuff and like let you 2 acknowledge the "alliance"..once you have 2 people, pple will find it hard to disturb or make life difficult for you. trust me, there are people who get into groups of 3 in the very early stage of orientation and they act like they known each other for months or years already. then they go around sabo-ing or disturbing those individuals who are too shy to make friends. alliance is very important. once you have an ally, you can find another group of 2 or 3 to make friends and then from allies you become a CLAN! and then no one will dare to disturb you.Ok that sounds like a game, but that first friend is very crucial. it's like building a hero in WC3...this person will lead you to your other friends...<br><br>About seniors...i don't come from a neighbourhood school so im not too sure about all the smoking ahbengish and gangsterism type of stuff. everyone in my sch is guai guai. even the worst case is those slacker that refuse to study. no one smokes and even playing in LAn shop or hanging out in world of JJ after school is considered HOPELESS to teachers.<br><br>Durin S1 or S2 no one really look at your result. But once you approach Sec 3 or 4, pple will start making friends with you without you knowing if you have good grades. all the people with good results will be swarmed by friends (true anot, decide for youself). if you wan support (or irritation, up to 2 to judge..)..just study hard and pple will come to you for help etc...<br><br>Don't really give a damn about CCa if you're not interested. Have this policy that " if the school doesn't have the cca im interested in, im NOT joining anything because they refuse to set up such a club". believe it anot, some schools close down CCa or refuse because they don't see the potential in it even if there is sufficient interests in the club. CCA points are quite pointless, you spend 4 years on the average of 2-3 times per week and 2-3 hours each time at the maximum of only 2 point deduction during OLEVELS. believe it, it's just a gimmick. unless you enjoy a CCA, go find one. it's like primary sch, don't force yourself because everyone has a CCA, just do the math (factoring in time and effort spent), and you'll realize this horrible truth. MOE is shortchanging pple who join CCAs. be smart and don't join any....100 over hours or even more (including CAMPS for those in uniform groups)...will be very enough for you to move a subject up by 2 grades so that's your 2 bonus points already....it's just not worth it..<br><br>ok. i know my "tips" are controversial...but well. gd luck.<br></div>

Lots of ppl in my sch like badminton but they closed it down a few years back due to the lack of potential ( like winning competitions etc)<br><br>heard that they are gonna close down netball, volleyball and soccer too.

            <div class='col-md body'>aiyah, i always hate act-cool people. but seriously, from my wisdom and experience, in all i've seen in life, only got 2 types of act-act people: Guys who act cool and girls who act cute.<br><br>in general, guys seldom act cute unless it's those very very gay and soft types, but i have only seen 1 case so far. girls, even those in their 20s+, all love to act cute. i don't remember seeing girls who act cool(although a girl who acts cool is truly cool! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">)<br><br>some tips, by the way:<br><br>1) don't get invovled in un-necessary trouble, meaning that don't join as CCAs if you can help it; waste of time, considering SG's local talent. better to use the time to go library, surf porn, play xBox 360 games or go shop for nice-nice clothes.<br><br>2) be neutral to the gangsters; if you are walking along a narrow vertical pathway in school and they're walking towards you and if they're part of your class, say hello to them so they don't feel alienated/offended.<br><br>3) don't act cool if you're a guy; will offend the gangsters. last time in 1998 when i was in sec 2, got one indonesian-chinese guy quite rich and handsome. always walk like a cool penguin with the legs motion thrusting left and right, shouder up and down, instead of thrusting the legs forward as we usually do. in the end, some gangsters drag him to empty classroom and punch his stomach because they bua-song his "dao" attitude. ya-ya lah! KNN! serves him right. i missed the show, though.<br><br>if you're a girl, don't act cute. will offend female gangsters and they're really bitchy about it. first, they'll constantly talk about you behind your back when they see you, then it comes to confrontation and assaulting you with barbie doll's leg. KNN. if you're pretty, then you must act humble and kind. if you're plain, act really kind and sweet.<br>from my experience, unlike male gangsters, female gangsters won't pick on those guai-guai little girls one.<br><br>if got female gangsters bully you, pay S$30 per banglah and ask them to take the female gangsters to male toilet and settle there. ARK HA HA HA! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>i think the guys here in sgforums also quite willing to help out for free, although i'm not interested.<br><br>that's all,<br>nikar.</div>
