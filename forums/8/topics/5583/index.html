It boosts their ego to know they have 'conquered' yet another.<br>b. they have been cheated before and want revenge.<br>c. they are not aware that they are causing hurt to the girl who happen to take his initiatives too seriously.<br><br>But do note that girls also play this game.

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to say that, from my experience and through observation, a lot of girls do exactly the same thing.  In general, it's usually the prettier girls who will do this kind of thing, but not exclusively.  Same goes for guys.<br><br>It may generalize, but always, there are some truths behind them.<br><br>I find that guys take it a lot harder when they get their emotions messed with.  Girls just show it more.  Guys usually will carry it with them for months and months...and some for years and never show it.  I guess this goes to that idea that 'guys do have a harder time finding a girlfriend than girls do.'  Ok, there are some girls that find it hard to find guys.....but please people, don't deny this quote.<br><br>Fact is, if a girl wants to meet someone, they just need to dress up and go somehwere and therir chances of meeting someone just by sitting there is very high.  If a guy were to do the same thing, the only way he would meet someone just by sitting there would be if he was handsome or cute as hell...  Most guys try many time and get rejected over and over, but would the same thing happen to girls?  Very unlikely.<br>For a guy to get dumped hurts more than just his ego especially if he had to work to get that girl.  Fact is, girls don't have to work as hard to get guys...period.  To get the right guys, they have to be more proactive, but hey...who cares right because a lot of girls go for fucked up guys anyways.<br><br>My point is that it just seems that more guys do it than girls, but that's just on the surface level.  I'm not local (from States), but I know SO MANY girls who have more than 3 boyfriends.  Most guys I know here don't even have 1 girlfriend.  The idea that it's only guys is just a misconception.<br><br>To clueless,<br>From my point of view, I find that girls are more prone to use guys for whatever reasons than guys are willing to use girls.  It may be that becasue girls vocalise their pain more often that it seems like it's always the guys who are doing this.  I had a girlfriend once who was really...difficult, to say the least, and she would just pick fights with me in public all the time.  And every time, u could obviously tell that everyone would give me the dirty look as if to say that it must be the guy who wronged the girl and shit like that.<br><br>Let me just say that we guys hurt just as bad, if not more because of any number of reasons.  We aren't all heartless bastards.<br><br>cheers<br><br>if anyone would like to have a friendly discussion about this, they can email me at firewire_ieee@hotmail.com<br><br>maybe we can share experiences about how bad we got our hearts screwed with.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In other words, not all guys are bastards or all girls are bitches, it just depends on the individual... to say that one gender is more likely to discriminate or play play around with the other's feelings is quite a biased generalization.....<br><br>Certainly some guys get a thrill out of abusing women emotionally, and some women have such low self-esteem problems that they not only tolerate, but come to expect this kind of abuse from bastards who squeeze them heartlessly. Same way with some guys who hang around those girls who mercilessly push them around and try to change their lifestyles and pressure them into spending less time with their friends.<br><br>But one thing's for sure, anyone who says things like "looks don't matter" or "money can't buy love" clearly is either a hypocrite, or doesn't realize that it isn't money that buys love; it's what you *do* with the money that buys love. If you compare two decent guys, everything equal, one rich and one not, chances are the rich one in our society will get the girl. Of course, there are other factors like personality; but if a rich guy is bastardly he's still more likely to get girls(quantity not quality though) than a poor nice guy.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay first I would like to say thanx to all those who had reply with regards to this topic. I'm not stereotyping any gender like Kife has commented coz I do know that there are girls who do that to? But dun u agree that guys are usually the one with the roving eyes whenever they see a pretty girl walk past even though their hands are tight around their girlfriends' waist? I do agree that it's harmless to do that but I thought if u really love someone u wun even care abt those other girls around u. Some guys I noticed, when a pretty girl walk past his eyes will follow the girl's movement, the way she walk and all that.<br>There is this survey conducted in US for both guys and girls. It's main intent was to find out what comes in first when looking for a partner or mate. For guys, most of them said that looks are important. All the others like good character, personality come behind. And for girls, good character, security are the main criteria. I dun want to based my judgement on this survey alone but as we can see it exists here in Singapore too. Sometimes u see pretty girls with average looking guys and u tell urself that the girl deserved a better looking guy. But what makes u think that a better looking guy is any better?<br>Girls usually dun go for looks even though I admit that some do. But for guys the first impression goes by looks and not others.<br><br>Would someone like to debate me on that?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>let's admit it, it is just a game we play.The rules are non existent to say the least...we are all players regardless of gender, consciously or subconciously...being nice sensitive caring, concerned serves one stragetic purpose jus as playing hard to get,flirtting , outright throwing oneself at the other party serves another.<br><br>Many roads lead to Rome...the end justifies the means and the winner takes all...the loser has nothing to whine about. he loses simply cos he was not up to mark, no two ways abt it.Sometimes we lost simply cos we were born disadvantaged. Looks is half the battle won. Sometimes we lost cos we are too reckless. Impatience, too " un-opportunistic"...etc..<br><br>It has nothing to do with gender.

            <div class='col-md body'>So, in the final analysis, I think it's safe to say that it's one big game of chance; some bastards are rich and beng-like and get all the girls, some plain-looking girls can still get a nice boyfriend, some girls make it, some guys don't, and it's all one big confusing roulette game to try to find the ideal matching partner(or partners, depending on your views on monogamy), or as close to it as you're willing to compromise.<br>Some guys can overlook appearance, some guys can't, some girls don't care if a guy is rich, some girls do. It's all one big messy, complicated interweaving of desires and fantasies and, in the end, some people make it no matter how little they seem to deserve it, and some people don't, no matter how nice they are.<br><br>Shit, man. I'd rather go to a casino, at least that way I know the rules of the games. Trying to find a partner like playing poker, while blindfolded, with the cards down, not knowing the rules, not knowing what the stakes are, and with a dealer who *smiles* all the time(and to those of you who recognise this phrase, it's a damn good book, no? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Clueless :<br><br>There's nothing to debate really. What u hv stated are facts.<br><br>Fact #1 - Roving Eyes<br>I admit that sometimes my eyes do rove but perhaps not to the extent u describe. And I do not think there is anything wrong with that if done more discreetly. I would believe most gf and wives would not be so naive to think that their bfs or hubbies do not look at other girls once attached or married. And I believe in most cases, the glancing just ends there.<br><br>Fact #2 - Guys generally go for look first.<br>No argument on this and I do not hv an answer. I will hv to ask my maker why when I meet him.<br><br>Zephure<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hope everyone understands that it's not just us guys that stares at girls.  I've been with a few girlfriends who openly stared at goodlooking guys and then had the cheek to tell me that he's really gorgeous.  TSK TSK.<br><br>Girls are just better at doing it when their boyfriends aren't around.  Let's not deny it.  It's stupid and insulting to say that women don't stare also.<br><br>Here's the real controversy.  I find it ok, but many people in Sais don't.<br><br>Is it ok for people to maturbate after they get attached or married?<br><br>In my books...nothing wrong.  It's even more fantastic if she wants to join in.:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Staring or at least appreciating is one thing; I think it's a mark of a mature and stable relationship if the people in it can honestly compare other good-looking people to themselves but still feel secure in the affection of their own partner.<br><br>A genuine roving eye buaya/vixen with a taste for fresh pastures outside the relationship is another thing altogether, of course. Personally, I've never seen the point in monogamy, but that's just my philosophical opinion, most people seem to find it works for them. Or, at least, they try to make it work in the belief that somehow it's "the right thing", only to be frustrated because the whole concept of monogamy requires you to repress and suppress what you are and what you want in favour of some anachronistically ridiculous idea of "love" everyone expects you to have.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've often thought the same thing.  I mean I believe that people should get attached and married and stuff like that.  But at the sam time, I feel that when the couple are comfortable enough with each other, they should, if they want and enjoy it, allow their partners to go and experiment or enjoy with other people...or enjoy other people together. as long as u are sure enough about ur love for one another and that it is just an extension of ur relationship.  Many&lt; I believe would have a hard time even accepting this.<br><br>I face the same problem.  I can accept it and have on occasions encouraged my gf , in the past, to try other people if she wants.  Firstly, I trust that she won't run away with him, and secondly, I want her to be happy and enjoy herself....maybe a bit too open, but...<br><br>Of course it has never happened, but the problem is that I can still feel really jealous.  It is an emotional and mental paradox.  U say she can, but u can't tahun when u think about it.   duhhhh!:-p<br><br>Anyway, I'm all for it, but both party must know what it entitles and all rules must be stated beforehand or else u will end up in a messy situation.<br><br>Just a thought.  I know that I'm in the minority here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now i know that most ppl look at guys and start pointing their finger at them, saying bad things abt them. Guys has always been seen as the "bad" ppl, and cheating on  the girl's feelings are wat they do best.<br><br>However, guys really get cheated of their feelings too, juz as what firewire said.<br>There was this girl whom I liked, made use of me, when she was having a crush on someone else. What more can I say??<br></div>
