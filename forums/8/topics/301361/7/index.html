            <div class='col-md body'>If the TS want to do it correctly , he should do it like what my class did in high school. A teacher falsely accused a student of doing something wrong and slapped her. That girl was probably picked on because she came from a broken home.  We told our parents and apparently one of the parents made a phone call to MOE. It triggered off an investigation whereby the teacher actually had to apologise to the girl and my class.<br><br>The second time was when a teacher insulted me in class for something I didn't do . She accused me of chewing gum when I was actually grinding my teeth due to a dental problem. My classmates who sat near me told her I had a problem with my teeth but she just continued screaming insults on me and my parents.<br><br>I told her in front of the whole class that I am telling my father about what she said and we have 37 witnesses. She actually made me stay back and she cried and begged me not to tell my father.<br><br>My form teacher stepped in and asked very nicely that I do not make the complaint. She also backed me up by telling the teacher that I had a problem with my teeth hence the grinding which looks like I am chewing something. If I had made the complaint , that teacher would be suspended because her insults were uncalled for. Apparently that was the situation and I said I won't if she left me alone. So I never made the call to my father.<br><br>So if the TS have nothing to hide , he shouldn't be resorting to media instead of going through the right channels.<br><br></div>

The society has changed alr. 20th and 21th century like you all have said is very much a difference. Is not whether we can endure it or not. When the society has developed, people developed too. In those days torture might not be as ruthless as people can think of now. People gets more violent. So of course if you were to say maintain the standard it was used to be, i think that is impossible.</div>
