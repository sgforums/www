            <div class='col-md body'>Haha reminds me of the posts and thread I had months ago.. lols..<br><br>Modes of punishment by teachers are very debatable seriously.. Some will argue that "counselling" will do a better job, and others will argue that kids need to learn the hard way just like olden times.. Seriously, both have their pros and cons and who in this world is to determine a balancing mechanism? To each his own right?<br><br>The best is to look at the situation on a case to case basis.<br><br>1) How much damage is being done to the victim?<br>On most cases, which is why majority of the forumners here are flaming the TS, such actions are usually shrugged off. Brain damage? Bleed? Any physical injuries? Doubt so. Maybe with a stroke of luck and skill, the paper cut the skin of TS head and bleed him to death. Wow..<br>Emotional damage? Greatly humilated in front of his love of his life? Contemplating to commit suicide already because lose face in front of whole class? Wow..<br><br>Most likely, minimal injury suffered.<br><br>2) Justified?<br>We don't really know what happened. So we can't really judge whether such actions are justifiable or not.<br><br>Bottom line:<br>If you really did something wrong, and you didn't suffer any injury, "counselling" you will do you any good? Or perhaps, the teacher should have hit you on the head with an encyclopedia instead.<br><br>If you didn't do anything wrong, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is there really a need to go to this extend</span>? If you cannot handle such trivial things in life, let's see how you go really far in your life ahead..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TS... judging from your style of writing, I get the vibes that you're one of those "Act smart" type and no doubt more intelligent than the average sec school kid. However, you're probably not very popular in school, and is the bad book of every other teach in your school for your attitude.<br><br>Unfortunately, I cannot sympathize with you.  Firstly, if you were obviously innocent of reprimand, you should stand on your own two balls and defend yourself and take the case right to your principal's office.   Secondly, you're one kinda wimp to be "hurt" by an exercise book "impacting" on your head.<br><br>No one in the right mind forcefully hits another person for no reason, or for minor mistakes.  You must have pissed her off enough to do so.  Not necessarily by a single incident, but by a continued show of bad attitude.</div>
