            <div class='col-md body'>i feel that teachers can punish students, because thats always the case when students do the wrong thing. But shouldnt they tell the students what wrong they do or the reason for punishing them? Sometimes its just very frustrating when a teacher punishes you and keep mum about WHY he/her punishes you. Thats awful. For one to bear the consequences, one needs to know the cause in the first place like i always said.</div>

If it is a good cause you had understood to be your own mistake, accept it with open heart and keep shut. if you think it is unreasonable for the teacher to beat you, you should at least wrote the whole story to let others judge who is in the wrong. ny concealing the other side, you are trying to avoid the problem/s that led to the beating.<br></div>
