            <div class='col-md body'>just reminding everyone that teachers are human too.. they too can fail in their ability to judge, their ability to rationalize, the strength of their slaps.. not everything that they do are right.. the student was hit with a book, true.. but how much force was used nobody knows.. so pls dun say it's gu niang of the TS..<br><br>What is clear here is the fact that the student used a wrong medium of reaching out.. he should have gone to some other teacher for help n not post it here.. but there is no point for us to say that he's a gu niang, a sissy, just because he said what he said, i don't understand why he was accused of those names just because he posted that? why is he supposed to keep quiet? why cant he tell someone?<br><br>what if the student is ur son? what if the teacher wrongly accused him? what if he was slapped everyday..? what if he is suffering from constant minor punishments n biasness from the teacher? everyday just a light shove.. not enough to cause physical hurt, but enough to cause emotional stress.. can YOU handle that yourself..?<br><br>so don't jump to conclusions when there are no details.. but its highly in doubt that the TS will post again.. so we will never know what exactly happened..<br><br></div>

I am a student studying in a school in Bishan, Singapore. My school is Guangyang Secondary School.<br><br>On 4th January 2008, at around 12.40PM according to the time on my watch, my class was having it's last two periods of the day when the unpleasant incident occurred. At that time, I was in the midst of doing my maths assignment in class and the teacher for the maths period, Mrs Quah Chen Hoon, came over to the front of the classroom where I was seated.<br><br>She pointed out the solution to a maths question which I was doing, but the next moment, she used a Exercise Book, which she was holding in her hand, to hit my head.<br><br>The impact was hard. Now, I did not question or talk back to her for fear of raising her hackles. So, I have decided the best way out is to write in to the media to voice my grievances.<br><br>As a result of this incident, I would like to reinforce the message that teachers in Singapore are not allowed to hit their students physically, except for punishable offences that are very serious in nature. I strongly believe that this is a rule that is set by the Ministry of Education regarding discipline in schools.<br><br>A voice recording of Mrs Quah's maths lesson will be made available as well.</div></blockquote>Well, I don't care if this is my very first post whatsoever. I had enough of seeing such nonsence and I <strong>AM</strong> from the same school and same class as Furious Student. Believe it or not, it's up to all viewers.<br><br>First, <strong>FURIOUS STUDENT</strong> I would like to give you a round of applause for plotting and writing such a good old lame pathetic story! <strong>STORY OF THE YEAR!</strong> Why? I am in the same damn class and I definetely know what was going on. So here it goes. <strong>MATHS lesson with Mrs Quah STARTED at 11.30am and ENDED at 12.50pm.</strong><br>My question is, why in the world would you record an hour of the lesson, taking the time at about,11.40++am when nobody has even laid a hand on you? Was this plotted etc? THINK! You claimed she hit your tou fu pussy head at 12.40pm ACCORDING to your watch, so why record the lesson at 11.40+++am when you don't even know that you would be hit at 12.40pm?<br><br>FYI everybody, the teacher, Mrs Quah, was rather in a god damn good mood on Friday when the incident happened and I definitely don't recall anything of such where she HITTED Furious Student so hard that he cried for his momma. Even if there was a hit, it was like some soft pussy touch UNLIKE what Furious Student CLAIMED. Trying to gain some stupid sympathy and telling MOE what to do? PS, come up with a BETTER idea if you want to get a teacher outta the school while gaining sympathy all over SG and the WORLD if they happen to read such things.<br><br>So are you happy now? That it has the media's attention to an innocent person? Tarnishing the school's image? I will track you down if possible, but maybe not.<br><br>There's retribution to every bad things you do like this! So who knows tomorrow you will see your momma's name on the front page of newspapers apologizing for your sorry acts or your momma being accused for some thing she didn't do? <strong> CHOICES COMES WITH CONSEQUENCES, YOUR CHOICE, YOU CHOOSE </strong><br><br>OOHHHHHh, just my 2 cents worth.<br><br></div>

Chinese newspaper WANTS to wirte a story about this. The NEW PAPER might just follow up. Cos this story is also on STOMP. It's such a pity that only I am the one in the same class with this Furious Student in this forum. Seeing a good teacher getting accused of something she didn't even do.</div>
