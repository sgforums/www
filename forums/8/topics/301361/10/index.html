I am a student studying in a school in Bishan, Singapore.<br><br>On 4th January 2008, at around 12.40PM according to the time on my watch, my class was having it's last two periods of the day when the unpleasant incident occurred. At that time, I was in the midst of doing my maths assignment in class and the teacher for the maths period, came over to the front of the classroom where I was seated.<br><br>She pointed out the solution to a maths question which I was doing, but the next moment, she used a Exercise Book, which she was holding in her hand, to hit my head.<br><br>The impact was hard. Now, I did not question or talk back to her for fear of raising her hackles. So, I have decided the best way out is to write in to the media to voice my grievances.<br><br>As a result of this incident, I would like to reinforce the message that teachers in Singapore are not allowed to hit their students physically, except for punishable offences that are very serious in nature. I strongly believe that this is a rule that is set by the Ministry of Education regarding discipline in schools.</div></blockquote>Your teacher is exercising your head for you! 好心沒好報! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
