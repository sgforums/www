            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, back here to posting. TS a.k.a Furious Student, can you <span style="color: red;"><strong>PLEASE</strong></span> at least start replying all forumers already? OR is it that you have just no proof to back up your <strong>STUPID, FAKE and PATHETIC</strong> story? So what does an hour of voice recording of the lesson, 1 hour before you was being hit shows? <strong>WAS THIS ALL PLOTTED?</strong> OR are you a GOD or someone else powerful enough to PREDICT or KNOW what's gonna happen in 1 hours time on that day, cause, I believe you recorded it at about 1140+++am and you CLAIMED being HIT at 12.40pm. Something is so wrong.<br><br>TS a.k.a Furious Student, you are such an despicable cad, trying to set some one up, in this case, a very good teacher. So what will you gain IF you manage to get this teacher out of school, or on the newspaper? Proud etc? But be warned that there is something called RETRIBUTION  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>And I seriously believe in what ever you do to others, it will be DEALT back to you. Retribution might just fall on you anytime, be it now, or during your national exams, or, worse come to worse, DEALT to your parents! Just my 2 cents worth, but it would be such a sad thing if your parents got to pay for your sins.<br>A little piece of advice for YOU, and other readers who might plan on doing such things, when you want to record an ABUSE, in this case, being "HIT" by an exercise book. Do record down the VIDEO instead of some random MP3 format sh!t which proves nothing and waste all forummers time downloading something useless. STATE the time nearer to your video recording, not like record 1 hr before getting 'hitted'. Your plot has just failed all right? Who are you to tell MOE what to do when you yourself is faking such story and TRYING to gain sympathy all over SG and probably over the world since this is the internet world. Go get a life.<br><br>REPLIES/COMMENTS TO POST THAT HAS MY ID ON IT <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> :<br><br>freedom4ever --&gt; The school should expel him instead OR sent to Boys' Home for slandering/destroying school and teachers reputation. Wouldn't that be a good idea since his parents doesn't have the ability to take their CHILD in hand.<br><br>polarsnake --&gt; I would really like to help the teacher, but I guess the school is trying hard not to allow this up onto the newspaper etc. But if the reporters/paparazi what ever you call it, still wants to write a story on this, my class and I will definitely stand up for this teacher. Reporters are pretty good at stirring up stories just to keep viewers entertained and to keep their rice bowls safe. NO OFFENCE  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>gigabyte14 --&gt; It's all up to readers/forummers to believe or not believe what I said, but I definitely won't help those who are guilty, like in this case, TS.<br><br>purpledragon84 --&gt; Our math class in banded, approx ~ 55+ plus students combined from both classes are splitted/banded in to 5 different classes and teachers. In this case, it's about 25 of us. Alright to handle, but, 1 thing is for sure, the teacher was in a pretty good mood on the day of the incident. It was like our 2nd day 3rd lesson with the teacher when school started?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>End of response.<br><br>But TS is pretty guilty I guess. Editing his VIRGIN POST, removing the teacher's name, school name etc and subsituting it with random words. But unfortunately someone has quoted his original virgin post, with everything attached to it. Just think before you do anything ok?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

ITS SO OBVIOUS THAT IT'S A SET UP!! WHY FRAME THE TEACHER?? Coz i think ur dumb and slenger*.. Record to listen to what The Teacher has said so you can revise on it?? I say it's bullshit!! If you really hate the Teacher and school so much,why so this when you can just QUIT school and not venting your revenge on the school and teacher??

I was sitting on the table and reflecting on what the teacher had said in class the past few days, trying to so call recall and be something like a IO*, but my choice of career is definitely not an IO, it's a meaningful but dirty job. Anyway, back to topic. I was thinking hard that day, recording of lesson started at 1140++am, claimed being hit at 12.40pm, where lesson ended at 12.50pm. That's when something struck my mind of why would he actually record the lesson in the first place and claim being hit? So decided to have everyone's view on this matter. It's a sad thing that I don't have the time to post at STOMP also. But anyways, IF anybody has a STOMP account and wishes to help, it would greatly be appreciated  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Like maybe a link to SGF thread or something like that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>All these are just some random posts  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Which explains my nick too.

I am a student studying in a school in Bishan, Singapore.<br><br>On 4th January 2008, at around 12.40PM according to the time on my watch, my class was having it's last two periods of the day when the unpleasant incident occurred. At that time, I was in the midst of doing my maths assignment in class and the teacher for the maths period, came over to the front of the classroom where I was seated.<br><br>She pointed out the solution to a maths question which I was doing, but the next moment, she used a Exercise Book, which she was holding in her hand, to hit my head.<br><br>The impact was hard. Now, I did not question or talk back to her for fear of raising her hackles. So, I have decided the best way out is to write in to the media to voice my grievances.<br><br>As a result of this incident, I would like to reinforce the message that teachers in Singapore are not allowed to hit their students physically, except for punishable offences that are very serious in nature. I strongly believe that this is a rule that is set by the Ministry of Education regarding discipline in schools.</div></blockquote>you little snivelling, spoilt, whinny brat made of tofu, a small whack on the head with a tiny exercise book will concuss you or send you to tan tock seng icu issit? blardy hell study dun want to study want to create such nonsense controversy and abo teachers. very free ah? not enuff cca and homework to do issit? i tell you, if u were in my class 12 years back, you sure kenna jialat jialat from us one, we sure track you down, drag you to a toilet and give you our own education, and its aptly named "brutality".</div>
