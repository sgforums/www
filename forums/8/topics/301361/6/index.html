            <div class='col-md body'>i wonder why all keep saying "last time the teacher use duster, the teacher use GPMG, the teacher use grenade on me oso i nv cry".. last time police wear shorts too.. its quite ridiculous to compare over the times.. last time primary sch cannot bring hp too now also can wat..<br><br>the issue here is not whether he's a spineless ball-less idiot or child delinquent or  whatever, but we shud at least get the full story and not be quick to pass judgement..<br><br>to many of us, an exercise book hitting on the head is nothing, but to the person who is experiencing it, its a different story.. its exactly the same as the first time u were late for school, u tinking wah die die, but yrs later ur younger brother late for sch, u'll be thinking, aiyah late late la.. nothing wat..<br><br>same for ur 1st extra duty, u tinking wah nb, so suay, wah lao, not my fault wat.. but when others tio extra, u'll be thinking, chey, 3 only, that time i tio 21 oso diam diam!<br><br>n we duno hw heavily the teacher hit the fella with the exercise book either.. maybe its a slight pat on the head, maybe it was a freaking sprint followed by a flying clothesline style full swing to the back of the head "with an exercise book only wat"..<br><br>of coz im not saying the teacher is wrong, coz we haven haf the full details of the story, and to TS, u are not helping here by refusing to give a full account of what exactly happened.. it juz shows that YOU have something u are not divulging to us, which makes us doubt the credibility of ur story too..</div>

Sensationalization is the rule of the day, and putting you down dose that for them.<br><br>I agree that teachers are not allowed to hit you on your head.<br><br>Iagree with some forumers, that you did not elaborate much about the situation that led to you being assaulted.

            <div class='col-md body'>When was this recording done? AFTER the incident occured? and what's the purpose of letting us listen to it? What I really want to know is...<br>WHY do you think the teacher hit you?<br><br>I can emphatise with you about the matter &amp; it made me read the whole post because I experienced a similar thing 16 years ago in primary school.<br>It was also a MATHS class...and the teacher hit me on my head very HARD with his hand. The force nearly made my head hit the desk. It took me by surprise...shocked me. It just stunned me into silence and choke. I remembered the reason was - I was not quite paying attention. My friend made a joke and I laughed a little..and then BAM! - got hit. He then pointed out that I did something wrong on my maths problem. I couldn't remember well..it's still a blur from that point onwards.<br><br>This was the same teacher that scolded me infront of everyone on the first day of school because I came late and didn't allow me to get in line in the school hall or even the class. It was not my fault I was late. I did not even know this new teacher appointed to my class..or even his name. On the 1st day of school..and he began it this way for me. It was quite traumatic, I scrambled around the school,not knowing what to do and cried...feeling lost when everyone is already in class. I called my parents finally,choking back tears..and I only entered the class when my parents complained to the teacher.<br><br>This was the same teacher that beat my friend hard on his back and humiliated him infront everyone. All my friend did was point out a good move to this teacher who is playing checkers with another classmate of mine. I can still remember how shocked he looked..probably scarred.<br><br>There were many incidents from this primary school in all my years spent there..even before the above incident. Many scars..even before the abovementioned 'scar'. Other bad &amp; dull memories..some disturbed my young mind. Got slapped hard a few times by this female teacher for not walking in line and another time in class. Stand up while everyone in the school hall is sitting down...just because I forget to bring something. It was ...quite traumatising. Some of you might go 'huh'...but a self diagnosis I realised recently revealed that I might be a high functioning autistic child or even Ausberger. My parents missed all the signs. It was there...but I won't blame them, they don't know anything.<br><br>oh..the memories flooding back. Getting hate looks from teachers &amp; the parents of a friend I accidentally hurt. I did not intentionally hurt you my friend..I grabbed that thing from you because you did not returned it back to me and it shocked me when it scratched your arm. That young,I was scared of the teachers and going to school is a dreadful experience. Looking back, my paranoid side..even thinks that the school is standing on a 'bad area'. The darklings feed on negative emotions...and has probably affected many going to that school...including the teachers.<br><br>Looking back,I can tell you guys,it has affected how I expect people to be..and having social anxiety disorder(again,self diagnosed)..and avoidance disorder.<br><br><strong>TEACHERS - Young minds are sensitive and need proper nurturing to grow up to be an emotionally &amp; mentally healthy human. PLEASE treat young minds with care. NOT EVERY KID IS THE SAME. You cannot punish &amp; treat every child the same way. TEACHERS - Do not let emotion or personal matters affect you in school. I know it can be hard but think of the child's future. and lastly. TEACHERS...PLEASE DO NOT GIVE THE EVIL EYE to your students. By this,I mean,giving them that stare when you're angry with them. Till today,I still remember some of those stares from teachers. I really felt that they were angry and hated me. This has contributed to my disorders. </strong><br><br>I planned to write a more detailed article and submit it to Today or some news paper,coinciding with Teachers' Day but I just felt compelled to just write here today because I don't even know if I get to write in next time. Some of you might not understand me...it's ok. At least,I'm voicing out.</div>

Believe me,I'm not using this as an excuse. I have gone through many,I mean many situations. I keep asking why..and then researched it myself. Yes,through books first and then internet...via websites and especially forums. Shrinks need to study for so many years - that's how they know the symptoms,the treatments for it and make theories &amp; books on it. Yes,it's not professional diagnosed...but it is highly likely that I'm right and only I know this.</div>
