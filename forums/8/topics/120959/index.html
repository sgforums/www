            <div class='col-md body'>All the while she's inside, I was there like her guardian, patiently waiting for her presence.. Time seems to stop for a moment when she's not around.. surrounding was still bustling with activities, negotiation was going on and deal was clinched.. many times, I will docked behind a pillar that I had carefully selected to prevent any familiar sight from seeing me.. Half an hour had past, but there was still no sight of her..<br><br>There she is.. from the corner of my eyes, I captured the most beautiful creature of earth.. she was walking towards my direction.. I need to act fast, racking my over-worked brain for a solution.. Up close she was even more radiant and captivating than when I had seen her from a distance.. Her irises were as pitch-black as her pupils.. Her ample, cascading black hair flowed onto her shiny bare shoulders.. She wore no makeup and her neat ungroomed eyebrows joined ever so slightly.. Her tiny, round lips were full like a tulip bulb.. She look shy, pensive and reserved..<br><br>"Hi " erm.. I.. been waiting for you..<br><br>" Yes? "<br><br>" I would like to know you, maybe a contact number? "<br><br>" But I am not a working girl and... "<br><br>" GREAT" I interupt her before she could end her sentenced..<br><br>" I am sorry, but suddenly I feel excited."<br><br>Its been a week since I got to know Linda.. She was a woman of many blushes and very few words.. I could never guess what she was thinking.. She would not eat much and would quietly ask for her dish to be bagged to go.. Little by little however, she seemed to get comfortable with the fact that I wanted to be close and intimate with her..<br><br>Her mum was working as a chamber-maid and many times, she would gladly help her mother when she's sick.. she's filial and pretty, kind and humble to the poor and old.. what more can I asked for in a girl..<br><br>It was a saturday morning and we decided to go shopping.. Linda took me to a large state subsidized clothing outlet where she had probably bought all of her clothes.. The clothes seemed to have come from garment liquidators in China and South America or some international charity organization.. There were a few leftover promotional T-shirts and some specialty clothes favored by the poor working girls.. Linda said that she visited the store often and at best there were slim pickings.. That day she did not find anything she liked..<br><br>I thought that maybe a stylish dress would make her happy and I took her to a chic clothing boutique in the lobby of a fancy international hotel.. The store was air conditioned and played pop music.. The pretty storekeeper greeted us with a smile, presented some garments and made some suggestions.. Linda was in awe from the moment we entered.. She bashfully touched the fancy designer clothes.. Then she tried a couple of dresses on and began posing by the mirror in a mix of self-consciousness and fascination.. She examined the price tags in wonder..<br><br>" Let's go, Its too expensive here."<br><br>" No, Its alright, come on choose one that you like."<br><br>Reluctantly, she put on a blue dress of beautiful silk that fit her well .. The price tag was a reasonable $135(2500bahts) and I decided to pay cash and buy her the dress as a present.. When we left the boutique, she was all smiles, overjoyed with the fancy shopping bag in her hand..<br><br>"So I meet you tonight?"<br><br>" Ok dear, I will be in this blue dress for you." she smiled..<br><br>That night Linda stood me up.. I anxiously stayed in until midnight and drank all the beer in the mini-bar but there was no sign of her..<br><br>The next day, just before noon, a knock on my door woke me.. Linda was outside..<br><br>"Listen carefully. I am sorry about last night but yesterday I had a big problem at home."<br><br>"What happened?"<br><br>"I could not wear your dress last night.. I was very upset and I did not want to see anybody.. Understand?" She said as her eyes welled up..<br><br>"But why?"<br><br>"Because yesterday my mother took the dress back to the shop to got the money for it." A tear ran down her cheek.. She paused silently for a while and said:<br><br>"My mother said I could not have that dress when in our house we don't have enough food to eat."<br><br>I held her as she broke into a silent sob.. I did not quite know what to say.. I told her that the dress was not a big deal and she had no reason to be upset.. I wanted to tell her that I would buy her another dress or that she could depend on me for anything but I held back as it was not going to sound right..<br><br>Soon, my holiday came to a end.. that was the last I saw of her..<br><br>It was not until two years later that I went back to bangkok.. As we approached the center of town, there was again the familiar scene of curvaceous young prostitutes working the streets and intersections..<br><br>"The working girls are still here."<br><br>The new taxicab zoomed smoothly through the dark and empty avenues of Havana. The taxi driver, said, that I could have them for $40(950 baht)..<br><br>As the cab slowed down and stopped at a red light I focused my eyes again and for a moment I caught a good sight of her from afar as she was illuminated by another pair of approaching headlights.. It was Linda..<br><br>"You like her? ... She was lovely. Do you want me turn the car around?" The driver asked..<br><br>"No. It's not necessary." I replied..<br><br>"You can probably have her for $60(1400baht), maybe $40(950baht) this hour.. I can negotiate for you."<br><br>"No thanks. It's all right."<br><br></div>
