            <div class='col-md body'>I think the golden era was late 80s to early 90s...to be precise till 1998..Life was good...i could remember that during the late 80s i was in pri school, life was carefree and easy.....things were cheap.....and people had time to have hobbies and social life....here was no internet and places like cinema, theme parks ect were the ones people had to enjoy themselves..video rentals were also popular as a fav pastime....people played consoles with friends and family making their bonds stronger....<br><br>Come to early 1990s, life was even better....A lot of new things started appearing.....things became classier....this was the golden era...<br><br>Now the 2000s really suck.....war, conflicts .....virus outbreak...Due to the internet, people have become more lonely and antisocial and corrupted (porn ect).....Ills associated with society that requires actual contact has now become easier due to the internet...Internet addiction....sexual predators on the loose in IRC channels....Cyber terrorism....hacking.....anti social propaganda....Porn can all be accessed in the comfort of your own home with a single click...People no longer play games with family and friends...rthey rather go Online with multiplayer gaming..No doubt the Internet is useful for humans....but history has shown that humans would rather often go down the dark path associated with technological advances....Like they say Forbidden fruit is always better in taste....<br></div>
