It's a matter of perfecting the speaking of Mother Tongue and English. I speak Teochew at home with my family members, Chinese or English when I'm with friends or when I'm outside. And now, I'm able to speak well in all 3. It's a matter of balancing yourself well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whether u agree or not, it's really more helpful and useful if u have a strong foundation in English than in Chinese if u're living in Singapore. And the best way to have that foundation is to make it their everyday language.<br><br>No matter how fast China is growing or how popular the chinese language is becoming, English is not going to lose its significance here.<br><br>But of course, every chinese people should at least be able to converse properly in chinese.</div>

If mandrain also equally lousy i think the parents can go knbock their head on the wall.</div></blockquote>Firstly, do not generalise.There are parents out there who speak fluent Standard Singapore English ( this is a linguistic term), and there are those who are fluent speakers of dialect.<br><br>This is our identity.We are a nation shaped out of a migrant identity of South East Asia, India, China and the Malay Archipelago.<br><br>Do you want them to speak Putonghua like the Northerners?We, for your information are not the People's Republic.Those of us of Chinese origin, are Overseas Chinese who are equally adept in any culture, because of the heritage that was granted to us, the heritage of English as our first language, our dialect as the language of our ancestors and Malay as the language of our neighbours.<br><br>Those who look down on any one part of their heritage, yes, we can consider them ignorant.But to condemn those that choose to speak English, is highly bigoted and shows a lot about the mindset of the person doing the nasty.<br><br>I'm proud to say I'm extremely fluent in both my English and my mother dialect, Hokkien.Mandarin, as far as I'm concerned, is a political construct and a remnant of the social cohesion policy of the PRC govt.We try to integrate Mandarin into our repertoire of language for the sake of business and cultural exchange.<br><br>What we should be doing is introduce to our children their mother dialect, and not place it behind Mandarin.A true Overseas Chinese, and especially a Peranakan, is well-versed in all three languages of his/her soil.Sadly, my Malay is not up to scratch despite having spent early years of my youth in Borneo..so I'm still learning a little whenever I can.<br><br>Try not to look down on others just because they do not share your helicopter vision.<br><br>Meng3 pek4 bo2?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What i notice from the replies, quite a number of ppl mention abt China booming thingy. I feel that when mention abt greater emphasis on chinese language nowadays, ppl always associate with the reason to learn the language is becoz of China booming economy. Its not the way to think this way, how can a chinese dunno, refuse to learn n hate their own language? Esp among the young chinese here in Singapore... Even give every sch here a world class chinese teacher and system to teach chinese also no use as students attitude n interest to learn their own language is not there.</div>

I assume ur grand parents or parents muz be from english sch tat time? As what i observe, the children from english school parents mostly their children speak english. Now sch teaches two language unlike last time our parents time whereby sch divide into eng n chinese tat teaches purely on each language. Hence, hope the parents nowadays tat know mandrain n eng pls Dun everytime talk eng to their kid which wat i notice. 8 out of 10 young parents still keep on toking eng to their kids.

            <div class='col-md body'>When I was studying in singapore I really hated chinese, I constantly failed everything but surprisingly I could speak it decently well. I didnt know how to speak any dialects cause i never thought they'd be usefull. Ironically, after coming to America, Ive realised that ANY language has its uses. YOu can speak chinese, you've got chinese friends, u speak canto, u have friends from macau and HK, u speak hokkien,you've got taiwanese friends. And it really sucks when your group of friends keep speaking cantonese and you dont understand a word of it. English is very important, but that does not mean Chinese or dialects are of any less importance</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally feel that parents should speak to their children in their mother tongue and dialect.<br><br>There's plenty of practice for English in schools.<br><br>And it only applies to Chinese.
