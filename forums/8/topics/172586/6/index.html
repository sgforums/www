Your postings only go to show your pettiness and immaturity as well as your intolerance against religions in general.<br><br>The kind of blind hate you're exhibiting is nothing different from the terrorists from Afghanistan and Al-Qaaed, the people who were responsible for the Sept 11 attacks.<br><br>But I wouldn't sucpect you're from the Jemaah Islamiyah or a related organisation, as your arguements are too weak in general.<br><br>I just wonder too, how much do you really know about churches in general? You probably think all churchs are like CHC. Have you really been to CHC itself to see how they worship? Or compared it with what goes on at another church?<br><br>I am not a supporter of CHC myself, but if you are going to present yourself as an opposition, at least do it with some credibility at least. And not make empty threats and mindless posts that show how much you lack in maturity.</strong></span></div>

Your postings only go to show your pettiness and immaturity as well as your intolerance against religions in general.<br><br>The kind of blind hate you're exhibiting is nothing different from the terrorists from Afghanistan and Al-Qaaed, the people who were responsible for the Sept 11 attacks.<br><br>But I wouldn't sucpect you're from the Jemaah Islamiyah or a related organisation, as your arguements are too weak in general.<br><br>I just wonder too, how much do you really know about churches in general? You probably think all churchs are like CHC. Have you really been to CHC itself to see how they worship? Or compared it with what goes on at another church?<br><br>I am not a supporter of CHC myself, but if you are going to present yourself as an opposition, at least do it with some credibility at least. And not make empty threats and mindless posts that show how much you lack in maturity.</span></strong>[/b]</blockquote>Thread starter jus seeking to be famous. See 1st post?
