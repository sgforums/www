THAT, is what i call mindless selection. following the trend.<br><br>if ppl say that students who go on to poly will amount to nothing, well perhaps you should not even give a damn about them, because they dont know enough to comment. i have a friend who did very well and went to poly to take chemical engineering, because he's very sure that is what he wants to do, and that he'll be able to move on university after poly.<br><br>therefore, jc is for ppl who 1)either are not sure of what they want to do in the future, or 2) ppl who want to take courses that universities do not permit entry into through diploma results. fair enough?<br><br>however, you have to acknowledge that poly is for ppl who 1) are very sure of wat they want to do in future, 2) want to take courses exclusive to polys, like mass comm, which jcs do not offer, or 3)cannot get into jcs, cannot get into desired poly course, dont want to go to ite, hence choose some unpopular course to enter just for the sake of entering. seriously, look arnd in the forum, whenever it is JAE period dont you see many of such threads arnd the forum?</div></blockquote>Could'nt have put it in a better way.

Anyways, I can see that there are pretty decent people who know that xinyi! just went overboard with her remarks and stuff. lol. Chill man! I was a JC student. Now I am in Uni. I have poly grads in my uni. And some do better then me.

I'm a poly student who could have chose a jc route, i admit i chose it reason being so i wouldn't have to mug like mad in jc yet could comfortably get ahead with further education.<br><br>SO passing by here and seeing poly students labelled as "stupid" is something which i cannot condone. Its a sweeping statement and my cirlce of friends, large part of them whom actually come from jc'es understand that and have no biasness against people like me.<br><br>Seriously Xinyi's statements have made her a bad egg amongst the good. If you don't like something or dislike certain issues, its prolly cos' you don't understand it. And most people who hate others are because they can't be them, its a proven psychological fact. But we all take time to mature, so let this thread be a learning tool.<br><br>Do not persist with your impertinence by flaming the whole population from just one sample cos' it really shouldn't be like this and no problems can be solved this way.</div>
