To keep up with the system. I never said they didnt.  But Poly is also extremely demanding. Blood and sweat goes for both. And i daresay u benefit more from polys.. In terms of skills. But then again i have my opinion u have yours.<br><br>Poly is not an easy way out. Perhaps JCs arent either. But at the end of the day they're continuing what they did in sec school and thats the bottom line. In polys its a challenge learning new things, picking up skills, etc.<br><br>As for polys being more attractive.. Look at the trend..<br><br>My conclusion is.. both ways lead you to ultimately the same destination. So both instituitions have their pros and cons. Both are on equal grounds.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Peace.<br><br></div>

This is coz JCs have had the high and mighty attitude for such a long time.<br><br>Im so sick of ppl saying poly is juz "hands on" stuff. We have tonnes of projects, theory papers, lab papers, tests every few weeks. Its juz as demanding/more demanding.<br><br>Polys equip you with skills for the working world. Thats y its more attractive now. And the courses are getting better. And when you go to poly, there wont be that much adjusting to do in uni.. coz its pretty similar.<br><br>We have presentations every few weeks. We deal with our problems ourselves. Meet our dead lines or else face the consequences. Itz all bout discipline in poly.<br><br>Sure thr r people who arent disciplined la. But as i said slackers r everywhr. Hell i slack at times.
