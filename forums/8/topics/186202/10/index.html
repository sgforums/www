            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>it is written in the papers, in case you havent realised. each yr there is an average of 20000 students who enter poly and 15000 pupils who enter jcs. therefore, if there are 3 batches of poly students and 2 batches of jc students, the ratio of poly students to jc students is only 2:1, not as much as you EXAGGERATE. </blockquote>Again, I can't resist the temptation to reply. Use your brain lah brother/sister.<br><br>You know how to compare year-on-year or not? You take Year 1, Year 2 and Year 3 poly students add together, and Year 1 and Year 2 students add together, which school has more?</div>
