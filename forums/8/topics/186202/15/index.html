This is coz JCs have had the high and mighty attitude for such a long time.<br><br>Im so sick of ppl saying poly is juz "hands on" stuff. We have tonnes of projects, theory papers, lab papers, tests every few weeks. Its juz as demanding/more demanding.<br><br>Polys equip you with skills for the working world. Thats y its more attractive now. And the courses are getting better. And when you go to poly, there wont be that much adjusting to do in uni.. coz its pretty similar.<br><br>We have presentations every few weeks. We deal with our problems ourselves. Meet our dead lines or else face the consequences. Itz all bout discipline in poly.<br><br>Sure thr r people who arent disciplined la. But as i said slackers r everywhr. Hell i slack at times. But you find that in Polys/JCs/Uni watever.</div></blockquote>hey, you know, jc students dont exactly have it all easy, and not everything is about exams. we do have presentations to make, research to do, lab practicals as well.<br><br>i know there are good courses in polytechnics. mass comm, business, tourism and hospitality, chemical engineering. if you are sure of what you want to do, why not? i have friends arnd me who do well and go to poly, because they are very sure of what they want to do, or the course that they want is only available in polytechnics.<br><br>however, i have to add that i have an exclassmate who went on to poly because her father wanted her to go to poly to gain practical experience. at that time, i asked her, "so have you thought about what you want to do?" she hasnt. she has no idea totally. just because her father wants her to gain practical experience. when they both have no idea of practical experience in WHAT area will she be gaining, because she doesnt even have a course in mind. THAT, is what i call mindless selection. following the trend.<br><br>if ppl say that students who go on to poly will amount to nothing, well perhaps you should not even give a damn about them, because they dont know enough to comment. i have a friend who did very well and went to poly to take chemical engineering, because he's very sure that is what he wants to do, and that he'll be able to move on university after poly.<br><br>therefore, jc is for ppl who 1)either are not sure of what they want to do in the future, or 2) ppl who want to take courses that universities do not permit entry into through diploma results. fair enough?<br><br>however, you have to acknowledge that poly is for ppl who 1) are very sure of wat they want to do in future, 2) want to take courses exclusive to polys, like mass comm, which jcs do not offer, or 3)cannot get into jcs, cannot get into desired poly course, dont want to go to ite, hence choose some unpopular course to enter just for the sake of entering. seriously, look arnd in the forum, whenever it is JAE period dont you see many of such threads arnd the forum?</div>
