            <div class='col-md body'>Odex to hire independent auditor to show sincerity<br><br>To prove it is not profiteering from the enforcement actions, Odex will hire an independent auditor to go through its accounts at the end of the case. And every extra dollar will be donated to charity, said Odex director Stephen Sing. Odex is seeking between $3,000 and $5,000 from each illegal downloader. Said Mr Sing: "We are just trying to recover the costs incurred for this (legal) action."<br>.<br>The costs include lawyers' fees and payment to Internet investigation firm BayTSP. Odex also has to pay the ISPs to reveal their subscribers' identities Â– one asked for up to $150 per IP address, said Mr Sing. Out of the 1,000 IP addresses tracked down through SingNet, there were only 400 subscribers, as each user is typically assigned up to four IP addresses. Compensation was sought from 300 "heavy" illegal downloaders.<br>.<br>Odex has settled 105 cases, one of which involved a nine-year-old child Â– most were in their late teens to mid-20s. Odex's lawyer Lau Kok Keng said it had gone to the police at first but was advised to gather the evidence Â– including downloaders' identities Â– on its own.<br>.<br>Looking ahead, Odex, which will launch a video-on-demand website today, is aiming for a "free and legal alternative" for fans by broadcasting anime on free-to-air television. Recently, Singapore became the first country outside Japan to broadcast D.Gray-Man, said Odex managing director Peter Go, with more titles under negotiation.<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/208537.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/208537.asp</a><br><br>Japanese anime firms close ranks with Odex They pledge court action if local provider's appeal fails<br><br>Loh Chee Kong<br>cheekong@mediacorp.com.sg<br>SOME were flown in from Japan. Others appeared on video to show their support of their local representative, anime distributor Odex, which has come under flak from fans for its court actions against illegal downloaders.<br>.<br>At a press conference held by Odex yesterday, the message from nine anime copyright holders Â— including some of Japan's biggest animation studios Â— was clear: They are prepared to take legal action against the wrongdoers directly, should the Singapore courts reject Odex's bid to do so.<br>.<br>After getting court orders to force Internet service providers (ISPs) SingNet and StarHub to hand over subscribers' data, Odex's crackdown on illegal downloading hit a roadblock last Thursday, when the court rejected a similar application against Pacific Internet (PacNet) on the basis that Odex Â— as a sub-licensee Â— was not in a position to file the application. Odex is appealing against the decision.<br>.<br>Remarking that protecting copyright in Singapore "is more difficult than we thought", said international sales and marketing manager Fumiki Yamazaki from Showgate, one of the four Japanese companies in town. He said his firm will not hesitate to "go straight to court" if necessary. Its stance was affirmed by all the other copyright holders present.<br>.<br>The latter were understandably aggrieved, said Odex's director Stephen Sing, as illegal downloading here was rampant.<br>.<br>According to data collated by Silicon Valley-based Internet sleuth firm BayTSP, in the past 10 months, there were 483,310 counts of illegal anime downloading, mainly through peer-to-peer file sharing protocol BitTorrent. This makes Singapore the country with the highest number of illegal downloading counts per capita, at 10.89 per cent Â— far ahead of second-placed Sweden at 3.70 per cent.<br>.<br>Odex's managing director Peter Go added: "Even in the past month, when there was so much coverage on the case, the count went down by only 17 per cent (compared to July)."<br>.<br>Countering online allegations that anime fans had no choice but to turn to illegal downloads due to the poor quality of their DVDs, Mr Go pointed out that fans in focus groups "could not tell the difference" between Odex's products and those sold in Japan when screened on "a 42-inch plasma TV".<br>.<br>As for complaints about the accuracy of the DVD subtitles, Mr Go said the firm had to abide by censorship requirements. "For example, in Fruits Basket, some of the dialogue had to do with love between two boys, so we changed it to them being best friends. As a result, we got bombarded for having poor subtitles," he said.<br>.<br>According to Mr Go, Odex represents 32 copyright holders and distributes 90 per cent of the anime titles sold here.<br>.<br>In the past two years, its DVD sales have fallen by more than 60 per cent. "We hope to achieve at least an 80-to-90-per-cent reduction in illegal downloading. Whether it's realistic or not, we'll have to see," he said.<br>.<br>In other countries, noted TV Tokyo Corporation's manager Yukio Kawasaki, most culprits stop downloading illegally once they have received a complaint letter from the licensee. He said Japanese animation studios usually leave it to their local representatives to take action against copyright infringers.<br>.<br>Based on exchanges with anime fans here, Mr Sing said Odex "understands they will not stop downloading just because we sent them a warning letter".<br>.<br>Toei Animation Enterprises' manager Ryuji Kochi said he "regretted" the negative publicity Odex's legal action had generated. He reiterated that it "takes many people's work" to create animation.<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/208525.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/208525.asp</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Title : Odex says it is not going after illegal downloaders for profit<br>Date : 30 August 2007 2211 hrs (SST)<br>URL : http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/296983/1/.html<br><br>SINGAPORE: Anime distributor Odex has defended its action against illegal downloaders as a form of enforcement against piracy rather than for profit.<br><br>Rumour has it that the company earned some S$15 million by taking action against illegal downloads.<br><br>Computer users, most of them teens, have been pilfering anime titles from the Web.<br><br>In fact, one report even ranked Singapore number one in the world, when it comes to illegal anime downloads per capita.<br><br>Odex has uncovered close to 500,000 cases of illegal downloading so far.<br><br>To further prove its point, Odex has roped in about 30 Japanese copyright holders who have said they will support Odex in its legal move.<br><br>That move saw Odex going to court to force SingNet and StarHub to release the names of its subscribers who have illegally downloaded its cartoons.<br><br>The result - a backlash against Odex.<br><br>Some people have accused the company of sending 1,000 warning letters, each supposedly called for the identified subscriber to pay between S$3,000 and S$5,000 in fines.<br><br>But at a news conference on Thursday, Odex said that there was no fine involved. It said 300 letters were sent out.<br><br>About a third of the recipients settled with Odex for an undisclosed sum. The rest are being mediated.<br><br>The company claimed that any excess money from the move, after deducting costs, will be donated to a charitable cause.<br><br>Odex added that no one was forced to pay beyond his/her means.<br><br>"This exercise was never meant to be just an enforcement. It's not a profiteering mission to get as much money from everybody. It was conceptualized with a very big picture (in mind).<br><br>"Illegal downloaders can download animes for all they want... five years, ten years, there will be nothing left to download. This is the fear that most strikes us. We want to address that situation," said Stephen Sing, director of Odex Pte Ltd.<br><br>That's why Odex still plans to continue what it calls its enforcement process. Its target - an 80 or 90 percent reduction in illegal downloads.<br><br>That seems like quite a stretch, since the company has seen only a 17% drop in illegal downloads this month.<br><br>More importantly, Odex may not have the right to pursue its so-called enforcement after all.<br><br>Despite the company's success against SingTel and StarHub, a judge has ruled that Pacific Internet does not have to give up the names of its subscribers who have been accused of illegally downloading anime.<br><br>This is because the court found that Odex is just a sub-licensee and not the copyright owner or exclusive licensee for most of the anime titles sold in Singapore.<br><br>Odex says it will launch an appeal to reverse the latest court ruling. - CNA/ir<br><br><span class="small">Copyright Â© 2006 MCN International Pte Ltd</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Threatening has no effect on me. If ODEX loses, that's good. If the Japanese comes down, it's even better. It's your own anime, you don't protect, who else will protect it? And don't forget, our copyright laws only applies to an exclusive licensee or the copyright owner. ODEX is not, no one will protect you. Authorizing ODEX to do so will only irk customers.<br><br>Plus, with a subbing like "That's guy look so cool!", you expect me to buy? The whole sentence is not only incoherent, it's also grammatically incorrect. That's guy = That is guy.<br><br>That is guy look so cool! Hello?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And thank you ODEX for blocking me. Obviously, you have no idea that all Singapore connections are masked, as required by laws. Bunch of idiots.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Auditors have always been independent. Getting independent auditors is very redundant, unless of course, you have been playing with your accounts. If that is so, good luck. Like NKF, you will go.<br><br><blockquote>Odex also has to pay the ISPs to reveal their subscribers' identities Â– one asked for up to $150 per IP address, said Mr Sing. Out of the 1,000 IP addresses tracked down through SingNet, there were only 400 subscribers, as each user is typically assigned up to four IP addresses.</blockquote>Very good. It makes it sounds like you bribe Singnet.<br><br>And haven't I said you are too dumb? This is the second time you've admitted that IP addresses is not a solid evidence. Fancy of you to hire an ex-hacker to disprove the whole theory.<br><br><blockquote>Looking ahead, Odex, which will launch a video-on-demand website today, is aiming for a "free and legal alternative" for fans by broadcasting anime on free-to-air television.</blockquote><blockquote>After getting court orders to force Internet service providers (ISPs) SingNet and StarHub to hand over subscribers' data, Odex's crackdown on illegal downloading hit a roadblock last Thursday, when the court rejected a similar application against Pacific Internet (PacNet) on the basis that Odex Â— as a sub-licensee Â— was not in a position to file the application. Odex is appealing against the decision.</blockquote>Skull's too thick. Which part of our Copyright Act do you not understand?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Get the Japanese to fly to Singapore!<br><br><blockquote>Remarking that protecting copyright in Singapore "is more difficult than we thought", said international sales and marketing manager Fumiki Yamazaki from Showgate, one of the four Japanese companies in town. He said his firm will not hesitate to "go straight to court" if necessary. Its stance was affirmed by all the other copyright holders present.</blockquote>Nice attitude. I like. Of course, it's difficult to protect copyright here, because ODEX don't own you, neither is ODEX the exclusive licensee. A Japanese translator will help.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote>Countering online allegations that anime fans had no choice but to turn to illegal downloads due to the poor quality of their DVDs, Mr Go pointed out that fans in focus groups "could not tell the difference" between Odex's products and those sold in Japan when screened on "a 42-inch plasma TV".</blockquote>Tell me how many of us own a 42-inch plasma TV. You are being very unrealistic.<br><br><blockquote>As for complaints about the accuracy of the DVD subtitles, Mr Go said the firm had to abide by censorship requirements. "For example, in Fruits Basket, some of the dialogue had to do with love between two boys, so we changed it to them being best friends. As a result, we got bombarded for having poor subtitles," he said.</blockquote>Including bad grammar and incoherent sentences? Obviously, summary skills learnt from secondary school didn't help you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote>According to Mr Go, Odex represents 32 copyright holders and distributes 90 per cent of the anime titles sold here.</blockquote>As I've said, you are too unrealistic. Stop living Mars and come back to Earth please.<br><br><blockquote>In the past two years, its DVD sales have fallen by more than 60 per cent. "We hope to achieve at least an 80-to-90-per-cent reduction in illegal downloading. Whether it's realistic or not, we'll have to see," he said.</blockquote>Too full of yourself. We will be glad that it goes down by half, you expect a near 100% reduction in illegal downloads.<br><br><blockquote>Based on exchanges with anime fans here, Mr Sing said Odex "understands they will not stop downloading just because we sent them a warning letter".<br><br>Toei Animation Enterprises' manager Ryuji Kochi said he "regretted" the negative publicity Odex's legal action had generated. He reiterated that it "takes many people's work" to create animation.</blockquote>Because Singapore laws don't allow them to do so. Simple.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Again.  If the anime copyright holders wish to convey Exclusive License to ODEX, it will be a different story.<br><br>But for this saga, ODEX most probably did not obtain exclusive licensee status BEFORE all the letters were sent out for all the animes they demanded compensation for.  Exclusive Licensing is something the copyright owners should THINK carefully before giving as it entitles them to the same rights as the copyright owners.<br><br>In a way defending what Judge Lau said, he did not feel that ODEX was the right people to make the request or to take action.  It probably meant that the Judge did not see any evidence that ODEX was the Exclusive Licensee for all the animes mentioned.  And he was right to remind everyone that protecting our privacy doesn't mean that we can infringe copyrights.<br><br>AnimeSuki's explanation on Licensed Fansubs is worth looking at.<br><br><blockquote>Fansubs violate copyrights<br>We have to admit it: the distribution of fansubs is technically a violation of copyright under the WTO TRIPS agreement. However the TRIPS agreement does not demand that distribution of copyrighted material is a criminal offence unless it is done on a commercial scale. This means it is up to the copyright holder to bring the offender to court. The copyright of unlicensed material is held by the original creator. In the case of anime this usually means the Japanese distribution company. If something is licenced, the licensee holds the copyright and thus the right to sue any copyright infringers within the area covered by the license. </blockquote>With the TRIPS agreement in mind, ODEX's letter stepped out of bounds when it threatened criminal prosecution when they knew it was not done on a Commercial scale.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in the light of all this, what is odex's or rather, stephin sing real intention? many of anime lovers claim them to be profiteering, while odex claim that they want to cut down illegal downloading. However, by the looks of things, i do feel that their actions can also be revenged-motivated. why? thats because their sales have decreased by 60% over the years, even if they win this lawsuit against pacnet and takes more action against downloaders, after which there will be less downloaders, more anime fans will only switch to online streaming, boycott products or search for other methods already. Thus i dont see why odex have the motivation/be a hero and help police curb illegal downloading, other then seeking to cover up losses suffered over these few years and to take a wicked revenge against downloaders.<br><br>i ve no evidence tho, above are just my views and imagination</div>
