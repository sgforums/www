            <div class='col-md body'>Why are they so silly? It's fan-subs afterall right?<br><br>So technically people record those anime from FREE tv broadcast in japan and then translate them into subtitles to share it.<br><br>Therefore, they can't sue those people who downloaded fan-subs cos those people do not know it's illegal to do so. I mean put it this way, if you happened to record a mediacorp show and then put in your own subtitles and share it with your friends overseas...does that means mediacorp will sue you for it? Can they do that?<br><br>Frankly speaking, if nobody made any profits out of this fan-sub issue...there is no case at all. At the most once the person received such a letter make sure that they removed all traces of those "illegal" (to Odex) animes from their premises immediately, Odex might ended up paying more for the court proceedings than the accused (Cos it's easy to claim that the accused wasn't aware that fan-subbing isn't legal in Singapore and wasn't using it to make any personal gain out of it. Moreover, the accused has realised that it was against the beneficial of Odex...therefore had all "illegal" fan-subs removed from his premises upon the awareness from Odex).<br><br>If everyone do that, Odex also cannot do anything but they will need to face the fact that the public will be silently boycotting all their products. It's normal in Singapore and it's called politics. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

If more then one of us are willing to fight it out in court, I believe the sheer amount of court case bills that odex have to fight will eventually bankrupt them.

Win or lose, lawyers still get paid. [Defending lawyers looking at their clients as Cash Cows too....hmmmm....perhaps..heheheh]<br><br>If the alleged subscribers [ie the defending team] lose the court case.....they will have more than just having to pay up the initial $5000.00 demanded. They will also end up paying the court fees, conplainent [ie Odex] lawyers fees, and their lawyers' fees!!<br><br>That's gonna cost more than the $5k demanded from each alleged downloaders.<br><br>And what about Odex?? No extra cash outlay. Cause, Odex's lawyers fees for the court case will be paid by the losing defence team [ie alleged subscribers].
