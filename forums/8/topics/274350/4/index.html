So ppl are easily tempted to download them, and some even think that it should be legal to download.</div></blockquote>I'm sorry, whats so "illegal" about downloading anime again?<br><br>As long as the copyright holders in Japan are not the ones requesting Odex to take action, I don't see what justification there is for Odex to be so kaypoh.<br><br>Even if the anime someone download is also distributed by Odex, as long as its not THEIR Sub, not their work, I don't see how wrong it is.  Say, for example, ODEX subs XXX anime into english for distribution.<br><br>1.   Is someone who downloads XXX anime subbed in Spanish liable to compensate Odex?<br><br>2.  Is someone who downloads XXX anime subbed in English, and thinks he PREFERS eg Shinsen-Sub cos they have better English than ODEX distributed Subs wrong?<br><br>So where is the right for a consumer to exercise his right?  I can choose based on pricing, and quality.  In terms of pricing (which happens to be FREE...) and quality, if OTHER fansubs are better in my opinion, then its just too frickin bad for ODEX.<br><br>However, if lets say the copyright owners in Japan, have already stated that they do not wish their anime to be distributed on the net anymore, I think as anime fans, we should respect their decision.  Some have done so, some have not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I posted an article from Todayonline in another thread.<br><br>linked below:<br><br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=275223<br><br>Frankly, no need to overly complicate the matter on this... no need to look at the Japan situation cos Japan's laws are not extraterritorial and ODEX is taking action under the Singapore Copyright Act.<br><br>Copyright Act S136(3A) Quoted as per below:<br><br><blockquote><br>(3A) Where, at any time when copyright subsists in a work Â—<br><br>(a) a person does any act that constitutes an infringement of the copyright in a work other than an act referred to in subsection (1), (2), (3) or (6);<br><br>(b) the infringement of the copyright in the work by the person is wilful; and<br><br>(c) either or both of the following apply:<br><br>(i) the extent of the infringement is significant;<br><br>(ii) the person does the act to obtain a commercial advantage,<br><br>the person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding $50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.<br></blockquote>So in a nutshell, I wonder how ODEX is going to substantiate its claim that (i) the extent of the infringement is significant and/or (ii) the person does the act to obtain a commercial advantage...<br></div>
