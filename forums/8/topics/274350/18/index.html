Its just a mere distraction.<br><br>Odex failed :-<br>1.  As a distributor to release their licensed anime quick enough for the anime fans here, and when the anime fans are tired of waiting and go for fansubs, they decide to sue them.  This is the internet age.  If you can't keep up, you get kicked out.  Fansubs are faster and apparently are of better quality.<br><br>2.  To assure the quality of their subbing, and video standards.  No Singaporean wants to buy sub-standard products when better ones are available cheaply, and in this case FREELY.<br><br>From a consumer point of view, he is being sued because he sought an alternative due to the lack of availability of the product he desires, and finally when the product is out, it is of inferior quality.<br><br>They ought to be grateful that those consumers who bought their crappy products didn't make any reports to CASE about it.<br><br>Finally, I sincerely doubt the court will rule in favor of releasing the identities of the PacNet subscribers.  I think one of the Straits Times columnist made it quite clear that, Odex, or whoever, is able to come up with concrete proof, that those individuals have "illegally" downloaded some licensed material of THEIRS, then the court will order PacNet to hand over the names of the subscribers behind the IP.  Again, IP addresses cannot pin point an individual, especially in this wireless-rampant environment.<br><br>If for some reason (eg. wireless network broken into), the names were given to Odex, and the subscribers were NOT responsible for the downloads, then the Privacy of the subscribers would have been breached unfairly.<br><br>IMO If this happened before the advent of wireless networks, Odex could get away with it.  Having the IP address roughly narrows it to one household.  And the subscriber would have to be somewhat responsible.<br><br>But with wireless networks, its not narrowing down the "illegal" downloader to 1 house hold, but possibly, a few clusters of households.  It would be unfair to burden the subscriber when home-wireless network equipment are insecure when compared to industry equipment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ho ho, Board of Flim Censors shoot back liao<br><br><strong>Subtitles must be done accurately: Censors<br>Letter form Tan Lee Cheng, Senior Asst Director (Film Standards), Board of Film Censors</strong><br><br>We refer to the article "Japanese anime firms close ranks with Odex" (Aug 31).<br><br>Mr Peter Go, managing director of Odex, is said to have commented that the subtitles of some of his anime series had to be tweaked to conform to the Board of Film Censors' (BFC) requirements.<br><br>This statement is not correct and the BFC would like to take this opportunity to clarify its position.<br><br>Subtitles are usually provided by distributors to reach out to a wider audience or to translate content that may be in a foreign language (example, Japanese anime). There are occasions when the quality of translation may be the cause of poor subtitling. This has nothing to do with the classification process but it is still worthwhile for distributors to address as consumers would expect to have accurate translation of purchased works.<br><br>It is also the distributor's responsibility to ensure that subtitles reflect the true content of an anime (that is, animation) especially its dialogue and commentary. If subtitles are not accurate, they can mislead the viewer and also make it difficult for the BFC to classify an anime accurately.<br><br>The BFC has never asked for subtitles to be tweaked. We require that subtitles accurately reflect the content of a film or video so that we can classify the content accurately. Inaccurate subtitles also do no service to the community or to the young who may be misled into thinking that an anime is suitable for them when it could be meant for a higher age group.<br><br>As the ratings for videos (including anime) range from G to M18, there is sufficient leeway to allow for the subtitling of mature content without subtitles having to be tweaked.<br><br>We urge all distributors to translate and subtitle their content accurately so that they can provide an informative service to viewers.<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/209169.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/209169.asp</a></div>

In the article, it quotes the 2006 issue of Reason Magazine, saying, that the Japanese animation industry reached an astonishing $80 billion in 2004, which was 10 times what they were, in 2003.<br><br>These fansubs have helped promoted otherwise unknown titles of Japanse animation to popularity.<br><br>The comment by the author was made in response to Mr Go's statement that the Japanese animation industries banded together for crackdown action to prevent a possible collapse, like the South Korean ones.<br><br>I think most anime fans know the real reason behind South Korean animation industry collapse.  Fansubs couldn't save them simply cos the Korean language is not as well proliferated as the Japanese language, hence lesser fansubs, and lower market penetration.  It was not due to piracy that forced them to shut down.<br><br>My personal opinions regarding this remain the same.  Odex is doing this because their profits, NOT the Japanese animation industry's has been hurt by fansubs.  Now, if they had been providing quality products, and released them quickly via the internet in pay-per-download fashion, I would FULLY support their attempt to sue "illegal downloaders." <strong>Anime fans today DON'T WANT to wait months for a VCD/DVD to be released with crappy subtitling. They want their fix of their fav anime as soon as its out.</strong><br><br>Also, Odex failed to understand that its these fansubs that have brought awareness &amp; popularity to THEIR products.<br><br>Without the fansubs and anime fans who downloaded (may i add, well subbed) animes, Odex would have no business to be in at all.  Positive experience from these fansubs have brought about awareness to the new animes by recommendations and reviews.<br><br>Dear Odex, stop antagonizing all the anime fans that are supposed to form your customer base.  You have to match the fansubs in quality, and speed before most anime fans would support your enforcement action.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Isn't it very obvious that from their first post till now all their reactions , you can already tell that they are only concerned with how to milk money from consumers . Since you don't buy our stuff so we'll sue you for downloading lor , and since now it has blown into a big thingy they are now trying to push blame to other pple or dept whever they can in the hope that pple won't flame them so much . But from what i see , these pple are really gutless , dare to post and do but don't dare to admit their own mistakes , always trying to chose the easy way out , another guniang . As we all heard this saying before " by hook or by crook " , so if they can't do it by hook , so they do it by crook lor . Anyway i hate that " fellas " face also , the one who posted the first remark abt fining downloader . Can't make money through hardwork then now trying to use the easy way and employing taichi , truly despicable .</div>
