            <div class='col-md body'>If Odex believes in charity, it should issue a stern warning Â— and stop at that SingNet's 'consent': What is the actual position<br><br>Letter from Matthew Yim Yew Fei<br>Letter from Steven Lo Chock Fei<br><br>I wish to raise some legal concerns over Odex's crackdown on anime pirates..<br>After Odex's failure to get a court order against Pacific Internet, the firm invited executives from Japanese anime firms like Toei to come to Singapore to defend its actions. In an interview, Odex's founders, Mr Peter Go and Mr Stephen Sing, vowed to continue their crackdown. However, certain legal issues relating to such a crackdown need to be resolved.<br>.<br>Odex is just a local distributor of anime in Singapore. It is unlike the Business Software Alliance (BSA) or the Composers and Authors Society of Singapore (Compass).<br>.<br>When the BSA legally settles and receives compensation from somebody who had used use pirated software, it is taken that the culprit has paid his or her dues to the legal owners since the BSA has links to major software firms. Likewise for music infringement, Compass acts on behalf of the many music composers and publishers, saving the wrong-doer from further legal burden unless he commits another infringement.<br>.<br>When a person who illegally downloads settles with Odex, is he or she still liable for other lawsuits if other anime distributors and production houses also wish to sue? Can a Japanese production company like Toei still sue the person over other downloaded anime which the firm owns but which Odex does not have the licence to distribute?.<br><br>If Odex does not have the legal right on behalf of other firms, families who have settled may face further lawsuits and possible financial ruin because of the foolish act of the children.<br>.<br>A Government agency like the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore should look into this to reach a deal for everyone.<br>.<br>Odex said that it would donate any excess compensation to charities. My question to it: Why can't Odex be charitable to those families with mitigating reasons and let them off with a stern warning?.<br><br>In the recent court case where Odex was seeking details of those who downloaded anime illegally, District Judge Earnest Lau said that "for the SingNet case, the court order was made by consent" and that "SingNet did not even appear in court".<br>.<br>However, SingNet subsequently clarified that it did not "consent" to the demands by Odex. This clarification contradicts the District Judge's words.<br>.<br>Perhaps the authorities could clear the air on the issue.<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/209147.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/209147.asp</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Precisely.  Its this kinda companies like Odex, that come up with crappy products, and wants to sue people "for the greater good" of the industry that disgusts me.<br><br>If they were really concerned about the "greater good" they would have put in effort in their VCD/DVD quality assurance, and hasten releases in the first place.  They come up with half baked products and want to tell people they are acting for the greater good.  Do they honestly think Singaporeans are stupid?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can agree no dubbing please , because i am a naruto fan and have seen the " local official release " of the naruto vcd ( i'm not sure abt dvd dubbing ) . I find that after dubbing it from jap to chinese , the names sounded rather gay or even downright stupid . If i were to dl or buy pirated version , i still can accept substandard quality in dubbing and subtitle ( the worst subtitle in english so far is the DevilMan which i had to crack my head just to think what are they trying to say actually ) orginal dvd somemore . So if you want pple to support orginal stuff , show us some quality otherwise get lost and keep quiet . Your poor business is due to your short cutting and cutting down on budget to get more profits . I personally also find that some dl version have much better quality original ones .</div>
