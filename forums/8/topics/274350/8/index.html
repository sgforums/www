            <div class='col-md body'>frm HWZ...very good writing to this saga.....<br><br><blockquote><br><br>Although this might not be absolutely relevant to the Odex saga, I think the anime culture in Japan itself affects the attitudes of the anime and manga industry towards copyrights.<br><br>As pointed out earlier, within the the anime and manga scene in Japan, there are cosplayers and doujins writers. The same copyright laws that apply to fansubs apply to the participants of these classes of people as well. But this class of people (who are fans of this anime culture) feed the passion and interests of the fans, the very consumers who pay good money into this anime and manga industry.<br><br>The industry feeds off these cosplayers and doujin writers, and even go so faras to acknowledge and accept their presence - seen through allowing their participation, printing and sale of these doujins at manga fairs. To say nay to the fansubbers is to say nay as well to these classes of people, and therefore the industry players are wary not to exercise their rights absolutely to the extent to kill off the very fans feeding their consumers.<br><br>To those in the know of the culture in Japan, these anime and manga fans (otakus) are usually ostracised for their hobby. If you go for karaoke with you Japanese boss, picking a popular pop song might win you a raised eyebrow but picking an anime theme song kill your career. It is like dirty hobby, in the eyes of the general public. Shutting down on the fans who through cosplaying, fansubbing and doujins win more fans over to the "dark side" is itself commercial suicide.<br><br>But outside Japan, the attitudes towards anime and manga is different. Maybe some people will feel it is childish to still read "comics" and to watch "cartoons". Maybe some people will feel the hentai or ero-games that are part and parcel of the culture is distasteful and lewd. But because the fanbase outside of Japan is so much smaller, likewise the negative attitudes towards the fans are not as established or apparent. To this end, perhaps the industry players may wish to enforce their copyrights, but the question is to what end?<br><br>The way the industry works, as far as I know, is that the animation companies profit through sales of licences for exclusive distribution, licencing to television networks and use of their works for advertisements. Where they are involved in sales of media, it is usually within Japan itself and rarely overseas. The same goes for manga; overseas sales usually only involve an overseas distributor buying over the copyrights, translating the manga and selling it. The reason is basically that Japan has the highest concentration of Japanese speaking people in the world and these industry players in Japan are only producing goods for the Japanese speaking people. For everywhere else, they sell their licence. So the question they have to ask themselves in enforcing their copyrights overseas is "What benefit does it bring to me?"<br><br>Fansubs, just like doujins and cosplayers, feed the hobbyist and create an overseas culture for the goods these Japanese animating companies are selling. Because they are interested in selling licences for distribution, that the fact that there is fan base for distribution promotes their licence. They are not selling the medium (DVDs/VCDs) themselves to these overseas fans, they are only selling the licences. It is for the distributors who purchase these licences to worry about the fansubbers and downloaders. Thus, these distributors have the shortend of the stick.<br><br>But why do people still buy when they can download? In part the otaku culture is beyond just watching animes and knowing stuff about it. It is a serious hobby. Just like collecting stamps, it is not enough to just own a photocopy of a rare stamp. It is not enough to own a computer graphic of a scan of a rare stamp. You must own that stamp.<br><br>Likewise, otakus in Japan pour money for limited edition DVDs that can cost several times more than the regular versions. People spend thousands of yens on toy figurines that do nothing but collect dust. And this culture is contagious enough to affect overseas fans. To bring the point back to our little island, Odex if it is failed in anything is the failure to promote this otaku culture in Singapore. It has not produced quality DVDs, take part in fairs and promote limited edition or special edition goods. Heck, they don't even do a good job at subbing.<br><br>But I digress. The point I am trying to make is this: anime and manga is not music, movies or computer games. It is a fantasy world promoted and sustained by the fans through imitation in various forms of the work they support. It is as likely that the industry players would kill off fansubs as they would kill off they doujin writers and the cosplayers. We're talking about a different industry from Hollywood, it's a different kettle of fish.<br><br></blockquote><a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com/showthread.php?t=1704654&amp;page=5" rel="nofollow">http://forums.hardwarezone.com/showthread.php?t=1704654&amp;page=5</a></div>
