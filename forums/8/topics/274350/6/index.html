And it seems that as long as we don't profit from it commercially.<br><br>In Japan, where the copyright owners are, they can record a broadcast and distribute as long as its not for profit.<br><br>What we have on the internet are essentially hi-quality recordings of these broadcast from Japan.  They are subbed over by kind souls for ppl like us OUTSIDE Japan to watch and enjoy.<br><br>I think the last part is interesting.<br><br><blockquote>(c) causing the film or recording to be seen or heard in public.</blockquote>The internet domain is considered public.  But did any of these ppl who were sent letters directly CAUSE its circulation?<br><br>Finally, I guess the people who received the letters for 80k claims, should really check in with the lawyers and if necessary, go to court.  I don't believe they should let ODEX just claim statutory damages just like that.<br><br>If really so good to earn,  I also go and obtain a few licences for anime to sub n distribute.

Worst of all they showed letters of OTHER anime distributors to let Odex help them to claim payment but the thing is, they are distributors but not the copyright holder themselves!</div>
