" this way, even tho doesnt make them less of a villain cux they r waging war against anime fans, it reflects better on their company's reputation in the industry. But now its their product also suck still come out n sue ppl, it just doesnt seem that they are heroic, it just reflects on their intention of profiteering.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Topic: shld we buy anime from odex?<br><br>no. point is the bad subtitling<br><br>i tink that the japan company should translate it properly, then import it to spore. at an affordable price. odex should translate it properly, in order for their products to sell. i remember tat seeing on mda webby that can sent video for checking, since odex is in this business, they should do it properly, if not, lossing customers is the usual happening.<br><br>in conclusion, i tink that the bad subtitling led ppl to download instead,  becos the element in my mind is-why pay for bad stuff? thus, the propersition team is unstable and we shld not follow their motion.<br><br>so this essay can get A or not? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thinking about it properly, What are Odex's products that they want to claim damages from?<br><br>The anime? No. If you look porperly, Odex is a SUB-LICENSE owner of the anime. THat means, Odex have no rights on the anime itself. What Odex has rights over is the stuff they sell. The CDs, the box cover and their crappy subtitles.<br><br>So what did any of the "illegal downloaders" steal from Odex to create damages? People download fansubs which consists of the anime and subtitles buy the fansubs. Did the downloaders copy the Odex's box cover? Did the downloaders copy Odex's CD design? Did the downloaders copy Odex's crappy subtitles?<br><br>If the answers for the 3 above question is "NO", then Odex have no rights to sue people in the 1st place.<br><br>And since Odex has no rights to sue the downloaders in the 1st place, sending any threats for money sounds something like something from the Penal code.<br><br><blockquote>Extortion (Penal Code, Cap 224, Sec 383)<br><br>Whoever intentionally puts any person in fear of any injury* to that person or to any other, and thereby dishonestly induces the person so put in fear to deliver to any person any property or valuable security, or anything signed or sealed which may be converted into a valuable security, commits Â“extortionÂ”.<br><br>Illustrations<br>(a) ODEX threatens to publish a defamatory libel concerning DOWNLOADER, unless DOWNLOADER gives him (ODEX) money. He thus induces DOWNLOADER to give him money. ODEX has committed "extortion".<br><br>Simpler terms: Since Odex has no rights is sueing people, Odex is now unlawfully threatening people for money.<br><br>*injury = injury to mind, body, reputation or property<br><br>And Extortion is a seizable offence i.e. can be arrested without a warrant</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Beginning the reason was they never practice Quality Assurance (I'm gleefully applying words I learnt in class here!) in their anime production line.<br><br>Now the main reason is everyone's blacklisting them.

            <div class='col-md body'>If the japanese want to come down to sue us, come lor. How much money time to sue a amt of anime lovers in sg.<br><br>There are much more ppl downloading  in other countries. Even they did come down, they will just sue a few and stop. cus the money and time needed it is not wise to do tat. I sure the japanese knows that. They say all this thing in SG is to boost confidential in Odex and to force the judge to think twice b4 doing anything.<br><br>Boycotting their staff is not much help,  but it will hurt their profit. they wont close down since they are selling to other countries and air to channel like E City.<br><br>If odex from the start make their quality a good 1 from the start(Such as Sub)....I am sure there will be people who will buy them.<br><br>Well, I can say we anime lovers are fighting a losing war, but we youngster can find other alternatives to watch anime. Or some hero create a new program to let ppl download.<br><br>Just like in the past, ppl use IRC to dL song and movies. They catch us. We move to lime wirer or kazza did the same thing, now torrent. I am sure future there will be some alternatives for us.</div>
