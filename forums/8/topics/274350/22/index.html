Such hearings are typically closed door affairs.<br><br>While it is hard to say what Mr Go or Dr Toh's affidavits contain, the BayTSP affidavit will probably include details of how the alleged downloaders were discovered.<br><br>The earlier judge, District Judge Ernest Lau, had noted in his judgement that the onus should be on BayTSP to explain how the alleged downloaders were tracked, not Odex.<br><br>Earlier this year, Odex, which distributes anime here, sent letters demanding settlement sums of between $3,000 and $5,000 to several hundred people it alleged were downloading pirated anime.<br><br>It had successfully obtained court orders to get the names of downloaders from SingNet and StarHub.<br><br>In August though, district judge Ernest Lau turned down Odex's request for a court order to obtain the names of similar alleged downloaders from PacNet.<br><br>A date for the hearing and a decision has not yet been set.<br><br>Copyright Â© 2007 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
