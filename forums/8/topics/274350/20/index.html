            <div class='col-md body'>I find it funny man,<br><br>People use to say when DL movies and music, u will get bad quality such as the sound or the image of the movie is bad. Or u may see ppl moving around, talking in the moves when u dl movie.  And the music will not be as great as the original. So they encourage ppl to buy original. This is quite true, as some priated dvd have had quality<br><br>However, in anime when u support original, u received crappy quality and sub. How can odex want us to support original when they give us this kind of crap.<br><br>Isn't  Odex encouraging anime lover to download? Since we paid to receive crap products.<br><br>Odex top management are stupid people.</div>

This crackdown could have scared some into buying legal goods. And this group, I believe, doesn't know that there are other anime distributors as well.</div>

Subscribers can click on the link on the notice; they will be asked to acknowledge receipt of the notice and promise not to download any more pirated anime.<br><br>If they deny they have done this, they will have a chance to explain their position with the same link.<br><br>Mr Sing said if the subscriber does not respond, the firm will consider a court order to get his ISP to release his details.<br><br>The firm has changed tactics hoping the individual with the Internet subscription - often a parent whose child is downloading anime at home - will rein in such activities if they find out about them.[/b]</blockquote>The firm has changed tactics hoping the individual with the Internet subscription - often a parent whose child is downloading anime at home - will rein in such activities if they find out about them.<br><br>"Almost all the parents we spoke to said they would have stopped their children from downloading if they had known about it," said Mr Sing.<br><br>He said downloaders are more combative and believe they should be allowed to continue downloading copyrighted content.<br><br>A survey by the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore this year showed only one in five people here is "bothered" by copyright infringement.<br><br>Odex sent a warning list to the National University of Singapore (NUS) earlier this year.<br><br>Professor Alan Chan, associate provost for undergraduate education, said NUS has formally warned a number of students.<br><br>"As an educational institution, we must protect and honour the integrity of intellectual property," said Prof Chan.<br><br>Source: The Straits Times, Tuesday, 18th Sept 2007, Pg H2</div>
