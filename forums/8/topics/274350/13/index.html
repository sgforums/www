            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Odex says it is not going after illegal downloaders for profit<br>By Foo Siew Shyan, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 30 August 2007 2211 hrs<br><br>SINGAPORE: Anime distributor Odex has defended its action against illegal downloaders as a form of enforcement against piracy rather than for profit.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Rumour has it that the company earned some S$15 million by taking action against illegal downloads. </span><br><br>Computer users, most of them teens, have been pilfering anime titles from the Web.<br><br>In fact, one report even ranked Singapore number one in the world, when it comes to illegal anime downloads per capita.<br><br>Odex has uncovered close to 500,000 cases of illegal downloading so far.<br><br>To further prove its point, Odex has roped in about 30 Japanese copyright holders who have said they will support Odex in its legal move.<br><br>That move saw Odex going to court to force SingNet and StarHub to release the names of its subscribers who have illegally downloaded its cartoons.<br><br>The result - a backlash against Odex.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Some people have accused the company of sending 1,000 warning letters, each supposedly called for the identified subscriber to pay between S$3,000 and S$5,000 in fines.</span><br><br>But at a news conference on Thursday, Odex said that there was no fine involved.<br><br>300 letters were sent out, it said.<br><br>About a third of the recipients settled with Odex for an undisclosed sum.<br><br>The rest are being mediated.<br><br><span style="color: red;">The company claimed that any excess money from the move, after deducting costs, will be donated to a charitable cause</span>.<br><br>Odex added that no one was forced to pay beyond his/her means.<br><br>"This exercise was never meant to be just an enforcement. It's not a profiteering mission to get as much money from everybody. It was conceptualized with a very big picture (in mind). Illegal downloaders can download animes for all they want....five years, ten years, there will be nothing left to download. This is the fear that most strikes us. We want to address that situation," said Stephen Sing, director of Odex Pte Ltd.<br><br>That's why Odex still plans to continue what it calls its enforcement process.<br><br>Its target - an 80 or 90 percent reduction in illegal downloads.<br><br>That seems like quite a stretch, since the company has seen only a 17% drop in illegal downloads this month.<br><br>More importantly, Odex may not have the right to pursue its so-called enforcement after all.<br><br>Despite the company's success against SingTel and StarHub, a judge has ruled that Pacific Internet does not have to give up the names of its subscribers who have been accused of illegally downloading anime.<br><br>This is because the court found that Odex is just a sub-licensee and not the copyright owner or exclusive licensee for most of the anime titles sold in Singapore.<br><br>Odex says it will launch an appeal to reverse the latest court ruling. - CNA/ir<br><br></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> self righteousness</div>

A judge had turned down its request last Thursday (Aug 23).<br><br>To date, Odex has sent out 300 letters, from the 1,000 Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that SingTel had provided. An IP address is a string of numbers that can identify a user, although web addresses are commonly shared here.<br><br>StarHub has also been served with a court order to provide Odex with another 100 ISP addresses.<br><br>The Odex fracas has led to fervent online chatter with some anime fans vilifying Odex and others voicing outrage over the court orders forcing Internet Service Providers to reveal the names of their subscribers.<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/STIStory_153203.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/STIStory_153203.html</a></div></blockquote>They can bring in whoever they want.  They still need to have a documentation from those copyright holders stating that ODEX is the EXCLUSIVE LICENSEE so that they can take action the behalf of the copyright holders.<br><br>And they have to show that such an agreement was in effect before ODEX even began to send those letters.  Otherwise, its like driving a car before getting your license.</div>

IP addresses logged by those streaming servers won't be our real IP addresses. All Singapore connections going out are masked by a proxy and is needed under the law.<br><br>2. Depending on where the servers are hosted, they are unlikely to be able to get hold of the IP addresses, even with a court order, due to DPA or Data Protection Act.

What they stress is you must get the anime legally or they will make your life hellish. Simple.
