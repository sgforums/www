I told her that she is not fit to be an HR Manager (more like a s.l.u.t in geylang). I sent my resume over to her and she doesn't even bother to read the details before asking me to come for the interview. If the company could not afford to pay me the salary i'm expecting, what the heck they shortlisted me and ask me to come for the interview. Wsting my time &amp; money.<br><br></div></blockquote>u r my idol!!<br>u r right at getting back at her.<br>no one can insult anyone.<br>i've once kana a very jia lat HR mgr, she reli insult me to the core, but i didnt do anything &amp; keep my cool. ( i shd insult her back actually!) i regretted my kindness to her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u noe what, i encounter exactly the same thing as u.. and it not once but twice.. previously i went to this company to interview, i send in my resume and state my expected salary there.. then they ask me come down for an interview. so i came down and the manager assistant interview me. after that interview, she wans me to come down for the second interview to meet the manager. seriously, i really pin high hope for that since it a second interview.. so the nx day i make a trip down. this time round the manager didn;t meet me personally and instrad he ask his another colleague to interview me. during the process everything was ok until he suddenly say that i am over qualified for this position and say he cun pay me that kind of pay.. when i heard that, i really feel like scolding the guy.. waste of my time and effort.. i mean why the hell did they have to ask me come down again since i am over qualified.. didn;t i state all this out in my resume? sux man.. but i didn;t scold the fellow.  i kip my cool.. no pt wasting my effort scolding pple like him<br><br>then the nx interview i went is an it firm.. once again i already states my expected pay then he say he cun afford me, pay me 400 bucks less. i was like wtf!! waste my time like that..  i went out of the office in an angry manner<br><br>so now i learn my lesson, it best to neogitate the pay with them when they call me up for interview, or esle no point going down. it wil be another wasted trip.</div>
