              <p>I've gotten into countless mini-rows with her over how I disagree and dislike the way she does things.

              <p>My dad is taking her for a holiday. It's so rare. I've never seen him doing this before. He's taking her to a place she's never been before.

I told her, can you keep an open mind and stop complaining about what you haven't even seen and experienced? I think she should try to appreciate my dad a little more. He works overseas most of the time, and last year he even asked if my mom would like to move over to live with him but she declined to.</p>

              <p>haha, i know the feeling, my sis always complained that my
              parents are nice to me and my bro, altho she did behave like a
              spoilt brat</p>
              <p>but even when ur brother got treated better doesnt mean you are
              like cinderella or yue niang</p>
              <p>i would really suggest to let go of this, who knows, u could
              reap better rewards in future, whether its career or a doting
              hubby</p>
              <p>like i said, take the burden off you bah, its doesnt have
              physical impact in ur life and you are not going to end up like
              Princess Margaret</p>
