Its because we never allow time to reflect and ponder and improve upon our actions and character while we are together. Even if you were to go back to her: I assure you that things wouldn't be any better because of the fact that you embrace the change because you panic &amp; fear to lose her &amp; walk alone in life again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This is not only a wrong mentality, rather, the existing flaws you have is kept hidden within you: not exactly solved deep within.
