              <p>i dont think it's outdated.  I think theres nothin to do with that? </p>
              <p>But currently i say internet is part of a youngster's life.... but your bro's way too over, he should get out more. Is he an introvert from young? Your parents never scold him or nag him to get a job?</p>

              <p>My younger brother is now studying at NUS, 1st year and he is now on his term break for 1 month plus. For all this while, he has been staying at home either watch TV shows, playing games, downloading movies and every other stuffs he can download from the internet or basically just rot at home. This computer will be working harder than him and my home broadband has been hogged by his extensive 'exercise'. When it comes to meals, My mother will prepare breakfast for him and buy dinner for him daily. There was only 1 time I was surprise to hear that he went out with his friend(s). Soon he is back on his daily routine, till now. I remember during my school days, I would be eagerly looking for a part time job to spend my school break and at the same time, to earn some extra income. Basically we are already too tired to tell him to go and gain some working experience outside while having his term break.</p>
              <p>Recently I came across a newspaper article on the death of the recruit and the officer cadet during their training. In the article, the author did highlighted that  the lifestyle of the nowadays youngsters could be one of the causes of the deaths. I look at my younger brother and asked myself; "If more and more of the youngsters are having lifestyle like him, will National Service be expecting more and more cases of such 'sudden death' happening in the near future?" Luckily for my younger brother, he has already 'geng' his way out of the National Service. There is one thing I really impressed about him is how he can 'geng' his way throughout the whole 2 years of National Service and finally downgraded. Trust me, if you throw him a M16 machine gun, he will be looking at you blankly.</p>
              <p>I have friends who are studying Uni now but their attitudes are totally opposite of my younger brother. I am wondering what do you think of the lifestyle of the youngsters nowadays? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>'cos your family spoils your younger brother. Don't attribute it as a lifestyle of the youngsters nowadays. When I was that age, I also have friends who rot at home what.</p>
              <p>Look at your mom, still prepare breakfast and dinner for him. Holiday don't give pocket money, see what stunt he wants to pull lor.</p>
              <p>Instead of asking is it the lifestyle of the youngsters nowadays, for your case, it's more appropriate to say that it's your upbringing that your family is cultivating on your younger brother instead.</p>

              <p>Yalor, nowaday the youngster are useless. Most of them get downgraded in NS (I guess its getting too easy for people to downgrade). The worst is most of the downgraded look perfectly healthy! They can run faster than anyone when playing soccer or basketball!</p>

              <p>Maybe gahmen can consider FT for combatants! Haha.</p>
              <p>But it's true about the downgrade scenario. Most of my men were non-combat fit, but when time to play soccer, all like dragons and tigers one leh.</p>

              <p>I really hope he is interacting with billions of other people out there in the net. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> I think his main activity is downloading and watch whatever he has downloaded. Everytime I walk pass his room, he will have different programmes playing on his monitor. Ranging from anime, to drama series, to entertainment shows. I do agreed that since its his term break, must give him a break. However even when his school term start, other than going to school, he will be back to his usual routine. I btc, never go to uni one (lol), so I have no idea what is the workload in the uni? Does it differ from other uni? Is it 1st year quite relax?</p>
              <p>Btw based on my younger brother's lifestyle, is there any za bo who want to date him? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>

              <p>'cos your family spoils your younger brother. Don't attribute it as a lifestyle of the youngsters nowadays. When I was that age, I also have friends who rot at home what.</p>
              <p>Look at your mom, still prepare breakfast and dinner for him. Holiday don't give pocket money, see what stunt he wants to pull lor.</p>
              <p>Instead of asking is it the lifestyle of the youngsters nowadays, for your case, it's more appropriate to say that it's your upbringing that your family is cultivating on your younger brother instead.</p>
