              shows. I do agreed that since its his term break, must give him a
              break. However even when his school term start, other than going to
              school, he will be back to his usual routine. I btc, never go to
              uni one (lol), so I have no idea what is the workload in the uni?
              Does it differ from other uni? Is it 1st year quite relax?</p>

              <p>Not easy to find part time job. And the pay is usually low.</p>
              <p>But here's what i did during the decemeber holidays: rot,
                  overseas and some tuition</p>
              <p>For May to july holidays, the break is longer so i try to find
                  part time. I work in a printing company when i was in first year
                  going second year. Work at taka as sales assistant from second to
                  third year. Work as relief teacher from third to fourth year.
                  Currently working at some kns perm job. Just grad.</p>

              <p>Same... I also just grad</p>
              <p>I just applied 2nd job as part time group tuition teacher... After I learned a bit of the ropes, I will give start my own group tuition group... Returns per hour will be significantly higher than at my full-time job... Aiming to do this at the start of next year....</p>
              <p>At the same time, I will be storing 'ammo' to wait for the stock market to recover</p>
              <p>Maybe you could consider this path too</p>
