            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes, those people on the receiving end just keep mum and enjoy the attentions showered upon them. If their main motive is just to pick and choose, it's alright, but they should not give some misleading hints or false hope for the other person. If you are someone in that position, put yourself in your suitor's shoe and see things from his perspective, what had he/she done to deserve what he/she is getting.<br><br>It's never easy trying to get over the love for someone. Perhaps, they deserve the hasher punishment than they are receiving but do you think it is fair to them.. nope!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup.. it's true that no matter what others might say, it all depends on how the person want to do.<br><br>Same as my philosophy in the stock market, if your stock is not doing well, review the situation, is there any chance of it recovering in the near future, if no, better to sell, to cut lost and buying back later at a lower price. Don't bank on buying in to lower your cost price. Let's see if it does make sense, if you like someone and have done what you can to get the person, and you failed, it's better to review your stand. Don't try to hope that by giving more, you will get the person. Hope it does make sense.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa:<br><br>I guess, what your friend needs, is a serious wake up call. But I shall not jump to assumptions. the guy might be serious, just that he is not ready to commit. If that is the case, then I guess, he just does not know his piroities well enough, and you could say that he is selfish in that sense. I know that it is possible to be serious but not ready to commit, as I am such a person. Thus I guess maybe sounding out the guy and finding out if he is serious would be a good move first. If he is, then ask your friend if she is ready to wait, (By the look of it, I'm sure she is), otherwise if he does not have any intention to settle down with your frined, then I think trying to "counsell" him rather then your friend would be a easier way to do things. Trust me, love is blind, and speaking to the one not in love would be a lot easier. You can't stop your frined from loving him, but you can help by asking the guy to stop giving out signals. If all else fail, I guess, letting your friend see the ugly truth would be the only way, show her the guy's real intention, it would hurt her, but learning about the truth earlier, means to move ahead in life faster.<br><br>Just my thoughts on the matter. I do pity the guy though if he is not ready to commit, I would be in a fix too, if a gal is to love me like that, but the time is not right.

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting..<br>I believe this is not the first of its kind. Probably u ought to sit down and have a good heart to heart talk with your friend. Analyse the situation. What is the current sitation? What is his reaction? Does he show any signs? Is he fooling around or he just don't know how to express himself? OR what if he's those mummy boy "mummy say this... ummy say that...."? I believe you are good at understanding and working out the solutions. Use your psychological ability to do the work. Of coz, you need to get the aproval from the girl involved else you can flame for nothing.<br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But I'm a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
