Their prawns are still jumping on display, their fishes are always slimey with freshness, their crabs have a range of sizes to choose from and they are so alive they can jump!

Besides cheap things in Sheng Siong, their service I think is the best among the supermarkets and departmental stores.  Mustafa's service staff service really sucks, I just came back from there.  I don't think they care about service in mustafa, no doubt quite a number of things there are cheap.  Think sheng siong and mustafa have different management styles.  boss of the sheng siong told the staff no matter how much or how little (eg though only earn 10 cents or 20 cents) they must treat the customers well becos their income depends on the customers.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
