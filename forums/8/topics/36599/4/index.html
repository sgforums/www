And it is a VOW.<br><br>Living together for a while will show us what living together will be like so that the next step can be taken with eyes wide open.<br><br>Do not make sweeping statements... statistics can lie.<br><br>Just like the recent one where it was found that men who shave everyday have fewer instances of stroke.  Co-relation is not causation.<br><br>What is not written in the article but was told later by another researcher was that men who shave tend to be white collar workers who take care of their health and grooming, while those who do not shave as frequently are blue collar workers who do not look after their diet as well.<br><br>Statistics can lie.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:</div><div class="quote_body">Besides, stats show that people who "co-habit" before getting married are far more likely to end in divorce... why?

Let's not be tied down to each other, maintaining some kind of a relationship in which we can amicably leave.<br><br>Why do people not want to commit to marriage nowadays? The answer is in the question... it's commitment. In our self-serving soceity nowadays that places emphasis on feeling good for the moment, commitment is a dirty word and stability is only lasts as long as fashion. Divorce does not happen because people are getting married, but because people do not treat their vows seriously anymore. So we come up with lame stuff like "co-habiting" which is actually just an empty, superfical fair weather system has hardly has any familial bonds at all...<br><br>Is marriage just a piece of paper?
