            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Pink&gt; I am with the idea of cohabitating rather than marriage. Not to say that I'm against marriage though. In my opinion, I want to know if I can live with the person I love before I wanna be married to him. Who knows that we may love each other but we can't live together? I think for me cohabitating is a way for me to test if both of us are able to live together for a long term. Even though we are not getting married, at least I think cohabitating is a nice way to be together without being bonded with extra committment with tat "cert". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bah "co-habiting" is just one way of saying that you want to enjoy a relationship but not to cash in all the chips on the table.<br><br>So it's not "till death do us part" or "through sickness or health" but simply "till we get bored of each other/ find somebody better/ things go bad for us". Let's not be tied down to each other, maintaining some kind of a relationship in which we can amicably leave.<br><br>Why do people not want to commit to marriage nowadays? The answer is in the question... it's commitment. In our self-serving soceity nowadays that places emphasis on feeling good for the moment, commitment is a dirty word and stability is only lasts as long as fashion. Divorce does not happen because people are getting married, but because people do not treat their vows seriously anymore. So we come up with lame stuff like "co-habiting" which is actually just an empty, superfical fair weather system has hardly has any familial bonds at all...<br><br>Is marriage just a piece of paper? Obviously when people started to see it that way, it already means they have something wrong with their mindsets and that's why we have nonsense like "co-habiting".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Besides, stats show that people who "co-habit" before getting married are far more likely to end in divorce... why? Because they bring their attitudes of "co-habitation" into their marriage and apparently treat their "vows" with the same looseness, anyhowness, tida-apa attitude they held while "co-habiting"...</div>
