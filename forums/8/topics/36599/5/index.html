Note that all of the reasons given so far to justify "co-habitation" are mainly selfish ones stemming from the undesire to treat one's relationship, and partner, seriously. All excuses that having a couple that is dedicated and commited is better then some piece of paper called marriage is  [b]NONSENSE</strong> Marriage <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">IS</span></strong><span style="font-style: italic;"> about dedication and commitment long before paper was invented. When you think that marriage is just a legal union of thing, you have missed the whole point of things. And no wonder you don't take it seriously, instead opting for less-strings attached "cohabitation".<br><br>Go and examine yourself and your attitude towards your relationship. If you are serious, you should be thinking of marriage, not staying together in a limbo that is fickle and has nothing more then fleeting interest to tie yourselves together.  </span>[/b]</blockquote>I simply cant understand why there are so many couples out there who still supports co-habitation..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  is the world getting worse.. ? does 'moral' exist still..!?! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>I m not trying to say that people who does co-habit has no morals but simply if they wanna enjoy the priviliges of staying together why dont they just get married? doesnt co-habiting requires a certain level of financial stabilty as well?

You're right that I don't have to get approval to co-habit (THEN eventually get married!) with the person I love. I wasn't seeking such approval.<br><br>Another thing I might want to ask you, since you do not condone co-habitation, is whether you have actually lived with your partner at some stage in your life. You are absolutely sure that it's not the way to go? Is it because of religion, family, or society's influences?<br><br>The reason I'm asking is because I have been on both ends of the see-saw. I've had relationships where I have lived with my girl, and others where I didn't. So I guess I have seen both sides, and believe co-habitation is acceptable (NOT a pre-requisite, mind you) for me.<br><br>So have you been on both ends of the see-saw to make a sound judgement? Even if you haven't and are still unable to accept co-habitation, then that's fine too! We're just having a healthy discussion here aren't we?<br><br>Thank you once again for your well wishes.

            <div class='col-md body'>Refering to co-habitation without the intention to marry, if it replaces marriage rather then being the stepping stone to one, then it's where it becomes self-defeating. Where a supposedly 'devoted and loving' couple prefer a low risk co-habitation rather then trade vows and take them seriously, contradiction! Devoted and loving? In fair weather prehaps!<br><br>Excessive co-habitation (in terms of years) before marriage despite all the candy-talk being glossed out, is shown quite clearly to have a negative effect to the future of your marriage relationship. Why? Apparently the new responsbilities of marriage life and vows are treated with comtempt because of the ingrained low-commitment mindsets of "cohabitation"... and they carry these mindsets into their marriage, and of course, find out that something has to give.<br><br>Can you escape the stats? It's like smoking, some will escape getting addicted, but many will fall to it... Why expose yourself to such danger? Co-habitation should be more of an 'orientation camp' towards marriage life rather then a paethetic limbo of "less strings attatched" commitments...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The concept I am vermently against is "co-habitation" replacing marriage or preputal "co-habitation" with no intention of marrying... it's like getting into a serious relationship but with no intention to commit to it... it's patently absurd. Some form of co-habitation is unavoidable before marriage life, and is probably benifical, but if it gets drawn out to emcompass the entire status of the relationship is just plain showing that these people are lacking in commitment and seriousness in their relatioship... after all, how easy is it to jump ship?<br><br>Not saying that there are no people do not treat their marriage seriously (those are another bunch of jokers for another thread), but any couple who claims to be "serious" should want the best for their relationship, and it will not be some limbo that comes with no promises and no strings attatched... No perminancy, no convenant... what's that nonsense... Marriage is far more then a piece of paper, and if you just see it that way can see co-habitation as the ultimate for a relationship... it's a sad day.</div>
