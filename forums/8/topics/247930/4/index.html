            <div class='col-md body'>Alright I give in on rape. But molest - why does that cause psychological harm? That is what I am asking.

What basic rights. Basic rights, privacy and morality are created by humans.

It was an analogy to show an infringement of basic rights. Very good, you have understood basic rights, privacy and morality are created by humans. The society is made up of humans. They do vary from human to human I agree but for this case it is definitely a consensus of the majority of the society. Doing something against my permission is a definite infringement of basic rights. It is the most basic of all basic and I would pity you greatly for being confused on this very fact.<br><br>Sex sure is great, well at least you and me agree. Or to that fact, many others will agree. But is forced sex great? Now the object of who applied the force does not matter. A girl being forced to sex would be just as unpleasant as you would be forced to sex. Or this guy. Or that guy. Or whoever is being raped. You would argue that you love sex, so forced sex is good. I would assume that you have lost the whole meaning of "forced sex" then. If you enjoy it, you are not being forced anymore. You have essentially allow the other party to continue the act. It would then be consensual sex. Would you allow a big grizzly bear to rape you? Well unless you permit the bear to continue grilling your poor hole, I wouldn't say that you would enjoy it.<br><br>They would essentially have sex with their partners I agreed. But the fact is that they disliked the fact that they are forced. So many females in this world love sex as much as we do but if and only if they permit themselves into committing that act.<br><br>All these explanation had been made easier for us. Through simply terming it as wrong. The laws says it. Your society says it. What are the chances you, an individual, going against the views of the majority, the experienced, the experts, thinks that it is not wrong?<br><br>Like I have said before, "Now to ask something that is inevitably as clear as ABC, and something that is quite insensitive to the female population, that would put a question mark to the sincerity in that question. Whether it is truly an innocent question or mere inferiority to the norm's intelligence."<br></div>
