It was an analogy to show an infringement of basic rights. Very good, you have understood basic rights, privacy and morality are created by humans. The society is made up of humans. They do vary from human to human I agree but for this case it is definitely a consensus of the majority of the society. Doing something against my permission is a definite infringement of basic rights. It is the most basic of all basic and I would pity you greatly for being confused on this very fact.<br><br>Sex sure is great, well at least you and me agree. Or to that fact, many others will agree. But is forced sex great? Now the object of who applied the force does not matter. A girl being forced to sex would be just as unpleasant as you would be forced to sex. Or this guy. Or that guy. Or whoever is being raped. You would argue that you love sex, so forced sex is good. I would assume that you have lost the whole meaning of "forced sex" then. If you enjoy it, you are not being forced anymore. You have essentially allow the other party to continue the act. It would then be consensual sex. Would you allow a big grizzly bear to rape you? Well unless you permit the bear to continue grilling your poor hole, I wouldn't say that you would enjoy it.<br><br>They would essentially have sex with their partners I agreed. But the fact is that they disliked the fact that they are forced. So many females in this world love sex as much as we do but if and only if they permit themselves into committing that act.<br><br>All these explanation had been made easier for us. Through simply terming it as wrong. The laws says it. Your society says it. What are the chances you, an individual, going against the views of the majority, the experienced, the experts, thinks that it is not wrong?<br><br>Like I have said before, "Now to ask something that is inevitably as clear as ABC, and something that is quite insensitive to the female population, that would put a question mark to the sincerity in that question. Whether it is truly an innocent question or mere inferiority to the norm's intelligence."<br></div></blockquote>OK about rape. What about molest. Why would there be psychological harm from molest? I'm not saying it's wrong. I'm just asking why.</div>

But some questions are mere sensitive and as part of the society, you ought to exercise some level of tolerance and sensitivity. Some of the questions you asked are pretty obvious and because of the high chances of it offending the mass, you should phrase it in a way that would be as tactfully as possible. Your enthusiasm to have true knowledge is commendable but apparently your "stupidity" throws it all. And you chose CHIT CHAT-sgForum in all the forums of the world to expose yourself. Cos the people here, if you want to know the root of my point, is they won't tolerate your "nonsense"...</div>

I'm sure you are at least smart enough to know the difference between rape and bluffing. But then again, this is debatable. Because the experts would have to take into consideration her state of mind at the moment of the act. You said <strong>normally</strong> so I assume this example of yours is when the girl is in perfect thinking capability to make her decisions.<br><br>Yes, essentially it boils down to her purity and chaste.<br></div>
