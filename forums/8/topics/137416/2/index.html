But kinda funny  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Joe was moderately successful in his career, but as he got older he was increasingly hampered by incredible headaches. When his personal hygiene and love life started to suffer, he sought medical help. After being referred from one specialist to another, he finally came across a doctor who solved the problem.<br>"The good news is I can cure your headaches... The bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine. The pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles."<br><br>Joe was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. He couldn't concentrate long enough to answer, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife.<br><br>When he left the hospital, his mind was clear, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life.<br><br>He walked past a men's clothing store and thought, "That's what I need: a new suit." He entered the shop and told the salesman, "I'd like a new suit."<br><br>The salesman eyed him briefly and said, "Let's see... size 44 long." Joe laughed, "That's right, how did you know?"<br><br>"It's my job."<br><br>Joe tried on the suit. It fit perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, "How about a new shirt?" Joe thought for a moment and then said, "Sure..."<br><br>The salesman eyed Joe and said, "Let's see... 34 sleeve and... 16 and a half neck" Joe was surprised, "That's right, how did you know?"<br><br>"It's my job."<br><br>Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly. As Joe adjusted the collar in the mirror, the salesman asked, "How about new shoes?" Joe was on a roll and said, "Sure..."<br><br>The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, "Let's see... 9-1/2... E." Joe was astonished, "That's right, how did you know?"<br><br>"It's my job."<br><br>Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly. Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, "How about a new hat?" Without hesitating, Joe said, "Sure..."<br><br>The salesman eyed Joe's head and said, "Let's see... 7-5/8." Joe was incredulous, "That's right, how did you know?"<br><br>"It's my job."<br><br>The hat fit perfectly. Joe was feeling great, when the salesman asked, "How about some new underwear?" Joe thought for a second and said, "Sure..." The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, "Let's see... size 36."<br><br>Joe laughed, "No, I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old."<br><br>The salesman shook his head, "You can't wear a size 34. It would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More...<br><br>A little boy came down to breakfast. Since he lived on a farm, his mother asked if he had done his chores.<br>Â“Not yet,Â” said the little boy. His mother tells him he canÂ’t have any breakfast until he does his chores. Well, heÂ’s a little pissed, so he goes to feed the chickens, and he kicks a chicken. He goes to feed the cows, and he kicks a cow. He goes to feed the pigs, and he kicks a pig.<br><br>He goes back in for breakfast and his mother gives him a bowl of dry cereal. Â“How come I donÂ’t get any eggs and bacon? Why donÂ’t I have any milk in my cereal?Â” he asks.<br><br>Â“Well,Â” his mother says, Â“I saw you kick a chicken, so you donÂ’t get any eggs. I saw you kick the pig, so you donÂ’t get any bacon, either. I also saw you kick the cow, so you arenÂ’t getting any milk this morning.Â”<br><br>Just about then, his father comes down for breakfast, and he kicks the cat as heÂ’s walking into the kitchen. The little boy looks up at his mother with a smile, and says, Â“Are you going to tell him, or should I?Â”<br><br></div>

While he waits, he grabs a handful of peanuts from the bowl on the counter, and as he starts to chew, he hears a voice say, "That's a beautiful tie, is that silk? Very NICE choice!"<br>Wondering who made the comment, he looks around and doesn't see anyone nearby who could be speaking to him. With a shrug, he pops a few more peanuts into his mouth.<br><br>Next he hears the voice say, "Those shoes are stylin', my man. Are they Italian leather? They look GRRREAT!"<br><br>He whirls around to again but sees no one near him. He glances nervously around and then at his shoes, which he tucks self-consciously under the stool.<br><br>A little freaked out, he grabs another handful of peanuts. This time the voice continues with, "That suit looks FANTASTIC! Is it an Armani? Very nice!"<br><br>He immediately calls the waiter over and says, "Look. I keep hearing these voices telling me how great my tie, my shoes, and my suit look - what's up with that? Am I GOING CRAZY??"<br><br>"Oh," the waiter nonchalantly replies. "It's just the peanuts."<br><br>"The PEANUTS?!?" the astonished man asks, staring at the bowl beside him.<br><br>"Yes," replies the waiter, "Â…they're complimentary."<br></div>
