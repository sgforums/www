            <div class='col-md body'>If you find yourself in love with someone who does not<br>love you, be gentle with yourself. There is nothing<br>wrong with you. Love just didn't choose to rest in the<br>other person's heart.<br><br>If you find someone else in love with you and you don't<br>love her/him, feel honoured that love came and called at<br>your door, but gently refuse the gift you cannot<br>return. Do not take advantage, do not cause pain.<br><br>How you deal with love is how you deal with you, and<br>all our hearts feel the same pains and joys, even if<br>our lives and ways are different.<br><br>If you fall in love with another, and she falls in love<br>with you, and then love chooses to leave, do not try to<br>reclaim it or to assess blame, Let it go. There is a<br>reason and there is a meaning. You will know in time.<br><br>Remember that you don't choose love. Love chooses you.<br>All you can really do is accept it for all its mystery<br>when it comes into your life. Feel the way it fills you<br>to overflowing, then reach out and give it away.<br><br>Give it back to the person who brought it alive in you.<br>Give it to others who deem it poor in spirit.<br>Give it to the world around you in anyway you can.<br><br>This is where many lovers go wrong. Having been so long<br>without love, they understand love only as a need.<br>They see their hearts as empty places that will be<br>filled by love, and they begin to look at love as<br>something that flows to them rather than from them.<br><br>The first blush of new love is filled to overflowing,<br>but as their love cools, they revert to seeing their<br>love as need. They cease to be someone who generates<br>love and instead become someone who seeks love.<br>They forget that the secret of love is that it is a<br>gift, and that it can be made to grow only by giving it<br>away.<br><br>Remember this, and keep it to your heart. Love has its<br>own time, its own seasons, and its own reason for<br>coming and going. You cannot bribe it or coerce it, or<br>reason it into saying. You can only embrace it when it<br>arrives and give it away when it comes to you.<br><br>But if it chooses to leave from your heart or from the<br>heart of your lover, there is nothing you can do and<br>there is nothing you should do. Love always has been<br>and always will be a mystery.<br><br>Be glad that it came to live for a moment in your life.<br>Don't deny love just only you don't want to be hurt...<br><br>IF YOU KEEP YOUR HEART OPEN, IT WILL COME AGAIN<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
