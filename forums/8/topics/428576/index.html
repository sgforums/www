              <div id="post_message_9530538" class="vb_postbit">Ok, it's been a relatively normal day, until now. A young pretty blond woman, with a Russian or Eastern European accent asks to use my bathroom. I say yes and let her go back. She takes about 10 minutes and eventually comes out thanking me graciously and goes out to leave. She was selling things and left her bag outside so I wouldn't think she was stealing anything. She leaves to go continue selling at other houses and I hear my brother go "Oh my god!" I run back there only to find that she left the toilet clogged with shit. It was so bad we've spent the past 10 minutes trying to unclog it. I am utterly shocked that it came out of that girl's body. I just can't believe that just happened.</div>

              <p>Last few days I have been having erotic dreams.</p>
              <p>Warning : kids under 18 yrs old are not advised to read the following.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First I have dream which was very strange. Its like I could know that I was dreaming. I was controlling my dream and my movement. I was leaning and kissing a woman and I was actively trying to control my movements. I was half asleep and half awake, it seems.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I was dreaming that I was licking a woman's behind. There was a couple more sequences but I feel too embarassed to say it.</p>
              <p>Third, the strangest thing happened. I dreamed I was sleeping in a room together with a young maid. It was innocent sleeping only in a room with 2 beds. So I slept alone and she slept alone. Then suddenly in the middle of the night she aroused and moved to my bed to made love to me. I rejected her. Then the lights went bright and suddenly I saw that she was not a young maid but an old woman with dubious appearance. I was half disappointed and wanted to rectify this dream. I tried to dream something better but could not achieve it.</p>

              <p>no worries. there are many people who awake still dreaming.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>read so many qyeries i get so feedup. years on in photography i see people who still ask silly questions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a guys using crop sensor asking is 18-50mm any better than a 24-70mm. wjhat i read sometimes i really cannot tahan want to reply them kundu! they are the same just made for diffetn crop factor bodies. off course you can still buy a 24-70 and use on a crop body - just that it make no sense on the focal range only.</p>
              <p>and there are people who wonders why the price of a 70-300mm nikon VR is steeper than say a DX 55-300mm. this time you should really look at the optics. the 70-300mm is ahrper than any of the DX ramge of glasses man!</p>
              <p>and people asking whynot buy the 18-200mm and be it. come one if this lens can beat a two lens combination the other lens can close shop no need sell already! superzooms suffers softness ay random focal range and apertures, plus serious distortion at the wide end! so you can forget about architural shoots not without any distortion correction afterwards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i read i really wonder if such forums really is helping people improve knowledge on photography! then there are thos anal type who like big holes, f2.8 f1.4 f1.0 but i see their photos they really cannot handle the extreme shallow depth of field and their main focal points (pottraits usually the face / eys) is off, focus else where - even online posting cropped photos can see off already imagine the priginal uncropped photos! then there are people who get all piped up about people comparing cams with more focus points and say a good cam no need many focal points lah. they should shoot more.</p>
