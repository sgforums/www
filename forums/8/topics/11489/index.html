So far Real Madrid is the form team of the tournament and i think they will go on to win.<br><br>But MU is also up there with the best..it's just that they have been in poor finishing form lately, mostly due to the off-form of beckham, giggs injured, and scholes's lack of ideas...<br><br>Like arsenal, if u cannot score, u cannot progress...hence they ended up with the same fate...<br><br>I think MU needs some new faces and a creative midfielder, since cantona left, it's their collective talent that has shined. Someone who can make that final sublime pass or defence splitting through ball. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY: A RELIABLE GOAL GETTER!<br><br></div>

They had to qualify first (remember they lost the EPL to Arsenal in the 98/99 season) and won 2-0 on aggregate.<br><br>2. They were drawn in perhaps the most difficult group, including Bayern (ironic huh?) and Barca...and played magnificently to qualify from the first stage. (they were undefeated too)<br><br>3. They then had to clear the quarters and semis, playing italian clubs and knocking both out in the process...to my knowledge, no team has done that b4 and it's widely known that italian teams (till recently) are the toughest in the world.<br><br>3. And lastly, they never gave up in the final...even fielding 4 strikers...right up to the final whistle...tat's my MU!<br><br>luck? hardly...it's called never-say-die attitude<br></strong></blockquote>Well said. And not to forget that they had it tough in the FA cup that season too. Having to face Liverpool ( <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">), Fulham, Chelsea and Arsenal, before getting to beat Newcastle in the finals. And they did not have it easy in the league too, where they have to win their last match to take the league trophy.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Despite the fanfare surrounding David Beckham's new contract, this was a suitably disappointing finale to what has been a disappointing season for Manchester United as they drew 0-0 with Charlton.<br><br>The erstwhile champions had wanted to bow out on a high, but instead they were held to their first goalless draw at Old Trafford since September 1999.<br><br>Just to add to United's disappointment, Liverpool's win over Ipswich condemned them to third place in the table - their worst finish since 1991 - and the ignominy of having to qualify for the Champions League in August.<br><br>No United fan would have predicted such an outcome back in the summer when Sir Alex Ferguson splashed out nearly Â£50million on Juan Sebastian Veron and Ruud van Nistelrooy.<br><br>But as Roy Keane acidly observed in midweek, good players do not necessarily make good teams.<br><br>Despite all this, a defiant Sir Alex Ferguson refused to be downbeat and he insisted their barren season had not been a failure, claiming "we're not a club in turmoil".<br><br>Writing in his programme notes the United boss said: "It's not a time for knee-jerk reaction because let's face it, to reach the last four of the UEFA Champions League and take the Premiership to the last but one fixture can hardly be described as failure.<br><br>"Indeed our form since Christmas overall has not been bad. I stick to my guns and will continue to argue that we have played some of the best football in the division and we have scored the most goals."<br><br>Ferguson promised changes and the first of these will be the departures of Ronny Johnsen, Raimond van der Gouw and Denis Irwin.<br><br>Irwin captained United on his 527th and last appearance after 12 trophy-laden years at the club.<br><br>Irwin brought the curtain down on his United career when he was replaced by John O'Shea after 68 minutes and he left the pitch to a standing ovation.<br><br>Before kick-off those same United fans had applauded Beckham as he was paraded on the pitch after signing his new contract worth a reported Â£90,000 a week.<br><br>After 10 days of heartache, at last the Old Trafford faithful had something to smile about.<br><br>Charlton then set about trying to ruin United's feel-good factor and they should have been two or three goals ahead by half-time.<br><br>Kevin Lisbie was involved in their best moments and on 28 minutes he was denied by a last-ditch block by Phil Neville after a surging run from the left.<br><br>He then provided a late contender for miss of the season eight minutes later when he squandered a glorious chance. Chris Bart-Williams pulled the ball back from the right and with the goal at his mercy, Lisbie somehow managed to sidefoot wide from only yards out.<br><br>United could not get going and it said it all about their performance that Quinton Fortune and Neville were their best players.<br><br>Diego Forlan briefly raised the tempo in the second half when he twice went close to breaking his duck for United on his 18th appearance for the club.<br><br>First Dean Kiely touched his half volley away for a corner and then the Uruguayan flashed a right-foot drive across goal.<br><br>On a day of United farewells, following Irwin's exit, van der Gouw replaced Barthez 13 minutes from time to make his last appearance.<br><br>Keane nearly snatched an undeserved victory at the end for United in stoppage time only for Kiely to save his shot.</div>
