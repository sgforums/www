            <div class='col-md body'>You are so lucky to have such a wonderful girlfriend who was hopelessly in love you.<br><br>As a guy I can do nothing but to scold you first!<br><br>While you are in a "walk first see how" attitude, you are never serious in a relationship. If so why bother to keep that relationship for 2 YEARS and destroy the youth of the girl you never liked????<br><br>From what I see you are only "using" the girl's feeling and enjoying her attention to get what you want....like the bike!! Can't you just wait until after NS to get a bike? You know that in NS you can't afford this kind of money and you still die die buy and USE her money somemore? You NS got so much time to ride bike?? Only weekends word!!<br><br>I really hope you din make use of her fondness of you to GET WHATEVER YOU WANT from her...including SEX. If so, I really have nothing to say!!! I always believe that whatever you want you must EARN it! Why are you so spinless?? Talk about marriage some more!!<br><br>You think chio is the key thing???? even a prettiest ger can grow old word! And to think that you are actually consious about HOW SHE LOOKS in front of your frenz.....Why? trying to play "perfect couple"?? or are you competing with your frenz on who has the prettiest girlfriends??<br><br>She may not be as smart as you want and her pay may be pathetic but how about you??? You find a 3K or above job then compare okay!! A girl who is willing to work her life and give her saving for you, dun say 2K, or 1.3K....500 you should be contented cos IT'S YOUR MAIN JOB to provide for her happyness and never her's!!<br><br>You already knew you patched up with her after the break up show how insecure you are to yourself and to her. You are weak at the heart!! I suggest you do some thinking...<br><br>Okay, finish scolding, now for the decision. If I were you I will..<br><br>BREAK UP!!<br><br>Cos it's clear that you don't love her! Dun waste her youth anymore and bluff yourself that you love her and then later find her a nuisanse. 2 years is already too long and if you drag anymore......both will be miserable...even if you marry, it will not be a happy marriage.<br><br>I might sound crude and you might be angry but let me tell you, I'm just typing what I think cos the only person to blame for all this is...YOU. I don't know you and I'm not flaming....I'm only giving a very personalised advise that a relative/big brother will give....it's NOTHING PERSONAL and I have no grudges with you.<br><br>But I seriously think you should do some soul searching........dun make the same mistake as me okay! (okay, not the same but almost similar)</div>
