            <div class='col-md body'>Dun be in a relationship because of gratitute. If so, I think she deserves better and you should move on. Actually I feel maybe you dun even know what you want for now. Maybe its better to first sort out your own feelings and exactly what you want in a partner. The combination of criteria is simply too much for any1 to answer your questions except yourself. How to quantify how much good looks is good enough to offset other lesser than "want" qualities? No one can answer you except yourself. Take a step back and examine yourself first.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by vti_79:</div><div class="quote_body">i recently celebrate my 2nd annivesary with my gf.we had been together since my first year of ns and now i had ord...she was still by my side..all of u must have know that this girl really love me!<br><br>i know this girl from irc from the first time we meet,i was only prepare to go steady with her on a "walk first seee how" attitude.after a few month,i found that this girl is hopelessly in love with me..she give me all her love and everything..<br><br>when i cough,she will get some med to me after work and see me at my house.when i was broke during ns,she pay for some of our date and when i say i want to learn bike,she save up $1 out of her $3 pocket money for me!i told her that if i really got a bike and if we not steady anymore,she will still be the first one to sit my bike..really glad to know such a girl.she is the girl who give me her everything.whatever i want,she will give..include sex!!<br><br>but the problem is this girl is not my dream girl.what i want is a girl with brain and a bit of looks..i often dream of me and my future wife earning a$2000 each a month so that we can led a comfortable life...but she earning $1300 at the moment and i ask her to upgrade herself which she did.the way she do things and the way she talk also piss me off sometimes..always say things wrongly and doing things the long way.<br><br>for her looks...she wasnt good looking loh!i just want someone who is PRESENTABLE,NOT CHIO..but i felt i couldnt bring her out to see my friends cos of her looks...<br><br>all the guys here...i wonder if u agree with me?<br>for girls right,either we get a one with no looks but got brain...or via visa..but for her,she got none loh...<br><br>i am thinking really far loh..cos i want her to be my future wife.<br><br>recently she was getting tired of all my nagging..asking her to change this and that and she say she is willing to break up with me and she dont love me as much...<br><br>we broke up once and later i patch with her cos i feel that i  cant find someone who love me so deeply like her...i may be able to find a chio and smart girl,but will the girl love me so deeply???<br><br>shall i follow my dream..find a smart beautiful wife get married,each of us earn a decent sum of $2000 no problem having a nice car and house..but love is so  so only..OR<br><br>marry my present gf with no looks and brain,live a simple life..evny others with cars and nice houses(i will be very sad,cos im a great car lover)...ENJOY HER DEEPEST LOVE TO ME...while i continue to nag all her wrongdoing till she correct herself FOR THE REST OF MY 30,40,50,60,70,80 YRS OF OUR LIFE?<br><br>IF U WERE ME......what is your decision?<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>forgive me, Miss Plain Jane... but my advice to vti79 is to break up with her... why?<br><br>1. You don't seem to like her at all. Its only by virtue of the fact she shower so much love on you, that you 'love' her back. It call the law of reciprocity, human nature.<br>I see no future for the 2 of you. Break up with her before you regret later in life, no use dragging on. The reason why you're hesitating is that its always nice to have someone love you like that.<br><br>2. What she have is variable, and what she don't have is fixed. What do I mean? How much a girl love you can be changed, but the looks and brains and earning potential cannot be changed. So find a pretty smart girl who don't love you as much. Then make her love you as much as Miss Plain Jane.<br><br>The sea is deep and fishes are aplenty. The reason why you're holding on is that you're afraid you cannot find another girl. My hunch is that this is your first girlfriend. Don't worry, take the plunge and you'll be well rewarded.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Axl:</div><div class="quote_body">forgive me, Miss Plain Jane... but my advice to vti79 is to break up with her... why?<br><br>1. You don't seem to like her at all. Its only by virtue of the fact she shower so much love on you, that you 'love' her back. It call the law of reciprocity, human nature.<br>I see no future for the 2 of you. Break up with her before you regret later in life, no use dragging on. The reason why you're hesitating is that its always nice to have someone love you like that.<br><br>2. What she have is variable, and what she don't have is fixed. What do I mean? How much a girl love you can be changed, but the looks and brains and earning potential cannot be changed. So find a pretty smart girl who don't love you as much. Then make her love you as much as Miss Plain Jane.<br><br>The sea is deep and fishes are aplenty. The reason why you're holding on is that you're afraid you cannot find another girl. My hunch is that this is your first girlfriend. Don't worry, take the plunge and you'll be well rewarded.</div></blockquote>u seem to think the same way as me too....<br>i think break better loh.<br>i would be in a dilima if i were u, but luckily i am not u.<br></div>
