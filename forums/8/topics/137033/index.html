Can you judge with total neutrality?<br><br>What if it was a husband murder case for Catherine Zeta Jones? What if it was Julia Roberts?<br><br>I think sometimes it's unfair to really judge or think one knows a celebrity well  because it's all second hand stories. And given a chance, I'd allow myself weird behavior if I became a celebrity too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>When you're a rising star, the media is your biggest fan, full of adoration, when you're down in the dumps, the same qualities that made you special to the media can also be portrayed as the worst character flaws anyone has ever seen. Similar examples can be seen when it comes to our own relationships. During the honeymoon stages, that 'cute' habit of your girlfriend/boyfriend was really endearing, as time went on, that 'cute' habit became an irritant that could even trigger off major arguments.<br><br>But I'm getting carried away  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
