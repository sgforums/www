Yup, he nicknames wine Jesus Juice because Jesus once turned water into wine. Nothing sinister about it.<br><br>2) He's never done anything like that.<br><br>3) He has mannequins of characters that he like ( e.g.The Jolly Green Giant ) to keep him company because he's a very lonely person. ( People say he's weird, I say he's just different. A genius will always appear weird to the average person. )<br><br>4) If he's ever touched kids anywhere near sensitive regions, its probably just accidental with no sexual intentions.<br><br>People wonder how he can spend so many nights with children without molesting them.<br>These are the people with filthy minds, these are the people who can't seperate the image of a sleeping child from sex.<br>If you adore your dog so much that you allow it to share your bed, are you going to start molesting it? After months of sleeping together will it suddenly start to arouse you?<br>It won't because you don't associate dogs with sex, the way Michael Jackson doesn't associate children with sex.<br></div>

It is just that in Singapore, the state is an all-powerful entity and can afford not to pay for its mistakes. I am sure we have our share of crap prosecutors as in the USA.<br><br>Anyone remembers Vidya Shanker? Could he have been set up?

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, I've been a fan for a long time and I would totally understand if you take whatever I say with a pinch of salt.<br><br>However I assure you I've formed my opinions based on actual court transcripts and evidence presented. Unlike the media which wants you to believe that Michael Jackson got away with everything. They've never been fair to Michael Jackson and they're not going to start being fair now.<br><br>About the juror that believes Michael Jackson is a molester, even though he never molested the boy in this case:<br><br>The prosecutors knew thay had a phony and weak case so they tried to strengthen it by saying Michael Jackson had molested 5 boys before including Macaulay Culkin and Wade Robson.<br>They then brought in a group of ex-emploees to say they witnessed the molestations. That's where you have headlines like "Ex-workers expose Jacko's secrets" etc.<br>Problem is, this group of workers had all stolen from Michael Jackson before, had all sold stories to tabloids before and admitted they lied about the stories before. Furthermore they all owe Michael Jackson USD 1.6 mill when a judge threw their case out when they tried to sue him for wrongful termination.<br>Point is none of the jurors believed them.<br><br>Now of the 5 alleged past victims, one ran away from this trial, 3 denied anything happened ( Brett Barnes, Culkin, and Wade Robson ). And only 1, Jason, testified that he was molested.<br>The juror's have already stated that they didn't believe Jason's testimony coz he changed his story a million times from tickling to fondling to hands outside pants to hands inside pants to hands inside underwear. He received USD2mill at that time to shut him up. He then claimed in court that he had no idea where the money came from and how he suddenly became rich. His mother was also an ex-cleaner who had been proven to steal from Michael Jackson and had sold stories that her son was molested to tabloids, she had also previously admitted that she lied about the molestations.<br><br>After all that, 1 juror still thinks Michael Jackson is a molester because he spent 365 nights with Barnes, whom had already testified that nothing happened. Well, guess what, Barnes quit his job to fly all the way from Aussie to testify for Michael Jackson. In fact, his whole family flew over to testify that they were there and knew Michael Jackson never did anything inappropriate.<br>And the reason why they spent 365 nights together? Barnes was keeping Michael Jackson company on his world tour, as a good friend would, and they simply shared hotel rooms.<br><br>Whoever thinks it is impossible to spend 365 nights with a boy without molesting him, you share the opinion of Juror #1(which he is officially known as). Keep in mind that he is only 1 out of 12 jurors who had such a view.<br><br>I have read so many reports that only focus on this quote from Juror #1.<br><br>Is that fair? I don't think so.<br><br></div>

You do not become a child molester simply by sleeping with kids 365 days/yr.<br><br>Yes, i agree that he did not come off past law suits smelling like roses. But that is  more a problem with the US justice system than anything else. He has just been acquitted in a court of law,  before a jury of his peers. What more can he do to clear his name?<br><br>I do not dispute that he is odd. But as shown in court, he is not a paedophile.<br><br>Watch for it, i suspect the gold diggers will try a civil suit soon.
