Last time this NS guy, heard he every month earning 20k, coz he had a biz, driving Merc, but I like him because he's extremely friendly and humble, never boast much, it's really amazing.

You need to understand what the company is doing, the management team, what its future strategies might be, and read current news and relate how the strategies is in alignment with the market trends. Example, if the company during its annual reports stated that it's going into the cd/vcd market over the next 5 yrs and recent research shows that youngsters nowadays prefer to download music from the net, then you know the company is likely to face plenty of risk ahead. You need to do alot of research, and relate the information to if the business is going to be more profitable in the future. You need to have an exit strategy, meaning, you need to know what should be the actual value of the stock, at what price you will sell it. For example, if the value of the stock is $1, but the market price is $0.30, you should buy and wait until it gets to $1 then sell. But if the market price is $1.10, then the price is more than what the stock should be valued at, so dun buy. To put in layman term means, if you go into a furniture shop and see Chair A and Chair B, chair A cost $1, chair B cost $2, that's their price. If chair A can last you only 1 year, but chair B last 5 years, chair B has better value than Chair A. People who only see the price and not the value tend to buy liabilities. People who know how to spot value in some things, will be able to buy assets. That's why the cheapest may not be the best.<br><br>Even if you don't know anything about investing, I still suggest you just anyhow pick a few stocks from different industries, sort of like diversification to reduce your risk. Since stock market grow about 10% annually, over the long run, you will still earn more money than the puny 1% banks pay for your savings. Investment is for really long term, 2yrs to &gt;20yrs, but overall i would suggest put the money in and forget about it. When I first started, I invest and then everyday check the stock market prices, really dumb of me.<br><br>Banks take your money, give you 1% interest, then they invest in other things, even if they earn 6% from your money, think about it, using your money and paying you 1% but they keep 5%, you dulan or not.

Last time this NS guy, heard he every month earning 20k, coz he had a biz, driving Merc, but I like him because he's extremely friendly and humble, never boast much, it's really amazing. He got really good looks and money, could have been a player, but still so loyal to his gf. Another guy I look up to is Warran Buffet, he so rich but still so frugal, really amazing, he's my hero.</div></blockquote>Wow, how old was he? 20 at most? That's a mean feat, having a business that makes 20k profit in his absence.<br><br>Any idea what he was in? Not to copy lah, just to study.</div>
