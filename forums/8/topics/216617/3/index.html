            <div class='col-md body'><br>For those who care to know about financial knowledge, it's important to have 6 months savings, while the rest of the money set aside into bonds, stocks, commodities, passive income, etc. Putting more than necessary in banks is quite stupid.<br><br>I have a few plans myself, just sharing because I see my friends owning cars/houses/maids/credit cards and looks very rich, but every month working like a slave to pay all that. For me, money is working very hard for me, so next time I don't have to work so hard at all.<br><br>I know this sounds crazy, I am 25 but I am already planning ahead for retirement, if you're younger than me, you have a headstart advantage over me. I put 60k in investments altogether, so this 2-3 yrs will be tough for me, because I'm investing heavily since I came from a poor family. Considering my investment growing at the current constant rate, even if I go to jail now and come out 20 yrs later, I'll still be a millionaire.<br><br>Secondly, I've invested heavily in my studies, because next time I plan to come out and be a professor. I find studying extremely fun and interesting. Since it's in my interests, next time I should probably enjoy working. Education will help to get you out of poverty, that's what I believe in, and something that I acted upon.<br><br>Third, it's important to buy some insurance to cover illness especially if you are not particularly rich. Even millionaires can become bankrupt nowadays with the rising medical fees, believe it or not. So always protect yourself physically and financially.<br><br>Forth, it's good to be earning multiple streams of income. It's amazingly fun especially when you know that you are in control. If your income comes purely from your job, then when you gets retrenched, then you have no cash flow. If you have MSI, then even if you lost one customer ( your job ), then you still have plenty to get along, your cash flow is not disrupted at all.<br><br>Fifth, I always hang out with positive/smart people ( most of the time, they also happen to be directors and big shots so i guess personality helps alot ), so they kind of influence me alot. I say this because most of the time, people are so stubborn they refuse to learn, they always think they are the smartest. So to be financially savvy, you also need to be open minded and filter information that can be financially beneficial to you. For example, I wanted to buy a car last time for my gf, so I seek advice from this business man, and he told me about all the things associated with having a car, which luckily I listen and give up such a stupid idea given my financial status at that time.<br><br>Sixth, it's important to have good work ethics. It doesn't matter how good you are at your studies, if you have terrific work ethics, you are opening many opportunities for yourself. I have gotten to know many high ranking people from small companies to huge companies through my hard work which they recognize and refer me more clients. This is something you can't get even if you have a PhD with lousy work ethics.<br><br>Seventh, I'm hoping to be an author in the future. I told my friend and see what they think, they laughed at me, quite amusing. The truth is I am writing everything I've learnt and I'm making things happen instead of leaving it to luck. Every month during my spare time, I write a small digestible chapter so maybe a few years down the road, I should have enough to get it published. So to want to be rich, you have to start taking responsibilities for your own actions and make efforts to turn your dreams into reality. You don't have to care what other people think, because chances are, many people don't want you to succeed, and they try to put you down with words or anything else they can, but successful people will not succumb to such tactics. In fact, everytime people criticise ( non-constructive criticism ) me for something, it makes me want to work so hard and driven to succeed. Part of the reason I wanted to get a PhD anyway is not so much to make a living, since I intend to have businesses, but the paper is to make a statement.<br><br>Also, I read alot of books, averaging 3/month, and it helps alot. I used to be really stupid, in terms of financial sense and business sense, but I've came a fair bit since then.<br><br>I hope those thoughts help, even though it might makes me sound like an asshole, to some people, I might be, but otherwise I can be really nice person.</div>
