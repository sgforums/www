Be it so, since hee<br>Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid<br>What shall be right: fardest from him is best<br>Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream<br>Above his equals. Farewel happy Fields<br>Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail<br>Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell<br>Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings<br>A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time.<br>The mind is its own place, and in it self<br>Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.<br>What matter where, if I be still the same,<br>And what I should be, all but less then hee<br>Whom Thunder hath made greater?

Leader of those Armies bright,<br>Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld,<br>If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge<br>Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft<br>In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge<br>Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults<br>Their surest signal, they will soon resume<br>New courage and revive, though now they lye<br>Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,<br>As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd,<br>No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth.<br>He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend<br>Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield<br>Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,<br>Behind him cast; the broad circumference<br>Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb<br>Through Optic Glass the TUSCAN Artist views<br>At Ev'ning from the top of FESOLE,<br>Or in VALDARNO, to descry new Lands,<br>Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.<br>His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine<br>Hewn on NORWEGIAN hills, to be the Mast<br>Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,<br>He walkt with to support uneasie steps<br>Over the burning Marle, not like those steps<br>On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime<br>Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;<br>Nathless he so endur'd, till on the Beach<br>Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd<br>His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans't<br>Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks<br>In VALLOMBROSA, where th' ETRURIAN shades<br>High overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedge<br>Afloat, when with fierce Winds ORION arm'd<br>Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew<br>BUSIRIS and his MEMPHIAN Chivalrie,<br>VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu'd<br>The Sojourners of GOSHEN, who beheld<br>From the safe shore their floating Carkases<br>And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown<br>Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,<br>Under amazement of their hideous change.<br>He call'd so loud, that all the hollow Deep<br>Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates,<br>Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost,<br>If such astonishment as this can sieze<br>Eternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this place<br>After the toyl of Battel to repose<br>Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find<br>To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n?<br>Or in this abject posture have ye sworn<br>To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds<br>Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood<br>With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anon<br>His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discern<br>Th' advantage, and descending tread us down<br>Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts<br>Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.<br>Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n.<br>They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung<br>Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch<br>On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,<br>Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.<br>Nor did they not perceave the evil plight<br>In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;<br>Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd<br>Innumerable. As when the potent Rod<br>Of AMRAMS Son in EGYPTS evill day<br>Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud<br>Of LOCUSTS, warping on the Eastern Wind,<br>That ore the Realm of impious PHAROAH hung<br>Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of NILE:<br>So numberless were those bad Angels seen<br>Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell<br>'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;<br>Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear<br>Of their great Sultan waving to direct<br>Thir course, in even ballance down they light<br>On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;<br>A multitude, like which the populous North<br>Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass<br>RHENE or the DANAW, when her barbarous Sons<br>Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread<br>Beneath GIBRALTAR to the LYBIAN sands.<br>Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band<br>The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood<br>Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms<br>Excelling human, Princely Dignities,<br>And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;<br>Though of their Names in heav'nly Records now<br>Be no memorial, blotted out and ras'd<br>By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.<br>Nor had they yet among the Sons of EVE<br>Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,<br>Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,<br>By falsities and lyes the greatest part<br>Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake<br>God their Creator, and th' invisible<br>Glory of him, that made them, to transform<br>Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'd<br>With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,<br>And Devils to adore for Deities:<br>Then were they known to men by various Names,<br>And various Idols through the Heathen World.<br>Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,<br>Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,<br>At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth<br>Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,<br>While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?<br>The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell<br>Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix<br>Their Seats long after next the Seat of God,<br>Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd<br>Among the Nations round, and durst abide<br>JEHOVAH thundring out of SION, thron'd<br>Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd<br>Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,<br>Abominations; and with cursed things<br>His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan'd,<br>And with their darkness durst affront his light.<br>First MOLOCH, horrid King besmear'd with blood<br>Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,<br>Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud<br>Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire<br>To his grim Idol. Him the AMMONITE<br>Worshipt in RABBA and her watry Plain,<br>In ARGOB and in BASAN, to the stream<br>Of utmost ARNON. Nor content with such<br>Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart<br>Of SOLOMON he led by fraud to build<br>His Temple right against the Temple of God<br>On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove<br>The pleasant Vally of HINNOM, TOPHET thence<br>And black GEHENNA call'd, the Type of Hell.<br>Next CHEMOS, th' obscene dread of MOABS Sons,<br>From AROER to NEBO, and the wild<br>Of Southmost ABARIM; in HESEBON<br>And HERONAIM, SEONS Realm, beyond<br>The flowry Dale of SIBMA clad with Vines,<br>And ELEALE to th' ASPHALTICK Pool.<br>PEOR his other Name, when he entic'd<br>ISRAEL in SITTIM on their march from NILE<br>To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.<br>Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd<br>Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove<br>Of MOLOCH homicide, lust hard by hate;<br>Till good JOSIAH drove them thence to Hell.<br>With these came they, who from the bordring flood<br>Of old EUPHRATES to the Brook that parts<br>EGYPT from SYRIAN ground, had general Names<br>Of BAALIM and ASHTAROTH, those male,<br>These Feminine. For Spirits when they please<br>Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft<br>And uncompounded is their Essence pure,<br>Not ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb,<br>Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,<br>Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose<br>Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure,<br>Can execute their aerie purposes,<br>And works of love or enmity fulfill.<br>For those the Race of ISRAEL oft forsook<br>Their living strength, and unfrequented left<br>His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down<br>To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low<br>Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear<br>Of despicable foes. With these in troop<br>Came ASTORETH, whom the PHOENICIANS call'd<br>ASTARTE, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns;<br>To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon<br>SIDONIAN Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,<br>In SION also not unsung, where stood<br>Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built<br>By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,<br>Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell<br>To Idols foul. THAMMUZ came next behind,<br>Whose annual wound in LEBANON allur'd<br>The SYRIAN Damsels to lament his fate<br>In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,<br>While smooth ADONIS from his native Rock<br>Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood<br>Of THAMMUZ yearly wounded: the Love-tale<br>Infected SIONS daughters with like heat,<br>Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch<br>EZEKIEL saw, when by the Vision led<br>His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries<br>Of alienated JUDAH. Next came one<br>Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark<br>Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off<br>In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,<br>Where he fell flat, and sham'd his Worshipers:<br>DAGON his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man<br>And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high<br>Rear'd in AZOTUS, dreaded through the Coast<br>Of PALESTINE, in GATH and ASCALON,<br>And ACCARON and GAZA's frontier bounds.<br>Him follow'd RIMMON, whose delightful Seat<br>Was fair DAMASCUS, on the fertil Banks<br>Of ABBANA and PHARPHAR, lucid streams.<br>He also against the house of God was bold:<br>A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King,<br>AHAZ his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew<br>Gods Altar to disparage and displace<br>For one of SYRIAN mode, whereon to burn<br>His odious offrings, and adore the Gods<br>Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear'd<br>A crew who under Names of old Renown,<br>OSIRIS, ISIS, ORUS and their Train<br>With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd<br>Fanatic EGYPT and her Priests, to seek<br>Thir wandring Gods disguis'd in brutish forms<br>Rather then human. Nor did ISRAEL scape<br>Th' infection when their borrow'd Gold compos'd<br>The Calf in OREB: and the Rebel King<br>Doubl'd that sin in BETHEL and in DAN,<br>Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,<br>JEHOVAH, who in one Night when he pass'd<br>From EGYPT marching, equal'd with one stroke<br>Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.<br>BELIAL came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd<br>Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love<br>Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood<br>Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee<br>In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest<br>Turns Atheist, as did ELY'S Sons, who fill'd<br>With lust and violence the house of God.<br>In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns<br>And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse<br>Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,<br>And injury and outrage: And when Night<br>Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons<br>Of BELIAL, flown with insolence and wine.<br>Witness the Streets of SODOM, and that night<br>In GIBEAH, when hospitable Dores<br>Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.<br>These were the prime in order and in might;<br>The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd,<br>Th' IONIAN Gods, of JAVANS Issue held<br>Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and Earth<br>Thir boasted Parents; TITAN Heav'ns first born<br>With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd<br>By younger SATURN, he from mightier JOVE<br>His own and RHEA'S Son like measure found;<br>So JOVE usurping reign'd: these first in CREET<br>And IDA known, thence on the Snowy top<br>Of cold OLYMPUS rul'd the middle Air<br>Thir highest Heav'n; or on the DELPHIAN Cliff,<br>Or in DODONA, and through all the bounds<br>Of DORIC Land; or who with SATURN old<br>Fled over ADRIA to th' HESPERIAN Fields,<br>And ore the CELTIC roam'd the utmost Isles.<br>All these and more came flocking; but with looks<br>Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd<br>Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief<br>Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost<br>In loss it self; which on his count'nance cast<br>Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride<br>Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore<br>Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais'd<br>Their fainted courage, and dispel'd their fears.<br>Then strait commands that at the warlike sound<br>Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard<br>His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd<br>AZAZEL as his right, a Cherube tall:<br>Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld<br>Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc't<br>Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind<br>With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd,<br>Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while<br>Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:<br>At which the universal Host upsent<br>A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond<br>Frighted the Reign of CHAOS and old Night.<br>All in a moment through the gloom were seen<br>Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air<br>With Orient Colours waving: with them rose<br>A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms<br>Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick array<br>Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move<br>In perfect PHALANX to the Dorian mood<br>Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd<br>To highth of noblest temper Hero's old<br>Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage<br>Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd<br>With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,<br>Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage<br>With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase<br>Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain<br>From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they<br>Breathing united force with fixed thought<br>Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd<br>Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now<br>Advanc't in view they stand, a horrid Front<br>Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise<br>Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield,<br>Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief<br>Had to impose: He through the armed Files<br>Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse<br>The whole Battalion views, thir order due,<br>Thir visages and stature as of Gods,<br>Thir number last he summs. And now his heart<br>Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength<br>Glories: For never since created man,<br>Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these<br>Could merit more then that small infantry<br>Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood<br>Of PHLEGRA with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd<br>That fought at THEB'S and ILIUM, on each side<br>Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds<br>In Fable or ROMANCE of UTHERS Son<br>Begirt with BRITISH and ARMORIC Knights;<br>And all who since, Baptiz'd or Infidel<br>Jousted in ASPRAMONT or MONTALBAN,<br>DAMASCO, or MAROCCO, or TREBISOND,<br>Or whom BISERTA sent from AFRIC shore<br>When CHARLEMAIN with all his Peerage fell<br>By FONTARABBIA. Thus far these beyond<br>Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd<br>Thir dread Commander: he above the rest<br>In shape and gesture proudly eminent<br>Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost<br>All her Original brightness, nor appear'd<br>Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excess<br>Of Glory obscur'd: As when the Sun new ris'n<br>Looks through the Horizontal misty Air<br>Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon<br>In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds<br>On half the Nations, and with fear of change<br>Perplexes Monarchs. Dark'n'd so, yet shon<br>Above them all th' Arch Angel: but his face<br>Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care<br>Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes<br>Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride<br>Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast<br>Signs of remorse and passion to behold<br>The fellows of his crime, the followers rather<br>(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd<br>For ever now to have their lot in pain,<br>Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't<br>Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors flung<br>For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,<br>Thir Glory witherd. As when Heavens Fire<br>Hath scath'd the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,<br>With singed top their stately growth though bare<br>Stands on the blasted Heath. He now prepar'd<br>To speak; whereat their doubl'd Ranks they bend<br>From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round<br>With all his Peers: attention held them mute.<br>Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,<br>Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last<br>Words interwove with sighs found out their way.<br>O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers<br>Matchless, but with th' Almighty, and that strife<br>Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire,<br>As this place testifies, and this dire change<br>Hateful to utter: but what power of mind<br>Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth<br>Of knowledge past or present, could have fear'd,<br>How such united force of Gods, how such<br>As stood like these, could ever know repulse?<br>For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,<br>That all these puissant Legions, whose exile<br>Hath emptied Heav'n, shall faile to re-ascend<br>Self-rais'd, and repossess their native seat.<br>For me, be witness all the Host of Heav'n,<br>If counsels different, or danger shun'd<br>By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns<br>Monarch in Heav'n, till then as one secure<br>Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,<br>Consent or custome, and his Regal State<br>Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd,<br>Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.<br>Henceforth his might we know, and know our own<br>So as not either to provoke, or dread<br>New warr, provok't; our better part remains<br>To work in close design, by fraud or guile<br>What force effected not: that he no less<br>At length from us may find, who overcomes<br>By force, hath overcome but half his foe.<br>Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife<br>There went a fame in Heav'n that he ere long<br>Intended to create, and therein plant<br>A generation, whom his choice regard<br>Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:<br>Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps<br>Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:<br>For this Infernal Pit shall never hold<br>Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th' Abysse<br>Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts<br>Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,<br>For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr<br>Open or understood must be resolv'd.<br>He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew<br>Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs<br>Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze<br>Far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd<br>Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm's<br>Clash'd on their sounding shields the din of war,<br>Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav'n.<br>There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top<br>Belch'd fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire<br>Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign<br>That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,<br>The work of Sulphur. Thither wing'd with speed<br>A numerous Brigad hasten'd. As when bands<br>Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm'd<br>Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,<br>Or cast a Rampart. MAMMON led them on,<br>MAMMON, the least erected Spirit that fell<br>From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks &amp; thoughts<br>Were always downward bent, admiring more<br>The riches of Heav'ns pavement, trod'n Gold,<br>Then aught divine or holy else enjoy'd<br>In vision beatific: by him first<br>Men also, and by his suggestion taught,<br>Ransack'd the Center, and with impious hands<br>Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth<br>For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew<br>Op'nd into the Hill a spacious wound<br>And dig'd out ribs of Gold. Let none admire<br>That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best<br>Deserve the pretious bane. And here let those<br>Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell<br>Of BABEL, and the works of MEMPHIAN Kings,<br>Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,<br>And Strength and Art are easily outdone<br>By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour<br>What in an age they with incessant toyle<br>And hands innumerable scarce perform<br>Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar'd,<br>That underneath had veins of liquid fire<br>Sluc'd from the Lake, a second multitude<br>With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore,<br>Severing each kinde, and scum'd the Bullion dross:<br>A third as soon had form'd within the ground<br>A various mould, and from the boyling cells<br>By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook,<br>As in an Organ from one blast of wind<br>To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.<br>Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge<br>Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound<br>Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,<br>Built like a Temple, where PILASTERS round<br>Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid<br>With Golden Architrave; nor did there want<br>Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n,<br>The Roof was fretted Gold. Not BABILON,<br>Nor great ALCAIRO such magnificence<br>Equal'd in all thir glories, to inshrine<br>BELUS or SERAPIS thir Gods, or seat<br>Thir Kings, when AEGYPT with ASSYRIA strove<br>In wealth and luxurie. Th' ascending pile<br>Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores<br>Op'ning thir brazen foulds discover wide<br>Within, her ample spaces, o're the smooth<br>And level pavement: from the arched roof<br>Pendant by suttle Magic many a row<br>Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed<br>With Naphtha and ASPHALTUS yeilded light<br>As from a sky. The hasty multitude<br>Admiring enter'd, and the work some praise<br>And some the Architect: his hand was known<br>In Heav'n by many a Towred structure high,<br>Where Scepter'd Angels held thir residence,<br>And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King<br>Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,<br>Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.<br>Nor was his name unheard or unador'd<br>In ancient Greece; and in AUSONIAN land<br>Men call'd him MULCIBER; and how he fell<br>From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry JOVE<br>Sheer o're the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn<br>To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,<br>A Summers day; and with the setting Sun<br>Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,<br>On LEMNOS th' AEGAEAN Ile: thus they relate,<br>Erring; for he with this rebellious rout<br>Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now<br>To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape<br>By all his Engins, but was headlong sent<br>With his industrious crew to build in hell.<br>Mean while the winged Haralds by command<br>Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony<br>And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim<br>A solemn Councel forthwith to be held<br>At PANDAEMONIUM, the high Capital<br>Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call'd<br>From every and Band squared Regiment<br>By place or choice the worthiest; they anon<br>With hundreds and with thousands trooping came<br>Attended: all access was throng'd, the Gates<br>And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall<br>(Though like a cover'd field, where Champions bold<br>Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans chair<br>Defi'd the best of Panim chivalry<br>To mortal combat or carreer with Lance)<br>Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air,<br>Brusht with the hiss of russling wings. As Bees<br>In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,<br>Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive<br>In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers<br>Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,<br>The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,<br>New rub'd with Baume, expatiate and confer<br>Thir State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd<br>Swarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n,<br>Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd<br>In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons<br>Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room<br>Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race<br>Beyond the INDIAN Mount, or Faerie Elves,<br>Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side<br>Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees,<br>Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon<br>Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth<br>Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth &amp; dance<br>Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear;<br>At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.<br>Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms<br>Reduc'd thir shapes immense, and were at large,<br>Though without number still amidst the Hall<br>Of that infernal Court. But far within<br>And in thir own dimensions like themselves<br>The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim<br>In close recess and secret conclave sat<br>A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat's,<br>Frequent and full. After short silence then<br>And summons read, the great consult began.<br>END OF BOOK I<br><br>High on a Throne of Royal State, which far<br>Outshon the wealth of ORMUS and of IND,<br>Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand<br>Showrs on her Kings BARBARIC Pearl &amp; Gold,<br>Satan exalted sat, by merit rais'd<br>To that bad eminence; and from despair<br>Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires<br>Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue<br>Vain Warr with Heav'n, and by success untaught<br>His proud imaginations thus displaid.<br><br>Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav'n,<br>For since no deep within her gulf can hold<br>Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall'n,<br>I give not Heav'n for lost. From this descent<br>Celestial vertues rising, will appear<br>More glorious and more dread then from no fall,<br>And trust themselves to fear no second fate:<br>Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav'n<br>Did first create your Leader, next, free choice,<br>With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight,<br>Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss<br>Thus farr at least recover'd, hath much more<br>Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne<br>Yeilded with full consent. The happier state<br>In Heav'n, which follows dignity, might draw<br>Envy from each inferior; but who here<br>Will envy whom the highest place exposes<br>Formost to stand against the Thunderers aime<br>Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share<br>Of endless pain? where there is then no good<br>For which to strive, no strife can grow up there<br>From Faction; for none sure will claim in hell<br>Precedence, none, whose portion is so small<br>Of present pain, that with ambitious mind<br>Will covet more. With this advantage then<br>To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord,<br>More then can be in Heav'n, we now return<br>To claim our just inheritance of old,<br>Surer to prosper then prosperity<br>Could have assur'd us; and by what best way,<br>Whether of open Warr or covert guile,<br>We now debate; who can advise, may speak.<br><br>He ceas'd, and next him MOLOC, Scepter'd King<br>Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit<br>That fought in Heav'n; now fiercer by despair:<br>His trust was with th' Eternal to be deem'd<br>Equal in strength, and rather then be less<br>Car'd not to be at all; with that care lost<br>Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse<br>He reckd not, and these words thereafter spake.<br><br>My sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles,<br>More unexpert, I boast not: them let those<br>Contrive who need, or when they need, not now.<br>For while they sit contriving, shall the rest,<br>Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait<br>The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here<br>Heav'ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place<br>Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame,<br>The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns<br>By our delay? no, let us rather choose<br>Arm'd with Hell flames and fury all at once<br>O're Heav'ns high Towrs to force resistless way,<br>Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms<br>Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise<br>Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear<br>Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see<br>Black fire and horror shot with equal rage<br>Among his Angels; and his Throne it self<br>Mixt with TARTAREAN Sulphur, and strange fire,<br>His own invented Torments. But perhaps<br>The way seems difficult and steep to scale<br>With upright wing against a higher foe.<br>Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench<br>Of that forgetful Lake benumme not still,<br>That in our proper motion we ascend<br>Up to our native seat: descent and fall<br>To us is adverse. Who but felt of late<br>When the fierce Foe hung on our brok'n Rear<br>Insulting, and pursu'd us through the Deep,<br>With what compulsion and laborious flight<br>We sunk thus low? Th' ascent is easie then;<br>Th' event is fear'd; should we again provoke<br>Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find<br>To our destruction: if there be in Hell<br>Fear to be worse destroy'd: what can be worse<br>Then to dwell here, driv'n out from bliss, condemn'd<br>In this abhorred deep to utter woe;<br>Where pain of unextinguishable fire<br>Must exercise us without hope of end<br>The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge<br>Inexorably, and the torturing houre<br>Calls us to Penance? More destroy'd then thus<br>We should be quite abolisht and expire.<br>What fear we then? what doubt we to incense<br>His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag'd,<br>Will either quite consume us, and reduce<br>To nothing this essential, happier farr<br>Then miserable to have eternal being:<br>Or if our substance be indeed Divine,<br>And cannot cease to be, we are at worst<br>On this side nothing; and by proof we feel<br>Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav'n,<br>And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme,<br>Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne:<br>Which if not Victory is yet Revenge.<br><br>He ended frowning, and his look denounc'd<br>Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous<br>To less then Gods. On th' other side up rose<br>BELIAL, in act more graceful and humane;<br>A fairer person lost not Heav'n; he seemd<br>For dignity compos'd and high exploit:<br>But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue<br>Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear<br>The better reason, to perplex and dash<br>Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;<br>To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds<br>Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the eare,<br>And with perswasive accent thus began.<br><br>I should be much for open Warr, O Peers,<br>As not behind in hate; if what was urg'd<br>Main reason to perswade immediate Warr,<br>Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast<br>Ominous conjecture on the whole success:<br>When he who most excels in fact of Arms,<br>In what he counsels and in what excels<br>Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair<br>And utter dissolution, as the scope<br>Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.<br>First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav'n are fill'd<br>With Armed watch, that render all access<br>Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep<br>Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing<br>Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night,<br>Scorning surprize. Or could we break our way<br>By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise<br>With blackest Insurrection, to confound<br>Heav'ns purest Light, yet our great Enemie<br>All incorruptible would on his Throne<br>Sit unpolluted, and th' Ethereal mould<br>Incapable of stain would soon expel<br>Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire<br>Victorious. Thus repuls'd, our final hope<br>Is flat despair: we must exasperate<br>Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,<br>And that must end us, that must be our cure,<br>To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose,<br>Though full of pain, this intellectual being,<br>Those thoughts that wander through Eternity,<br>To perish rather, swallowd up and lost<br>In the wide womb of uncreated night,<br>Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows,<br>Let this be good, whether our angry Foe<br>Can give it, or will ever? how he can<br>Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.<br>Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,<br>Belike through impotence, or unaware,<br>To give his Enemies thir wish, and end<br>Them in his anger, whom his anger saves<br>To punish endless? wherefore cease we then?<br>Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed,<br>Reserv'd and destin'd to Eternal woe;<br>Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,<br>What can we suffer worse? is this then worst,<br>Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms?<br>What when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook<br>With Heav'ns afflicting Thunder, and besought<br>The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem'd<br>A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay<br>Chain'd on the burning Lake? that sure was worse.<br>What if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires<br>Awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage<br>And plunge us in the Flames? or from above<br>Should intermitted vengeance Arme again<br>His red right hand to plague us? what if all<br>Her stores were op'n'd, and this Firmament<br>Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire,<br>Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall<br>One day upon our heads; while we perhaps<br>Designing or exhorting glorious Warr,<br>Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl'd<br>Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey<br>Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk<br>Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains;<br>There to converse with everlasting groans,<br>Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd,<br>Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse.<br>Warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike<br>My voice disswades; for what can force or guile<br>With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye<br>Views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth<br>All these our motions vain, sees and derides;<br>Not more Almighty to resist our might<br>Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.<br>Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav'n<br>Thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here<br>Chains &amp; these Torments? better these then worse<br>By my advice; since fate inevitable<br>Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree,<br>The Victors will. To suffer, as to doe,<br>Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust<br>That so ordains: this was at first resolv'd,<br>If we were wise, against so great a foe<br>Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.<br>I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold<br>And vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear<br>What yet they know must follow, to endure<br>Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,<br>The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now<br>Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,<br>Our Supream Foe in time may much remit<br>His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd<br>Not mind us not offending, satisfi'd<br>With what is punish't; whence these raging fires<br>Will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames.<br>Our purer essence then will overcome<br>Thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel,<br>Or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd<br>In temper and in nature, will receive<br>Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain;<br>This horror will grow milde, this darkness light,<br>Besides what hope the never-ending flight<br>Of future days may bring, what chance, what change<br>Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers<br>For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,<br>If we procure not to our selves more woe.<br><br>Thus BELIAL with words cloath'd in reasons garb<br>Counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath,<br>Not peace: and after him thus MAMMON spake.<br><br>Either to disinthrone the King of Heav'n<br>We warr, if warr be best, or to regain<br>Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then<br>May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild<br>To fickle Chance, and CHAOS judge the strife:<br>The former vain to hope argues as vain<br>The latter: for what place can be for us<br>Within Heav'ns bound, unless Heav'ns Lord supream<br>We overpower? Suppose he should relent<br>And publish Grace to all, on promise made<br>Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we<br>Stand in his presence humble, and receive<br>Strict Laws impos'd, to celebrate his Throne<br>With warbl'd Hymns, and to his Godhead sing<br>Forc't Halleluiah's; while he Lordly sits<br>Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes<br>Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers,<br>Our servile offerings. This must be our task<br>In Heav'n, this our delight; how wearisom<br>Eternity so spent in worship paid<br>To whom we hate. Let us not then pursue<br>By force impossible, by leave obtain'd<br>Unacceptable, though in Heav'n, our state<br>Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek<br>Our own good from our selves, and from our own<br>Live to our selves, though in this vast recess,<br>Free, and to none accountable, preferring<br>Hard liberty before the easie yoke<br>Of servile Pomp. Our greatness will appear<br>Then most conspicuous, when great things of small,<br>Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse<br>We can create, and in what place so e're<br>Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain<br>Through labour and endurance. This deep world<br>Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst<br>Thick clouds and dark doth Heav'ns all-ruling Sire<br>Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur'd,<br>And with the Majesty of darkness round<br>Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar<br>Must'ring thir rage, and Heav'n resembles Hell?<br>As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light<br>Imitate when we please? This Desart soile<br>Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;<br>Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise<br>Magnificence; and what can Heav'n shew more?<br>Our torments also may in length of time<br>Become our Elements, these piercing Fires<br>As soft as now severe, our temper chang'd<br>Into their temper; which must needs remove<br>The sensible of pain. All things invite<br>To peaceful Counsels, and the settl'd State<br>Of order, how in safety best we may<br>Compose our present evils, with regard<br>Of what we are and where, dismissing quite<br>All thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise.<br><br>He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld<br>Th' Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain<br>The sound of blustring winds, which all night long<br>Had rous'd the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull<br>Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance<br>Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay<br>After the Tempest: Such applause was heard<br>As MAMMON ended, and his Sentence pleas'd,<br>Advising peace: for such another Field<br>They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear<br>Of Thunder and the Sword of MICHAEL<br>Wrought still within them; and no less desire<br>To found this nether Empire, which might rise<br>By pollicy, and long process of time,<br>In emulation opposite to Heav'n.<br>Which when BEELZEBUB perceiv'd, then whom,<br>SATAN except, none higher sat, with grave<br>Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd<br>A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven<br>Deliberation sat and publick care;<br>And Princely counsel in his face yet shon,<br>Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood<br>With ATLANTEAN shoulders fit to bear<br>The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look<br>Drew audience and attention still as Night<br>Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.<br><br>Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav'n,<br>Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now<br>Must we renounce, and changing stile be call'd<br>Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote<br>Inclines, here to continue, and build up here<br>A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream,<br>And know not that the King of Heav'n hath doom'd<br>This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat<br>Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt<br>From Heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new League<br>Banded against his Throne, but to remaine<br>In strictest bondage, though thus far remov'd,<br>Under th' inevitable curb, reserv'd<br>His captive multitude: For he, be sure,<br>In highth or depth, still first and last will Reign<br>Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part<br>By our revolt, but over Hell extend<br>His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule<br>Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav'n.<br>What sit we then projecting Peace and Warr?<br>Warr hath determin'd us, and foild with loss<br>Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none<br>Voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n<br>To us enslav'd, but custody severe,<br>And stripes, and arbitrary punishment<br>Inflicted? and what peace can we return,<br>But to our power hostility and hate,<br>Untam'd reluctance, and revenge though slow,<br>Yet ever plotting how the Conquerour least<br>May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce<br>In doing what we most in suffering feel?<br>Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need<br>With dangerous expedition to invade<br>Heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege,<br>Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find<br>Some easier enterprize? There is a place<br>(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav'n<br>Err not) another World, the happy seat<br>Of som new Race call'd MAN, about this time<br>To be created like to us, though less<br>In power and excellence, but favour'd more<br>Of him who rules above; so was his will<br>Pronounc'd among the Gods, and by an Oath,<br>That shook Heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd.<br>Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn<br>What creatures there inhabit, of what mould,<br>Or substance, how endu'd, and what thir Power,<br>And where thir weakness, how attempted best,<br>By force or suttlety: Though Heav'n be shut,<br>And Heav'ns high Arbitrator sit secure<br>In his own strength, this place may lye expos'd<br>The utmost border of his Kingdom, left<br>To their defence who hold it: here perhaps<br>Som advantagious act may be achiev'd<br>By sudden onset, either with Hell fire<br>To waste his whole Creation, or possess<br>All as our own, and drive as we were driven,<br>The punie habitants, or if not drive,<br>Seduce them to our Party, that thir God<br>May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand<br>Abolish his own works. This would surpass<br>Common revenge, and interrupt his joy<br>In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise<br>In his disturbance; when his darling Sons<br>Hurl'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse<br>Thir frail Originals, and faded bliss,<br>Faded so soon. Advise if this be worth<br>Attempting, or to sit in darkness here<br>Hatching vain Empires. Thus BEELZEBUB<br>Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis'd<br>By SATAN, and in part propos'd: for whence,<br>But from the Author of all ill could Spring<br>So deep a malice, to confound the race<br>Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell<br>To mingle and involve, done all to spite<br>The great Creatour? But thir spite still serves<br>His glory to augment. The bold design<br>Pleas'd highly those infernal States, and joy<br>Sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent<br>They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.<br><br>Well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate,<br>Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are,<br>Great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep<br>Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate,<br>Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view<br>Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms<br>And opportune excursion we may chance<br>Re-enter Heav'n; or else in some milde Zone<br>Dwell not unvisited of Heav'ns fair Light<br>Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam<br>Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air,<br>To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires<br>Shall breath her balme. But first whom shall we send<br>In search of this new world, whom shall we find<br>Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet<br>The dark unbottom'd infinite Abyss<br>And through the palpable obscure find out<br>His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight<br>Upborn with indefatigable wings<br>Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive<br>The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then<br>Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe<br>Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick<br>Of Angels watching round? Here he had need<br>All circumspection, and we now no less<br>Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,<br>The weight of all and our last hope relies.<br><br>This said, he sat; and expectation held<br>His look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd<br>To second, or oppose, or undertake<br>The perilous attempt: but all sat mute,<br>Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; &amp; each<br>In others count'nance red his own dismay<br>Astonisht: none among the choice and prime<br>Of those Heav'n-warring Champions could be found<br>So hardie as to proffer or accept<br>Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last<br>SATAN, whom now transcendent glory rais'd<br>Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride<br>Conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus spake.<br><br>O Progeny of Heav'n, Empyreal Thrones,<br>With reason hath deep silence and demurr<br>Seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the way<br>And hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light;<br>Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire,<br>Outrageous to devour, immures us round<br>Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant<br>Barr'd over us prohibit all egress.<br>These past, if any pass, the void profound<br>Of unessential Night receives him next<br>Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being<br>Threatens him, plung'd in that abortive gulf.<br>If thence he scape into what ever world,<br>Or unknown Region, what remains him less<br>Then unknown dangers and as hard escape.<br>But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers,<br>And this Imperial Sov'ranty, adorn'd<br>With splendor, arm'd with power, if aught propos'd<br>And judg'd of public moment, in the shape<br>Of difficulty or danger could deterre<br>Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume<br>These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign,<br>Refusing to accept as great a share<br>Of hazard as of honour, due alike<br>To him who Reigns, and so much to him due<br>Of hazard more, as he above the rest<br>High honourd sits? Go therfore mighty powers,<br>Terror of Heav'n, though fall'n; intend at home,<br>While here shall be our home, what best may ease<br>The present misery, and render Hell<br>More tollerable; if there be cure or charm<br>To respite or deceive, or slack the pain<br>Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch<br>Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad<br>Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek<br>Deliverance for us all: this enterprize<br>None shall partake with me. Thus saying rose<br>The Monarch, and prevented all reply,<br>Prudent, least from his resolution rais'd<br>Others among the chief might offer now<br>(Certain to be refus'd) what erst they feard;<br>And so refus'd might in opinion stand<br>His rivals, winning cheap the high repute<br>Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they<br>Dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice<br>Forbidding; and at once with him they rose;<br>Thir rising all at once was as the sound<br>Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend<br>With awful reverence prone; and as a God<br>Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav'n:<br>Nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd,<br>That for the general safety he despis'd<br>His own: for neither do the Spirits damn'd<br>Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast<br>Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,<br>Or close ambition varnisht o're with zeal.<br>Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark<br>Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief:<br>As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds<br>Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o'respread<br>Heav'ns chearful face, the lowring Element<br>Scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip Snow, or showre;<br>If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet<br>Extend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive,<br>The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds<br>Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings.<br>O shame to men! Devil with Devil damn'd<br>Firm concord holds, men onely disagree<br>Of Creatures rational, though under hope<br>Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace,<br>Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife<br>Among themselves, and levie cruel warres,<br>Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy:<br>As if (which might induce us to accord)<br>Man had not hellish foes anow besides,<br>That day and night for his destruction waite.<br><br>The STYGIAN Councel thus dissolv'd; and forth<br>In order came the grand infernal Peers,<br>Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd<br>Alone th' Antagonist of Heav'n, nor less<br>Then Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream,<br>And God-like imitated State; him round<br>A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos'd<br>With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms.<br>Then of thir Session ended they bid cry<br>With Trumpets regal sound the great result:<br>Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim<br>Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie<br>By Haralds voice explain'd: the hollow Abyss<br>Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell<br>With deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim.<br>Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais'd<br>By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers<br>Disband, and wandring, each his several way<br>Pursues, as inclination or sad choice<br>Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find<br>Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain<br>The irksome hours, till his great Chief return.<br>Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime<br>Upon the wing, or in swift race contend,<br>As at th' Olympian Games or PYTHIAN fields;<br>Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal<br>With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form.<br>As when to warn proud Cities warr appears<br>Wag'd in the troubl'd Skie, and Armies rush<br>To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van<br>Pric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears<br>Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms<br>From either end of Heav'n the welkin burns.<br>Others with vast TYPHOEAN rage more fell<br>Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air<br>In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar.<br>As when ALCIDES from OEALIA Crown'd<br>With conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore<br>Through pain up by the roots THESSALIAN Pines,<br>And LICHAS from the top of OETA threw<br>Into th' EUBOIC Sea. Others more milde,<br>Retreated in a silent valley, sing<br>With notes Angelical to many a Harp<br>Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall<br>By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate<br>Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance.<br>Thir song was partial, but the harmony<br>(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)<br>Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment<br>The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet<br>(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,)<br>Others apart sat on a Hill retir'd,<br>In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high<br>Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate,<br>Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,<br>And found no end, in wandring mazes lost.<br>Of good and evil much they argu'd then,<br>Of happiness and final misery,<br>Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame,<br>Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie:<br>Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm<br>Pain for a while or anguish, and excite<br>Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest<br>With stubborn patience as with triple steel.</div>
