              I was told by this job agency(Comtel Solutions Pte Ltd) to have an interview with Credit Suisse Bank this morning on 11:00 AM, at this address 51 Changi Business Park Central 2,
              4th Floor, The Signature.
              
              When I came there lots of guys are waiting, so I waited there also, but lots of us waited and waited, some of them even for around 4 hours, really crazy.
              
              Finally for me it's around 3.5 hours, I didn't want to wait again, so tell them I should leave, they told me would arrange me soon, but still need wait around 20 minutes, I gave up.
              
              So now just write that down to let more guys know about it.
              
              
              this is the address about the company, be careful about it:

              <p><br>Allo!  You first time ever attend interview arh?</p>
              <p>This is your job agency fault?</p>
              <p>FYI, the bank HR dept should be the people that dictate the interview time.  Not your agency.</p>
              <p>You really think all bank execs are soo free to cater to job agency timing?  Who do you think is paying who for a successful recruit?</p>

              <p>And you didnt get the job.</p>
              <p>Goes to show.........you really couldnt make it even with them.........kinda......shows you really no experience.</p>

              <p>I would suggest the job agency drop you.  No point helping you anymore.  Wasting their time.</p>

              <p>Viciouskitty74, in my view, I felt that your comments are
                          uncalled for. To wait up to 3.5 hours reflects insincerity of the company in
                          their recruitment. Put yourself in their shoes. Your comments stated “<em>For a
                          HR generalist point of view</em>”, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">could</span></strong> have indicated that you
                          are a HR personnel and if that is true, I doubt your professionalism and
                          efficiency.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Even if you are not a HR administrator, your comments
                          reflected that your mentality is <strong>immature, irresponsible, uncaring,
                          inconsiderate and snobbish. </strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Indeed, the recruiter and the client are in the wrong to
                          make the candidates wait without any explanation. Not only did this incident
                          echoed the lapse in the integrity of the bank but too amplified that the
                          recruitment agency should buckle up on their customer service standards.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">No matter what circumstances the recruitment agency or the
                          client had encounter on that very day, they could had made arrangements to
                          inform all affected parties and to be prudent in making sure that the candidates’
                          trip to the said interview session were not a waste of time.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In view of the current global economical situation and the
                          shortfall of jobs availability, employers should show more compassion to their
                          potential employees. I believe the term is Corporate Social Responsibility and
                          every employee is part of the assets to the company, in another way the human
                          capital or investments.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">By commenting “<em>I would suggest the job agency drop
                          you. No point helping you anymore.  Wasting their time</em>.”
                          suggested that you have no idea how an individual would felt, going jobless for
                          months or being retrenched is disastrous to many as they could be saddled with
                          loans to pay and debts to settle, not to mention the high living standards that
                          Singapore has become.<span>  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In short, your comments reflected poorly on you as an
                          individual. I could have imagined that you are a spoilt brat who has a silver
                          spoon fed by your parents. Maybe I could have been wrong but the sediments felt
                          by many in the forum as well as the press reflects the voice of mine I suppose.
                          Viciouskitty74, you should be ashamed of yourself, maybe your upbringing could
                          be a problem.</p>

              I agree that viciouskitty's remarks are uncalled for....
              if there's the professionalism of Credit Suize, i.e. being so unorganized, what can be said about their investments and staff....this company we can as well drop.
              
              Thier HR is unexperienced and cannot even handle time-management for recruitment, they should be sacked.

              <p>i dont understand, what vk said is right, and she got lambasted...you guys got any real job experience??</p>
              <p>job agency take directions from HR as to what time to come, and besides, some HR dept do engage more than one agency for recruitment</p>
              <p>there could be miscalculations in the timing, especially when its back office of CS in Changi and they would want to employ large number of poeple</p>
              <p>and yeap, even some HR personnel told me the same thing as vk, they are very busy in screening potential employees so you got to do something that make them sit up and notice, especially during your interview and in your resume..people write so much garbage in their resumes even the managers dont bother to read through as they got busy schedule</p>

              <p>Merrill Lynch is well known for their wealth management services but look at their internal financial management</p>

              <p>If there are really so many people for interviews, then CS should schedule them to come in different days.</p>
              <p>Even ASTAR or SPF does better, duh...</p>
              <p>I believe there are more than 2-3 interviewers, thus if some interviewers cannot make it on time or day, someone else in management position can take over to help interview.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A better way for this CS to do recruiting is schedule the same way as the MORE experienced companies:</p>
              <p>1. Have 15min-20min time for first interviews and with 5min in between for interviewers to complete their assessment forms</p>
              <p>2. Schedule only enough interviewees to come on the SAME day, the rest should be scheduled at different days, look at SPF, many companies do better, CS's HR is inexperienced</p>
              <p>3. Email in advance to interviewers on the dates of interviews and liase with them their time available.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If CS's HR cannot even do such a simple task, I dont know what they are doing man. </p>
