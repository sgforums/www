              <p>Anyone have bad experiences with insurance agents ? Mine was quick to close a deal and after I made payment, there were some simple enquiries about my policy which he PROMISED to check and didn't get back to me afterwhich I checked directly with Great Eastern Life HQ and was settled over the phone. Its a very simple enquiry.</p>
              <p>This time, I asked the agent for a copy of my policy terms and conditions. Again, he PROMISED to send but didn't send. It has been 2 weeks and I'm waiting. I'm waiting daily to see how long this fellow is gonna to send. Maybe in a months time in mid Feb, I'll write in to the CEO!</p>
              <p>Anyone had bad experiences with agents to share ?</p>

              <p>I definitely have very very bad with insurance before as well. Twice so far...the first time was from Great Eastern as well. This insurance agent is one of the worse i have met and i really wonder how the HELL did she even sit on the million dollar table each year. The first time she sold me stuff was an investment product. She guarantee me that it would makes money blah blah...luckily i was not dumb enough and only plough in 5k. Before buying i told her that if this policy dun make money, dun ever call me to sell me anymore insurance products anymore. Anyway the policy failed but i din blame her since i was the one who make the decision to buy it. But then again 1 year down the road, she has the cheek to call me again. This time round trying to sell me another policy, i was very polite and told her that due to my bad experience with her i really is not keen to purchase anything with her. But she insisted on meeting up so i oblige as long as i am not force to purchase anything from her. End of the meeting i din buy anything from her and boy was she rude. Bombarding my hp with sms saying that i wasted her time blah blah....WTF was that for i was thinking......Do i owe her a policy to start with....&gt;&lt;"</p>
              <p>2nd time round was a agent from AIA. As usual they try to sell me a policy. As the agent came down all the way, i felt bad if i dun purchase anything from them. So i ended up purchasing a policy as her other policy benefits..etc is just not good enough. But because i only purchase a policy from her and not two...she got pisss off....it took me almost 1 year to retrieve a cheque from her. And that is after threatening law suit against AIA....cheez that totally suxs...</p>
              <p>Anyway all insurance agents are just $_$ face...for those who are looking to purchase policies whatsoever....make sure u read through everything and make sure u get back watever u need before making payment for the policy. Dun ever treat them with courtesy whatsoever...coz they dun deserve any respect...</p>

              <p>So many complains about Great Eastern ar. I'll share with you guys mine.</p>
              <p>This guy apparant was going door-to-door doing asking for community donation for non-profit organization. After you donated, he will reveal his true self as an investment agent asking you to buy insurance. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"> Damn! I was pretty sure he'll be getting good karma for his volunteering his time UNTIL he reveal his agent identity. I guess he's doing bad.</p>

              <p>AIA is one of the worse !</p>
              <p>I have seen how they splurge on your insurance premiums, their staffs get wonderful meal allowances whereby they bring their family out for lunch and dinner, spend it all until it hits the limit of their monthly limit. And then AIA often have trainings, they buy lots of door gifts for their insurance agents and staffs, they even have seminars, trainings and talks from reknown speakers at 5 star hotels at your expense.</p>
              <p>I've known friends who take out mortgage loans from AIA, they pay their instalments, they even kept their bank records but AIA's statement recorded that they still owe AIA money for the mortgage. Apparently the money did go into AIA's bank account but due to their awful adminstration, they couldn't trace it to their own mortgage accounts.</p>
