            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Singaporeans have been told to raise their resilience and strengthen their cohesion in the face of threats from terrorists.<br><br>Defence Minister RAdm Teo Chee Hean says the <strong>terrorists can only win if Singaporeans allow themselves to be defeated psychologically and they start to fall apart as individuals and as a society.</strong><br><br>He was speaking to some 400 students at the Temasek Seminar, which each year gives young Singaporeans an insight into the geo-political and security challenges facing Singapore.<br><br>RAdm Teo said: "We would not want to be in the same situation as Kuwait was in 1990. We need a strong defence so we can preserve our independence and sovereignty. And so we can live in peace, free to pursue what is in our own interest and for the well-being of Singaporeans."<br><br>That's why the minister say investing in defence has always been a priority especially as the military transforms itself into a 3rd generation fighting force.<br><br>But today the threat does not just come from rogue nations muscling in on smaller neighbours, nowadays it also comes from terrorists and extremist groups whose ultimate goal is establish a caliphate - a global Islamic community.<br><br>The Defence Minister said: "It is ironic that these extremists who are trying to force a return a 7th century Arabian way of life actually make very good use of 21st century technology and infrastructure. They exploit the Internet for recruiting and propagating their extremist teachings. Satellite TV stations like Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya provide platforms for screening terrorist videotapes and beaming their extremist ideology all across the world."<br><br>And even though America is the main target of the terrorists, Singapore and the region have not been spared.<br><br>There have been attacks from Casablanca to Riyadh, from Bali to Jakarta.<br><br>But the Defence Minister warned that the real target is psychological - terrorism strikes fear in the mind and shatters cohesion.<br><br>The Jemaah Islamiyah, for example, is aiming a dagger at the very heart of Singapore society, he added.<br><br>And even though a variety of precautions have been taken to make Singapore a hard target, no security system is 100 percent proof.<br><br>RAdm Teo said: "The ultimate test for us is not whether we can stop every possible attack, big or small. It is whether we have the resilience to absorb the shock of an attack should the terrorists succeed in spite of our every effort, and to fight back, recover and show that we will not be cowed."<br><br>And this message seems to have struck a chord among young Singaporeans.<br><strong><br>"I feel there's a need to defend Singapore at all cost," said Eugene Loh, Student, Meridian JC.<br><br>"Even if suddenly the government just dumps a gun on me and asks me to fight for Singapore, I'll do it!" said Sylvia Shen, Student, Pioneer JC.<br></strong><br>But as Rear-Admiral Teo reminded the students, wars are fought with weapons but they are won by the resolve of the people. - CNA<br><br>________________________________________________________<br><br>such enthusiasm! hope this is the prevalent view of our youngsters.<br></div>
