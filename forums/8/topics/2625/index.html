            <div class='col-md body'>hi, if any here are graphic designers or alumni or the above institutions I need some kind advice. my brother is thinking of doing Graphic Design or some other design related course at  Temasek Poly.  but if for some reason or other he doesn't qualify ( I understand its extremly competitive) would NAFA or La salle SIA be a good alternative ?  how do employers look at these institutions. beside having a good portfolio of course would they look favorably as compared to poly grads ? I understand NAFA has been upgraded to a tertiary level institution.  I guese that makes it comparable to poly.  pls advised.  Thanks<br><br>[This message has been edited by mateo (edited 29-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i suggest La-Salle...it is more or less "internationally-recognised"...but i guess the initial interview is a tough one...unless u can convince the panel (with portfolio or watsoever) that u are up to their "entry standard"...design course are never easy to enter...but once u get thru the interview (and probably a trial...if u are selected) you will be mostly on your own...but one thing to warn ya...the fees alone will scare you away(the design courses ESPECIALLY expensive..and i think there is no subsidy or anything...unless u can get scholarship or sponsorship)...<br>as for NAFA...i can say that it is more "economical"...but i am not sure if the diploma is recognised outside spore...courses wise..it is abt the same as La-Salle and Poly...but no advanced diploma for certain ones...<br>i poked around for some information 2 years ago(when i was trying to make a choice then)...and the above is wat i gathered...i am not sure if the info is still current...i suggest ur brother shd make a personal trip down to the different institutions to talk to them or get prospectus or pamphlets...<br>well...i eventually went JC...hiak~...bcos the course that i wanted (in La-Selle) is way too expensive for me this poor bloke to afford...<br>Good luck~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi... i'm graduated from Lasalle about 5 years ago... there's not much difference between Lasalle or Nafa... for me... Nafa are well known for their illustrations and drawing skills... as for Lasalle... they are known for their darn to design and dream... in either institutions... u will learn... in school, u will learn the basic of designs... how far u can go.. depends on oneself.. design is like a never ending path.. have to upgrade and keep in touch with the lastest in everything ranging from fashions to the lastest technology that effects out daily life... finally... it's not difference which institutions u choose.. if u have a tight budget then go for Nafa... if u want more freedom.. then Lasalle... but i do have some friends from Nafa who switch over to Lasalle ... reasons for being that all the lecturers in Nafa are chinese educated. anyway, the final choice is still up to u... cheers!<br><br>------------------<br>A unknown force!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just graduated from Lasalle -sia just a month ago.....<br><br>I would suggest going to Lasalle before they get absorbed by NUS...once NUS takes over..the courses will be very regimented and based on rote learning...trust that it is going to be like this...<br><br>Lasalle SIA offeres diploma and Degree in design that are both recognised locally and internationally...the other schools are not really recognised as international qualifications, although you probably can get away with passing it off as one.<br><br>NAFA is known for being able to produce people who can illustrate and present their drawings well.  I have seen their work and it looks inpressive.  but the problem is that it might be a bit traditional in terms of teaching method and course layout.<br><br>Lasalle sia is known for being the school of slacker...although the physical drawing ability of the students don't quite match those of nafa, Lasalle students are generally more well rounded and are taught to value ideas and consepts above all else, which I might add is what most design houses look for above ability.  Lasalle also makes sure that whatever course you major in, you have a very strong base that includes your introduction into fine arts and other medias.  in short you will learn painting, sculpture, drawing, computers(multimedia) and a few other things also depending on the scheduling that they set for the semester.  But you will get a very good base before you major in design or whatever else.<br><br>like I said earlier, lasalle will stress more on what your ideas are.  In the past, it was quite easy to get away with substandard work but have really good ideas, but now the standard is really high already.  They expect you to have a standard to keep and still have some ideas behind what you are talking about. Also, it is very well known that the verbal presentation ability of lasalle students are usually better than thiose of the other institutions....and lastly it is considered a private tertiary institution...if that matters to u.<br><br>The diploma course is pretty stressful for interior design(if ur brother is going to tak eit).<br><br>Here is a list of course difficulty from easiest to hardest.<br><br>1.fine arts<br>2.graphic design/multimedia<br>3.interior design<br><br>the degree course for design tho is damnz tough like hell...They teach you based on curriculum from Australia...beleieve that they care very much about where your ideas come from...how you got those ideas and using wjhat method you got those ideas from...very very stressfull....I almost quit because it was so tuff...and I'm a person who usually sees everything as being easy to a certain extent....I have never had to work so hard for anything in my life before this degree course...so a warning...it is not for everybody as ur english has to be very good to be able to even understand what is going on in the reading and instructions....harg!!!!....I can't even think about it without cringing...(cringe)...<br><br>all- in all any school will do, but I just know that lasalle sia is very well known outside of singapore as well as inside and I dare to say that the "paper" has more weight than the other schools....but you pay for that weight in hefty sums...<br><br>Graphics should cost you: diploma $3000+++ dollars per semester....<br><br>graphics degree (BA graphic design) $ 5000+++<br><br>interior diploma: $3000+++<br>interior degree(ba): $7000<br><br>Anyway the amounts are per semester, but the government is now supporting the school but the prices are the same for some reason...so it is recognised by the gov already.<br><br>and keep in mind that the amount here doesn't include materials which can amount to some additional $2000 per semester if you aren't careful...and depending on the course...<br><br>ok, enuff already...I hope it helped..</div>
