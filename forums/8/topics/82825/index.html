And boost about the relationship you had..<br><br>You see and hear all your friends stories about their gfs.. about the sexually relationship that had with their opposite sex.. and you wan to have one desperate in order to be impared with them... and you jus couldn't resist the influence they gave you..<br><br>There she was, she plain &amp; natural.. you jus grab anyone who you can think of..<br><br>Poor girl.. you treated as if she's your maid.. and not someone who you care n feel for.. is there love is this relationship?? is there any commitment you made to her?? is this the kind of relationship you wan to be in??<br><br>Why get a gf jus because you wanna show off to people that what they can do.. you can do it too.. Don't you know that she is the one who suffer the pain that you given her physically &amp; emotionally...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You are not satisfied with everything she does jus because she dun have the looks and figure.. you jealous of ppl having pretty, good-looking gfs.. And why not yours..<br><br>No matter how hard you try to tell yourself she's perfect she's pretty.. the fact still wont change.. Cos in the 1st place.. there no chemistry taken.. no love.. no feelings.. nothing! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Ask yourself.. do you love her?? or is she jus a companion to you??<br>Do you really treated her as a gf..??? or wan her back as  a decent gf and not something else??<br><br>You said you know what you want.. issit getting her back is what you want?? or do you wan to ssee her living happily with someone who can really shower her love, care &amp; concern.. ?? or to be with you where there's no feelings but jus for sexual purpose?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>after 3 years.. there, you understand her.. No doubt if you ask her to come back to your side she will.. cos. she knows she loves you.. but in return.. do you?? if not.. let her go.. and find her own happiness... loving someone doesn't mean to be with him/her...<br><br>When you see someone you love.. you care.. find their true love n happiness.. you feel good.. at least.. at this point of time.. you've done a good deed..<br><br>No mater how guilty you feel.. or how much she given you.. once she's happy with someone.. all these pay off.....<br><br>Man, think about it.. will you be able to give her happiness?? You know that you are heartless towards.. then stop NOW!! don't hurt her any further.. It won't do you both good..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>why treat ppl who is plump &amp; plain so badly... they could also do what other pretty girls can do.. jus accept the way she is.. if you can.. all these problems wont hinder you at all..<br><br>Cheers!<br></div>

From what I can understand, seems like you don't really want to be back with her anymore. But you felt that you owe her something and felt guilty about it. So you need us to encourage you to move on and leave her completely without feeling guilty...right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Ask yourself this question, why did you choose to ask her to be your gf in the first place or why did you agree to be her bf in the first place? Because you are desperate for a gf and she just happened to be very avaliable for you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Since you chose to ask her to be your gf and she also don't mind to tolerate with your kinky sexual request. I felt that you should be responsible towards her. And I can tell you no other gf in this world will 'obey' you like she did. Sure...you can tell me that you don't love her anymore and she probably reached the limits of her tolerance gauge. And I can tell you there is no love in this world, love like those tian mi mi kind of love will last forever. That kind of love have a lifespan...and it is usually during the first few months of your relationship. After that, love comes with commitments or I would like to rephrase it as responsibilites. As her bf, you are responsible for your gf...whether you like it or not. Even if you find yourself another girl as your gf, you will still come back to this stage once the tian mi mi period is over.<br><br>Are you prepared to accept this kind of responsibilities? If not, then I believe you will never be able to find real happiness in whatever relationship that you are in. This is the loophole that I am giving you, use this as an excuse to get out of the relationship with her if you want. But be warned, you might not find somebody who is able to love you as much as her in the future and this may be my trap for guys like you. Tempting?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Then choose your path. Good Luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
