            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, the class system is alive and well. However, unlike pre-Industrial Revolution days where the deciding factors were birthright, money and education, the IR has changed capital distribution and created the nouveau riche, just like in contemporary Singapore. Wealth has cease to play such an importance in the accumulation of cultural capital as it previously did. As such the IR and democracy have removed birthright and wealth as factors.<br><br>Hence, education is one of the few class distinguishers left.<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, i believe the classes are prevalent in SIngapore.<br><br>Especially during the Primary school and Secondary school period, it is very detrimental for young kids to be "labelled". It simply prevent them from attempting anything that they may excel fearing they are just proving whom they are labelled as.<br><br>Look at the Normal stream student who could hack into computers and got him(her?)self into trouble.<br><br>Moreover, streaming them so early is detering them from what they could otherwise excel later on in their lives.<br><br>Finally it creates boundaries. Those who themselves are "labelled" would use their class as a status thus leading to stereotyping. Eg Special stream = academically inclined, Normal stream = academically challenged. COndo = $$, 2-room = no $$.<br><br>Though I sound confusing, re-read and somehow you will understand. Can't blame me, to lazy to edit or use a more concise approach.

            <div class='col-md body'>i think the education system here is quite silly to purposely craete a class structure.<br>1. Children are children even up to sec 2 alot of kids are still try not to learn what is being taught in school but just learning how to physcially remember and understand ideas and process thoughts in their brains<br>So how is it fair for example if u have a kid who has a freiking high iq but yet doesnt know how to express his ideas or how to put his thoughts onto paper? is it fair for such a student to be "streamed" into the adequate stream where by systematically self esteem is taken away from there innocent minds and they have to face not only their own physical barriers to learning but now also have to face additional emotional distress in the form of insecurities about learning bcos "everyone else thinks they are dumb cos they are in normal or em3 or whatever.<br>2. many children cant come to grips with learning how to learn and process the vast amounts of unnecessary data which they have to read and supposedly understand in school.<br>THink about it in schol there are the ppl who go out and study all day long memorising every word in teh text and do every possible assesment book that is out there, nad tehy get good marks<br>then there are those who study very little but yet are able to spot what is important and study that very well and also get good marks.<br>Now think how many ppl in primary and early secondary school have the mental capacity and will to freiking memorise the text book word for word. NOw think how many ppl have the perception to realise what is important and should be learnt in primary and early secondary school.<br><br>IN my opinion schooling should be made systematic and equal for everyone until at least sec 3 or 4 , when everyone has had at least a fair chance to find out what their minds are capable of.<br>It is really unfair to create a class among the young, a class which is made up by older supposedly more knowledgable, a class that can literally decide how u path in life shall be.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>bengboy,<br><br>Â“In Hong Kong &amp; US, the elite are the wealthy and in Singapore this may boil down to those who have Colonial ties.Â”<br><br>The elite all over the world are wealthy. WhatÂ’s your point? And what do you mean by Colonial ties? What qualifies as a Colonial tie in contemporary Singapore and give an example of one who possesses it.<br><br>Â“It has nothing to do with education or being educated. This is only the by product of it.Â”<br><br>That may have been the case in pre-Industrial Revolution England but it doesnÂ’t apply to Singapore today. During the pre-IR period, the group with access to ruling ideology was the landed gentry (or landowners, or aristocrats). Their lands and titles were given to them by the monarch, as such Â‘old moneyÂ’ symbolised family legacy and notion of birthright. Being born into these families meant you got the best education (Eton, Oxford etc.) (However, the IR distributed capital and made the capitalist as rich, if not richer than aristocrats.)<br><br>WeÂ’ve never had notions of landed gentry in Singapore. As such the class hierarchy is not a matter of birth or pre-existing wealth, rather it is a Â‘meritocraticÂ’ hierarchy which allows people from all backgrounds to rise in society. For example, one may be a son of a rubbish-collector but the opportunities are still there for upward mobility which was not the case in pre-IR England, i.e. if one's father was a village chimney-sweeper, one can forget about becoming a laywer or doctor because of the inaccessibility to education. With education available to all in Singapore, it is not 'birth', nor race nor pre-existing wealth that matters. Hence the currency for a Â‘meritocraticÂ’ hierarchy in Singapore is education Â– and how much of it.<br><br>cheers<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 13 February 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 13 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>education as a form of stratification? but then again the idea of meritocracy seems fine on paper but does it really exist in real life? there might be an equality of opportunities but not an equality of resources..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jul,<br><br>Even meritocracy is a means for class structure. Its not fine, even on paper. Secondly, I donÂ’t understand what you meant by resource not being available to all in SÂ’pore. I was talking about basic education. One may be poor but primary/secondary education is cheap and their concomitant exams are open to all to sit for. ItÂ’s a matter of whether you do well in them or not. Those who do well go on to universities and better jobs. Those who shine get scholarships Â– not based on whose Daddy is who but on Â‘meritÂ’. As such education becomes a currency to trade with for higher positions in life.<br><br>cheers<br><br>ps: are you Julianna who did journalism in Australia?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess what I meant by meritocracy is fine on paper is that it lulls people into a sense of false security- thinking that as long as they work hard, they'll rise up to where they want to be. What I meant by resources not available for all is that one may have equal opportunities to attain education but the outcome of this education is affected by resources that are not equally distributed. For example, I may have the same education but because I do not have the means to use the internet to source for more information, do not have the monetary means to buy more books, do not have the time to spend on my studies, do not have the money to spend on a tutor who can better my grades, I'll lose out to you on some extent right? And juz because of that, not because of the difference in our intellects, there's a likelihood that I'll lose to you in the long run.<br><br>Personally schools in Singapore are not juz merely institutions for education. It encompasses prestige, status and these inevitably affects how people view you and your future. Just as it was mentioned in Prodigal's thread on overseas wife, I believe Bishamon mentioned that the mere fact of being educated overseas render one an edge over others. It's the same with education here. Certain schools might not guarantee a bright future necessarily but it helps to give a nudge when it is needed.<br><br>PS: Nope. Not Julianna from Aust.

            <div class='col-md body'>Jul,<br><br>I understand that lack of financial resources may be a hinderance but you have to admit this is not a problem in S'pore. The middle-class strata is large, and the lower class (if there is one in S'pore) can still afford to send their children to schools. As for educational facilities, all schools, even neighbourhood ones, are incorporating computers to a 2 pupils to 1 computer ratio. The school libraries (pri/sec) are vastly improved. All you need to do well in exams are stocked on the shelves. I know this for a fact as my parents are teachers.<br><br>However, I agree with you that some schools carry prestige in terms of cultural capital. They may have better facilities than the ordinary school BUT that does NOT prevent bright pupils from neighbourhood schools to get into good JCs or universities. Besides, scholarships are open to all.<br><br>This is all supposedly meritocracy. A student from a poor background can still acquire education, and if he/she does well, can turn education into a currency for social mobility. This of course comes back to the existence of class structures.<br><br>cheers<br><br>ps. ok, nevermind, you just sounded like an old 'friend' of mine. Its a good thing you're not her cause this particular Jul wants to scratch my eyes out. *laugh*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terence:<br><br>I don't really think that the lack of financial resources in Singapore is not a problem. I choose to see it as something that has not being highlighted in society and thus swept under the carpet. People always think that everyone in Singapore is financially stable. I disagree. Although be forewarned that if you ask for official statistics, there's none. Haven't really done any research on that. Everything that has been fed to the society is one based on official views and statistics. One cannot deny the biasness and vested interests that are within. If I ask the people around me to define what class they belong to, I would think that the majority would see themselves as middle-class. But how many of these self-proclaimed middle-class families are truely that? Does having a graduate in the family immediately consitutes a rising in social mobility?<br><br>It's easy to see that everyone has the ability to attend education regardless of their financial situations but perhaps there's more underneath. There was this newspaper report a couple of years back regarding children that did not have the chance to finish their primary education. What equality of chances are these people going to have? True, the ratio of computers to students seems to be improving but then would the "impoverished" students even have the chance and time to use all these? Do they have the skills to better their studies?<br><br>Scholarships? It's a vicious cycle to me. It depends on how well you do which in turn depends on how much time and energy you can afford to put in it. Of course there's the prestige of the schools and what have you. Don't even get me started on relations that can gravitate you in the appropriate direction. People always claims that Singapore is a meritocratic system. How true is it? Then why are there quotas for certain faculties in local universities? Then why are there still discrimination shown towards females regardless of how intelligent or academically "well-endowed"?<br><br>Sheesh, now I sound like some bitter, cynical bimbo who can't appreciate what the government has done for you.. etc etc.. and the list of crimes goes on..<br><br>ps: wonder WHY would she wanna do something like that??? *laughs*<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jul,<br><br>You may be right, but I've never met anyone who cannot afford even primary school education. Perhaps there is an under-class in modern S'pore who cannot make ends meet. Can you draw me a profile of such a class?<br><br>If people chose to drop out after primary or secondary school for whatever the reason, so be it. The fact is, there ARE opportunities for social mobility. And yes, being a graduate, not just from any old university, but from a good prestigous one will enhance that person's chances of a better job, higher wages etc. It may not directly affect his family but it certainly profoundly impacts his lifestyle.<br><br>of course there are quotas for faculties and scholarships. That in no way compromises meritocracy. The best will survive and the weak will fade away, the best will get what they want and the weak will have to settle for leftovers. No one in Spore is deluded about this. I certainly have no problems with it. Some one suggested putting weaker students in the same class with better students - that was the most stupid suggestion I ever heard. Meritocracy is about survival of the fittest and not about welfare for all.<br><br>cheers<br><br>ps. Why? I don't know, something about breaking hearts, couldn't hear her very well, she was screaming down the phone at that time.<br></div>
