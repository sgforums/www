            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forum.<br><br>$150,000 spent on Khoo's record pursuit can help poor old folk<br><br>I AGREE with Mr Robert Yeo Sai Boo ('Why spend $150,000 on Khoo's trivial pursuit?'; ST, Dec 13). Why should good money be spent just so that someone can submerge himself underwater for 212 hours and 30 minutes?<br><br>The same day I read the article, 'Elderly sisters rescued from army of bedbugs'.<br>It was heartwarming to read about how the hospital staff of Changi General Hospital and their personal friends and family members sprang into action to help debug and clean the sisters' flat.<br><br>After it was sanitised, one volunteer, Mr Lai Peh Team, re-equipped it with second-hand beds, mattresses and chairs.<br><br>I could not help but make a mental estimate of the number of brand new mattresses that could be bought with $150,000, and the number of hours of peaceful sleep and rest many poor old folk could enjoy.<br><br>What doubly saddens me is that Mr Khoo Swee Chiow's sponsor is the Northeast Community Development Council.

Why not channel such funds to them? J.K. Rowling lived on state benefits before she became richer than Queen Elizabeth. If she had not received a grant from the Scottish Arts Council, she might not have written the Harry Potter series.<br><br>The $150,000 could help several local artists.

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forum.<br><br>How adventurer Khoo sees his many feats<br><br>IN RESPONSE to Mr Robert Yeo's questions in the letter, 'Why spend $150,000 on Khoo's trivial pursuit?' (ST, Dec 13), let me explain why I believe in North East Community Development Council (CDC)'s Dare to Dream Fund.<br>I do not depend on charity and public funds for a living. My income is derived from giving motivational talks (to corporations and schools), book royalty, sponsorship and product endorsements.<br><br>Sponsorship is not a donation. I have obligations to sponsors in return for their investments. In receiving sponsorship, the same business principles apply - marketing and sales, cash flow, crisis management and customer satisfaction. For major expeditions, there are legal contracts involved.<br><br>North East CDC has been very supportive of my endeavours, partly because I live in the North East district. By doing what I do best, I hope to inspire residents of the district to step out of their comfort zones, try something they have never dared to do, learn to take some setbacks and, in the process, become stronger people.<br><br>Standing on the summit of Mt Everest and reaching the South and North poles were some of the proudest moments of my life. I was proud to be a Singaporean. The reward was extremely enriching and spiritual.<br><br>Did I do it for self-glorification? The answer is yes if it means trying to prove to myself and pushing my own physical and mental limits.<br><br>But if it is thought that I was out to make a name for myself and to be famous, it would be the secondary outcome. There are many easier ways to be famous than risking my life. There is no gold medal or cash reward waiting at the summit or the South Pole.<br><br>When I die, I want my son to be inspired by me. I want him to know that his dad is a person of courage who dared to stand up for what he believed in, and one who did not give up easily. I also believe that this is my way to contribute to the Singapore I love.<br><br>Khoo Swee Chiow<br></div>

It's their national past time. After all, people are entitled to their opinion really.<br><br>It just bothers me that some people who probably have no track record at physically-demanding activities are taking pot shots at a man who is, apart from making a living, trying to pursue his dreams. And if Singapore is recognized as a result, so much that better.<br><br>Take this for example:<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Bank officer Kelvin Lim, 29, said it seemed unfair for Mr Khoo to receive repeat funding and that it is better for the council to look for other people to sponsor.<br><br>Teacher Lena Soh, 28 agreed: 'When resources are limited, it's a zero sum game. If Mr Khoo gets the funding again, what happens to the next person who applies? Would this mean that the next person doesn't get the money?'<br><br>'If you dare to dream the first time, you should get the funding, but for your second and third dreams, perhaps you should fund those yourself.' </span><br><br>Northwest CDC has already clarified their position. I think the matter is closed. Besides, he does not solely rely on this funding for financing his challenges. It was just one avenue he explored. The crux of the complaints is that the funding amounted to 150,000 SGD, a huge sum of money and a huge responsibility at that.<br><br>Maybe people are just worried that due to his failure to complete the channel swim, is it wise to invest good money on him again?</div>
