              <p>Im sure we all have had dreams that we wish we want some explainations to. Lets share them and maybe we can see if the rest can help interpret for us or maybe some may have had the same kind of dreams like you.</p>
              <p>I dream alot about me flying. Some says its about me wanting to break free. But i keep on flying in this familiar skyzone and im always rescuing the world.</p>
              <p>One said i could have been a bird in my last birth.</p>
              <p>I cant testify against that. but i like my flying dreams very much.</p>

Thats probably when you're closest to the spiritual dimension. For me it happened when i was extremely tired. I didnt even realise i had fallen asleep, everything seemed real but i could hear voices and see images. And i couldnt move or talk.</p></div>

              <p><br>Im not really sure what it means though. There was once, my mum had to wake me up as i was playing and laughing while i was alseeep. The thing is, i knew i was waving my hand in the air and laughing but i couldnt get up and didnt want to get up as well.</p>
              <p>and when my mum woke me up, my heart was racing furioiusly.</p>
              <p>But somehow, i sleep to dream sometimes, cause i enjoy my dreams at times. They bring you on an adventure which i dont get in reality.</p>
              <p>Its like an escape land.</p>
