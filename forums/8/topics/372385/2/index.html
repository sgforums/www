              <p>Seriously whats the big fuss about this issue?</p>
              <p>As the nation's 3rd ranked JC, having a 6 year IP programme is the logical next step if they were to improve the quality of their education ( as seen by the relative success in HCJC and RJC )</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> <em>'VJC has firmly established itself as a premier educational
                                          institution in the eastern part of Singapore. Therefore, it has a
                                          duty to serve the schools and students in the area.'</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, it does have a duty to serve the schools and students, but why is it only limited to "the area" only? Surely there is an equal duty to serve other students too, who would be enrolling in the new IP programme.</p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>'Secondary 2 students from other schools will no longer be able to
                                          enrol in the IP. If it goes ahead with the sixyear IP, VJC will end
                                          up competing with the other secondary schools in the area. This
                                          will have a detrimental effect on every school.'</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why does it matter whether secondary 2 students get to enrol or not? It is a substitution effect, not a reduction as if students REALLY wanted to get into vjc, they can do so after primary school. While some may claim that this puts even more unneccessary stress into young 12 year olds who want to make it into VIP, isn't this already happening? A significant number of VS students entered VS with VJC in mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>'VJC's proposal comes despite resistance from the Old Victorians
                                          Association (OVA) and other old boys who fear that the VIP
                                          extension will create rivalry between the two schools and create a
                                          split within the Victorian family.</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While it is true that VS would probably suffer in terms of reduction of the general quality of applicants, does this justify the opposition to the 6 year VIP? Old victorians claim that VJC should have VS student's interests at heart.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>This latest move from VJC comes two years after failed talks
                                          with VS to admit girls.'</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The irony of the issue is, VJC DID try. There had been repeated attempts to re-integrate VS / VJC ( which requires VS to admit girls since its nonsencial to have only 1 boys school as a feeder school ) which has been shot down by Victorians.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Imagine a son tell his mum to f*** off........all will be 100%
                                          against it mah...so as to VJC</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So true.. yet if the Mother refused to reconcile with the son, can we blame the son for seeking a better life? From what i see the blame ultimately falls on the Victorians who overwhelmingly opposed VS going co-ed few years back. It is they who have doomed their juniors ( assuming the VIP goes through )</p>

              <p>Dear Sir</p>
              <p><strong>RE: VJC’s PROPOSAL/SUBMISSION TO MOE TO SET UP ITS OWN INTEGRATED PROGRAMME (IP)</strong></p>
              <p>On behalf of the OVA and the Victorian Alumni, I am writing to you in respect of the above captioned matter.</p>
              <p>As you are aware, VJC has decided to proceed with its own IP despite almost unanimous objections from the alumni and a counter offer by the OVA to merge the two schools into an IP institution, one that will maintain the 133-year-old heritage of VS.</p>
              <p>At earlier meetings in March/October 2008, the roadmap for these 2 institutions and the various options available were discussed with Yat Chung and various opinion leaders in the presence of both principals. During that meeting, all parties had expressed their opinions and more importantly came to the agreement that the OVA will be consulted if any major decisions are to be made in respect of VS and/or VJC especially regarding the implementation of any IP.</p>
              <p>Without any consultation being made, VJC made the above proposal/submission to MOE. It is understood that the VAC/VEC had backed and supported such a move.</p>
              <p>VJC’s endeavour has caused much grief and disagreement among Victorians. One only needs to go into any popular cyber platform to gain a flavour and the extent of the views expressed by fellow Victorians on this issue. There is also an online petition being circulated. Whilst it is heartening to see Victorians rallying on this issue, it is also equally painful for matters to come to this state. If the VAC/VEC had consulted the OVA and the alumni on this issue, I believe that matters may not have developed in this manner.</p>
              <p>I have now received queries regarding the full particulars of the process which the VAC/VEC had adopted to come to this decision. Was there a vote taken on this issue and if so, please provide full details of the voting process, the parties who voted and the outcome.</p>
              <p>I need the above information so that these can be shared with fellow Victorians who are desirous and keen to be fully appraised of matters that had transpired.</p>
              <p>Given the urgency and gravity of this matter, I trust that the VAC/VEC will work with us at the OVA expediently. As such, I appreciate a written reply from you as soon possible.</p>
