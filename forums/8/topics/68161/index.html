            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Parable Number 1 </span><br>A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. A small rabbit saw the crow, and asked him, "Can I also sit like you and do nothing all day<br>long?<br>The crow answered: "Sure, why not."<br>So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.<br>All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it.<br>Management Lesson: To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Parable Number 2 </span><br>A turkey was chatting with a bull.<br>"I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree," sighed the<br>turkey "but I haven't got the energy".<br>" Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?" replied the bull.<br>"They're packed with nutrients."<br>The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him enough strength to each the first branch of the tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch.<br>Finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree.<br>Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree.<br>Management Lesson: Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keepyou there.<br><br><span style="color: brown;">Parable Number 3 </span><br>A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold; the bird<br>froze and fell to the ground in a large field. While it was lying there,<br>a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, it began to realize how warm it was. The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate.<br>Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him!<br>Management Lesson:<br>1) Not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy.<br>2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend.<br>3) And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut!<br><br><span style="color: violet;">Parable Number 4</span><br>The boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they went along, some people remarked "It is a shame the old man is walking and the boy is riding." The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, so they changed positions. Later, they passed some people that remarked, "What a shame, he makes that little boy walk." They decided they both would walk!<br>Soon they passed some more people who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a decent donkey to ride. So the both of them rode the donkey!<br>Now they passed some people that shamed them saying "How awful to put such a load on a poor donkey."<br>The boy and man said they were probably right so they decided to carry the donkey. As they crossed a bridge, they lost their grip on the animal who fell into the river and drowned.<br>Management Lesson: If you try to please everyone, you will eventually lose your ass.<br><span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>
