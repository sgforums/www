She logged on under her screen name<br>&gt; ByAngel213. She checked her Buddy List and saw GoTo123 was on.<br>&gt; She sent him an instant message:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ByAngel213:<br>&gt; Hi. I'm glad you are on! I thought someone was following me home<br>&gt; today. It was really weird!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; GoTo123:<br>&gt; LOL You watch too much TV. Why would someone be following you?<br>&gt; Don't you live in a safe neighborhood?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ByAngel213:<br>&gt; Of course I do. LOL I guess it was my imagination cuz' I didn't<br>&gt; see anybody when I looked out.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; GoTo123:<br>&gt; Unless you gave your name out on-line. You haven't done that<br>&gt; have you?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ByAngel213:<br>&gt; Of course not. I'm not stupid you know.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; GoTo123:<br>&gt; Did you have a softball game after school today?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ByAngel213:<br>&gt; Yes and we won!!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; GoTo123:<br>&gt; That's great! Who did you play?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ByAngel213:<br>&gt; We played the Hornets. LOL. Their uniforms are so gross! They<br>&gt; look like bees. LOL<br>&gt;<br>&gt; GoTo123:<br>&gt; What is your team called?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ByAngel213:<br>&gt; We are the Canton<br>&gt; Cats. We have tiger paws on our uniforms. They are really cool.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; GoTo123:<br>&gt; Did you pitch?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ByAngel213:<br>&gt; No I play second base. I got to go. My homework has to be done<br>&gt; before my parents get home. I don't want them mad at me. Bye!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; GoTo123:<br>&gt; Catch you later. Bye<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Meanwhile......GoTo123 went to the member menu and began to<br>&gt; search for her profile. When it came up, he highlighted it and<br>&gt; printed it out. He took out a pen and began to write down what<br>&gt; he knew about Angel so far.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Her name: Shannon<br>&gt; Birthday: Jan. 3, 1985<br>&gt; Age: 13<br>&gt; State where she lived: North Carolina<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Hobbies: softball, chorus, skating and going to the mall.<br>&gt; Besides this information, he knew she lived in Canton because<br>&gt; she had just told him.  He knew she stayed by herself until<br>&gt; 6:30 p.m. every afternoon until her parents came home from work.<br>&gt; He knew she played softball on Thursday afternoons on the school<br>&gt; team, and the team was named the Canton Cats. Her favorite<br>&gt; number 7 was printed on her jersey. He knew she was in the<br>&gt; eighth grade at the Canton Junior High School . She had told him<br>&gt; all this in the conversations they had on- line. He had enough<br>&gt; information to find her now.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Shannon didn't tell her parents about the incident on the way<br>&gt; home from the ballpark that day. She didn't want them to make a<br>&gt; scene and stop her from walking home from the softball games.<br>&gt; Parents were always overreacting and hers were the worst. It<br>&gt; made her wish she was not an only child. Maybe if she had<br>&gt; brothers and sisters, her parents wouldn't be so overprotective.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; By Thursday, Shannon had forgotten about the footsteps following her.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Her game was in full swing when suddenly she felt someone<br>&gt; staring at her. It was then that the memory came back. She<br>&gt; glanced up from her second base position to see a man watching<br>&gt; her closely.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He was leaning against the fence behind first base and he smiled<br>&gt; when she looked at him. He didn't look scary and she quickly<br>&gt; dismissed the sudden fear she had felt.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; After the game, he sat on a bleacher while she talked to the<br>&gt; coach. She noticed his smile once again as she walked past him.<br>&gt; He nodded and she smiled back. He noticed her name on the back<br>&gt; of her shirt. He knew he had found her.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Quietly, he walked a safe distance behind her. It was only a few<br>&gt; blocks to Shannon 's home, and once he saw where she lived he<br>&gt; quickly returned to the park to get his car.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Now he had to wait. He decided to get a bite to eat until the<br>&gt; time came to go to Shannon 's house. He drove to a fast food<br>&gt; restaurant and sat there until time to make his move.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Shannon was in her room later that evening when she heard voices<br>&gt; in the living room.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 'Shannon, come here,' her father called. He sounded upset and<br>&gt; she couldn't imagine why. She went into the room to see the man<br>&gt; from the ballpark sitting on the sofa.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 'Sit down,' her father began, 'this man has just told us a most<br>&gt; interesting story about you.'<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Shannon sat back. How could he tell her parents anything? She<br>&gt; had never seen him before today!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 'Do you know who I am, Shannon ?' the man asked.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 'No,' Shannon answered.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 'I am a police officer and your online friend, GoTo123.'<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Shannon was stunned. 'That's impossible! GoTo is a kid my age!<br>&gt; He's 14. And he lives in Michigan !'<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The man smiled. 'I know I told you all that, but it wasn't true.<br>&gt; You see, Shannon , there are people on-line who pretend to be<br>&gt; kids; I was one of them. But while others do it to injure kids<br>&gt; and hurt them, I belong to a group of parents who do it to<br>&gt; protect kids from predators. I came here to find you to teach<br>&gt; you how dangerous it is to talk to people on-line. You told me<br>&gt; enough about yourself to make it easy for me to<br>&gt; find you. You named the school you went to, the name of your<br>&gt; ball team and the position you played. The number and name on<br>&gt; your jersey just made finding you a breeze.'<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Shannon was stunned. 'You mean you don't live in Michigan ?'<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He laughed. 'No, I live in Raleigh . It made you feel safe to<br>&gt; think I was so far away, didn't<br>&gt; it?'<br>&gt;<br>&gt; She nodded.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 'I had a friend whose daughter was like you. Only she wasn't as<br>&gt; lucky. The guy found her and murdered her while she was home<br>&gt; alone. Kids are taught not to tell anyone when they are alone,<br>&gt; yet they do it all the time on-line. The wrong people trick you<br>&gt; into giving out information a little here and there on-line.<br>&gt; Before you know it, you have told them enough for them to find<br>&gt; you without even realizing you have done it. I hope you've<br>&gt; learned a lesson from this and won't do it again. Tell others<br>&gt; about this so they will be safe too?'<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 'It's a promise!'<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That night Shannon and her Dad and Mom all knelt down together<br>&gt; and thanked God for protecting Shannon from what could have been<br>&gt; a tragic situation.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; *****NOW*****<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Please send this to as many people as you can to teach them not<br>&gt; to give any information about themselves. This world we live in<br>&gt; today is too dangerous to even give out your age, let alone<br>&gt; anything else.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; EVEN FORWARD THIS TO PEOPLE WITHOUT KIDS SO THEY CAN SEND IT TO<br>&gt; FRIENDS THAT DO HAVE CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN.<br><br>see? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
