            <div class='col-md body'>Feb 12, 2005<br><br>Show some respect to elderly folk still at work.<br><br>LAST Friday, at around 1pm, I witnessed a disturbing incident while having lunch at the hawker centre located between Tanglin Halt Road and Commonwealth Avenue.<br><br>I had just finished my meal and was sipping my drink when a woman in her late 60s came over to my table to clear the plates. While she was doing so, a young woman, who later claimed to be her supervisor, came over and started ranting and screaming at her.<br><br>She accused the elderly woman of being slow, leaving many tables uncleared, and insinuated that she was lazing around, when in fact she was already trying her best to clear up the mess left behind by the lunchtime crowd.<br><br>This went on for quite some time and caused many people to stare in our direction. Out of pity for the elderly woman, I smiled at her and told her in Hokkien that it was okay and that she should just carry on with her work and forget about the incident.<br><br>The young woman, upon hearing my conversation with the cleaner, immediately directed her barrage of insults at me, saying I should mind my own business.<br><br>She kept up her incessant ranting for another five minutes, by which time I could no longer take her insults and left the place, but not before giving the elderly woman an encouraging smile and nod.<br><br>In a fast greying population, many elderly people have no choice but to work well past their retirement age, in a bid to reduce the burden on the younger generation, and as a means of livelihood.<br><br>Some of them have spent their lives contributing to Singapore after its independence, building up the infrastructure and nurturing society without themselves marrying and having a family of their own.<br><br>When we come across such unsung heroes, the least we could do is to show some respect.<br><br>And, as in the case of the elderly cleaner, be a little understanding about their declining physical abilities.<br><br>It is disheartening enough to be doing such demanding jobs when they should be enjoying the fruits of their labour in their golden years, without having to face such baseless insults from young people.<br><br></div>
