            <div class='col-md body'>Reason for the positive audience response<br><br>A lot of the audience are identifying with the film, the characters and the incidents. I'm getting so many calls from people from all walks of life, telling me that such incidents have happened in their lives too. That they've also had  in their lives, crushes and infatuations, platonic friendships and that they had ultimately compromised with reality. Audience identification is the strength of this film.<br><br>http://www.chennaionline.com/interviews/03cheran.asp</div>
