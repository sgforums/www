            <div class='col-md body'>hey, I  remember ashwarya in 94. Jus 21, she won the crown. she all of sudden become India's favourite hot diva.<br>If she did not also, I believe she will still come up top afterall. in bollywood there is no other girls to match her level of beauty. Here are some facts for you:<br><br>1) Her first film - "Iruvar" was in Tamil in 96. I watched the show and keep thinking to myself " a great beauty she is". the film even though  a huge flop, despite a big director and big musician<br>did not hinder her impending success for years to come.<br><br>2) Her second Tamil movie "Jeans" in 98 was a major hit.<br><br>3) Her third Tamil film was on a Jane austen book in 2000 with very nice music.<br><br>4) She's the only actress in India to have survived 10 years in the industry and cross decade (90s-2000s)<br><br>Having said all that. Why need'ed to wait 5 mins to post!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>forgot to add ;<br><br>I do not think many people knew of this . Ash made her first film appearance in a  south indian movie  in 1991 as a teen in  minor role .<br>it turned out  to be forgettable  trash. No body ever knew that movie existed.<br>it was like that jus unknown. a cult fact known in ashwarya fan  circles.<br><br>Ash took to modelling and after winning  Miss World appeared in Indian films concentrating her career on mostly hindi than tamil lang films.Her entry into films was not planned but happened naturally<br><br>So in fact her career is from:<br>1991 - present. And that is 15 years. Current age is 33<br><br>But awards and fame aren't everything in the lucrative indian films market. An unpublished market research by an Indian company in 2000 on the films market showed that<br><strong>" Frequent on-screen presence is needed for an artiste's success, ironically something Rai does not need to do often due to her Miss World status   putting her in the League of Elite Women who can command her star presence anytime she wants to. "</strong> .<br><br>If anyone there who keenly observed the trends from previous decade you are to notice that:-,<br><br>The only other  who has unofficial 2nd place is the actress <span class="large"><strong>Simran</strong></span> (Below)<br><br><img src="http://www.simranonline.com/gallery/gal/Simran/simran28.bmp"><br><br>Simran is a popular mid-90s  attractive lass with a lot  more films &amp; immense mainstream appeal than ashwarya rai.    Simran had an enviable start, which could be the dream of any aspiring starlet and by the late 90s ,her  name became familiar all over South India had become a star in her own right. She practically appeared on every wrapper of all the  magazines, mainly due to the stunningly revealing costumes she wore for the photo sessions.In every aspect Simran proved to be lucky and she had also done full justice to the roles given to her. Her histrionics were fully exploited<br><br>Like Rai, Simran is one kitten who  gets better in her youth and looks as she ages. And due to her frequent on screen presence and market saturation<br>She is another successful cross over from the 1990s with an acting career of 10 years. As of  2005 due to her marriage,  Simran  realises that her popularity is not a permanent thing and is ready for her exit from films and soon to be  leaving her memoric stamp on the industry. Bye Bye Simran. Bye Bye Lady !<br>If some will not know who Simran is. more  pics I provide:<br><img src="http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/5526/2simran307el.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The hypocrisy of the indian films industry never faills to amaze me. It had never been kind to females.Practically a male dominated field and gender biased. It had basically sidelined females to sex objects limiting their progress in the acting field<br>Many of the actresses are degree graduates and even so more highly educated than their male counterparts. There are no Whoopi Goldbergs or Meryl streep credited for their acting talents. In the 80s and before, the industry practiced nepotism. Chances were only given to those who had relatives or  links to the film industry. The rsulting consequence was the stagnant  braindead of talent. It finally  opened its impregnable doors in the early 90s to fresh talent<br><br>The reason why it holds ashwarya rai on a pedestal is because she is a national icon.</div>
