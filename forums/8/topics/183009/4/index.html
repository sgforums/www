He even has his own snack in Japan bearing his name<br><br>Briefly: Tamil Cinema<br>Tamil Guardian<br>Dec 7 2005<br>Japanese Fans<br><br>Ever since the film "Muthu" was released in Japan, Rajinikanth (right) has become a huge star there, and now with the film "Chandramukhi"also having been released there, Rajini’s popularity has increased even further. "Chandramukhi"; was released in Japan and received a massive welcome. The film which was screened at the Ropongi Hills cinema, which seats 250 people, was fully packed, with only 8 Indian viewers " the remaining seats were taken up by the Japanese fans. The fans who came bearing Rajini t-shirts were thrilled by the fight and song sequences in the movie. On seeing the overwhelming response, the distributor of the film in Japan has promised the fans to release Rajini' next film " on the same day as it is being released in Chennai.<br><br><img src="http://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Photo/competitions/UCL/345511_MEDIUMSQUARE.jpg"><img src="http://www.turksportal.net/tsi/v2/image/Haber/adrian_mutu.jpg"><img src="http://www.smh.com.au/ffximage/2004/10/18/adrianmutu_ent-lead__200x168.jpg"><br><br>We all know that Rajini’s Muthu was released as "Dancing Maharaja" in Japan and the movie was a great success. Marketers have tried to cash in on the Rajini craze and have introduced an Indian namkeen (snack) product, which has Rajini and Meena on the cover. The product is called Garam Masala.<br><br>Says a Japanese Blogger!.<br><img src="http://www.juventus.com/Allegati/f_Adrian%20Mutu1651440d866a0e2-6b9a-4699-b2db-97f089e8f08.jpg"><img src="http://www.juventus.com/Allegati/f_Mutu165350ed6ccbd3-fa0e-49a6-9326-3bca8b6c0ee.jpg"><br>Listen to what this man says about "Muthu"..<br><br>They sing songs and dance,when they are happy.They sing songs and dance,when they are sad. And they sing songs and dance,even if they have no reasons. In fact,they are singing and dancing in the better part of the movie. Also,you mustn't miss the scene of chasing by the horse and cart.This movie was a big hit in India,and also in Japan. Actually I love it.<br><br>Recently I found a Muthu's photo at a convenience store.It was on a package of snacks.This is a snack named "Garam masala" that is on the confectionery maker Tohato. Usually, I don't really eat snacks,but I found myself buying it. 42 kinds of spices are used to make it,so taste is really spicy.<br>After I ate it,I unconsciously felt like seeing the "Muthu" again.<br>If you have a chance,I recommend to see the "Muthu" and eat it.<br><br>Have you heard of this ?<br><br>Tour operators in Japan organize Dancing Maharaja tours wherein the tourists are brought to Chennai and they are taken to a movie hall, which shows a Rajini movie. After this they meet up with Rajini / Latha Rajinikanth.ajinikanth's charm works like magic in the island nation of Japan.No other Indian actor had achieved the kind of popularity that Rajini has in Japan. His film 'Muthu' was a blockbuster hit in the country. And, when he was getting ready to release his latest flick 'Chandramukhi', his fans from Japan had come down to Chennai to watch the film, first day, first show.<br><br>An Indian brand of masala snacks had conducted a market study and decided to launch its product with Rajini's picture on its wrapper cover. They chose some stills from 'Muthu'. The product has become a rage these days. His fans are reportedly buying the snack to simply collect his pictures!<br><br>Some are even framing the pictures and hanging them on the walls!!!<br>And the lead actresses who act with him become popular wih their other movies as well<br><strong>He also acted in a hollywood film Bloodstone in 1988</strong><br><br><a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0094765/maindetails" rel="nofollow">http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0094765/maindetails</a><br><br><img src="http://www.sportsposterwarehouse.com/warehouse/mutu04gb-1.jpg"></div>
