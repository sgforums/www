            <div class='col-md body'>Schools briefed on Singapore's stand on Iraq war: Rear-Adm Teo<br><br>By Dominique Loh<br><br>Education Minister Rear Admiral Teo Chee Hean has said schools have been briefed on Singapore's stand on the Iraq war and they are encouraged to discuss it with the students.<br><br>"We've given some advice to the schools with regard to Singapore's position on the matter, why we take this position. I would encourage the schools and the principals to have discussions with the students so that they can express their views and understand what's happening better," he said.<br><br>Speaking to reporters at a community event, he also hoped the Singapore Government's humanitarian aid to the Iraqis will spur others to do the same.<br><br>The Singapore Government is contributing US$250,000 towards the Singapore Red Cross humanitarian efforts to help the people of Iraq, and Admiral Teo hoped this will spur Singaporeans to want to contribute in a constructive way.<br><br>He said: "Some feel they ought to do something and they can come together and contribute something to this fund to help those who may suffer the effects of this war."<br><br>Admiral Teo and other MPs were at a ceremony to mark the building of a new Community Club which runs activities to foster social cohesion.<br><br>During this time, MPs and grassroots leaders say, it's even more important to make sure Singaporeans are united - particularly on the events in Iraq.<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/35538/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/35538/1/.html</a></div>

War is never glorifying, but suffering, soldiers die and so do civilians, but if you want peace, then no choice. Our Government stand is we would like the weapons of mass destruction not go into the wrong hands."<br><br>On the humanitarian front, Mr Ong added that Singapore schools will be chipping in to help the Iraqi people.<br><br>Red Swastika, for example, will hold a donation drive to raise at least a thousand dollars for the Red Cross humanitarian fund.<br><br>Matthew Kwok, a primary 2 student of Red Swastika School, said: "Iraq is a poor country. They need a lot of money to make things, buy food because food comes from other countries."<br><br>Issues linked to the war will also be discussed among older students in secondary schools and JCs in the days ahead.<br><br>Meanwhile, a check with Middle-Easterners in Singapore showed their views on the war are divided.<br><br>25-year-old Iranian student, Amir Farokhi, said: "Coming from Middle Eastern blood, there's a tint of fear. I'm not Iraqi, Iranians are different from Iraqi, but I sense the apprehension about the US or any other country, going into a region and say, this is how we would like to see things because it's in our best interest. And our best interest is also the world's best interest. And that I think is what the world is having a hard time swallowing."<br><br>Laith M. Adely, an Iraqi businessman, said: "I think Saddam has crossed the line of nomality. He's invaded 2 countries, he brutally suppresses his own population. I think the only way to take him out, to have a regime change in Iraq is from an outside force, and that's coming in the form of the allies. The Iraqis have tried on numerous occasions to overthrow him, but it's proved very difficult."<br><br>34-year-old Laith, who has been running a business in Singapore for the last 8 years, hopes that Saddam's removal will mean a better life for some of his relatives still in Iraq.<br><br></div>
