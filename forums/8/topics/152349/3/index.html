            <div class='col-md body'>well, that is what social studies and moral education is for, even then, there are still people amongst us with no moral decorum. Education works for the masses, but there will always be simpletons whom simply cannot conform to societal standards.<br><br>Racist remarks do not constitute freedom of speech,it is one thing to be fooling around with one's friends, and it is another to make outright racist comments with utter disregard to others.In most cases, the racists are ridiculously uneducated people or simply insecure individuals,hence it is really pathetic.<br><br>Just as minorities would take offence when some chinese would have fun with their racist slurs,the same is felt by the chinese whom constitute the minorities in other countries.Hence the crux of the matter is to not do onto other what you would not want done onto you.<br><br>To finish off, i feel that those two imbeciles deserve a deterrent sentence, coupled with some degree of moral education, because they must be pretty dense.I doubt any attempts to correct their mindsets would be of any use, hence slap them a nice fat fine[very singaporean] and give them some jail time..perhaps 3 months or so to reflect on their actions.Hopefully individuals from minority groups they have made comments about could help them get acquainted to prison life as well.<br><br>Cheers</div>

I could say that almost everyone must have had racist thoughts before however, the act of voicing them out is the issue.<br><br>The underlying nature of humans is to associate with those similar to them, and tend to exclude those whom they deem foreign,this is a natural construct and is simply in-built within Man. I agree that this is something which would not be remedied by strict enforcement, however,the ACT of voicing out the racist intents, is a different matter altogether. Especially in a public forum, no longer are the opinions personal,they have now turned public, and herein lies the problem. The duo made a conscious effort to voice their wayward views,in so doing incurring the wrath of those offended.<br><br>While you may feel that punishing them would cause them to be deemed heroes, imagine the consequences if these duo are not punished, would they not be revered more?And would there not also be more copycat acts since the pioneers are not heavily dealt with?</div>

Simply because you are hiding behind your computer screen in this forum, and form part of a majority race in Singapore would make you bolder and seem to feel that racism is no issue. But, you must realise, that Singaporean Chinese in Australia get stoned[ie rocks thrown at them], and this constitutes racism as well. We, Singaporeans, esp. in this generation have not felt the effects of racism, esp those in the majority cultures.The gahmen's acts to curb racism should be greatly appreciated, as nipping the problem in the bud would prevent the opportunity of racism to grow out of hand.<br><br>Racism is not harmless-just because you have never been a victim of it does not mean the problem is harmless,i find that comment remarkably n poor taste.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fenixfire:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, i think that using the analogous comparisons,the act of murder outweighs the thought of murder, hence it can be similarly put forth that the act of racism outweighs the thoughts of racism. I could say that almost everyone must have had racist thoughts before however, the act of voicing them out is the issue.<br><br>The underlying nature of humans is to associate with those similar to them, and tend to exclude those whom they deem foreign,this is a natural construct and is simply in-built within Man. I agree that this is something which would not be remedied by strict enforcement, however,the ACT of voicing out the racist intents, is a different matter altogether. Especially in a public forum, no longer are the opinions personal,they have now turned public, and herein lies the problem. The duo made a conscious effort to voice their wayward views,in so doing incurring the wrath of those offended.<br><br>While you may feel that punishing them would cause them to be deemed heroes, imagine the consequences if these duo are not punished, would they not be revered more?And would there not also be more copycat acts since the pioneers are not heavily dealt with?</div></blockquote>Perhaps you are right, but I'm more worried that others like them would be driven underground and grow like fungus.<br><br>It might be better to go head to head with them and prove to them why they are wrong.  Make it public so that everyone can hear just how shallow their thoughts are.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>totally agree with what fenixfire said...<br>nt just race issues but religious ones as well..<br><br>though most of us weren't born when the race riots happened, but we must learn from history..ask any of your folks what was it like back then....<br><br>no matter how much our life has changed n improved, our core basic human feelings will nvr change..<br><br>we can happy talk cok, crap here 2day but the future of the place where we were born and our future generations lies on our this generation's hands...<br></div>
