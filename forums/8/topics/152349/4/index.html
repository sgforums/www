I agree that this is something which would not be remedied by strict enforcement, however,the ACT of voicing out the racist intents, is a different matter altogether.

However, racists still exist as there is a limit to what education can offer. Similarly, the government educates us similarly from pri school, but not all of us go right up to uni,the education system guides us one way, but the eventual path taken is dependent on multifactorials, of which the individual's choices is one.<br><br>Racism starts from differences. Its a known fact that people prefer familiarities,while most people are able to live perfectly well with those whom are so called different from them, there are the wayward few who cannot. Racism is a matter of choice,no baby was born hating another kid based on differing cultures,upbringing and personal choice are the main constituents for this to occur[my opinion].<br><br></div>

However, racists still exist as there is a limit to what education can offer. Similarly, the government educates us similarly from pri school, but not all of us go right up to uni,the education system guides us one way, but the eventual path taken is dependent on multifactorials, of which the individual's choices is one.<br><br>Racism starts from differences. Its a known fact that people prefer familiarities,while most people are able to live perfectly well with those whom are so called different from them, there are the wayward few who cannot. Racism is a matter of choice,no baby was born hating another kid based on differing cultures,upbringing and personal choice are the main constituents for this to occur[my opinion].<br><br></div></blockquote>Well , i agree.<br>Alot of people began seeing muslims differently after so many things happened in this world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>can anyone give me the links to those racist remarks? i wanna noe what's the big deal.<br><br>to start off, all singaporeans, malaysians, south east asians are racist. doesn't singapore/malaysia state the "Race" of a person in its IC?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>then how? what exactly constitute racism ah? I see chinese sticking with chinese, indians with indians, malays with malays, white caucasians with themselves etc etc and so do the foreigners be they labourers or top level executives.<br><br>also i see that a lot of jobs require knowledge of mandarin, i dont have a problem with that. i have a problem with this - how does n e 1 decide what a child is supposed to learn as mother tongue/second language whatever? if it's a malay or indian or eurasian kid, by imposing our view that they should learn malay/tamil/(??) respectively, aren't we being racist? how do we know they aren't better capable to learn mandarin which is a job requirement in many cases. by ASSUMING that the child's "race" restricts him/her to be better capable of learning that particular language (and not mandarin) isn't everyone in the authority also acting racist?<br><br>wat's the big deal? as long as got no race riots, no murder, rape, genocides other horrible acts, why bother?<br><br>it's the masses (all of them) who are at fault, each and every one of them. come on, dont tell me you see a malay guy entering a mosque to pray and say some guy went to pray, you say some malay guy went to pray. you see some indian guy selling roti prata, u dun say some guy sells roti prata, u say an indian guy sells roti prata. u see some chinese gal in the arms of a white man, u dun say it's a swedish blue eyed gal with her sri lankan boy friend, do you?<br><br>den by judging a person's skin colour/facial features, and using it as a primary determinant for assessing his/her capabilities/actions, aren't you racist yourselves? i dun see wat's the big deal with some blogger saying some cr@p.<br><br>so why this fuss suddenly over these two racist bloggers blah blah blah, heck i dun even identify these two as racists altho i dunno what they said. why? coz i noe for a fact, all ppl use race as a criteria for measuring some inherent abilities/characteristics.<br><br>wat's the big fuss over it?<br><br>the last example was gooood:<br><br>you see a chinese gal in the arms of a white/caucasian man, but you dun say it's a blue-eyed swedish gal with her sri lankan boyfriend, do you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
