            <div class='col-md body'>This Sedition act itself, not only affects publications, speech, prints that are racist in nature. Of course, the remarks have to be serious enuff that it will cause the good citizens of Singapore to want to get out of their chairs and take parangs to chop each other.  According to the act's definition of sedition, if u even utter something which the govt dertermines as possible insurrection, u'd be in trouble too.<br><br>However, despite such a broad definition.  I believe that these laws are meant to protect us.  And the govt definitely won't botai boji decide to charge 2 unknown bloggers for just a few racist jokes.  We don't know exactly what they said, so I guess we have to wait and see.<br></div>

And well, i do not think that the gahmen actually wants to be so strict in enforcing the laws such that you would be rushed off to jail when you make a racial oriented joke. The duo that have been caught have obviously overstepped boundaries, hence the law have had to step in. I would agree with you that if the gahmen were to catch every kid whom has told a racial joke, the enforcement would be excessive.<br><br>Well, as to making the matter public,the gahmen has actually brought the racism matter out for the public to look into. At the same time, the gahmen would be expected to make a stand on this issue at hand, and their punishments could be seen as a deterrence for future offenders. As you said there would be the problem of racists possibly going underground, but I would concur that the gahmen must have realised that the pros outweigh the cons. While those who persist to have their racist agendas may go underground, this number would be rather miniscule as compared to the general public that could be swayed by such opinions being aired freely.</div></blockquote>Perhaps there is a limit to what education can do.  But I'm sure there are better ways of making a stand than to bring those boys to court.<br><br>Dont' you think Singaporeans will know how to judge for themself what's nonsense and downright dumb.</div>
