              <p>Recently there seems to be too many employees from PRC who cannot speak English in Singapore.  This is a big issue as I cannot fathom why they work in the hospitality industry when they cannot speak English.  Even the very basic requirements of the language are beyond them.  This trend is very troubling as we are trying to improve our services standards here but have people working as frontline staff who cannot comprehend what the customers wants.</p>
              <p>I am writing in to ensure the authourities look seriously into this problem because of what happened to me and my very important client.  We were at a cafe in a five star hotel in Singapore.  I asked for the bill.  The waitress was from PRC - she brought milk for my coffee.  My client laughed but he was already late for his flight and was not too impressed.  I told her again - I want the bill and even gesticulated the action of writing which everyone waiting tables usually understands.  What happens next is a complete shocker - she brings two mugs of beer.  I lost it - I went around and looked for someone who was not Chinese to ensure they weren't from PRC and got the bill in two minutes.  Don't these workers need to sit for an English competency test or something before being employed or are people from PRC given a waiver on this requirement?  I don't see frontline staff from other nations working in this country that cannot speak English, even Bangladeshi general workers on Constrcution sites speak relatively good english.  This is really mind boggling!</p>

              <p>The foreign trash from China are the favoured ones from LKY thus the leniency towards them.     I absolutely agree with you that we have no problem communicating with the other foreigners from other countries who work here.</p>
              <p>Anyway, these foreign trash from PRC - some have attitude problem like expecting the locals to understand what they speak.   </p>
              <p>As a chinese I  am a little lenient to them to communicate to them in Mandarin, but even then I do get stuff which I don't ask for.    May be basically, they do have interpretation problem other than not able to communicate in English.</p>

              <p>Recently there seems to be too many employees from PRC who cannot speak English in Singapore.  This is a big issue as I cannot fathom why they work in the hospitality industry when they cannot speak English.  Even the very basic requirements of the language are beyond them.  This trend is very troubling as we are trying to improve our services standards here but have people working as frontline staff who cannot comprehend what the customers wants.</p>
              <p>I am writing in to ensure the authourities look seriously into this problem because of what happened to me and my very important client.  We were at a cafe in a five star hotel in Singapore.  I asked for the bill.  The waitress was from PRC - she brought milk for my coffee.  My client laughed but he was already late for his flight and was not too impressed.  I told her again - I want the bill and even gesticulated the action of writing which everyone waiting tables usually understands.  What happens next is a complete shocker - she brings two mugs of beer.  I lost it - I went around and looked for someone who was not Chinese to ensure they weren't from PRC and got the bill in two minutes.  Don't these workers need to sit for an English competency test or something before being employed or are people from PRC given a waiver on this requirement?  I don't see frontline staff from other nations working in this country that cannot speak English, even Bangladeshi general workers on Constrcution sites speak relatively good english.  This is really mind boggling!</p>
