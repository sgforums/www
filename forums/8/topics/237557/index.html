Agree with u about threads being started on much less. Which is why I've given up on this forums and stopped coming her regularly. Same goes for Singapore. I also don't think they key to this discussion is aesthetics, but more on the "frog in the well" mentality of majority of Singaporeans. Even you who's much more able to present a well constructed argument in an articulate way has the knee jerk reaction of saying that the piercing in this case was done as a result of  "angst lack of attention"</div>
