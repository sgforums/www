Smoking SHOULD be banned because of human rights. Do you know that each time a smoker smokes in a room, the nicotine is left lingering in the air for a long time before it totally disappears? Hence, those people who enter that room will be breathing in polluted air even though there is no one smoking there at that time.<br><br>There are many other ways of generating wealth for a country.<br><br>And also, I think it's absolutely silly to spend money to commit suicide slowly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

THERE CAN BE NO PROPER JUSTIFICATION FOR SMOKING.<br><br>As we can see, greed is still a major reason why an utterly brainless, antisocial, unconsiderate and discusting habit like smoking can persist. It's all the same reasons why the abolition of slavery, child labour and all the stuff like that met so much resistance, because these activities were profitable.<br><br>And that's what makes it so utterly discusting, smokers go around blowing their stupid smoke in public, and let them drift into the face of others (that never fails to irk me off) and they dun even have the courtesy to stop smoking infront of young children but let their toxic fumes drift admist these hapless youth.<br><br>Smokers think they're helping the economy as if it was some lame justification to go on smoking, as always, these arrogant, cocky smokers are people who just hide behind some thin veneer of a reason to keep on smoking, they pass out lame reasons but when it comes to crunch time when the doctor tells them they have lung, throat, bladder cancer, brain damage, smoking related impotence, nerve damage, stroke, heart damage and the like, the arrogant smile that they had carried their stupid habit in is quickly wiped away and they realize how foolish they have been.<br><br>And worse, people around them suffer too, how many families have seen their loved ones taken away prematurely because of their own foolishness prideful arrogance? How many more will suffer with the side effects of second-hand smoke? The bodies are piled high. Is this so called freedom to choose to smoke? This is not freedom, when you smoke, you are seriously violating the rights of others around you. And no self-respecting person has to put up with that nonsense.</div>
