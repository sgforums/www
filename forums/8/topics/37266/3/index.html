My fren has to  avoid coffeeshops most of the time because almost all coffeeshops will have multitudes of smokers smoking away. He  has to stay away because the smoke will cause him infections which will cause death cause he is still weak. Fair? maybe not.<br><br>As I said, choices. U choose to smoke, nobody can fault u.

A  vicious cycle.<br><br>Let those who have eyes see, let  those who have ears hear.<br><br>No one can guarantee that by smoking, u are destinied 100% to die by lung or throat cancer. But the chance is high, very high. Just any doctors and  nurses.<br><br>Ultimately its a choice, life is about choices isnt it? For passive smokers, dun worry, unless u are in  a  smoking environment everyday, your body shld have ample time to repair itself. Of cos there are exceptions, my fren who have just recovered from cancer has been  asked by doctors to avoid coffeeshops and smoking areas. Pubs i can understand, but coffeeshops. My fren has to  avoid coffeeshops most of the time because almost all coffeeshops will have multitudes of smokers smoking away. He  has to stay away because the smoke will cause him infections which will cause death cause he is still weak. Fair? maybe not.<br><br>As I said, choices. U choose to smoke, nobody can fault u. Whether smoking results in the consequences nobody wished for, it is of no issue, cos its your choice, just remember some choices do not provide a route of return.</div></blockquote>u know. i love to use this "choice" issue in my postings too. great minds think alike. yea. life is about choices. what u choose now, affects what happens 10 years down the road. and about those who claim to hv the right to smoke. think clearly. yea maybe u hv the right. but why would u want to continue it? think logically. would u rather start a new life without knowing about smoking or being addicted to it? or would u hv CHOSEN to take the same path down the road. just curious.</div>

A burn on the face is not anywhere near as bad as lung cancer so if they accept lung cancer as a risk, they should also accept the wrath of the long suffering nonsmokers wat.

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree.<br><br>When smokers choose to light up amongst non-smokers, they had taken the liberty to harm innocent bodies. I didn't say they can't smoke, yes they have every right to kill/harm themselves but they ain't got the right to harm my body.<br><br>Bear, What rights do the smokers have to cause harm to non-smokers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>I think it's only right for smokers to smoke in designated areas/rooms. In this way, if they choose to die, they can breathe in each others 2nd hand smoke and in a way enjoy more and in another way die earlier so that less harm be caused to innocent non-smokers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>Till the day cigarettes maker can produce cigarettes that did not emits smokes, harmful chemicals and contain all by-products in the cigarette itself or in the user's body, smoking should be banned and it is only rightfully so <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I definitely value my life more than them. I don't want any pain/anguish that got to do with smoking-related illnesses. Imagine a smoker's life lying on the hospital bed, feeling helpless, too late... a life of regrets. Saying goodbyes to your grandchildrens/childrens/love ones etc.<br><br>"Grandson, don't be like grandpa. Never ever take up smoking...... the heartbeat stops....... silence. Love ones crying over your dead body" In a way, smoking does more than physical harm. It hurts the ones that loves you emotionally too. Think about it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Why wait till the last moment before one can, as I borrow a phrase from SAF,"WAKE UP YOUR IDEA <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> "<br><br><span style="color: red;">SMOKING KILLS</span><br><br></div>
