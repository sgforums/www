            <div class='col-md body'>Spin is a local Singaporean production by Television Corporation of Singapore that dwells on the ups and downs of tertiary students. Production started late last year and it opened with great rave and reviews in the beginning of this year.<br><br>Spin is now in her second season and I see no reason why it canÂ’t repeat the success it had with local audiences. It was a mark of faith and foresight when TCS decided to embark on the second season of Spin and as expected, was greeted with overwhelming support from the Singaporean students who feels that they can identify with the characters in there. Characters like Madeline Tan, Elaine Cheah, Rodney Oleverio, and Keegan Kang are household names and teenagers from all polytechnics hang their posters in their bedrooms, wishing to be in their shoes of angst and love.<br><br>With the ending of the first season, we witness a serious change in the script in which the polytechnic students began to seriously look like the students of Beverly Hills. We see an influx of local actors from Singapore posing as foreign students from the States for the producers believed fervently in keeping to the authenticity of the show vis-Ã -vis reflection of school life. Thus, we see the majority of SpinÂ’s actors are Eurasians sprouting American slang, which is of course, totally in accordance with the reality shown in all tertiary institutions in Singapore.<br><br>The story and the plot are gripping, to say the least and the casts in the show are simply thespians. Who need Kim Ng when we have Elaine Cheah? Madeline Tan is such an accomplished actress that I feel that her talent is rather wasted on the show, not withstanding the fact that the show too, is an excellent vehicle for her to export her talents to the rest of Asian and hopefully, Hollywood. Keegan Kang is the local version of Keanu Reeves, whose brooding expression is perfected with constant practise and Rodney wide range of anger expression is surely to be emulated!<br><br>Needless to say, this show is a shoo in for the Asian awards and I am not surprised that all actors and actress mentioned about will get their due results there and then. And I can safely predict that Spin will go on strong with even more seasons and going by the track record of TCS and their more than unshakeable faith in their foresight, as well as their receptiveness to popular opinions, my trust is well placed!<br>Go Spin Go!<br><br>------------------<br>The heartless and souless fool.</div>
