FOr those who don't read newspapers......<br><br>AUG 27, 2003<br>Mirage of Lee Hsien Loong's image problem<br><br>By Chua Lee Hoong<br><br>THE first time I came across Mr Lee Hsien Loong in person was in the late 1980s, when I was a young civil servant.<br><br>He was the Minister for Trade and Industry, and the Second Minister for Defence.<br><br>He was among a group of ministers, including the Prime Minister, that my department gave regular briefings to. When I wasn't briefing them, I would be there to take notes.<br><br>I have two abiding impressions from those sessions.<br><br>One was that Mr Lee had the uncanny knack of seeming deep in slumber, then popping up the moment the briefing ended to ask the most penetrating questions.<br><br>His long, reposing frame - six foot if an inch - slung loosely in the chair fooled us all.<br><br>The other observation? He sure loved our curry puffs.<br><br>Fifteen years on, I don't know if Mr Lee still loves curry puffs. But he still has the same difficulty of keeping his frame contained within most conventional chairs.<br><br>When Channel NewsAsia featured him in a forum with junior college students last year - the same forum where he wore that famous red shirt - the way his frame was too big and long for the tub chair reminded me all over again of how he used to fidget in the chairs I used to know.<br><br>Mr Lee takes after his father in his fidgeting. He takes after his father too in voice and the cadences of speech.<br><br>Needless to say, he too is brilliant, has a razor-sharp intellect and doesn't suffer fools gladly.<br><br>Where he differs sharply from his father, however, is that he likes children.<br><br>He genuinely likes them.<br><br>No amount of hothousing in political prep school can enable you to fake that.<br><br>You can pat thousands of them on the head and it will still be clear to the discerning observer that you're doing so only because you think you have to.<br><br>Not so the younger Lee.<br><br>My colleague, a veteran journalist who first covered him when he entered politics in 1984, says: 'He is awfully good with children. They respond very well to him.'<br><br>I can say the same from what I have seen.<br><br>My colleague also remembers the first Lee Hsien Loong walk-about in Teck Ghee: 'I was very impressed by how he handled his grassroots chaps who were trying to rush him along by saying, 'We have to cover XX number of blocks'.<br><br>'And he said, 'No, we are not covering blocks. We are meeting people'.<br><br>'At the market - and I have never forgotten this - when he was going around shaking hands, a fishmonger demurred, saying that his hands were dirty. Lee Hsien Loong stuck out his hand and said, 'No Singaporean's hands are dirty', and shook his hand firmly.'<br><br>What then of the 'no-nonsense, uncompromising and tough' public persona that Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong spoke about recently?<br><br>My colleague makes a shrewd observation: 'It is a male versus male thing. If you ask men, they will say, yeah, he is unapproachable. They keep a respectful distance from him.<br><br>'Maybe he exudes alpha male pheromones. Who knows?'<br><br>Who knows. He can be positively charming, even when he is just telling you why the Central Provident Fund contribution rate has to be cut.<br><br>Another colleague notes that Mr Lee doesn't suffer any image problem where heartlanders are concerned.<br><br>They know that he is the son of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and as intelligent, and that is enough.<br><br>Authoritarian and uncompromising?<br><br>In Chinese culture, these are traits of good, decisive leaders, to be welcomed as long as they bring the bacon home.<br><br>One challenge among the many that Mr Lee will face is that he inherits a Confucian society caught in the slipstream of rapid Westernisation.<br><br>The style expected of him will differ among different segments of society.<br><br>In recent decades, the Singapore administration is not known to believe in the art of the word as balm for the soul.<br><br>It is a no-nonsense government.<br><br>Words are used to convey facts, and facts are then used to move people.<br><br>It is just not done, to use words directly to move people.<br><br>In Mr Lee's case, for instance, he is happiest when he is creating policies, not creating sentences.<br><br>Having said that, however, I tend to believe that he possesses a sensibility of feeling and spirit that equips him with powers of empathy rare in a politician.<br><br>He's hardly your sensitive new age guy or your metrosexual, but he is an intense and thoughtful man who takes seriously the responsibilities that come with assuming the mantle of premiership.<br><br>He sees, for instance, that for Singapore to adapt successfully in the face of global trends, its people need to become less risk-averse and its system less rigid and controlled.<br><br>So while he will make tough and no-nonsense policy decisions, he will recognise that there is a less tangible aspect of leadership - the soft power, if you like, as opposed to the hard power.<br><br>Harnessing this is as important as making changes to rules and infrastructure, and I have no doubt he will do that.<br><br>If he combines the best leadership skills of his father and PM Goh, and throws in a few of his own besides, we are in for a treat indeed.<br>Copyright @ 2003 Singapore Press Holdings.
