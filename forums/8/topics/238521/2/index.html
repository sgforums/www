            <div class='col-md body'>thanks for your advice all! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>i'm thinking of investing in the MDIS Advanced Diploma in IT, but the price is around S$6300. the price is not a problem lah, my bank got enough money to buy 50 wives from China.<br><br>the problem is : $6300 is quite a huge sum, and if taking into the account the time also, a very big gamble. somemore, i don't want to take private degree(not interest in degrees), so it's very risky if this advanced diploma is not recognized by 99.9% of the companies here.<br>somemore, these private IT diplomas all also like local poly diplomas: a bit rojak, a bit curry, a bit of each, all mixed up a little....and worse still, i everyday read ST Classifieds and the IT/InfoComm section super-pathetic : less than 7 jobs in one day, whereas others, like Sales, Admin, Hotel/Restaurant, Technical, Engineering all over more than 40(some got 100++ jobs!).<br>very bleak....somemore, they all seek IT guys with 2 years experience and above....die liao...<br><br>like that, is it worth it to pay so much for the advanced dip? Informatics also got more or less the same offer, except that their cert is awarded by the NCC(singapore's own computing authority) whereas the MDIS one is awarded by the australian Edith Cowan university(at least sounds nicer).<br><br>as for second-class jobs for private diploma holders, i don't really mind lah. even in Tuas i can also consider, because the enviroment there are more friendlier with so many Malaysians, and plus, the Malaysian-chinese girls got quite a lot all super-chio one.<br><br>on a side note, if i ask the MDIS / private schools' course consultant for advice on these issues, do u guys think they'll give me honest answers? because i scared that they'll sweet-talk you and earn commission(a lot of them all like that).<br><br>thanks all!<br>nikar.</div>
