            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by aznpridegirl217:<br><strong>Not sure if this has been posted elsewhere.... but here goes:<br><br>On 24 Aug, Wong Geng Thong, an air con technician was sentenced to serve 8 weeks in jail for torturing and killing a cat. This may not have been his first offence of this nature.<br><br><img src="http://xa0.xanga.com/dd8a8ae5c5c3476748389/z51941010.jpg"><br><br>What the motherfucker did:<br><br>1. Lured the cat by offering it food,took it in his van to Blk 93A Jalan Dua off Old Airport Rd.<br>2. Tied a noose around the cat's neck and lifted the wire to hang the cat by the neck<br>3. Everytime the cat lost consciousness, Wong revived it by massaging its chest. He repeated this cruel act till the cat could not be revived anymore.<br>4. He then removed the wire noose, grabbed the cat by the neck and bashed its body against the wall several times<br>5. Then he threw the cat's body on the floor and kept kicking it<br><br>All that he did in the car park was captured by a spy camera.<br><br>Cleaners in the area have found the grisly remains of 10 cats in the neighbourhood over the past 5 months which is what triggered a group of volunteers to put up the spy cameras. These volunteers, along with the help of animal welfare organizations, have taken the time, money and effort to find the perpetrator of these senseless and cruel acts.<br><br>Yet when Wong Geng Thong was caught, he was sentenced to only 2 months in jail for what he did despite the fact that the psychiatrist who examined Wong was concerned he might abuse people too.<br><br>Most serial killers and murderers start their macabre career by torturing and killing animals. If unchecked, the likelihood of them progressing to hurt and kill people is very high. (Please read article written by Lynn Lam, Today Online http://www.todayonline.com/articles/127238.asp).<br><br>Under the Animals &amp; Birds Act, the maximum penalty for abusing an animal is a fine of $10,000 or a maximum jail term of 12 months, or both. Question is, what does it take to incur the maximum penalty? Doesn't such a calculated and cruel act as seen in the case of Wong Geng Thong deserve the maximum penalty?<br><br>If you feel that Wong Geng Thong deserves a harsher or the maximum penalty for what he did, please do the following:<br><br>1) Sign this petition<br>2) Tell your friends about this and get them to sign the petition<br>3) Write a letter to:<br><br>ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S CHAMBERS<br>Address : 1 Coleman Street, #10-00, Singapore 179803<br><br>Tel : 63361411<br>Fax : 63325984<br>Internet Website : http://www.agc.gov.sg<br>Email Address : agc@agc.gov.sg<br>(Please make sure your letter is polite and rational)<br><br>The SPCA is appealing for a harsher sentence for Wong but it's not just the responsibility of the SPCA, they need the help and support of the public at large. We are all responsible for making our society a safer and better place to live in. Please do something today before it's too late.<br><br>For more information and pictures of what the case is about, log on to this public Gmail account to download the files.<br><br>http://gmail.google.com<br>Username: CatKillerPetition<br>Password: Petition80<br><br><span class="large">[b]<br>please go HERE <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/killer75/petition.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.petitiononline.com/killer75/petition.html </a>to sign the petition.

I kept the kitten in my flat and I took great care of the little kitten.It grew and grew and became very handsome and very playful. He started to be on heat and started to make some noise. So I sent him for sterilisation. He recovered uneventfully. He was so cute and sat on my lap even joining me for my dinner on the table.<br><br>Then he disappeared three days ago. I thought the cat might have wondered somewhere and would return.Three days and still no sign of my little and adorable kitten. I became very worried and started to look for my kitten. No results.<br><br>Then today, I prayed and prayed. " Please return my cat, dead or alive..."<br><br>When I returned home this evening, I found my cat dead! - killed by some human beings. His head was smashed.His eyes were smashed. He must have died for a couple of days - stiff and smelly. I sayang him and cried. I said a few prayers and then buried him in some undergrowth far away from the people. I knelt and prayed and I cried.<br><br>Why are human beings so cruel? Why must they kill an adorable little kitten? And they kill with such ferocity and barbarity.
