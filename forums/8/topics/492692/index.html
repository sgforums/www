                  <p class="MsoNormal">This wretched inequality has got to stop. Why are women
                      treated so many times better than men? Men of any position are expected to put
                      on what I see as corporate uniform at typical office workplaces- long sleeved
                      shirt, long dark pants and leather shoes, day in day out, everyday the same.
                      Even when variety is allowed it only extends to wearing a polo t shirt or sport
                      shoes. Yet for women it is vastly different. They can wear the same corporate
                      uniform men wear, plus a mountain load more. Sleeveless blouses, sleeveless
                      tops so little they look like form fitting tank top, miniskirts, leggings
                      without any skirt over it, sleeveless short dresses, cropped pants, and very
                      often slippers</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">Now as if the above isn’t enough, they are creating more new
                      fashion to break the rules, like rompers which are sleeveless dresses which end
                      in short pants, culottes which are flowy pants barely past knee length. Or
                      somehow they got the company to ignore the dresscode on themselves altogether
                      and come in wearing just a t shirt top and shorts. Men cant even enter an
                      office in bermudas without receiving snide comments from collegues and told by
                      boss not to wear like that, yet women are wearing hotpants-like bottom without
                      being told off. And those men and women aren’t of differing position or roles,
                      they’re the same position. Just today I saw a girl wear a longish button shirt
                      without anything, skirt or pants or leggings at the bottom, posing as admin for
                      the company, and everyone acted as if there was nothing wrong with her. If a
                      woman went out to malls like that, I’d consider it abnormal, not to mention at
                      work, and yet women now are being condoned and forgiven not just dressing
                      informally but obscenely in the workplace, so what is this??</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">In the first place, letting women wear knee length skirt is
                      already a concession for them, as it allows them freedom of airing their legs
                      aside from the corporate uniform men wear. If all is to be equal, women should
                      be subjected to the same long sleeve long pants and shoes rules. Yet they find
                      that that isn’t enough and still go further and further with exposure and
                      undercuts to the formality to their outlook, all the while still not letting
                      men have any leeway to how we can dress. I can tell u a typical Bermuda looks
                      way better than the casual skirt or torn denim skirt that women love wearing to
                      work nowadays, and yet it isn’t allowed for us. Why is our rights to vary what
                      we wear not respected, but that of women being allowed all the way? Have men
                      not contributed as much as, if not more than women? Who are the ones drafted to
                      serve NS, at the expense of their time, money and comfort? And the so called
                      VWOs in charge of promoting equality only care for the privileges of women and
                      ignore the unfairness men face. Is this becoming of a first world society?</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">If women are to be allowed all these indulgences, then at
                      least bermudas should be recognised as formal enough for the workplace for men,
                      those which are around knee length and tastefully cut, not those baggy or slop
                      looking ones.</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">Ideally, men should be allowed the exact shortness of length
                      of any kind of pants or skirt a woman may be allowed to wear. Why are our legs
                      made taboo while women allowed to freely show them? Didn’t women coin it as
                      slutshaming when someone criticises them for exposure? Why are they allowing every
                      men to be subjected to the very same thing, day after day, while they enjoy
                      their freedom? Ideally too, women ought to undergo drafting, to complete our
                      nation’s vision of everyone going through a similar experience to boost
                      national unity.</p>
