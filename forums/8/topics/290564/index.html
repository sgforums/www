            <div class='col-md body'>8pm, i got a shocked .my new mkt folder got stolen outside macdonalds after i left it for 4hrs there.hay its not too late and its stolen earlier during daytime at a crowed place. freaked out i rode down on my other mkt bike to nearby vicinity to check.the first thing that came to mind is sungai rd which is notorious for dealing with such items.<br><br>there, i circle around in the dark alley then sudden i saw my bike at the kopitiam .one ahbeng with angkong was test riding it , i dunno what to do then. i was planning to call the pulis but before i could think, that beng paid it and cycle off. i chase him down and return with him to the den to settle with the gangsters.<br><br>there the fat ganster refuse to acknowledge its my bike and even tried to counter claim it not mine. finally he agree its mine because i proved it had my special 'drilled' seat post and it was just stolen hours ago. but he still ask for 100 bucks for me to get it . i was aggrieved and wanted to lock the lock with mine before calling the pulis but a ahpek ganster prevented me by snatching the bike away. we had a scuffle and i was almost tempted to defend myself. then we cooled down but started shouting at each other.<br><br>obviously i was out numbered and couldnt talk logic with these bastards. i call a****n to come down and when he finally arrived we still couldnt settle it still. the ganster absolutely refuse responsibility and wanted money, now for 50 dollars. i wanted to just take my bike and run but i couldnt as a****n say we cant get away.those guys had been there for 12 years.the fatty was a porn cd seller there when a****n was young.<br><br>i still dint call the pulis cause i haven got the receipt from the bike shop. im gonna do that and have my bike engraved soon now. so in the end the ganster fren finally soften down after i told them this is my transport bike to skool and i coulnt afford 50.a****n proposed 20 and fatty took it.<br><br>its my mistake to leave out such a attractive bike , even bangalas who saw it stood there and drool for a few minutes before leaving when we had kopi the other day.haizzz, now im only concerned with getting a tough lock for it and not keeping it out for too long.these scounderels are society's shame , im just disappointed they made things so difficult for common folks who use mktbikes. just parked beside the gangsters den is easily 20+ bike locked to railings and they display it for sale to ready buyers.<br><br>overall im glad to get back my bike but deep down i had a sunken heart .i dun wan to be 'poor' and had to deal with such stupids things.<br><br>By :babuseng.<br><br>Watch out for your belongings, whatever it is, do not leave it unattended.</div>
