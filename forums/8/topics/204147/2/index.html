Interestingly, I learnt pretty recently that even our Singaporean Indians stereotype their from-India counterparts.<br><br>The majority race (chinese) is not spared either.  Common stereotypes seen on TV incl the feeble funny old chinese granny (popularlised by liang popo), the Ah Beng &amp; Ah Lian, the SPG, among other things.</div></blockquote>Well said. I agree to the fact that everyone gets their turn. =)<br>Anyways its not just Singaporean Indians stereotyping Indian Indians. Its the other way too =) You will be surprised man.. lol..<br><br>Its pretty irritating though when the less informed, ignorant fools in Singapore tend to think that Bollywood is all about dancing around trees (that is oh-so-outdated  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  ) and thinking that all speak with an accent. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> But well thats the way it is when you tell something new to a "frog in a well". They tend to generalise and stereotype everything.<br><br>And Krrish, it will be much better if you were to spend your time "popularising" Bollywood elsewhere were people appreciate it man.<br><br>Stop spreading this blatant stereotyping of Indians..<br><br>Yet another clone  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well Columbus Columbus song is not his best song. But it has some pretty cool sound effects. Once my chinese colleague asked me who did the music and he said he finds it very unique. ... Then later he wanted to hear all his other songs as well.  i gave him some Cds i had. BTW he doesnt make this kind of techy fast songs anymore. since 2002, his sense of this style has dying, rather  doing love or romantic songs,  but still his distinguishing style is there even in these songs and rather prefering to keep low profile ,<br>holding concerts for charity, going tours and giving lectures in music production in western countries.<br><br>AR Rahman is also a UN ambassador now appointed by Kofi Annan  for the Fight against TB  worldwide campaign.<br>UN's Kofi Annan likes Rahman sir's music<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wait a sec guys.. I'm the thread starter, not KRRISH.. And like I stated above, I do not approve of KRRISH's constant extolling of Bollywood either.. In fact it's really getting on my nerves..<br><br>I would appreciate it if KRRISH would either leave this topic permanently, or stay and discuss issues related to the topic title. Thank you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why the sudden hiostility. Try listening to his usic and u will find it is good.<br>all i can say his computerised sound effect is out of this world.<br><br>Rahman's strength lies not only in his perfect sense of melody and rhythm but also in his immaculate sound engineering. His music has been hailed as that of the digital age and has also been assailed for the very same reason. His music can never be adequately described in words. One has to personally experience the pleasure of his creations. Many of his compositions might actually sound ordinary the first time. But his music has this amazing capacity to grow on you and establish a firm hold on the listener. His compositions are an intriguing cocktail of musical pieces that literally blow your mind. His music is unique in its offbeat instrumental interludes, unconventional harmonies, and use of far from perfect voices and thumping rhythms.<br><br>Rahman did more: he made the soundtrack of each movie  sold as if it were a separate entity from the film itself. And as if to prove him right, his music assumed a life of its own, flying off the shelves at record speed even when the film in question bombed at the boxoffice.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>KRRISH, you should do these 3 things..<br><br>1) Learn To Read.<br><br>2) Learn To Spell.<br><br>3) Leave OR Stay and discuss something relevant.<br><br>Not everybody is an A.R Rahman ass-kisser like you are. You should learn to respect that and type something productive that everyone else can relate to, instead of wasting precious minutes of everyone's lives.<br><br>Now I hope you were able to get all of that, cause it would be pathetic on your part if you weren't able to.</div>
