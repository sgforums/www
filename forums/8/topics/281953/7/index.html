Cant wait for season 3 seriously lol..<br><br>So, Nathan as of now is dead, Sylar is back fully fit for fighting.. Hmm...<br><br>I was just wondering.. Can the future be changed? According to hiro, he could had saved his dad but he didnt cos he didnt wana change the future.. Even when he tried to save the restaurant girl, she eventually died to a virus so the future still holds that the bar girl is dead which means, somehow or another the outcome in future will not be changed even if u try to change de past..<br><br>so now, peter went into the future, the virus had spread.. but he destroyed it in de last episode.. hmm.. and the explosion hiro went into the future to witness de city being wiped out in flames.. maybe the explosion and de virus epidemic will have some connection.. haha love this show.. but a bit inconsistent la some parts..<br><br>peter should have had micah's power cos they were all there at the open space when peter was exploding.. so peter would easily tell de safe door to open or shut down the alarm instead of using elle's pwoers and de telekinesis to open de door lol.. n00b dunoe how to use his power.. and peter or matt could have listen to the sniper who shot nathan lol but they didnt.. n00b..<br><br>this noah guy is damn dodgy.. dunoe what other secret he holding onto.. he really cared about claire or something dark secret he keeping? lol.. but could have listen to his thoughts..<br><br>what is mama petrelli's powers? haha solid show la..</div>
