Peter regained his memories so I guess he could control his powers better after that. He seems to favour Elle's powers though and he should have been able to access a whole gamut of powers since he also has Sylar's accumulated powers (super hearing, freezing, telekinesis, his scary voice (if that's a power), turning any kind of object into a puddle...and probably others that haven't been seen yet..think Sylar has super speed too..and he can somehow break out of Hiro's time freeze)<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v726/Demonight/Armageddon%202007/sylarsketchjasonbadower.jpg"></div>
