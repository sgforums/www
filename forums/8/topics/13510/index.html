Midnight show start liow!!!<br><br>Obiwan arr. We discussed this b4 wat. Faith is the same. Delivery method different lor.<br><br>Some send massage..er..message by sms, some use the phone, some preach,  some showed through good deeds, some sent it with special delivery by planes into buildings.<br><br>Such is the world lor.<br><br>Let's take a look this way, insurance policy is a good thing cos it protects your finances and well being for the future, perhaps even your family's too, agree?<br><br>So if an insurance agent who is a friend of yours keeps calling you every other day and extoll its virtue, insisting that if you don't buy, if you die how? If your house burnt down how? All these can be real, eh? But  you will avoid his calls would'nt you? You will even get annoyed even if he is right, isn't it?<br><br>Now, another agent who is also a friend, he lets you know that he is an agent, but never bugs you, just an occasional reminder that he is around, like sending you a birthday card or Christmas card or when there is a good new policy information now and then. Of the two, when you buy insurance, who would you buy from?<br><br>Christians likewise. We must spread the gospel because we are commanded to do so. Just the same as selling insurance because it is their job. Both are doing a service which they think can help people. Not everybody will buy policies and likewise not everyone will accept the gospel.<br><br>As for me, I have done as commanded. Spread the gospel I have. I am not commanded to shove it down on people's throat. I have also not read anywhere that Jesus did that, for even He said, "Let him that has no sin cast the 1st stone" when He saw a mob stoning a prostitute. The mob then silently dispersed.<br><br>Jesus did not tell the prostitute "You have sinned. Believe in me first then I will save you." Instead He rebuked the holier than thou mob and thus saved the prostitute. That, my dear Obiwan, is spreading the message of love.<br><br>That, Obiwan is what is taught to me and this will be how I intend to fulfill my duty. Of course, as a human being, I too have my frailties, so what right have I got to wag my finger at obiwan...er..everyone? If I were to do so, then I will be like the mob stoning the prostitute whom Jesus rebuked would'nt I?<br><br>So, I see myself playing the role of the second insurance agent. Let everyone know that i am a Christian and have good news to share and when people think its time to listen to my eternal life policy, then I will gladly share it.<br><br>That willingness to listen is not my job. God too has to work, He does this through the Holy Spirit. I am not God.<br><br>To detractors, there will be Osamas. There are many good Muslims that opposed Osamas and their likes. Likewise the Christians. There are many good Christians too.<br><br>Am I?
