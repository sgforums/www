            <div class='col-md body'>Due to popular demand, I am here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Actually I am glad tat poopie head is here. His replies are excellent ! I just have to say one thing. No one need faith to tell 1+1=2 or faith to be convinced of existence of gravity. One only use faith to believe in something tat is not a fact or not proven. As such, whenever they say people need faith etc, they r actually convinced tat their religion is already unproven or in tis case, proven wrong. Moreover, they also acknowledge tat non-believers don't have any reasons to believe in their religion. Non-believers do not have faith ! They r saying they believe in it just because of faith, if u don't have any, u should logically not believe in it. So it become a very interesting question to ask why does any normal people suddenly popped out faith which replace their logic and become a christian.<br><br>I am pretty sure u r aware tat the "faith" system is easily abused since they do not have to prove or explain anything. A good example is the Al Qaeda and other religious mobs or terrorists<br><br>Secondly, ALTHEISM is not a religion ! Believing in a religion, by dictionary terms : Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power . Obviously, Altheism do not believe in such things. How can it be a religion ? There r people who plays PC game, people who play playstation games and people who don't play any of such video games. So not playing game is a game itself ? <span style="font-style: italic;">"Atheism is a religion of believing that there is no God"</span><br><br>Thirdly, poopie head is right about science. If someone is convince tat the second law of thermodynamic or absolute zero is wrong, then prove it ! The bible is already proven wrong when men discover earth is more than billions of years, evolution is a fact and noah's ark cannot carry all the animals. If u prove it wrong, science will change and form itself to become a more accurate system. For religion, they do not accept the overwhelming evidences and instead, claims either the evidences r wrong, science is unreliable or men r just plain dumb.<br><br><blockquote>I have 2 Masters degrees and I would say I am fairly educated - up till today, I cannot find fault with the Bible.</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Tat doesn't prove anything u know. There r professors who believe in buddhism or being altheist too.<br><br><blockquote>Read deeper and ponder on the Word of God - if possible, obtain the original Greek and Hebrew texts as they are the most accurate.</blockquote>Frankly, if u read the original text, u may come out with more astonishing facts tat were censored off by the church before<br><br><blockquote>If everything was so straightforward, then there would be no doubt, then there would be no basis of faith</blockquote>Why need faith ? A god's game with human ? Don't u find it a contradiction ? they try hard to convince people to believe in them (Jesus, bible etc) yet they do not want them to be convinced at the same time. If he want people to believe in him, convince them with all his heart ! Don't give false accounts in the bible ! Send out stronger signals like appearing to the world to convince people they r there !<br><br><blockquote>Then how else could God give us free will, if everything was laid out for us so plainly</blockquote>If he want to give people free will, then RESPECT their decisions. Don't go around saying they give u free will, tell u a half convincing story and if u turn out not to believe in him, u go to hell. Tis really sounds like a joke to me.<br><br><blockquote>Don't worry about the details too much - grasp the foundations and understanding of Salvation first. </blockquote>The first thing to do is to first establish if it is correct or not isn't it ? Why grasp the foundations and understanding of Salvation if it is just a lie ?<br><br><blockquote>The only other real way would be to die and find out. It would be un-Christianlike for us to say "we told you so", that's why Christians are so fervent in getting the message across.</blockquote>The attitude of god is really  "I told u so". If u don't believe in him u go to hell. Tat sounds to me to be really absurb...<br><br><blockquote>Partially agree, was thinking maybe up till now archiologist have not found any evidence on creation yet, but maybe in 100 yrs they may find lor</blockquote>They have found evidences tat evolution is true. If evolution is true, the bible is not true then there wouldn't need a reason to believe in creationism<br><br><blockquote>On the other hand, the creation of Adam and Eve, they are actually two prehistroic apes!, not human, then as apes evolve, we become humans</blockquote>Not flaming u, but just to state out some facts... the bible have already stated Adam to be talking, thinking and naming animals. So they can't be apes. Adam is formed instantly from dust of the earth with the breath of god within a day. It is instananeous, not delay for millions of years<br></div>

Evolution has provided a clear explanation for the many features of life tat we see. Why force in creationism just for the sake of forcing in ? From my understanding, the proof of evolution result in the proof of the bible being wrong. Bible believes everything to be "created" instantly, not evolved. If these kinda sciptures r wrong, then there wouldn't need a reason to stubbornly believe in creationism. We don't see any evidence or signs tat show creationism, We don't see any reason or evidence tat suggest the existence of another being, why believe in such fairy tales in the first place ?<br><br>A hypothetical example is; I believe in gravity, plain and simple. Why force in something totally extraordinary, <span style="font-style: italic;">for example</span> hell give off another pulling effect, just because some sciptures say so ? Tat is no evidence of hell, no evidence it able to pull in anything, then why believe in it ? There is no evidence for creationism, no evidence of a creator tat creates, then why believe in it ? Evolution as a model is self sufficient on its own.<br><br><blockquote>to be truly open-minded, it is possible that the 2 is interlinked. that is something in-between was lost, that why the "connection" is lost? </blockquote>To be truly open minded, we see evidences and facts, not blind deductions. Please elaborate wat things were lost ? I don't see any mising link in evolution tat need creationism to be plugged in<br><br><blockquote>but then i still believe in my own hypothesis, i.e. many people just sprut up at different places in about the same time</blockquote>?? who tell u tat ? Even the bible doesn't tell u tat<br><br><blockquote>Anyway if bible says Adam to be talking, thinking and naming animals, hmm... any other animals are also able of independent thoughts, and conversing with fellow species? and perhaps in their own language, their actually name other species</blockquote>All animals cannot communicate complex messages effectively except humans. Animals can come out with "danger", "food there","lets have sex" but not complex things like knowing his own existence and naming other animals. Sorry man, to be blunt, it is all your thinking of trying to fit the bible into science, which sad to say... science is totally against these kinda sciptures.<br><br>If u wanna come out with any idea, please kidnly come out with facts to accompany it. Day dreaming or come out with ones own theories is easy, but serve little practical purposes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LOL... this is rather instructive huh...<br><br>Most of the miracles have been explained by scholars that study human behaviour, and most of them are skeptics and cynics and atheists.<br><br>The miracle of feeding so many ppl with 2 loaf 5 fish etc. It was the culture that time to carry ard your own food in case you got hungry, esp for long journeys. When Jesus offered to share the food, many of them ate from their own stash.<br><br>Turning the sea red. There is a micro organism that is red. Fish eat them as well as other stuff. Happens that under certain weather condition, these little red things (I really dunno the name) will multiply tremendously and make the sea look red.<br><br>Parting the red sea. Moses did not part the red sea the way we watched in the cartoon Prince of Egypt. Rather, scientists have discovered that the red sea was very low back then. At certain times, ppl can walk across (in a pinch) without drowning.<br><br>Locusts devestating the Egptian crop as sign of God. History has shown that Egypt has always had those irritating insects devestate their crop, that's why they always have stockpiles of food and wheat. The one we read about in the Bible is just longer than the usual.<br><br>Perfectly logical and sensible explanation to miracles. Is it due to God?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The miracle of feeding so many ppl with 2 loaf 5 fish etc. It was the culture that time to carry ard your own food in case you got hungry, esp for long journeys. When Jesus offered to share the food, many of them ate from their own stash. </blockquote>Obviously the bible states tat just a loave of bread get to be shared around, not they eating their own bread. U r already changing the content of the bbile itself in order to fit science. If u want to change the words, then u can change anything into everything.<br><br>Jesus, being born because of his mother affairs with other men is a target of bullying by the religion and people. He grew up desiring a change of the religion so he came out with an elaborate plot to totally revamp the system. Jesus reserection can be a total hoax too. He is just lame dead, and his disciples just go around dressed up as him to bluff the people. Jesus curing the diesease ? It is just some good acting. In the first place the people who claim they r sick etc r actually his own people. Jesus died on the cross is not because he want to save men. He died because he cannot escape from the chasing roman soldiers so he might as well use it for propaganda purposes.<br><br>Moses could have a chance to free the slaves because he led them into a popular revolt and egytians r busy with war from other countries. How they led them into a revolt is because of religion, giving the people a desire to put their lives at risk for freedom. The first borned who is dead actually meant the victims killed during the revolt or possibly war with the other nations. They do not cross over the red sea, rather they cross over a bridge. They cut off the other end of the bridge to drown the chasing egytians. In order to prevent the slaves from rioting, he come up with god, laws etc to contain and control his people. There r already signs tat some of his people r making him irrelevant by coming out with a totally new religion. Tat is why he come out with god anger or wrath to enforce his control over them. Why he smash the rocks with the 10 commandments, because he do not want them to see there is actually nothing written on it at all or it is badly and unprofessionally scraped out during those 10 days. They search for many years before finding the promised land is because moses actually don't know where to go. SO he come out with a cock story about being punish by god in order to make the people continue searching and not revolting to go back as a secure slave.<br><br>In tat case everything in there is a hoax and there r no divine interventions in it. U r just believing a story spuned out by men all along.<br></div>
