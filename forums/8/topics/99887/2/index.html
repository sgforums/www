Know that the Bible is written for all ages, then, now and future. understand the context of the author. If he means so, so be it but look at Genesis, understand who wrote that, the purpose of the verses. Genesis is not a simple straight forward book taken at face value (for that fact most of the books in the Bible are not that straight forward). Many people went through years of studies understand the book of Genesis. It is not so much of God wanting to put down an accurate number. Rather the whole purpose of the Bible to bring us back to God.<br><br>Besides many archeologist that the chornological time dating in the Bible is just different from modern dating. but of course they can proven wrong... keep an open mind on this. the geological description seemed to be fantastical accurate though.<br><br>why is it figurative? using us the finite being to write something suitable for all ages is not simple. Figure of speech is used. Not definite words which would limit its potency. About dinosaurs, the Bible did not write about it but it don't not mean that they were not there.... keep an open mind when reading the Bible<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><br>You have a basic misunderstanding of scientific theories.

That is why it is a fairy tale.<br></span><br><br>ermm guess what no one has been able to attain the temperature of absolute zero by its very definition! all molecules freeze at that temp. any attempt to measure it just raises it. the value is calculated and theory at best. not physically proven to be the absolutely lowest temp. many scientists now doubts that the current absolute zero is actually the lowest point.<br><br>many laws in physics believe or not is not proven. eg. 2nd law of thermodynamics (can't remember exactly the number but this should be the one :lol<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>yes evolution is the standing principle now no doubt abt that. but creation is steming back all the way to the origin of big bang...... so guess creation theory is always abound because there has to be a start to everything.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> The problem is that rationale people are the ones with open minds. They are the ones who believes in facts. On the other hand, Christianity suggests that Faith is the one and only thing needed to see the "truth".

Christians believe in facts too (oh yes we do  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ). Faith is the ability to believe what we can not see. It brings us beyond what is seen. So no need to abandon all logic to have faith. btw faith is not based on Bible alone. It is also based on living in a Christian way, to love and care for others.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> You cannot just push everything away just because it is written long time ago. You mention that it is a book of "Divine" origin, and "divinely" inspired, yet you suggest otherwise. God should know better, and he has all the facts and numbers at hand, right?

The Bible is very much relevent. what I am saying is look beyond the words and study the context of it. and because it is of divine orgin, don't take it at face value. words can be misused in many ways. even the devil used the words in the scriptures (Bible) to mislead (say so in the Bible).  Look not on what some would say is "divine facts" but look at the "divine teaching" and it is very much still relevant (no time to quote examples  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  some other time maybe).<br><br>The personal experiences is personal faith experience of living the Christian life, of course with emotion (we are humans). But like I said it is difficult to explain. Everyone is different. But if you want an example look at Mother Teresa's life story.<br><br>sorry if I seemed to be preaching... but as much as possible let's try to share and not say who's correct or better. i believe that learning from one another is impt in life  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Think of it in another way - why would it NOT state the accurate figures? Will accurate figures actually harm us in anyway? Yet, the figures stated in the Bible and its explanations of the way life came to be is totally different from what we found out. Why put a number to be figurative? Why can't it be accurate? Is it necessary to put a figure and worse yet, make it inaccurate, thus resulting in modern man discovering that the figures are highly inaccurate? It doesn't help, in anyway, to strengthen the credibility and believes if inaccuracies are found in the Bible.<br><br>Figure of speech is a very ambiguious way to convey your message, it opens up many more questions, and doubts. When do we know if some idea is just a "figure of speech" and when is it the "Truth" to be taken as is? You cannot expect a rationale person to rate the document as being accurate when many of the text proved to be inaccurate. An ambigious document is made so that it is hard to or even impossible to prove it wrong. A good example is Nostradamus' prophecies. Also with such a highly "ambiguious" and "inaccurate" document, it is inevitable for rationale people to doubt it.<br><br>Your idea of Bible being written for all ages does not in anyway explain for its inaccuracies. Since it is for <strong>ALL</strong> ages, its statements should remain true for <strong>ALL</strong> ages as it implies. If u say that some parts are accurate only for the past ages, then when do we know which part is accurate for our age? The Bible, being <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Divine</span></strong> should have no problem of stating facts for <strong>ALL</strong> ages that it was written for, yet we find inaccurancies now.<br><br>What is your idea of an "open mind"? To believe anything even when they are beyond what can be explained? To believe even when proven otherwise?<br><br>As for the dinosaurs, did they live together with mankind? No. The Bible suggests that land animals and mankind were created on the same day, suggesting dinosaurs and mankind lived together in the same time era. Please tell me that you agree this cannot be true. (some people still arguing that dinosaurs do in fact lived with mankind <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) In fact, there are too many questions and inaccuracies I dont even know where to begin.<br></span><br><br>ermm guess what no one has been able to attain the temperature of absolute zero by its very definition! all molecules freeze at that temp. any attempt to measure it just raises it. the value is calculated and theory at best. not physically proven to be the absolutely lowest temp. many scientists now doubts that the current absolute zero is actually the lowest point.<br><br>many laws in physics believe or not is not proven. eg. 2nd law of thermodynamics (can't remember exactly the number but this should be the one :lol<br><br>yes evolution is the standing principle now no doubt abt that. but creation is steming back all the way to the origin of big bang...... so guess creation theory is always abound because there has to be a start to everything.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> Again, u are repeating yourself, so I shall repeat again: You have a basic misunderstanding of scientific theories. All science theories have a way to prove themselves. Many science theories (if not all) <strong>cannot be proven directly, but is proven indirectly. </strong><br><br>For the sake of all those who are reading this: the scientific Laws and Theories CANNOT be called "Laws" and "Theories" if they are not proven correct. Unproven ideas are called "Hypothesis", so please dont be mistaken. (This is an example of how Creationists try their best to confuse people who dont bother to find out.)<br><br>Also your comment on Creation is exactly that - there is no way to prove it right and no way to prove it wrong. Unlike scientific theories, it is <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">unfalsifiable</span></strong>. It is very much a <strong>belief</strong> system, with no facts to back it up. That is why it fails as a scientific theory, but thrives as a fairy tale to be glorified by its believers. In other words, you can call it a religion.<br></span><br><br>well believe it or not, faith and science don't clash. many prominant scientist are Christians too. Christians believe in facts too (oh yes we do  ). Faith is the ability to believe what we can not see. It brings us beyond what is seen. So no need to abandon all logic to have faith. btw faith is not based on Bible alone. It is also based on living in a Christian way, to love and care for others.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> It is true many scientists are christians. It is however <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">NOT</span></strong> true that the statements in the Bible do not contradict with what we know as facts. Faith is another thing altogether. As I have mentioned, faith is without proofs (not that it is necessary). So how can I (or likewise open-minded rationale people) be convinced that the Bible is accurate when there are obvious inaccuracies in it? Yet it claims to be "divine" and holds all truths, and Christianity relies heavily on it?<br></span><br><br>I am not pushing away anything. The Bible is very much relevent. what I am saying is look beyond the words and study the context of it. and because it is of divine orgin, don't take it at face value. words can be misused in many ways. even the devil used the words in the scriptures (Bible) to mislead (say so in the Bible). Look not on what some would say is "divine facts" but look at the "divine teaching" and it is very much still relevant (no time to quote examples  some other time maybe).<br><br>The personal experiences is personal faith experience of living the Christian life, of course with emotion (we are humans). But like I said it is difficult to explain. Everyone is different. But if you want an example look at Mother Teresa's life story.<br><br>sorry if I seemed to be preaching... but as much as possible let's try to share and not say who's correct or better. i believe that learning from one another is impt in life<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> How can words be misused in a divine document? It is divinely "inspired"!! Why would inaccuracies be placed in the first place? I am not saying that the Bible is purely a book of facts, but then it did suggest that it is "divine" and "accurate" and it holds all Truths, yet we have already seen inaccuracies and ambigious statements. If Bibilical "facts" are inaccurate, how do we know if its "teachings" cannot be just as inaccurate as well?<br><br>Like i said, if everything boils down to personal experience, then what do you say of other religions? They cant all be correct at the same time, isnt it?<br><br>I'm not trying to bash Christianity or anything, but I am very curious how some people can still believe in something when its accuracy is doubtful. If faith is all that is needed, then we wouldn't know if it is blind faith, or that our "faith" is correct. Everyone's faith is different, so everyone is correct?<br></span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everytime I see or hear someone that has animosity towards Christianity, I always tell them there are 2 solutions:<br><br>1) Approach it with an open mind and heart, and experience God's love for yourself. Your eyes will be open.<br><br>I have 2 Masters degrees and I would say I am fairly educated - up till today, I cannot find fault with the Bible. Read deeper and ponder on the Word of God - if possible, obtain the original Greek and Hebrew texts as they are the most accurate. If everything was so straightforward, then there would be no doubt, then there would be no basis of faith. Then how else could God give us free will, if everything was laid out for us so plainly? If you are hungry and seek the Word of God, your carnal eyes will be open. "Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you."<br><br>Don't worry about the details too much - grasp the foundations and understanding of Salvation first.<br><br>2) The only other real way would be to die and find out. It would be un-Christianlike for us to say "we told you so", that's why Christians are so fervent in getting the message across.</div>

Just anyhow write 4 quatrains and include all the possibilities, and make it ambiguous and prone to subjective interpretation.<br>In fact, WE SHOULD take the BIBLE's word AS IT IS! And not try to derive things which you think it means. Ofcourse we can do that, AND IT will INDEED provide us with good life values and philosophy just like any Shakespeare's literature, where what is stated inside can still be applied to modern life and social living.
