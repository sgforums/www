Emperor Nero's name kind of means very long (maybe meaning king of very long time).  That guy is the one going around killing a lot of Christians that time. Sorry I digress.<br><br>2) the bible is the word of God. yes. but you don't take everything literally from there. it's not a textbook or a story book. you read with the context of the chapter in mind. in the chapter of creation, Genesis, esp creation of the world, it's very figurative. There would most probably be a hugh part of Earth's history not mentioned (doesn't mean it does not exist. Bible is not a science or history textbook). Adam and Eve is the representation of us (you may or may not want to be included. lol.). We have turned away from God basically speaking and hence we are here. Our state is fallen, our being is divine (made from God). God try to save us and send His son to die for all (this is what the Bible saying).<br><br>3) btw if something is not proven or disproven, it is not a fairy tale. Eg. Absolute zero (is the lowest temperature that can achieved) is not a fairy tale.<br>Einstein's relativity is not a fairy tale. The theory of evolution of apes to human is not fairy tale even though the link is not proven. Understand this, science only seek to understand nature. Science is not nature itself.<br><br>4) The thing abt Jesus. You know you need some faith to keep an open mind to Christianity. Many ppl have been put off by Christians forcing their religion down ppl's throat. Turn more ppl away than to God. can argue till cows fly but if there is no tinge of faith.... very hard to believe.<br><br>Summary : Bible (the chapter within) is largely written in context of their time and one has to take into account the author. But because it is inspired by God ie God is the actually the editor, it is still very much still relavent. Christians know it by head (knowledge) and by heart (faith). Knowledge part can explain. Faith part diff to explain (based on personal experience).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
