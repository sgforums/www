            <div class='col-md body'>I have just finished reading this article on Times <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1176980,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1176980,00.html</a> and it just added and confirmed my fear on the effects of global warming. Doomsday clearly looms around our head and could strike at a time thatÂ’s likely to be within my lifetime. Earth is very ill and it's temperature is rising. Some countries are feeling the pain more than others but the pain, increasing yearly in magnitude and frequency, is surely spreading and reaching far and wide, high and low.<br><br>The symptoms are clear but yet some of us still deny it or ignore it because we simply cannot give up what is causing it. For the least to say, it is an addiction. It is possibly something we have taken too much and just want more of it until either it kills us or there is no more of it.<br><br>I asked "Can I give up my car, my air condition, my computer, my TV, my refrigerator and many other possessions that contributes to this sickness that Earth is having? Can I live happily without them or is it just a mindset of us since we were brought up in an economic world?"<br><br>I answered "It is very painful to gave up and I really don't know how else to be happy.

If I cannot give up, I will simply live a shorter life and die with many others during this doomsday?Â”<br><br>On further thought Â“Mother Earth would not be so kind as to just let me die a quick death.

Just like cancer therapies, not everyone will be able to take it and it can be totally ineffective or some say too late.<br><br>Even as countries throughout the world are accepting the fact that Earth is very ill, it seems that no country is still willing to take any medication at all. We merely deceive ourselves that we can just take less and less amount of Earth and then cross our finger that it will heal by herself. Believe me these is only what the very smart leaders (some of whom are geniuses) of the world can only come out with or simply is only willing to risk with their political careers!<br><br>But nonetheless, for the sake of myself and my families and loved ones, I am not giving up hope. If you feel that this article makes sense, do help to distribute it to people u know to create more awareness and push the leaders of the world to do much more before there is really no hope.<br></div>

Just like cancer therapies, not everyone will be able to take it and it can be totally ineffective or some say too late.<br><br>Even as countries throughout the world are accepting the fact that Earth is very ill, <span style="color: red;">it seems that no country is still willing to take any medication at all</span>. We merely deceive ourselves that we can just take less and less amount of Earth and then cross our finger that it will heal by herself. Believe me these is only what the very smart leaders (some of whom are geniuses) of the world can only come out with or simply is only willing to risk with their political careers!<br><br>But nonetheless, for the sake of myself and my families and loved ones, I am not giving up hope. If you feel that this article makes sense, do help to distribute it to people u know to create more awareness and push the leaders of the world to do much more before there is really no hope.<br></div></blockquote>I am very glad that you care about out Earth. I disagree with the red part. I bet you didn't know that there is a protocol which does help the reduce of emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, it is the Kyoto Protocol. Although we are taking steps to save the Earth, but it all seems too late.<br><br>Come here see, you'll understand better. Try spending some time watching the Discovery Channel and National Geographic Channel.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol</a><br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship</a></div>
