What you are talking about it's like terrorist mis-using religion as a tool to influence people. Love by itself, it is never evil nor corrupted, be it whether the world become modernized or whatever. Lust is basically primitive human instinct to reproduce - and because human are intelligent and emotional creature, our moral mind steps in - you don't screw any girl you want on the street, just because you want to, do you? Lust has nothing to do with love, except people misuse the name of love to achieve lust. So...Love is actually a victim isn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Pain and suffering from relationships through breakup has always been there since ancient time. People have been going through things since ages ago and things most likely won't change till the end of time. Learn to grow from it and work around it the wise way.<br>Nobody is the perfect mate and nobody has a perfect relation of pure love - their little difference and flaws draws and bond them together. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Don't be so negative in your view - because eventually you have to face such situations in your life. This is the real world - its important to still hold strong in what you believe, but more importantly, live and work around, in this world.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
