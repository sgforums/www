Before you know it, you are still at square 1 because your life revolves around the circle(migrating from places to places) unless you change your attitude towards singapore. No country is perfect<br><br>Let me give you another experiment. You put some rats inside a really huge box, so huge such that when the scientist put a bit of food at one corner. However none of the rats found the food  and all died.</div></blockquote>wow.. that's alot of assumptions + bad analogy =\<br><br>You speak of would-be migrants "changing attitudes towards Singapore", but have you considered that the reverse might apply as well?<br><br>Would-be migrants typically do years of research and preparation before deciding on which country they would like to migrate to.  Unlike what u've depicted, a migrant is not akin to a wandering nomad.  You seem to simply migrants are people with no loyalty, no desire to sink roots.  Well, while it might be true in some cases, I can tell you u've got the wrong idea in general (as with many others).<br><br>There are so many so-called less fortunate countries than Singapore, but many of my friends and I are aware that Singaporeans tend to feel less attached to our country than the citizens of these supposedly less-well-off countries.  So, why are things so different in Singapore? And what would compel some Singaporeans give up the advantage of being part of a majority race, to go to a place where they are the minority?    Think hard.<br><br>The thing is.. If certain pools of talent feel they are not appreciated/recognised for their contribution, and there is no room for personal/creative growth in their home country for example, how can you fault these groups of people if they find their ideal opportunity abroad?  No one said any country is perfect.  But you cannot expect everyone to fit into the same mould, either.<br><br>Every person has to live under different circumstances.. it is largely our experiences and personalities that define us as individuals, so let us all look at the bigger picture and respect each others' decisions in life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup agree with you wholeheartedly Spinsugar....<br><br>I did years of research to where I am finally going before I did my application. Now that I have one foot there, I still have to work hard and I do not have any delusions about it. The difference is that I have a circle of friends, business partners and best of all relatives over where I am going...<br><br>Also, are our forefathers to be treated as disloyal? They also left their homelands to come to sillypore to build a future...SO we are just doing what they did...following in their footsteps.<br><br>No one should be dissuaded from leaving sillypore and I will be the first one to encourage anyone who wants to leave, to leave...just as how FTs are coming here, I would certainly encourage as many FTs to come here as much as possible....think of it as a blood transfusion....<br><br>COming to sillypore may be a step up for certain people coming from 3rd world countries, so I do not begrudge them, just like how many of us are leaving for greener pastures.....greener pastures does not mean we have to work less hard....On the contrary, we have to work even harder but the benefits and rewards are even greater....as compared to sillypore</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun strongly agree with thaT Singapore as a small country will taste the effect of survival between local and foreign talents. No matter how this world revolves or changes we should also understand that this is our very own country singapore with it diversified race, culture and unique identity. No foreigners can merge perfectly into our multi racial society or even be more proficient in our very own establish working environment.</div>
