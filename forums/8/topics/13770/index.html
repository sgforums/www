            <div class='col-md body'>Just visited the new Fateha.com site. The same old incitements and rude nonsense are still there. Statements in brackets are my own thoughts.<br><br>For example<br><br>1) Osama is better Muslim than some of our Muslim leaders.(It was not spelt out which Muslim leaders thus could even be implying even the Mufti).<br><br>2) That there is no proof that 9/11 terrorists are Muslims. Therefore the world is at war with Islam for fabricating such lies. ( Implying that all none Muslims at at war with Islam?)<br><br>3) That our Muslims MPs are not leaders. (Thus implying Zulkifar is leader cos he was praised many times for daring to take on the goverment for the "discriminated" Muslims and representing them?)<br><br>4) That what Fateha.com is doing is for the sake of letting other races and religions in  Singapore understand Muslims better? ( I am a moderate and yet I felt incensed when I read the articles. That means understanding of Muslims as radical as Fateha.com. is it? If so, untold damage is done to fellow Muslim Singaporeans as They lumped all Muslims in Singapore is like them).<br><br>5) They cited one example of atrocities against Muslims are the rounding up of our local terrorists wannabe. ( So when ISD rounded up gangsters and criminals of other religions, Catholics as communists, are all right, but round up Muslims as suspects for planning to bomb Yishun MRT is an atrocity against Muslims? So if the bomb really exploded and killed people if the ISA had not rounded them up, what are we supposed to do? I really wonder if he is involved in that plot).<br><br>6) Local media especially the Straits Times are out against Muslims. So many articles there said so, so I can't be bothered to mention which one. Thus Fateha.com claim to represent the voices whom the Strait Times ignored. ( So are they representing the radicals against most Singaporeans?).<br><br>And lots more rubbish.................yet they cannot be ignored. In times like this, stirring up all this hatred, he should be arrested. Will Guantanamo Bay be good enuff for him?<br><br>In case you say he already left Fateha.com, most of those articles mentioned above are written by him which is on the site. The editorial board which still allows these articles are just abbetting and that leaves me to ponder that the resignation of the members were just a show.<br><br>My view is simple. Since Zul went overseas to wash our dirty linen and planning to bring in foreign lawyers  into our High Court to question our own National Constitution(what treason is worse than that?) thus shaming our sovereignty to foreigners with their own political motives, I consider this man and all he stands for as treachery. A Traitor! I trust and hope that our Muslims compatriots can see through this thinly disguised quest for power and fame by this man, at the risk of harming our hard earned peaceful coexistense. At the risk of our train stations be bombed. At the risk of bringing Singapore back to the days when we feared each other. Worse, at the risk of us killing one another!<br><br>But alas, some will be swayed     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">        <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> DuH<br><br>[This message has been edited by blurblop (edited 24 February 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by blurblop (edited 24 February 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by blurblop (edited 24 February 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by blurblop (edited 24 February 2002).]</div>

Even when their economy hiccupped, we are plunged into recession.<br><br>2) Do any one of us think we can close our sea routes as most countries will have to use our ports to pass thru Alantic and Pacific? If we close our seas to the US, what will become of us? Somalia?<br><br>3) Even when we are on friendly terms with the US, we are still an object for bully cos we are small red dot. Can one imagine if we have no big brother? Guess whose army will be breathing down our throat? People say we are the Jews of South East Asia, I think if we do not have big brother, we are more likely to be Palestinians to be hammered down.<br><br>4) As for the Palestinian cause, I somehow suspect that the ordinary Palestinians wants peace and are sick and tired of the war but for the interference of foreigners and radical elements. 9/11 was supposed to be a wake up call for the Palestinian cause, but who are the suspects and pepertraters? Hardly any Palestinians. Egyptians, Arabs, Paktistanis, Iranians....etc..     Israelis responded heavily everytime there was a suicide bomber or similar acts. Those were responses. You stop bombing I stop attacking. Jews die, Palestinians die. Who kills? Both sides. Both are guilty. We will do the same for our survival, won't we? I am not condoning violence. Then again, if violence on both sides were to stop.....but will that ever be possible cos they are fighting over a piece of land that are heritage of their ancestor. Jurrasic Park...oops...Jurasalem. Its a long long story...its a family quarrel. What can be worse than a family spat.<br><br>"Nations against nations, brothers against brothers....."  :Revelation.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> DuH<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by blurblop (edited 24 February 2002).]</div>

Therefore the world is at war with Islam for fabricating such lies. ( Implying that all none Muslims at at war with Islam?)<br><br>the proof wouldn't hold out in any impartial court, because the evidence is completely circustanstial. no one ever saw or heard what happened in the planes that hit NY WTC.<br><br>4) That what Fateha.com is doing is for the sake of letting other races and religions in  Singapore understand Muslims better?

Good thing is everything seem good and working out fine to you. Bad thing is you have no say. Not to offend you, so as a singaporean, whether it concern or don't concern you, are you sure you can chap or asked to chap? Do you have a say? Sorry, You don't, you are just a tiny little nobody if you haven't notices. Everything is controlled my friend. They anytime want pay rise, they will just rise. Need to ask you? They anytime want to arrest, they will arrest, need you to chap? What chokky is trying to infer here will be the true cultivated mentality of common singaporean and also probably what the government want the pple to do. You are just a tool to be used in singapore. Does a tool speak?? Think the government want you to concentrate working as a tool and also produce more little tools for them to use in the future in the mean time. Or else they have to import so many foreign tools in to help in the economic and still worry about the total defence in singapore.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 02 March 2002).]</div>
