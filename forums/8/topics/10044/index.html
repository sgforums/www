            <div class='col-md body'>Pirate attacks on Singapore ships more than doubled in the first nine months this year, in the worst escalation in piracy in the region in almost a decade.<br><br>According to the International Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Centre, 31 Singapore ships fell victim to piracy from January to September this year, compared to 15 during the corresponding period last year.<br><br>It also reported a sudden rise in piracy and armed attacks in Indonesia and the Straits of Malacca.<br><br>The increase was alarming, and called for increased vigilance.<br><br>We have not seen figures like this since 1991. We have asked the relevant authorities to step up patrols. We believe it is the same gang responsible for attacks in the area.<br><br>The area referred to is the part of the Malacca Straits between Singapore and Malacca.<br><br>From January to September 1991, there were 67 attacks in the Straits of Singapore, Straits of Malacca and Indonesia. This year, the figure shot up to 122.<br><br>Strict anti-piracy watches should be maintained when transiting these areas.<br><br>Indonesia remains the most piracy-prone country in the world.<br><br>The bureau also warned of pirate attacks being reported off the resort island of Bintan, a short ferry ride from Singapore.<br><br>Pirates have also become bolder and violent.<br><br>On Aug 29, shortly after leaving Singapore for Port Klang, Malaysia, the MV Tiger Bridge was boarded by parang-wielding pirates just off the coast of Malacca.<br><br>The captain of the container vessel, Mr Harbinder Singh, was attacked by a man in the alleyway.<br><br>Capt Singh was slashed on his left hand, and received five stitches.<br><br>The pirates made off with more than US$20,000 (S$34,800) in cash, jewellery and other valuables.<br><br>Earlier that month, the Master of a Taiwanese fishing ship, Shuenn Mann No 12, was killed by pirates 224 km north-east of Singapore. He died when gunmen dressed in military uniforms fired at the vessel. The pirate boat was disguised as an Indonesian naval ship.<br><br>Mr Choong said the authorities of different countries must work together to protect vessels from pirates.<br><br>Piracy is very profitable. They can take home US$20,000 to US$30,000 in just 15 minutes of work.<br><br>If pirates are protected by a certain country, it is not going to help. They all have to work together.<br><br>------------------<br>Don't blame me for being heartless if you are cruel to me in the first place</div>
