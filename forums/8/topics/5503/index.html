            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a very strange person, the hatred will remain within me. But if i ever meet that person somewhere sometime out there, the hatred will all dissolve when i recall back all the good times we had together.<br><br>To guys, getting cheated by their girlfriends for another guy will certainly dent their ego and hurt their feelings. But if they get deserted for another female..i bet it will certainly whip their ego.<br>Or in the opposite effect, they may think its not so bad afterall, she isnt leaving me for another guy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to feel really bad when I got cheated on...I don't know, maybe it has happened so many times that I kinda don't really mind anymore.<br><br>It bothers me, but it doesn't make me feel that I should punish her or hate her or the other person...When I was younger, yes...but now I guess I've learned how to handle it...and in the process, even learned to expect it in a way.  I guess that's why it doesn't bother me so much anymore.<br><br>If my GF left for a girl...hmmm...never happened before, but I doubt that I would be very angry...I might miss her and all that, and sad too,...but ultimately I think that if she's happy then go ahead...as long as I know she's happy.<br><br>Is it a jaded view of relationship?  Maybe.  i don't know....My ego would hurt more if she fell for a guy...and it would really hurt if she fell for a guy who didn't look better than me.:-p  a bit shallow I know.  If the guy looked really good, I might find it easier to accept.....Don't know why...maybe an inferiority complex hidden deep within my sub-conscious stemming from my geeky days...maybe. :-)  But I would have to know that he's tresting her well, or else I might go ballistic on the guy....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would be extremely upset and hurt.  I would severe the relationship without second thoughts.  It would be a severe blow to my ego if my girlfriend has been going out with another guy.  Worst still, if she is sleeping with another guy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If my gf left me for another guy, I would feel sad, disappointed, useless and maybe even angry and disillusioned.<br><br>I guess it's the feeling that some guy is better than you and he can "snatch" away your gf which makes me feel inferior. I might also attribute it to a lack of communication on our parts...but ptobably will not blame her inless she is the really flirty type.<br><br>Maybe that's why I am so apprehensive about going into a relationship...I once remarked :"If I never get a gf, I'll never have to experience the heartache of a breakup"....<br><br>What do you guys think ?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well my ex did it to me<br>had a fling with this other guy while i was studying and one fine day while i was telling her i love her the story came out<br>EX: "I don't like to keep secrets from you....u knoe that....but i met this other guy...."<br>MAd: "-lying thru my teeth- its ok love...i understand...did u have fun while you were out with him?"<br>and the story goes on...in the end she was left crying and i was left consolong for her treacherous act. I wasn't angry, more like resentful of the fact that the girl i swore i would be honest and decent to cheated on me. she told me that she did not enjoy being in that guys company and had been actively going out with him for two weeks before boredom and  guilt ate her up. I never forgave her for that but at that moment, for that brief moment i actually believed all her bullshit.<br><br>we broke up on Valentines day a few months later. the one special day in her calender she set aside for love <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey, seems like musicwhiz is the only one who will bother to address your side of problem and not just let go of the relationship thinking that the other guy is better than yourself...<br><br>from a girl's point of view, there must be some problem inherent in the relationship that prompted the girl to want to seek solace elsewhere...<br><br>it's a pity if u just give up like that without trying to find out the real reason, maybe that's why u keep making the same mistake and driving away every of your new gf...<br><br>mm.....but i have this funny mentality as well that it's less treacherous to leave a guy for another woman than to leave for another man, cos' it shows that the problem doesn't lie with the bf, but with the girl herself...<br><br>what do u guys think?</div>
