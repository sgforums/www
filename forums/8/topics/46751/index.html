            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I am going to attempt to explain this movie.<br>There are some very important scenes, forst off is the meeting with the Oracle.<br><br>The Oracle asks Neo if he sees Trinity die, and he says no, the Oracle says Time no longer has control over you. Meaning Neo is more or less a prophet, he can see the past, and future which is why he sees the whole scene with Trinity from the ending. He asks why he cannot tell what happens to Trinity, and the Oracle explains that he cannot see his choices he makes until he understands why he made them. This means he cannot see himself save Trinity from falling because in his mind he has yet to make the choice to save her.<br><br>Second was the scene with the maker of the Matrix, which is probably the most important scene. The maker explains that the Matrix is older then everyone thinks. (I believe the current version is around 100 years old. Which is why Morpheus says they have been battling the machines for 100 years.) He then explains that everything that has happened up to this point is all a way to control Neo, the entire Prophecy is false.<br>Basically, they can control the people in the Matrix because of the Matrix, they have control of the world around everyone. They however do not have control over Neo, so they made the Oracle, the keymaker, everything to lead him to the point he is at now. It was all the way they controlled him. I also believe the counceler guy knew this and was trying to explain it to him in the scene in Zions machine room.<br><br>The maker also explains that the way the matrix is able to get 99.9% of everyone to accept it is by giving them a choice of whether they want to accept it or not. The .01% of people who dont accept it are in Zion, once Zion builds to a breaking point and the people want to rebel, they destroy it and the cycle starts over again. Which is what happened with the previous "The One"s. Neo however is different because of Trinity and the deal with her going to die, and he has broken the cycle by choosing the other door. Now the machines are going to destroy Zion and the matrix, but at the end of the show Neo stated Zion would be destroyed in 24 hours. I am assuming they would destroy the Matrix next.<br>ZION has NOT been destroyed at the end of the movie like alot of people think, actually they say that a group of 5 ships were sent out to make a pre emptive strike that failed, and the only survivor is Bane.<br><br>The only thing I cannot explain is how Neo stopped the machines at the end, it wasnt by the same power he has in the Matrix, or he would not have been hurt and in a coma, I believe it is because there is another plan set in motion by the machines, and Neo knows in order for this to work he cannot be killed. Which is why the machines were stopped after hurting him, but not killing him. This also could be to do with the maker saying Neo carried part of the code that is needed to restart the source of the Matrix.<br>This is the best explanation of things I have come up with so far.<br>Enjoy!</div>
