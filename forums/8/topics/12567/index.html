But if i'm not wrong, he never outright said that the one meant the other, as in "if u dun vote me, u won't get upgrading".<br><br>His strategies are not for me to judge. Every election, the ruling party will come up with ways to try to gardner votes. The last elections was upgrading. This time it's s'pore shares.<br><br>I look at it from a different perspective. It's not wat they offer me, it's wat they have already accomplished. If they say they were going to improve living conditions, then i'll just have to look back since the last election. A quick glance will satisfy me.<br><br>Remember, just becoz they offer s'pore shares or other gimmicks doesn't mean u are inclined to vote for them. There is no such obligation. The vote's in ur hands. U decide who u want.<br><br>When u communicate, u dun have to include vulgarities to get the msg across. Coherent language will do. Ppl respect others who can clarify a point without raising their voice or swearing.<br><br>"As for PAP, I'd rather live in a slum than to vote for them. Please Think carefully before you vote, be a man with principle. If you insist to be with them, I have really nothing to say. "<br><br>U sound disappointed. If a person has done a good job for his town council and helped his constituency, then the vote's as good as confirmed. It doesn't matter be it opposition or ruling party. In fact the party's rally is just a formality to me. U're definitely wrong to say voting a party of choice denounces someone as one without principle.<br><br>So does that mean as long it's PAP, voting them means one has no principle watsoever?<br><br></div>
