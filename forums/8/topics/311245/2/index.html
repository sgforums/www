              <p>I think i can roughly understand why you need examples but anyway, I can give you a few. It depends greatly on the type of girl you are dating.</p>
              <p>Type A:</p>
              <p>Eat anything also can, from hawker to fast food to food court (2 meals, drinks not inculded, approx $7). Plus watch movie($9.50 per ticket so $19 for 2) then la kopi at Starbucks/Coffee Bean(2 drinks plus 1 cake, approx $15). For a typical date like this on a single weekend will cost around $41. Sunday not inclusive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Type B:</p>
              <p>Bane of wallet. Eat cheap restaurant (Olio Dome/NYDC/Breeks, approx $55) only. Nite spot hangout such as pub/disco/wine place (assuming she can't drink much, approx $60). Send her home on taxi (plus going home yourself approx &gt; $25). For a typical date like this on a single weekend will cost around $140. Sunday not inclusive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Type C:</p>
              <p>Destroyer of wallet. Eat restaurant (other types of more ex restaurants, approx $80+++) only. Nite spot hangout such as pub/disco/wine place (assuming she drinks alot, approx $100++). Send her home on taxi (plus going home yourself approx &gt; $25). For a typical date like this on a single weekend will cost around $205+++. Sunday not inclusive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Type D</p>
              <p>Cook own food at each other's place (ingredent's cost approx $20), watch DVDs (depends if rent or download.), send her home (depends if last bus for ur own return trip is available, if not then approx $15). For a typical date like this on a single weekend will cost around $35+. Sunday not inclusive.</p>
              <p>Type E</p>
              <p>She pays for everything.</p>
              <p>Type F</p>
              <p>She pays half.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do note the above figures are variable and subjected to changes without prior notice. Meaning it can be cheaper one. All figures are approximated with buffer. </p>
              <p>So you see, it really depends on what kind of girl you are dating and wat you 2 are doing. I had tried out the above so I can tell you, but in the 1st place, no one told me such things. So IMHO, you should try it out. At least next time when someone ask u for advice, you can share share. Anyway since you young, it is always good to experience it. But make sure it is not a huge burden for you like Type B and C and dun make a type E out of her. All the best and good luck.</p>

              <p>So you see, it really depends on what kind of girl you are dating and wat you 2 are doing. I had tried out the above so I can tell you, but in the 1st place, no one told me such things. So IMHO, you should try it out. At least next time when someone ask u for advice, you can share share. Anyway since you young, it is always good to experience it. But make sure it is not a huge burden for you like Type B and C and dun make a type E out of her. All the best and good luck.</p>

              <p><br>Sometimes I pay, sometimes she pay, sometimes we go dutch</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sometimes hawker food, sometimes just finger food and snacks, sometimes high class restuarant, sometimes buffet</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for me a major saver is that we both don't drink(as in alcohol) and we almsot never order beverages when we eat out...after our meal we go Cheers or 7-eleven buy fruit juice</p>

              <p>if you're still in school and gettin' pocket money from your parents, please don't bother to get/have a gf.</p>
              <p>you're actually spending your parents' money on a r/s that only has a 0.5% of working out and advancing into future plans like marriage. This is what I call puppy love or infatuation.</p>
              <p>I wonder why kids will have the heart and conscience to spend their parents' money on their gfs. Work and earn your own money, being able to support yourself before considering going into a r/s luh.</p>

              <p><br>Totally agree. But the guy must always remember to pamper the gal. Eh... so far the most severe punishment I had for her is tickle until her tears come out... haaa!! </p>
