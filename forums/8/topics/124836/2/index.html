He said the Pope was still speaking as of Friday night.<br><br>Gave thanks<br><br>"Mass was celebrated at 7:30 this morning in the presence of the Pope," although the pontiff did not concelebrate the rite, the spokesman said.<br><br>"Sometimes it seems as if he were resting with his eyes closed, but when you speak to him, he opens his eyes," he said.<br><br>The Vatican's press office was scheduled to remain open all night for a second night.<br><br>Navarro-Valls said aides had told the Pope that thousands of young people were in St. Peter's Square on Friday evening.<br><br>"In fact, he seemed to be referring to them when, in his words, and repeated several times, he seemed to have said the following sentence: 'I have looked for you. Now you have come to me. And I thank you'," the spokesman said.<br><br>John Paul "gave some sign of recognizing people," Cardinal Achille Silvestrini was quoted as saying by the Italian news agency Ansa after paying a call on the Pope with Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran.<br><br>Very grave<br><br>For the second straight day, the Vatican announced a series of papal appointments, including a Spanish bishop, an official of the Armenian Catholic Church and ambassadors to El Salvador and Panama.<br><br>But John Paul's overall condition, which has rapidly deteriorated since Thursday, remained unchanged and very serious, the Vatican said.<br><br>"The general cardio-respiratory and metabolic conditions are substantially unvaried and therefore very grave. Since dawn this morning, there have been first signs that consciousness is being affected," Navarro-Valls said.<br><br>One of the Pope's closest aides, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, was quoted Saturday as saying that when he saw the pontiff on Friday morning, John Paul was "aware that he is passing to the Lord."<br><br>The Pope "gave me the final farewell," the news agency of the Italian bishops conference quoted the German cardinal as saying Friday night.<br><br>Preparation<br><br>Tourists and pilgrims streamed anew into St. Peter's Square Saturday.<br><br>Around the world, priests readied Roman Catholics for the Pope's passing. Many expressed hope that his final hours would be peaceful.<br><br>"Now he prepares to meet the Lord," Cardinal Francis George said at a Mass in Chicago on Friday. "As the portals of death open for him, as they will for each of us, we must accompany him with our own prayers."<br><br>A workman in the square, declining to give his name, told The Associated Press that crews were taking down the canopy on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica, which had covered an altar during Easter Sunday Mass, because they had orders to clear the space for when the Pope's coffin eventually is carried into the square.<br><br>In a sign of the Pope's decline, several cardinals from the United States and Latin America said they were heading to Rome.<br><br>After the official mourning period following the death of a Pope, cardinals hold a secret vote in the Sistine Chapel to choose a successor.<br><br>The Il Secolo XIX newspaper of Genoa reported that the Pope, with the help of his private secretary Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, wrote a note to his aides urging them not to weep for him.<br><br>Fearless<br><br>"I am happy, and you should be as well," the note reportedly said. "Let us pray together with joy."<br><br>This remained unconfirmed, however.<br><br>Cardinal Javier Lozano Barragan, head of the Vatican's health care office, told Mexico's Televisa dal Vaticano that the Pope "is about to die."<br><br>"I talked to the doctors and they told me there is no more hope," the Mexican cardinal told the television channel.<br><br>As word of his deteriorating condition spread across the globe, special masses celebrated the pope for transforming the Roman Catholic Church during his 26-year papacy and for his example in fearlessly confronting death.<br><br>His papacy has been marked by its call to value the aged and to respect the sick, subjects the pope has turned to as he battles Parkinson's disease and crippling knee and hip ailments.<br><br>The Pope's health declined sharply Thursday when he developed a high fever brought on by an infection. The Pope suffered septic shock and heart problems during treatment for the infection, the Vatican said.<br><br>Appeal<br><br>Septic shock involves both bacteria in the blood and a consequent over-relaxing of the blood vessels. The vessels, which are normally narrow and taut, get floppy in reaction to the bacteria and can't sustain any pressure.<br><br>That loss of blood pressure is catastrophic, making the heart work hard to compensate for the collapse.<br><br>Dr. Gianni Angelini, a professor of cardiac surgery at Bristol University in England, said the chances of an elderly person in John Paul's condition surviving septic shock more than 48 hours was no more than 20 percent, "but that would be in an intensive care unit with very aggressive treatment."<br><br>The first non-Italian Pope in centuries, John Paul had a manner that made people around the world think of him as their own.<br><br>Even non-Catholics embraced John Paul, crediting him for ending wars, spreading democracy and combating religious animosity. He transformed the papacy from an arbiter of religious doctrine to a global advocate for peace, understanding and responsibility. (AP)<br>[/b]</div>

"As of dawn this morning [Vatican time], the start of a compromised state of consciousness was observed."<br>AdvertisementAdvertisement<br><br>He said aides had told the Pope that thousands of young people were in St Peter's Square.<br><br>"In fact, he seemed to be referring to them when, in his words, and repeated several times, he seemed to have said the following sentence: 'I have looked for you. Now you have come to me. And I thank you.' "<br><br>Dr Navarro-Valls said the Pope's general condition was "very serious" but unchanged.<br><br>The Pope was fully conscious yesterday morning, continuing to play a significant role while at the same time serenely accepting his fate. The Pope celebrated mass at 6am. At 7.15am, "remembering that it was Friday", the suffering pontiff asked to be read the Fourteen Stations of the Cross, the story of Christ's passion and death, "making the sign of the cross at each Station", he said.<br><br>World leaders have paid tribute to the Polish-born Pontiff, the first non-Italian Pope in 450 years, citing his central role in the spread of democracy in eastern Europe and his steadfast upholding of the church's teachings on morality.<br><br>Prime Minister John Howard said he should be remembered both as a freedom fighter against communism and a great Christian leader.<br><br>Mr Howard said he had been an inspiring leader and would also be remembered as a person who helped lead the fight for freedom, which led to the fall of the Berlin Wall.<br><br>Earlier, church officials made it clear the Pope had entered the final hours of his papacy, which started in 1978.<br><br>"It looks as though these may be his last hours," said Cardinal Wilfred Napier of Durban, South Africa.<br><br>More than 60 cardinals, including Sydney's George Pell, were expected to fly into Rome for the Pope's funeral and the secret conclave that will elect his successor.<br><br>The next Pope will be chosen by the 117 cardinals under 80 years old.<br><br>The conclave to elect his successor will begin between 15 and 20 days after his death. Early speculation in Rome suggests either an Italian or Latin American will emerge as the next Pope.<br><br>However, some churchmen believe the developing world should provide the next Pope as that is where the religion is most vibrant. Nearly half of all Catholics are in Latin America.<br><br>Three-quarters of the cardinals eligible to elect the next Pope do not live in Rome.<br><br>At St Mary's Cathedral, local Catholics gathered throughout the day to pray for the Pontiff's health and soul.<br><br>Auxiliary Bishop Julian Porteous said the loss of the Pope would be felt hardest by those who had grown up during his leadership of the church.<br><br>"Young people will acutely feel it because he is the only Pope that they have ever known," he said.<br><br>Philippa Sikulu said the church would miss him very much.<br><br>"He could speak so many languages and he travelled so far - we were so fortunate to have such a wonderful Pope."<br><br>Pre-written church rules say the pontiff's mourning rites will last nine days and his body is likely to be laid to rest in the crypt under St Peter's Basilica.<br><br>�The church was conducting business as usual on Friday, with the Vatican press service announcing nominations of bishops and apostolic nuncios, the last to be approved by the Pope.<br><br>British Labour party strategists have acknowledged that the Pope's death might prompt Prime Minister Tony Blair to postpone his plan to call a general election on Monday.<br><br>China, which suspended ties with the Vatican in 1951, sent a message to the Vatican which said the country hoped the Pope would recover soon.<br><br>Irish primate Archbishop Sean Brady said: "I ask Catholics to continue to pray fervently . . . that he may be united ever more closely with Jesus in his suffering."</div>
