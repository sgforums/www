Most Protestants don't.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Look, the only reason im kinda glad he's passed on is because he was so sick and probably in a bit of suffering. Otherwise, even though im no christian, I think he deserves respect, especially from some of the lesser examples of xtians we've seen in here so far. it's not about religon now. it's about your basic humanity.</strong></blockquote>Yeah, it's good that he passed on because he had been sick for awhile.  Does he deserve respect as a human being for some of the work he has done?  Sure, but some are just expecting too respect from people who don't really care for the guy's position.  People just seem to care about his position more than they do the guy.  Why isn't there such a big fuss when a 'lesser' priest dies?</div>
