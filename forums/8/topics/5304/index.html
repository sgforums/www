            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, that's a really difficult one Luf...<br><br>i was in a long relationship with a muslim girl before(my X...*sigh*), and the subject did come up...but it was never resolved...<br><br>My thinkg has always been that I'm not willing to convert to any religion for another person...It has nothing to do with ego or what, but more to do with the fact that no matter what i am, she should be able to accept me for it...By having me change my religion, she basically is asking me to say that what i believe is useless and is not respected...by changing my religion, I basically change everything that I believe in and everything I've built my character upon...In most cases, religion plays a big part in how people grow up and become who they are...to change it is to deny urself and to become someone ur not...<br><br>I don't mind what religion my wife is...as long as she isn't a fanatic..*shivers)...scary...<br><br>Why can't we just marry the way we are..?   why must we convert or change...I thought that love was the most important thing?  If you could get along fine or perfectly before marriage, why must it change in any way...unless it's to please the family...correct?<br><br>I will never ask anyone to change to my religion or belief and I expect the same...Changing would go against everything that a person is...and to change only for marriage would be a sham at most...so what's the reason for it...u would only make a mockery of it if u have no feeling for it.<br><br>Do I believe in inter-religious inter-racial inter-cultural marriages?  Yes i do...if ur both willing to work for it then it's possible...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firewire,<br>I agreed with what you had posted. Religion had been part of our life for a long, perhaps even since the day we were born. We had been brought up with that belief, and if we were to change it, there might be some form of guilt. If you were to change your religion willingly due to changes in your belief, it's still acceptable, but definitely not for marriage.<br><br>I also believe in inter-religion marriages, if both parties are willing to accept the other for who they are, they should also accept their belief. Family members might not be able to accept, but the most important factor would be the couple involved.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Luf (edited 28-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very iffy, my comments will be too drawn out, word of advice? "Follow the river and follow your heart"<br><br>Ko Kid, I was just wondering why you said "U can convert her... but i suggest dun let her convert u.." How does that make sense? Why can't she convert him if he can convert her? What gives him (whoever he is) the right to convert her (whoever she is) in the first place? How is this fair to her? I find that your remark has no proper basis. Would you like to prove otherwise?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>convert? nah.. well i haven't met anyone dat with such an influence on my life yet, anyway..<br><br>but jus to speak i think in singapore we really need to go further and bend the rules a bit for tolerance's sake<br><br>religions are meant to give us some sense of identity as well as for our personal/spiritual? well-being, and i personally think 'requesting/persuading' others to abandon their old religions/way of thinking for a new one isn't really very correct, especially when each religion has it's plus points..<br><br>if one day some new and popular religion comes up, but with just ONE extreme clause like 'u must not associate with relatives/friends not of (some) religion' or something like dat, would anyone comply?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO, i dont thk anyone shld be "forced" to be converted because of his/her SO. i find it very shallow and hypocritical, how can you ask someone to convert to a religion he/she doesnt believe in? what's the pt? what's the use of "belonging" to a religion when you dont even believe in it? if i ever get into a relationship where religion will be an issue, it's ok by me as long as he doesnt insist tt i convert. if he demands tt i do, then i'll break.... if he's tt "right" for me, shldnt he understand and respect my views?<br><br>and Ko Kid: "U can convert her... but i suggest dun let her convert u.. " ahem. perhaps you'll like to justify this comment?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a bit curious here. Does different religion mean something like Islam and Christianity or would you include Any religion with no religion?<br><br>I guess ideally it would cause no problem. Hopefully the two different religion don't clash, and neither would have to change. I'll venture to say that so long as you can live together without bending the rules of your own religion, or are not so serious about the religion to be totally incapable of tolerating any other way of doing things, then you should be all right.<br><br>The possible problems of a couple with different religion might be different way of facing problems that will come their way, but I can't give examples of that. I'll use the old line that all religion make people better people. So, for this part, if you can tolerate minor changes to lifestyle, I don't see any problems with different religions.<br><br>Then, there is the problem of the social network behind the 2 people, because if marriage is not only between 2 people, its between 2 families. I would love to say that love is between me and my honey, but I think I can't escape that my parents, relatives and friends to a certain extent, are involved as well. Still, if the 2 religions are not that different, e.g. the ones that are having wars against each other, it should be all right.</div>
