The current MRT station makes such an idea unfeasible, and furthermore barriers can only prevent accidents from happening, whereas the example you gave was not an accident.

            <div class='col-md body'>i think that it cannot solve the problem of sucide but however , can at least stop the delay and reduces 'publicity' of the sucide event. also , public will feel better if they are confident of the fact that they wont see a dead body lying on the track while at the paltform. the main thing is the publicity issue. also, children like to play on the platform will also be safer. a more 'normal' way of commiting sucide doesnt generate that much publicity i guess. and seriously , there is a need to stop of these sucide things(we dont wanna end up like japan, being first in world for sucide rate).. and that can be done through education. anyway.. how can someone as poor as that guy goes unnoticed ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why ask the govt to spoon-feed us again. Suiciding on the MRT track is just the same as dashing across a busy street on the road. If you want to SMRT to install barriers to the above ground MRT stations, might as well ask the LTA to put barriers on all sidewalk along the road. Danger is something that we should avoid ourselves on our part, not push all responsibility to some governing body for us to complain to.</div>
