All the ISP logs all the places that we visit and attaches them to the dynamic IP you are assigned to at that particular time. It is only whether the ISP wants to check up on you.

They dun wanna waste time. =) )<br><br>One word for them.<br>Stupid.<br><br>Dun act clever when you dunno anything lah...<br>A moment of foolishness will set you back for your entire life.<br><br>------------------<br>The Prince Of Death...<br>______________<br>| |Ã” NiVleK Ã” | |</div>

Dun have to catch them mah for such a harmless prank... juz keep a tag on him-and his friends- so that if he really does something nasty both he and his accomplices could be nabbed...<br><br>Actually I dont think the future of these punks are completely ruined, i'd like to have them work as full time security personnel for.... whatever IT companies... especially internet based companies like ISPs hehe, provided they dont become rotten fuc tups again...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Too bad they are the first to be caught doing this. TCS will want to apprehend this foolish teen offenders and make them an example to all other "hackers" out there.<br><br>Like what I said. They do not know much about hacking. There is a vast difference between hacking, cracking and playing pranks.<br>They belong to the category of playing pranks. If I were a internet security company, I wouldnt be so stupid as to employ kids with just miniumum knowlwdge of the internet world.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, once the hacking incident is reported, it is beyond TCS, MCS or MCI to charge the offender.  The police(Computer Crimes Division) will take it from there and it is up to the DPP (deputy public prosecutor) to prosecute liao.<br><br>But I believe that he deserved it because if they aren't tough on hackers (be it pranksters or melicious hackers), it wouldn't be a detterrant anymore and people would see it as petty crime whereas security, privacy and money are at stake.<br><br>Imagine if someone hacked into Singtel and disabled all the internet accounts...no one would be able to surf and losses could amount to the billions.
