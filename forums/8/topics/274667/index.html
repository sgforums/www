But as far as those richie that had dated me, I gathered that they live in their own society, very bossing, wanted to control peoples and fail in many ways to understand those poorer than them.<br><br>My grandma used to told me, being a rich man wife or gf is the worst lot of all, because she cannot say much, nor will she know where her bf or husband is, and in cold, she will cry alone as bf or husband is rich and easily fall prey or preyed on other gals. So what if this rich wives or gfs are given cars, house, credit cards, maid and cash, they still cannot find a truly owned man they love.<br>Everyday worry.<br><br>So, if u ask me if i will go for a rich boy, sorry. no, because the character simply dun gel and in the end, i may get hurt. So, I rather be with ah beng, jackie, ah seng, ahmad, Raja and Robert then with some rich guys, because with rich boys, i feel uneasy, no freedom and somewhat like being controlled.<br><br></div>
