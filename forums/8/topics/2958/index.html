JUST DO IT !!!<br><br>PS: Do it only if U really think its worth doing it. Remember ... U are doing it for urself &amp; not others.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't think of anything other than clarifying things. But do that in a not too straight and intimidating manner.<br><br>Here's why: From what you said, I don't feel that you are that close to the guy yet. Even though you used bf, which I assume to be boyfriend, you said you think he likes you too, which means that if there is a relationship, it is in the early stages.<br><br>Now, 2 things are happening. The first is that the initial excitement might be cooling down, because you said the conversation is getting boring. Secondly, he has shown some interest in that other girl.<br><br>So, my opinion is at this stage when nothing is confirmed he might be looking for someone else. Which is why I suggest if you are comfortable, try to clarify things. The reason that I say don't be too straight forward and intimidating is because I don't perceive you two as being a couple yet, so talking about serious stuff like this might actually scare him off by moving things along quickly. So asking something like "are you interested in that girl" instead of "are you breaking up with me" might be more appropriate. I think keeping quiet doesn't help.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 18-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Worm: I actually think that if he said that in the first week, its too fast. This is my personal view, because its inconceivable to me that a real relationship can proceed to that stage in one week. So, I'm sorry to say that I think it sounds like a rash promise which felt sincere at the moment but has little hope of being kept.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just wondering, how old r u and ur bf? i mean if both of u are still young (teenagers), then i think u should not take the fact that he has everything planned (i.e. getting married and migrating) too seriously. But maybe if u both are already in your 20s, then who knows??<br><br>I think the best way is for u both to act more like couples, so u should just offer to go with him to buy the christmas present for that gal (if u can get out of the house) and give the present to the girl in both your names. If u can't get out, just tell ur bf that u want to share the present as well &amp; ask him to include your name as well...won't this make it obvious to both your bf that u and him are supposed to be together, and at the same time, won't give the other girl funny ideas about your guy.<br><br>Hope this is helpful!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>of all the advice here so far, i would say that sparkle's is really the most practical and most likely to succeed... guys (our age), especially if they're a.gdlooking, b.charming, c.flirtatious, d. all of the above, do this all the time. probably due to the fact that other girls are more attracted to them, regardless of whether they're attached or not. but the main thing is, you gotta trust your bf. does he do this all the time? if he does, then relax, since it's probably just this habit of his to chk out girls all the time. but if you're not ok with him, TELL HIM! say you're sick of him forever talking about other girls, do the same back and see how he reacts. if he dares to say anything, then qn him about his own behaviour. if this is the first time, just tell him you feel kinda hurt that he keeps talking about this girl (if you really cannot bear it anymore), or goss about her with him, ie discuss about her, rave about her with him, but keep on using WE/US etc. to emphasise the fact that regardless of how fantastic the girl is, he's still with you.</div>
