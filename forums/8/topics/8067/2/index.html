I did not put an equal sign to it..ok?   I am piss off by you too..Revelations.

For someone as lowdown as you who has no respect for other people's privacy, I guess what you did is right huh???<br>And of course, all forumites are idiots here to you right Zeta??? They don't know which Lex you are referring to, so rest of the forumites here, sorry, someone here is questioning your intelligence.<br>As to who has the right and who doesn't, sorry, I am not a lawyer, I am not well versed in all these, unlike you Zeta charlatan dear. But what I do know is, those pictures are meant for a private page, and if the person in issue wanted to let every of the forumites see her, she will do so herself and not let some nosey parkers do it for her.<br>And why, Zeta, thanks for your compliments about my nick. Didn't know you held it at such high regards, even though I must say that some comments made about my nick is irresistably corny (just my humble thought, no offence, bah). And why, how did you know I like Flintstones cartoons??? In fact, the new Flintstones movie is going to be out soon, I suppose I will be watching it to develop my new found interest.<br>And wait a minute, why am I in the spotlight??? The spotlight should be on you Zeta, on what a kind soul you are to share what you have with the rest of the forumites, splendid you are. So if Revelations mean old fashioned, *cough cough, wipe away the cobwebs*, then what do you suppose Zeta mean??? Breach of trust, unworthy of respect, hmm.....do help me here Zeta, I am indeed running out of proper adjectives to describe you.

You want to know who I am??? Zeta, heard that??? Reveal Revelations, now, that is a nice name. OK, I do have my pictures online somewhere, go find it and post a thread on it, that is a challenge, since you are so smart and I am so dumb. And how do you know I have no idea where to get those pics from??? That is weird, because I feel dumber and dumber by the minute. Well, for one thing for sure, at least I respect other people's privacy and do not have fun at their expense. Other forumites here can agree with me, can choose not to agree with me, I don't know, but for such a thing to happen, especially to a nice lady, it is totally uncalled for. Wanna know the lady??? Email her, ICQ her, call her, go for outings, umpteen ways of doing it, and since so many forumites are keen on doing so, they definitely don't need your help here. Or are you suggesting that they are running out of ideas???<br>Hmm.....Hugo teaching me the rule of the game. Wow. The rule of the game I think here is, respect other people's privacy. Be a gentleman, and not a jerk. I am not out for personal attacks here Hugo, do not misunderstand me. I am just trying to put across the message here that if you condone such actions, it speaks a lot about you. I think "Let's Reveal Revelations" is a good idea too, will be looking forward to it. By the way, I think I am sticking out like a sore thumb already, and I think I'm the only one making so much noise about it, how nosey of me. But at least one thing for sure, I don't think I am nosey in the wrong way. If this is how the forum is going to be degraded, well, it is just sad.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>
