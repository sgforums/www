            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Zeta,<br>Your effort at brightening up this forum with your niffy pictures is commendable. However, I wish to point out the legal implications of your actions. True, anything on the web is for public consumption. However, posting materials which clearly have a copyright imprinted on it is ILLEGAL. Do you have the permission of the authors involved to paste this pictures??? Are they yours??? Was they passed to you???<br>Whatever the source of the pictures, the owner has identified them as her own work and has demanded that they be taken down.<br><br>This is for the administrators of this forum, since those pictures are identified by the author involved, i suggest you take down this thread before you get yourself into legal implications.<br><br>I may not know the law and it's intricate working, especially as regards to this new field of privacy on the net. However, i do know several laws are in place safeguarding the privacy of individuals as well as the copyrights. Zeta can choose to ignore the warnings given and the Administrators of this forum can let the thread run on. We shall see what happen 14 days later.<br>Good day guys.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

Not when such things are happening....I want to wish I did not see any of these happening....but no no...my eyes just can't deny them.<br><br>Today is a sad day, it is sad to know that people can actually think that they : -<br><br>1) did not infringe on any law even though they did.<br>2) offended many even though they thought they are funny.<br>3) step on my friends toes and so they step on my.<br><br>You might be thinking that I am taking this personally and let me tell you...yes you 2 MORON...I am taking this Personally!<br><br><blockquote>Rev : You are dead wrong. If everybody try to remain anonymous and be secretive, then what are those clubbig and outing for ?</blockquote>To hell with you young punks, what do you know about privacy? To go out with people and club and pub does not mean that a person does not respect the right to privacy or that a person would not prefer to have privacy. Put it this way, (And I am trying to be polite here.) If you think that your comparison about going to pubs together and what nots is a good arguement....I sure hope you can see the middle finger I am showing you right now. And I think you better go back to school before you even want to argue with me that your point is valid....and yes, to give you back some credit at my own expenses...FUCK YOU!<br><br><blockquote>Ask yourself why you pic is not posted here is because you did not publicise it. And if others do, you have no right to stop someone else from posting any pic here.</blockquote>Fuck you again idiot. You have no right to publicise anything which is an intellectual property of anyone without the verbal or written permission of the original owner if the property according to the Intellectual properties rights and Patent Act under the Singapore Legistation. And yes, you are in deep shit if Tet would like to sue you for infriging on her intellectual property, which in this case is in effect. Then I would say good luck to you. You better get ready to have any of your property to be transfer to your next of kin. for she not only can sue you for infrignment of copyright. she can sue you for misuse and defamation of intellectual property, for defamation of a person with bad intent. you will be paying for all the legal charges that is used in the law suit....liable to any damages she claims to have suffered from these offences, and most of all basically since you are an individual, you are not a corporation or business, she can sue your pants of you, you have no money yo pay, you sell your house, you still have no money to pay, you will be declared a bankrupt, and if you die, good luck to your NOK(next of kin) he/she will bear this debt for the rest of his/her life, and if he/she dies, their decesndant will bear it, and so on and so forth. I know what I am tlaking about, but do you understand at all? I suppose you dun know the shit you are getting yourself into else you would never have done anything like that in the first place.<br><br><blockquote>ZETA... remove my work now. Within 14 days legal notice as according to singapore laws, I urge you to remove the content or I will take legal action against you. Please keep a look out in your email.</blockquote>Tet: You can call me for advice on legal advice on this matter, I will back you up on this anytime.<br><br><blockquote>I am really puzzled how n earth you gonna take legal action against "someone" or "something" which is not physically existing ?<br>Sue who ? .. ????<br><br>Well sue you young punk, (somehow I can imagine you to be a corn head lookalike, and I am only imagineing...I state that..you can't sue me for defamation *grins*) Please note that under the penal code, the identity of a person as state to when a crime is committed includes all alias, all nicks, all untrue name. To be simple, as long as you are the one commiting the crime, I dun care who this person or thing is, I can sue you, I can make your life hell. And please note that all posts are logged in this forum, I have clarified this matter with the system adminstrator, and as the law requires, they are bound by it to provide all logs to this forum. I dun have to bother about tracking you down, for the ISP will be incharge of this as they are again bounded by law to do so as in their contracts with the MITA. Trust me, you are someone, phsically, virtually, spiritually, as long as you are someone with an identity, I can catch you, I will hunt you ,and like I said, I will make your life hell.<br><br>[quote]Wake up boys and gals...<br>From start till now I never mention who that pic belong to...</blockquote>dearest Zeta, now you are scared aren't you? Trying to shift responsibility to others and dragging everyone else who commented on the issue with in aren't you? But no no....I hope you understand the term inference. And under the law, yes, under the law again, if for any reason, an idea of crime is committed under inferance by another, the crims itself is valid, yes, but the person causing such inferrance would be considered as part of the crime, and yes, they are the mastermind and will definitely get the heaviest sentance. as for the offenders who commited the crime under inferance by another will be aquitted if they are able to give enough reason prove that there is inferance while they are committing the act. So please zeta, dun be a pussy cat and shift the blame to others, if I were you, I would rather be a heroine, and take all the blame myself, at least i die glorified, not a loser.<br><br><blockquote>But personally, I think those pics are artistically created and you mean we can't post compliment msg like this here....??</blockquote>YOu know what? I dun care if you compliment or not, you infringe on the copyright and I can sue you. Why not I put it this way? is it not a compliment that so many people actually wants to use a software I created, so much so that software pirates actually profit the most from my creation? Yes, it is rather complimentary, but sorry, I still got to sue you. *shrugs* You infringr on my copyright.<br><br><blockquote>Prove it to me that's your work..I don't see any traces of you in that 2 masterpiece...</blockquote>Zeta, you know what? I think you are really fighten now, so much so that you feel the need to have evidence and in hope that tet can't produce evidence, your heart can at least ease am I not wrong? *sigh* I hate to tell you this, but tet does have the proof and it is so damn easy. She just needto produce the original flims of photos from which the pics are done from. I know she has them, I seen them, gees, in fact I was there when she collects the developed photos. So let me guess, your heart is beating faster already? Or do you need me to really show you the flims before they stop all together?<br><br><blockquote>If you look closely at the link.....that's not my homepage.</blockquote>hmm....another try to get yourself off the hook? *sigh* how many times do I have to tell you that basically no matter what you say or do, all I need is the Log from the system admin to prove that you are the one who said those things and that pics is posted by you? *sigh* So maybe another person is dragged in, the person who owns the site, but that is all, the 2 of you being seperate netities are liable for different crimes, in this case, you are liable for defamation or at least cause of it. *smiles* ahh...I feel so good....revenge is sweet is it not? I hope you are able to sleep tonight, and that you are not having cold sweat right now, I would be if I were you, not because that the charges are frightening, (I have seen a lot more cases worst than this) but simply because you 2 there did not think that there would be so much after effects. *sigh* sometimes as the saying goes, ignorance is bliss, but that is only sometimes, if you 2 were not so ignorant before you even touch that keyboard of yours this morning, I am sure you 2 will be glad that you did not do what you did today, but too late, too late....what done cannot be undone.<br><br>I hereby tells the system admin not to erase the logs of this post and to take note of any editing done further from this point in time. If tet is to sue the subjects, these eveidance will be required. and you know that you are bound by law to do that.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I look forward to working with you, Jason, in future if required.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Callan (edited 26 June 2000).]</div>
