Believe me, because I've been a VICTIM myself.... But one thing you would have to understand is that SYSTEMs are INTRODUCED for the sake of LAW... And SYSTEMs are usually quite 'TIGHT-FIXED'. Because of their nature there tends to be LOOPHOLES around, people looked for them and MAKE USE of them... But just like though we know a knife can be used to hurt or kill another, that don't mean that knives should be BANNED altogther... People weigh PROs and CONs... And the NECCESSITY for their EXISTENCE.... WIthout such SYSTEMs other MORE SEVERE problems might come in....<br><br>Should people be CHARGED for filing a FALSE POLICE REPORT? The answer is YES. But in Singapore, I guess the system's 'you mind your own business'? If anyone make ANY FALSE STATEMENT which SERIOUSLY affect the RESULT of a JUSTIFICATION, the person could be charged with CONTEMPT of COURT. But if you feel that you have been accused, you can always try to take LEGAL ACTIONS against the person. And like you've mentioned in your POST, such can just be another 'loop hole' for people to ABUSE... To bring HARM to another. HENCE, as I guess you would agree with me, you would need EVIDENCE for you to do just that. I AGREE that much INJUSTICE can be DONE because the LACK of such CONCRETE EVIDENCE, the NEGLIGENCE of a JUDGE or certain AUTHORITY. But we're ONLY HUMAN. And AUTHORITIES are just STRUCTURES.<br><br>There're simply too many things they have to look into, they always go by PRIORITY in term of IMPORTANCE... Just like the way you should manage your Life... Then again sometimes that may not be the case, such as little CHAOS within a SYSTEM.. Cause CONTAMINATION and CORRUPTION.... But these are not RARE nor STRANGER... Just verifying degree... In DIFFERENT people and DIFFERENT structure.... HUMAN NATURE.... 'Human error'... There're simply too many details to go into, forgive me if I can't oblige to explanations... I thought of writing a book on this one day... And I sure HOPE one day I DO...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway... According to my own 'LAW of Emotional Kinetics' (The way I describe it lah...)... If it's too MINOR a CASE to be brought up, it woouldn't be brought up... And if the CASE really have 'IMPACT' on the VICTIM, it WOULD be brought up by the VICTIM... (Or by relative people under influence of the 'Kinetics'...) With PROPER EVIDENCE, much would be justified.</div>

Our Mdm Susan would not have let things drop so easily if it's really a SEXUAL HARASSESSMENT case. PRESSING CHARGE on both SEXUAL HARASSESSMENT or FALSE POLICE REPORT would be a waste of time for both Susan and Informer, not to mention the police altogether.

Everybody makes mistake, I'm sure you DO TOO?<br><br><strong>On the grounds of your mistake (and a hide up). </strong>I would just advise you to stop making a fool out of yourself....[/B]</blockquote> I've noted your comments, but first let me explain to you the situation.<br>It's definitely not a misunderstanding.<br>Why u may ask ?<br>Because if it's a misunderstanding for a start, she should not have just be 'trigger happy' and made a false police report against me !<br>When u make a police report, you are causing unnecessary inconvenience for the accused, as he will be interrogated by the police or even be detained for further investigations .<br>This for a start will have a 'knock on' effect, as the accused will have to take leave from work to help with the investigations.<br>Next if he has been detained for 24 or 48 hrs, then his employer will think that he has commited a crime or guilty of a crime !<br>That will cause him to most probably lose a good chance of promotion if one is just around the corner !<br>Then, there will be gossips in the company if colleagues get wind of the detention due to police investigation work, and you will be the butt of jokes and gossips !<br>And all this could have been avoided because of some idiot making a false police report against the innocent !<br>Well, in my case, since the cops have no evidence of me harassment back in 1995, I do not understand why they did not charge her in court for making a false police report !<br>Is this due to a gender issue ?<br>Or because she has a "respectable" job as a teacher/ lecturer ?<br>Well, to readers here, I will now be a smart ass street wise guy and use every dirty tricks in the black book to expose this kind of  underhand tactics used by people like Susan Chua.<br>Then I am going to file a report against her to light up the fire so that cover ups will be impossible !<br>If the cops sit on the case, I will file a private summons against her and get the press to focus on this scandal !<br>Yes, this I will do to expose scams like this for the media to see both locally and internationally !<br>We'll see how much longer can the so called silly authorities try and cover this up this kind scandals !<br>Call me stubborn, but when I've been victimised like this, sad to say I will bite back so hard that false accusations/ false police report like this will not go unpunished !<br><br>[/B][/QUOTE]<br>BELIEVE me, I can understand your grief with this SHIT (if it's for real) because I've been through the LEGAL too....<br><br>About the taking leaves and such are just the SYSTEM... If you wanna INSIST it's UNFAIR, YES... To a certain extent I can AGREE with you... ESPECIALLY when you're ACCUSED and INNOCENT.... It's a TOTAL WASTE of TIME...<br><br>About the people gossiping about you, this is just HUMAN STUPIDITY displayed in one of the various FORMs....<br><br>About taking ACTIONs against her 'from the black book'? I urge you if you have means with the LEGAL, have a CLEAR CONSCIENCE and thinks it REALLY NECESSARY, you may go ahead with the LEGAL PROCEEDINGS... But may I remind you it would just WASTE MORE of your TIME and ENERGY...?<br><br>About your dirty tricks... "The BLACK and the WHITE when MIXED together is GREY... It won't matter if you're ORIGINALLY BLACK or WHITE <span style="font-style: italic;">anymore</span>... All that matters now, you're <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>grey....</strong></span>"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Devil1976:<br><br><blockquote>I understand your CONCERN regarding women making such DARING and FORCEFUL accusations against the men under the PROTECTION of the WOMEN's CHAPTER. Believe me, because I've been a VICTIM myself.... But one thing you would have to understand is that SYSTEMs are INTRODUCED for the sake of LAW... And SYSTEMs are usually quite 'TIGHT-FIXED'. Because of their nature there tends to be LOOPHOLES around, people looked for them and MAKE USE of them... But just like though we know a knife can be used to hurt or kill another, that don't mean that knives should be BANNED altogther... People weigh PROs and CONs... And the NECCESSITY for their EXISTENCE.... WIthout such SYSTEMs other MORE SEVERE problems might come in....</blockquote>well, i'm not saying the existing laws protecting women should be removed. in fact i would strongly oppose such a move. rather, i'm more in favour of having additional laws in place that would discourage the exploitation of such loopholes in the legal system. to use back your analogy, a knife can be used to kill or hurt other people, but that doesn't mean knives should be banned. however, laws should be put in place which would discourage people from using knives to hurt and kill other people, right?<br><br><blockquote>Should people be CHARGED for filing a FALSE POLICE REPORT? The answer is YES. But in Singapore, I guess the system's 'you mind your own business'? If anyone make ANY FALSE STATEMENT which SERIOUSLY affect the RESULT of a JUSTIFICATION, the person could be charged with CONTEMPT of COURT. But if you feel that you have been accused, you can always try to take LEGAL ACTIONS against the person. And like you've mentioned in your POST, such can just be another 'loop hole' for people to ABUSE... To bring HARM to another. HENCE, as I guess you would agree with me, you would need EVIDENCE for you to do just that. I AGREE that much INJUSTICE can be DONE because the LACK of such CONCRETE EVIDENCE, the NEGLIGENCE of a JUDGE or certain AUTHORITY. But we're ONLY HUMAN. And AUTHORITIES are just STRUCTURES.<br><br>There're simply too many things they have to look into, they always go by PRIORITY in term of IMPORTANCE... Just like the way you should manage your Life... Then again sometimes that may not be the case, such as little CHAOS within a SYSTEM.. Cause CONTAMINATION and CORRUPTION.... But these are not RARE nor STRANGER... Just verifying degree... In DIFFERENT people and DIFFERENT structure.... HUMAN NATURE.... 'Human error'... There're simply too many details to go into, forgive me if I can't oblige to explanations... I thought of writing a book on this one day... And I sure HOPE one day I DO...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </blockquote>i agree with you; sad but true fact.<br><br><blockquote>It's all a CYCLE... People act in a moment of EMOTIONAL OUTBURST, EMOTIONALLY DRIVEN, faster than the LOGICAL MIND... That's usually how FATALITY like SUICIDEs and MURDERs (Some cases) took place... There is no right or wrong, just BASIC HUMAN INSTINCT.... Though it can be trained and controlled....</blockquote>i'm all for the implementation additional laws to prevent people from filing false charges knowingly, so as to control this emotional outburst on their part, as you mentioned.<br><br><blockquote>Just like what Informer's demonstrating now.... Could be that if his stand is TRUE? And your 'don't care what his/her reasons are'..... 'DON'T CARE' simply means that your mind have been PRE-CONDITIONED... When things happen, your mind SLEEPS... Your EMOTION just TAKE OVER... Go FIGURE OUT how POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS that can be yourself?</blockquote>actually what i meant was that it should be my right not to be held responsible and have to suffer the consequences for the actions of someone else, since i have no control over the actions of other people. when i said i don't care what his/her reasons are, i meant in the way that i'm not obliged to understand his/her reasons for making me suffer the consequence of his/her (reckless) actions.<br><br>this is comparable to a burglar breaking into my house and threatening the lives of my family members and myself. i definitely would not care what his reasons were for breaking in, be it him being out of a job for 6 months, or having just lost money in horse racing, etc. once he steps into my private property and threatens my life, thus indirectly making me suffer the consequences of his actions, i would not give a damn about his reasons and i would stop him with deadly force if necessary.<br><br>this is precisely the reason why rape or robbery victims are usually not held accountable for injuries they may have inflicted on their assailants in self-defence.<br><br></div>
