I have to confess that I dun know much about T-shirt printing or IT stuff.<br><br>But given a rough view of the demographic break down on the dominant users or visitors of the forum, much of the pool would fall under the 15 to 25 age group.<br><br>By occupation, the bulk of the pool would be in either JCs, poly or uni.<br><br>Hence, this characteristic would have already zeroed in a common concentration point for any potential T-shirt sales, that is in ideal, within the grounds of a local campus.<br><br>I'm not too sure if JCs which fall directly under MOE would allow for such sales.
