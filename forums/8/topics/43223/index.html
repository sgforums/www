            <div class='col-md body'>Here is the thread for everyone to complain about the <span style="font-style: italic;">Big Lag</span>. For those of you who don't know, the Big Lag tends to strike everyday from 11pm-2am. Yes, we are like a damn happening club along MS on a saturday night every night.<br><br>Just so you know...we are not keeping you lagging just so people think we are so happening. We are trying our best to resolve the lag and some big big things have been done in the past few days. Let's see if it improves...<br><br>Anyway, do complain in this thread when it starts lagging so we can consolidate all the whining into one place. Those who want to donate $$$ for a new server pls send $5,000 to me.

            <div class='col-md body'>ok i just read your post daniuge.<br><br>first.. domain is very cheap to buy, only 12 euro/year or therabouts to register.<br><br>but the server and bandwidth costs are much much much more... you understand I cannot disclose this exact amount.<br><br>about your suggestion, we don't want people to join premier member just because the server is lagging so much. you can imagine the complains from normal members ie "trying to make all of us pay money to become premier member just because the server lag so much". however the suggestion does have some merit and i have thought about it before, we will only use it if there is no way to reduce the lag for everyone.<br><br>also, do take note that the people who 'flamed' you in that thread are just normal members we have no control over what they say. furthermore, i was offended that you were trying to suggest that i was making the server lag on purpose just to put ads up there.<br><br>btw you run a website as well?<br><br>your post for reference:<br><blockquote>Please mind your words. I am mentioning all these because i myself is a network administrator, I can see a vicious cycle in this thing.<br><br>nobody subscribe  no money  congestion (no money to buy upgrading stuffs)  nobody subscribe<br><br>do you understand my point here?<br><br>for your info, subscription for a domain is $75.00/year to $90/year depending on who you subscribe it from.<br><br>First problem is to ease congestion. How do we do it? Use Qos. By doing this, premier members will be granted extra bandwidth. When people see that premier members are given such previlege, people will start joining. When more and more people joined, more money will roll in. I am saying all these not because i am a premier member but i really want sgforum to grow.</blockquote></div>

We barely used 1/4 of our space resources. The issue is database optimisation, CPU bottleneck, and memory (ie RAM, not storage space). We are taking several steps to sort it out. For example, we are in the midst of a RAM upgrade from 256mb to 1GB. This would already cost us in the region of $900... and before you shoot me, its so expensive because I have to engage Dell to do it with their own memory and labour because I am not in Singapore.</div>

We barely used 1/4 of our space resources. The issue is database optimisation, CPU bottleneck, and memory (ie RAM, not storage space). We are taking several steps to sort it out. For example, we are in the midst of a RAM upgrade from 256mb to 1GB. This would already cost us in the region of $900... and before you shoot me, its so expensive because I have to engage Dell to do it with their own memory and labour because I am not in Singapore.</div></blockquote>i just felt that everytime you click on the all forums thing and it has to call up all that extra unused data, that's kinda a waste of resources.<br><br>you read the other thread where i said something about excessive junk being loaded on the front page?<br><br>less stuff downloaded = less bandwidth used.</div>
