            <div class='col-md body'>most of the forumers here are from Sg... so i think for starters, the distribution hub should be based here even if the server is not... (is it??? i have no idea... never go and do whois and stuff... why bother...) so does Chief have anyone here he can trust?<br><br>furthermore, if u're <strong>REALLY</strong> leery about shipping problems and all that stuff, limit your sales to Sg addresses only.<br><br>that would help keep costs down... face it... speedpost to local address is cheaper than fed-ex from timbuktu to god-knows-where... u can always add on to your capabilities later when u're more comfortable.<br><br>if Chief has already set up a pay-pal account for the site, you could revive it and use the shopping cart functions... its limited and not very attractive, but again, it keeps costs down... u'll just have to pay [3.9% (if u charge as S$ instead of US$... US$ is 2.9%) + US$0.30] per transaction.<br><br><strong>u go for a merchant account with a bank, your fixed costs will shoot the roof before u can scream "dot.com, here i come!". </strong>i've helped some people find out about this before... they freaked when they heard the costs... its only viable if<br>(a) u have massive traffic,<br>(b) u have massive backing or<br>(c) money's no object to you...<br>and it can't be (c) 'cos we're here complaining about the server lagging cos there's not enough money to upgrade!<br><br><strong>one catch:</strong> if u're registered as a charity, banks are <strong>A LOT</strong> more generous... its still expensive and there are STILL fixed costs, but its significantly lower commercial rates if u negotiate with them <strong>properly</strong>...  but u're not a charity, and i really don't think its a good idea to go there anyway!<br><br>try lah... maybe just spend a <span style="font-style: italic;">bit</span>, print a few, test the market... if it works out, then consider further developments. if it doesn't, u lose practically nothing but the cost of printing a few t-shirts and the time spent trying to sell them...<br><br>i'ld love to try something like that... too bad this isn't my forum  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>let me know what u think... i <strong>might</strong> be able to help a bit... i dunno... depends what u have in mind.<br><br>i initiate ideas, but it gets really annoying when people just talk and talk and nothing comes about (dunno 'bout u, but not the first time its happened to me...)<br></div>

Anyway I'd answer your queries in an effort at transparency. The server is an entry level dell 1 rack server, pentium 3 850MHz, 256 mb ram. The bandwidth is unlimited on the singapore one backbone. The bottleneck is not bandwidth, it is the server. avg processsing time per request can shoot up to 10 seconds during peak periods, but it is usuallt 0.1-0.2 seconds during less busy hours.<br></div></blockquote>ha ha... so so so, i see. so the purpose of ur post is to stop the 'bitchin', i get it now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>an entry level dell 1U rack-mount server shud be good enuff to serve as a web server. but i'm not very sure abt forum engines, because i think it might takes up more processing then any other regular web servers.<br><br>juz a curiosity, how much do u pay for ur unlimited bandwidth? how big? what kind of bandwidth? e.g. pvc? shared? dedicated? atm?<br>which data centre do u host the server at?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks again for all the ideas regarding the t-shirts.<br><br>cx:<br>i'm not even thinking about a merchant account! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>and it'll definitely be shipping to sg only, overseas maybe with an extra charge.<br><br>the thing about t-shirts is that chances are you'll end up selling 5 a month, does the revenue justify the hassle? of setting up the payment n shipping infrastructure in addition to the work of actually designing and printing?<br><br>right now i will put this idea on hold, i'd probably only seriously consider it if there was a total outsourcing solution. for example: <a href="http://t-shirtme.buy-tees.com/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://t-shirtme.buy-tees.com/index.asp</a><br><br>weeeeeee.....:<br>I can't answer your queries <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i know alot of website folks use cafepress.<br><br>or i think a better option for us here is to 1st get a couple designs, then see whose interested in the shirts, collect payment from them, and THEN we print those shirts and mail it to them.<br><br>let's not do this too often, maybe only once every quarter, to preserve the novelty of it. there won't enough ppl buying t-shirts every month anyway.</div>
