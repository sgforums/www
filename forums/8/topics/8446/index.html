I always believe if a person is capable, he can find better pay and better prospect job after ORD. Serving as NS and sign on as regular you will also recieve different treatment.

            <div class='col-md body'>ANd think about this, if you dun want a job where any Ah Gao (even the uncle sweeping the street) can do, then dun sign on. If you do it for the sake of money, well outside is more attractive. If you do it for satisfaction, well as what I say, even a pig can do your job. (Unless you want to scare those Ah Beng with your warrant pass)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, With a diploma it is advisable not to sign contract with any of the Armed forces..<br>Reason.. In years to come you would loose out n terms of Salary... And the main reason..you would regret being a constable rather than being a inspector.. So if you could get a degree maybe you could consider signing a contract with the police!!!!<br><br>------------------<br><strong>*<span style="font-style: italic;"> No FeAr</span> *</strong></div>
