              <p class="MsoNormal">Hi All,</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Like to share some Party Magic and Card Tricks for your incoming Christmas Party.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">BTW, tell me how you going to celebrate this coming Christmas Party.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: underline;">1. ANY NUMBER CHOSEN!</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: #000000;">Someone is told to think of a 
              		number on watch dial. Mentally beginning with one  number above the 
              		one he thought of, he is to start counting as the performer taps the 
              		dial one tap for each number. As soon as he risen-tally counts to 20. he 
              		is to say stop. At this point, the magician’s pencil is on the number 
              		previously thought of! </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: #000000;"><strong>SECRET :</strong> Make seven taps at random, but on the 
              		eighth tap have your pencil on number 12. Now start tapping counter 
              		clockwise around the dial. No matter what number was taken, when the 
              		spectator counts to 20, your pencil wilt be on the right number.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> <span style="color: #000000;">2. CARD READING!</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: #000000;">Pack is shuffled by anyone in audience, 
              		given to you and you openly replace it in the card case. You now 
              		announce the cards one by one before taking them out of the case. The 
              		audience is amazed to see that each card drawn out it the one you 
              		previously named.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: #000000;"><strong>SECRET</strong>: Cut a small opening in the corner of the 
              case (at the bottom A). This lets you see the index of each card.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 7.05pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. FLOATING EGG</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: #000000;">Many soldiers used to bet visitors to their camps that 
              it was possible to make an egg float on water. Here is the <strong>secret</strong>, but the 
              bet­ting is up to you. Fill a glass about three-quarters full of water and put 
              an egg in it. The egg sinks to the bottom Now put a great deal of salt in the 
              water. As the salt sinks to the bottom, the egg rises to the top.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 4. GHOST WRITING</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: #000000;">Show your audience a piece of paper which is 
              apparently blank. Pass it out <em>for examination </em>and then hold it over a 
              lighted candle. Watch ‘ghostly’ letters appear! </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: #000000;"><strong>Secret</strong>: Before the party starts, 
              make an "ink" out of lemon juice. Write any letters or words you desire to appear 
              later with this lemon juice “ink” The writing is invisible until heat beings it 
              out. A Little ingenuity will make this trick the hit of any party.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>5</strong></span></span><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">. 
              Broken Match Trick</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style='font-family: "Trebuchet MS";'>A seemingly unbelievable 
              trick. You place an unbroken match in a empty handkerchief. Fold it, and allow 
              one of your friends to break the match. Open the handkerchief. The match is 
              there, whole once more! </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style='font-family: "Trebuchet MS";'><strong>SECRET</strong>: Insert a match in the 
              Hem of the handkerchief 
              before doing the trick! That’s the one broken!</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">6. Magnetic </span></strong> <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700;">Cards</span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">When you are at a friend’s home, borrow 
              his deck of cards and tell him you are going to show him that cards have an 
              affinity for walls. You then walk over to any wall of the house and place a card 
              against the wall. At you walk away, it is noticed that the card sticks to the 
              wall. This effect it then repeated with other cards which you attach to 
              different parts of the wall. Absolutely no paste or other adhesives are used, 
              yet the cards remain stuck to the walls. A weird effect!</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;"><strong>SECRET</strong>:   All that is necessary 
              to perform this unusual trick is a rug on the floor, plus any deck of cards. Rub 
              your shoes briskly against the rug on the floor, which will create a small 
              amount of magnetism in your body. Then slap the card quickly against a wall and 
              it will stick there. Your shoes should be rubbed against the rug as you walk 
              towards the wall, but do it in a casual manner so that it is not too obvious. 
              The card should be held flat, in the palm of your hand.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Verdana; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 700;"> 7. YOUR NOSE KNOWS!</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The performer hands someone a pack of 
              playing cards with instructions to take out as many ad desired and to lay them 
              face upward on the table. One is to be selected while the performer is out of 
              the room. Performer returns to the room and announces that he can sniff out the 
              thought of card. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;"><strong>SECRET</strong>: Performer arranges with 
              some one in the room who knows the selected card to gently tap his shoe while he 
              is bending over the table. A swindle’ but a good trick.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Verdana; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 700;"> 8. FOUR ACE PRODUCTION!</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">While blindfolded, you can produce the 
              Four Aces from the deck after it has been shuffled and placed in your coat 
              pocket if you follow these instructions carefully: before doing the trick, hide 
              the Four Aces in your upper right band vest pocket. Let anyone shuffle the deck 
              thoroughly and place it in your inside coat pocket. Someone now can place a 
              handkerchief about your eyes as a blindfold. You then apparently reach in to 
              your pocket and withdraw the Four Aces from the deck.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;"><strong>SECRET</strong>: All you do is to take out 
              the Four Aces you originally hid in your upper right hand vest pocket! The 
              illusion is perfect... the audience thinks the cards were taken from the deck 
              they saw shuffled. To prevent detection, after showing the Four Aces, place them 
              back in your coat pocket . . . and withdraw the deck, shuffling it as you do so, 
              after which you can throw it out for examination.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> <span style="font-family: Verdana; text-decoration: underline;">9. ARMY GAME!</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Performer lays four Jacks on a table and 
              tells audience they represent four men who derided to enlist in the Army. 
              However, two of them, after a physical examination, were rejected, whereas the 
              other two were accepted. Ask if anyone in the audience can tell which two were 
              rejected . . - and why. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;"><strong>SECRET</strong>: In all cards made in the 
              U. S. A. two of the four Jacks have only ONE EYE. Very few people notice this so 
              you have the background of a good trick.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Verdana; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 700;"> 10. TO TELL A CARD!</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Ask a person to select any card from a 
              deck and have him place it on the top of the deck. Then ask him to cut the 
              cards. You then look at all the cards and then quickly throw out the one that 
              was selected. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;"><strong>SECRET</strong>: Notice card at BOTTOM of 
              the deck before starting trick. The card selected will FOLLOW this card.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 7.05pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700;"> </span><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">11. 
              MYSTIC ASHES</span></strong></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">If you present this effect in a dramatic 
              manner, you can convince folks that you are truly psychic! Sit at a table and 
              ask members of the audience to call out the names of famous living or dead 
              people. Write down each name on a separate piece of paper, then fold the paper 
              and throw it into a glass or metal bowl. Now invite a member of the audience to 
              remove one of the folded papers and hold it up against his brow. Bum the balance 
              of the papers in the bowl, pick up the ashes and study them carefully, then 
              announce very slowly the name on the folded slip. When it is opened, of course 
              your prediction is verified.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">SECRET:    Write the <em>first </em>name 
              called on all the papers. No one will know you did this at all evidence is 
              destroyed when you burn the papers - A variation of this trick is to ask for names 
              of cities, states, countries, etc,</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">12. 
              Dollars Breaks Pencil!</span></strong></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The performer first borrows a lead 
              pencil from someone and then borrows a dollar bill from someone else. An 
              assistant is told to hold the pencil on both ends. Performer then folds the 
              borrowed dollar bill lengthwise and says:“I can break the pencil with the bill!” 
              He now hits the pencil a sharp rap in the centre with the folded bill. Nothing 
              happened! He repeats this again. Nothing happens . . . but, lo and behold! The 
              third time the bill hits the pencil, it breaks! </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;"><strong>SECRET</strong>: As wish many good 
              magical tricks, no preparation is required. When the performer first hits the 
              pencil with the folded dollar bill he is only leading up to the next move, for 
              as he hits it for the third time, he has secretly placed his second finger 
              alongside the outside of the bill. Now, as he strikes the pencil, the <em>finger </em>breaks she pencil! The bill has nothing to do with it. Do not try this with 
              automatic pencils, or small stubs of pencils.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">13. 
              Mind Reader</span></strong></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Announce that you and someone else have 
              mutual mental attraction. To prove it, the other person leaves the room. While
              <strong>he (or she) is absent, request any friend to mention </strong>his (or her) 
              favorite number. This done, a third party brings the “mind reader” back into the 
              room. Your assistant places his (or her) hands on your temple and immediately 
              announces the correct number. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;"><strong>Secret</strong>: As the fingers are placed on your temples, 
              simply tighten your jaws causing the muscles in your forehead to press against 
              the fingers. Press one for each digit. For example, the number is 132. Press 
              your jaw once, pause, press three times, pause, and then twice. Ten presses are 
              zero.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 7.05pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 700;"> 14. SELECTED CARDS FOUND!</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Divide a pack into two piles, with the 
              odd cards in one pile (the aces, three, fives, sevens and nines), and the even 
              ones (picture card, twos, fours, sixes, eights and tens) in the other pile. Then 
              tell ,several people to draw cards out of either pile. After secretly reversing 
              the piles, have the people place the cards they drew from the odd pile into the 
              even pile, and vice versa. You will then find the selected cards in each of the 
              opposite piles. To add more effect to this trick, have a person shuffle each 
              pile separately before cards are drawn.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 700;"> 15. Hypnotized Cigar</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Tell your audience that you intend to 
              hypnotize a cigar. Look at the left hand illustration above and note that the 
              cigar is apparently floating in air. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The <strong>secret</strong>: Before doing this trick, stick 
              a pin half way in a cigar. The cigar can now be held in any position by gripping the pin between the fingers. After 
              you make the cigar ‘suspended” itself so the air in various positions, take the cigar in the right hand, leaving

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">A clever way to make a dime vanish is to 
              spin it on a table and then strike with a match box. No one will suspect that 
              the coin actually goes inside the box.</span></span></p>

              in the coin.) The entire idea is to have a “snap back” arrangement. Put a safety 
              pin on the other end and hook it under your clothes. When the pressure on the 
              rubber band is released, the coin will vanish up the sleeve.</span></span></p>

              Before trying this trick, put a small piece of chewing gum on one of the half 
              dollar. When you place the dime on the half dollar, make sure it is secretly

              as follows: </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">One son was to receive one half of the 
              horses, the next son was to get 1/3, and the last son was to receive 1/9 of 
              them.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">Now the lawyer who read the will was a 
              horse lover. He did not want to cut up the horses, which he would have to do, 
              since one half of 17 is 8 1/2, 1/3 is 5 2/3, and 1/9 is 1 8/9 horses. (Illustrated this on the 
              black­board.) So here is how he settled the matter. He placed one of his own 
              horses among the 17, making them 18. He then divided them as follows: </span> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #000000;"> <span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">The 1st Son  got

              middle of the floor. Place a chair six feet away from the has. Each player sits 
              in this chair. He takes a pack of ordinary playing cards and while seated must 
              toss the cards singly into the hat. Each card that reaches the hat may be given 
              a value, depending on the spots. Picture cards count 13. It is a very difficult 
              feat despite the fact that it looks simple and five cards in the hat is a good
