            <div class='col-md body'><br>Good evening ladies and gentlemen,<br><br>Before I proceed on with my essay, I wish to clarify and state clear certain things. First of all, this essay is meant for adults above the age of 21 with discerning taste and who appreciate the state of non-conformity. Secondly, I take no responsibility for whatever might happened to the readers after going through my essay. As I have mentioned in the first 2 lines, this is meant for ADULTS! I am sorry, I mean, THINKING ADULTS. Thirdly, I hope my piece of work is academic enough for I have no inclination to cater to the blood and gory side of cheap entertainment. I stress once again that I do not promote the usage of suicide and it is meant purely as a discussion topic. If you are easily offended by the topic, I suggest you click on the back button of your web browser and look at other delightful threads in the forum.<br><br>Thank you. With this out of the way, I shall proceed on with my essay, that is, suicide and the ways to go about doing it. In this stressful society of capitalism ran amok, people are confronted with problems on a daily, even hourly basis. We stress about our work, study and life. We worried about our family, friends and loved ones. Crisis are occurring at an alarming rates and we often feel besieged and yearn of an easy way out of this miserable existence. Of course, suicide is outlawed and out-moral. The courts dissuade us from attempting it with fines and jail while the moral crusaders denounce suicide as a cowardly act that is sure to be condemned by your makers and the gods they promote. We are urged by society to meet our problems with stoic brazenness and courage in the face of adversity is highly publicised in the media. More often than not, it is usually love angst teenagers who resort to this measure of ending their problems once and for all. And that, my friends, is something I do not like or encourage at all!<br><br>Suicide is for adults pure and simple. They are for individuals who have discovered that life has no more meaning for them, and that the problem facing them requires a much drastic solution and that all pros and cons have been measured. In short, suicide is a rational action of THINKING individuals. What I have here now with me is a list most potential suicide cases went through. Most people have different priorities in life and this list is not the definite list to suicide. However, I believed it fulfilled most individuals who are taking this route.<br><br>1. Ask yourself this question first. Is it true that life has no more meaning for you? If you cannot convince yourself with your answer, I suggest you stop now.<br><br>1. Is the problem really insurmountable? If not, I would also suggest that you stop thinking of suicide as an option.<br><br>1. Now we come to the guilt part, the consequences of your actions. Can you really bear to see your loved ones agonised over your death? Is it fair to them that they have to deal with your problems after you are gone? If you think you can answer all 3 questions in the positive, congratulations my friend, we can now proceed to the crux of my essay.<br>Euthanasia, the act of merciful killing, is a hotly debated issue in society today. I will not go into the nitty gritty details nor debate anyone on it. Suffice to say, what I have here is for people looking for a way out of their existence and the various ways to go about achieving it. I do not endorse this action nor do I condemn it. All I am doing it listing out in dry terms on how best to achieve it in a painless way.<br><br>I listed the ways of killing oneself under 4 major options: the crash and burn method, the toxic and poison method, the silent razor method and lastly, death by drowning.<br><br>THE CRASH AND BURN METHOD.<br>The most popular method to date. This form of suicide encompasses jumping, car and pedestrian accidents and any method that involve brute force. Needless to say, this method of suicide brought about unnecessary blood and gore, suiting those with attention seeking tendencies. The few drawbacks of this are it hurts at the moment of impact. Of course, if you can overlook this short moment of uncomfortable feelings, it would be indeed a terrific way to go. Highly recommended for the non-squeamish individuals.<br><br>THE TOXIC AND POISON METHOD.<br>Very popular with the females individuals. One of the reasons could be the relatively painless way of death and leaving the body and face intact for public consumption. Conventional methods include the quintessential sleeping pills, the monoxide in the car and other lethal poisons like arsenic and rat poison. Of course, the drawback for this is that poisons are hard to come by in Singapore and they do not guarantee a painless way of dying. There have been cases of suicide cases devouring large amount of rat poison, who unfortunately enough was discovered in time, and even more unfortunately, had to suffered through the horrendous process of stomach pumping. Ditto for sleeping pills and carbon monoxide, not necessary a sure proof way of dying. Individuals are highly advised to plan with great foresight before attempting this version of suicide.<br><br>THE SILENT RAZOR METHOD.<br>Yes, the popular image of blood filled bathtub is bound to fill oneÂ’s mind when one thinks of razor. The silting of sharp metal across the veins had accounted for many a females life and it can be a rather painful way to goÂ…until you have less than a quartz of blood left. Strictly for the voyeurs out there, who loved to look at themselves as they bleed slowly to death. Death by hanging also belongs to this category. Instead of a cold metal at your veins, you have a thick rope caressing your neck as you suffocate to death. Relatively quiet way of going. But can be rather unpleasant, for suffocating is can induce a lot of pain and struggling as you gasp for air.<br><br>DEATH BY DROWNING.<br>Self explanatory. Very, very horrible way of dying, for water entering your lungs IS a very painful experience. Not recommend for the swimmers out there. Your will to live might just kick in during the crucial moment, unless of course you tied a large object to your below.<br><br>There is undoubtedly many ways to skin a cat, as the saying goes. The sky is the limit and why limit to youself to those options shown above. After all, this will be your last chance at exploring your creative self. There will be people who are probably not too happy with my essay and think that it is in bad taste. I prefer to take a more sanguine view about this. I will not go into the right and wrong of suicide and pointing out the ways to kill oneself is but an interesting exercise in the grey matters.<br><br>Have a good day.<br><br>"The opposite of bravery is not cowardice but conformity." --Robert Anthony<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mr Hata-san (edited 28 August 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahahahaha, bravo bravo Hata-san, but I guess u missed out one of the most popular alternatives under the Toxic and Poison Method, and that is, the use of Carbon Monoxide. Popular among all suicide wannabes, and rumoured to be the most painless. So who will be the judge???<br><br>You mentioned that there will be no minors reading this rite??

No can do also!  I don't think I can suffer the pain.  I hate to feel pain and knowing that I will slowly die just feels super painful to me.<br><br>One more point.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the inspiring answers and thoughts which I have so generously  received from the forumites. I will now take turn to answer their queries and further elaborate my essay.<br><br>Yes, Mr Revelation and Mr Moose, I did not neglect to mention the methods of carbon monoxide and jumping from the building. It WAS in included in the Toxic and Burn category respectively. And being one of the more popular methods around, I am sorry to say I did not accord them more space in my essay. But thanks for pointing it out to me gentlemen.<br><br>Humourless Mr Revelation? Well, I did said that my aim was to open a discussion on this topic, not cater to Calvin and Hobbes audience in here. If you are referring to Madame TetÂ’s remarks to my essay, you can choose to ignore it. I always think she has a weird sense of humour and she did find it extremely amusing at the thought of the way Mafia dealt with their traitorsÂ…. thick cement at their feet and man overboard! Why this topic? Simply because I am very interested in the methods.<br><br>This is not the only forum I posted my essay. Frankly, I am very surprise at the mute response from my readers. Elsewhere, I was fair game and I was attacked from the Right to the Left, from the religious conservatives to the Aunt Agony and even the pro-government people too! Comments from them ranged from<br><br>Â“Did you ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether the four methods you listed above are approved?<br>Wake up your ideas, man!Â” - arrowhead<br><br>Â“Yep, it's a frigging crime to attempt suicide, so all you people participating in this thread might get it for accessorial liability (aiding, abetting...) if one of us is actually inspired to try this adult thing to do!Â”- AKT<br><br>Â“do u know that when a person commit suicide in singapore, he/she is "arrested" even if the person is already dead?? yes, the police would tie a rope around the hands..becoz he/she had committed a crime...isn't this ridiculous??!!!Â” -jon athan<br><br>I had yet to reply to those charming gentlemen above. But it is pretty obvious the first 2 find it hard to take jokes and obviously thinks that my essay is in poor taste. Oh well, I canÂ’t please everybody and if the ISD wished to invite me for a cup of coffee, I will most likely oblige those gentlemen. After all, they might wish to consult me on the prospect of staging suicide hitsÂ…as in, whether itÂ’s a genuine suicide case or not.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mr Hata-san (edited 28 August 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mr Hata-san,<br><br>You forget that your most esteemed race has deviced a most honourable way to suicide - seppuku. For the uninitiated, seppuku involves stabbing the lower left corner of the abdomen with a short sword, slowly cutting it across until the right corner, then slicing up swiftly.

            <div class='col-md body'>Good Wednesday evening, I see that some of you are still alive.<br>Well, if the only reason you are still here is because you are too afraid to do it, you are at the right place.  Tonight I am going to show you how to make sure that your death is as swift or painless as you wish it to be -AND- without pesky interruption.<br><br>It is a crime to abet suicide, so you would not be able to find a book on how to kill yourself.  We can circumvent the problem by reading books meant for social workers to spot suicidal tendencies and rescue the suicide-wannabes.  These books are widely available in bookstores and national libraries.  I am holding one right now, in fact, it is titled "Suicidals: Spot 'Em, Stop 'Em"  Quirky title, eh?<br><br>There are many telltale signs which enable a good antisuicide personnel to spot you.  These are what not to do.<br><br>Don't, in a sudden, withdraw yourself from your circle of friends.  If you have to, give them a valid excuse like the lack of money for clubbing or a nagging pain on your right foot.<br><br>I know you may be eager to settle your worldly possession before your departure.  Writing will, paying off _all_debts and donating all your personal belonging to the Salvation Army are obvious suicide indicator.  On the other hand, you should apply for new credit cards, splurge on them, owe the ahlongsan an obscene amount of money at a more obscene rate and party on.  These will serve a few purposes, firstly, you will not be able to turn back because if you don't kill yourself first, the ahlongsan is going to make you die a horrible death.  Also, the suicide watchdogs will think that you are having fun in this life, let them do that.<br><br>Thirdly, don't write your goodbye notes in advance so that your maid might find it and hand it to your mom.  If you are serious about dying, a good bye note is to be written in no more than 5 minutes before your permanent departure.  Some cold feet people have also told almost all and sundry that they want to die.  These people want to be stopped and usually they are.  if you are not one of them, keep mum.<br><br>Oh, that's all the time I have.  Please attend the next lecture that will discuss the amount of time some of the popular methods will take to kill you until you really die.  This will be very important because, as Mr. Hata San has said, planning is of utmost importance.<br><br>See you again.   Perhaps.</div>
