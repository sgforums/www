            <div class='col-md body'>Hi this is my first mail on this forum.  someone kept asking me to write something here ;-)...well, here i am...so my first mail is around cyber-relationship har....<br><br>WEll, is really nice to think abt how your other party look like and if things go really deeper in...u might even lose yourself....Well have been in the modemming world for the past 6 yrs since the bbs days...( wonder if anyone still remember it).. Well, cyberlove do exit in this world...alot i can say..i kone a person who first love is a cybergal and they last for 5yrs and still going strong...from my last info, they are even preparing to get marriage..  WEll, i don't dare to say every relationship will be successful.  but i do believe that it does exist.  Getting to knoe each other niside the cyberworld is just the starting stone.  Wht will happen next will be just like normal countship. Sincere, caring, sensitive, and whtever things u need to prove that u like the other party. Cyber-love is just like a normal relationship just don't get too absorbed in it and things will turn out just fine...:-)In real life, a love relationship hurts tooo..! whts make a cyber-relationship an exception ,rite?<br><br>------------------<br><br>[This message has been edited by patie (edited 10-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Angel of Despair-<br>This decision is ultimately up to you. Maybe you can consider what is it that you like about her.... and what would matter most in the relationship.<br><br>It is very difficult to have an internet relationship and what's more she is not in the same country as you are in. I dun think that long distance relationships will be able to last.... after all, you are separated by so much... but if you really love her... like her for whatever she is, you could give it a try. If it does not work out, at least you know you have tried. There's a downside to this though, you may not be able to remain frens after that (depends on whether u still wann be her fren at that pt. of time)<br><br></div>
