            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>LOL, as if they know every single person who has done it.</blockquote>Actually from a tracking standpoint it is relatively easy , from the server or ip side. They have certain programs that can track certain behaviors ie, common ports the p2p programs use or a constant steam or kbps from a single source etc etc.<br><br>Only thing is that its just not possible to catch them all. Singapore prisons will be overflowing , young and old will be all caught... the courts will be filled to bursting with just this kind of cases.<br><br>Therefore they are just catching a few here a few there and smack them with heavy penalties in order to deter the rest from downloading.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think they are mainly going after people who distribute them after downloading? But still if the authorities want to enforce any laws, it should be first clearly drawn out.<br><br>Okay, I know going out to a pasir malam store to buy pirated cds is wrong.<br><br>But what about downloading on the internet? Which sites are legal, which sites are not?<br><br>What can you do with the music you downloaded legally?<br>-&gt; Can you burn CDs? Put it in your MP3 player?<br>If duplicating the song is illegal, would'nt it make all MP3 player owners, criminals if they put in copyrighted music?<br><br>What about buying original cds? Is ripping it to my computer illegal too?<br><br>What about buying CDs of foreign origin? eg China original cds<br><br>If anything is to be done to the public, guidelines should be laid down. There is too much grey area. It creates paranoia and makes people ask the qn: " SO WHAT CAN BE DONE?"<br><br>Is it true that in singapore, you can do whatever the govt doesnt say that you cannot do?</div>
