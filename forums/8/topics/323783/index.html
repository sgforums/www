              if you want to attract singaporean girls, don't grow facial hair
              if you want to attract caucasian &amp; black girls, grow some facial hair. the 3 day stubble to be precise.

              there are some pretty nice decent looking guys with stubble in the straits times article today.
              
              when you say asians, did you mean specifically east asians?

              <p>from my observation, majority of caucasian, malay, indian, hispanic and black girls in general prefer guys to be hairy, not just the stubble, but chest hair etc.</p>
              <p>once, i read an online poll of US women and was shocked to see like 90% of them prefer men to have chest hair, because i've always read local polls that girls here prefer men to be hairless on the chest.</p>
              <p>anyway, the Urban article report is in sync with my observations.</p>
              <p>japanese, chinese, korean, taiwanese, hong kong, Malaysian and SG-Chinese girls, on the other hand, prefer guys to be clean shaven and even metrosexual (for the case of Japanese girls).</p>
              <p>it's in the culture, i guess, cos' caucasian, malay and indian culture are more rugged and "tough", while Chinese / Japanese / Korean culture emphasizes more on refineness and suaveness.</p>
              <p>however, though, westernized chinese / SG-chinese / Japanese girls etc. tend to prefer men with hair and stubble, like their western counterparts, cos' their <br>mentality = banana / white-washed already.</p>
              <p>if your type of girls is XMM / SG-Chinese girls, then obviously there's no need to panick if you shave everyday, like me.</p>
              <p>who cares about ang-moh / mat / indian chicks etc.?</p>
              <p>and for those 8 pics of those guys with stubble, notice their face......a lot of them are not of pure ethnic race. Some of them is like Indonesian + Thailand mix, some is like Chinese + Rojak mix.....stubble tend to look good on guys with squarish chins etc.</p>
              <p>for this reason, caucasian and indian men tend to look more suited for stubbles.</p>
              <p>do you seriously think handsome Chinese guys like Wu Zun etc. would look good in a stubble, with his fair skin? OMFG WTF.</p>

              you can see in that article that increasing number of young sg chinese like men with stubble..
                                                                                      
              :-)
                                                                    
              I like my guy hairy.. and he is.. hehe..
              methinks men who able to grow facial hair are mature..
                                                                    
              by the way i still have memories of my dad's stubble when i was a little girl.. and when i was a kid, i loved to touch my dad's stubble.. so i guess my dad set the tone on masculinity for me.
              
              i used to like clean shaven guys when i was a kiddo, but sometime in secondary sch, preferences slowly changed. piere pnh is one example of asian/chinese who looks good with stubble.

              <p>LOL, nah.......stubble doesn't look good on ALL caucasians, only most of them.</p>
              <p>i'm sure you've seen really fair-skinned, pale, nerdy, thin, scrawny caucasians before too.</p>
              <p>imagine them with a stubble or moustache. look good? no way.</p>
              <p>on caucasians, they've a more squarish face than asians, so a lot of hair styles, regardless of stubble or whatever, suits them.</p>
              <p>look at Aaragon in Lord of the Rings. He looks good.</p>
              <p>James Bond played by Pierce Brosnan look very good.</p>
              <p>In Lord of the Rings, Legolas, played by Orlando Bloom, fair and white, supposed to be a pretty boy, look so much more handsome when he's clean shaven. In Pirates of the Carribean, however, he growns so much stubble and some beard and it's disgusting.</p>

              <p>from my observation, majority of caucasian, malay, indian,
              hispanic and black girls in general prefer guys to be hairy, not
              just the stubble, but chest hair etc.</p>
              <p>once, i read an online poll of US women and was shocked to see
              like 90% of them prefer men to have chest hair, because i've always
              read local polls that girls here prefer men to be hairless on the
              chest.</p>
              <p>anyway, the Urban article report is in sync with my
              observations.</p>
              <p>japanese, chinese, korean, taiwanese, hong kong, Malaysian and
              SG-Chinese girls, on the other hand, prefer guys to be clean shaven
              and even metrosexual (for the case of Japanese girls).</p>
              <p>it's in the culture, i guess, cos' caucasian, malay and indian
              culture are more rugged and "tough", while Chinese / Japanese /
              Korean culture emphasizes more on refineness and suaveness.</p>
              <p>however, though, westernized chinese / SG-chinese / Japanese
              girls etc. tend to prefer men with hair and stubble, like their
              western counterparts, cos' their<br> mentality = banana / white-washed already.</p>
              <p>if your type of girls is XMM / SG-Chinese girls, then obviously
              there's no need to panick if you shave everyday, like me.</p>
              <p>who cares about ang-moh / mat / indian chicks etc.?</p>
              <p>and for those 8 pics of those guys with stubble, notice their
              face......a lot of them are not of pure ethnic race. Some of them
              is like Indonesian + Thailand mix, some is like Chinese + Rojak
              mix.....stubble tend to look good on guys with squarish chins
              etc.</p>
              <p>for this reason, caucasian and indian men tend to look more
              suited for stubbles.</p>
              <p>do you seriously think handsome Chinese guys like Wu Zun etc.
              would look good in a stubble, with his fair skin? OMFG WTF.</p>
