            <div class='col-md body'>hooza. i bet this is in 'reply' to what i posted in another thread...<br>by educate, i dont mean the usual singapore version of saying 'this is right and this is wrong'.<br>i mean, my so called sex-ed in sec 3 was about what? BGR!!!! about not getting into a relationship because...it will affect our grades. TADA!!! wonderful! do you think that many people will care about grades? and whats wrong with being in a relationship at that age? they say we are not mature enough. kids at that age HATE to hear that. do you think they will listen? with the way they teach, NO ONE is going to listen.<br>this whole education thing in singapore has got to change because i feel that it is doing more harm than good.</div>

But bear in mind, it also create awareness. Not necessarily everyone will adhere to the teachings, but it makes a difference to some. And rather it does not make a difference to anyone at all, at least it creates awareness and makes a difference to some people. Education on smoking. Would you know the harm done by smoking without education? It creates awareness isn't it? But ultimately it is still your choice, whether to smoke or not. If you decide to smoke, do not blame education. Because I decided not to smoke thanks to education for making me aware about the harm done by smoking.<br>Pri 1, teacher says smoking is bad for health. You nod your head. In secondary, if teacher stops saying that smoking is bad, would you be reminded? Humans are like that. Learning is a lifelong process. You can never learn once. You learn everyday. "<strong>so why bother educating them again if they do not want to listen</strong> " If we don't try, who knows whether they will listen or not? Better save some rather than none at all..</div>
