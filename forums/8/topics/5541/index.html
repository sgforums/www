            <div class='col-md body'>True....<br><br>Individualism is meant for everybody, but the reason why society works is that most people only take it so far.  I believe, and it's not hard to, that most people are followers.  Then we have the few leaders.  Then we have the individuals...<br><br>I know u guys will like the sound of this...Lonewolves.....  They live in society but not with it.  They don't or anren't able to weave themselves into the fabric of society for whatever reason.  Their thinking is different and they find that society doesn't provide the "elasticity" to be able to accept things for what they are or what they aren't, or hat should or shouldn't be.  They failed society, society failed them.<br><br>They live on the edge of it and are not, by choice and most times by circumstance, social creatures.<br><br>They differ from the gangsters or hard-core ahbengs, ah lians.  While the Bengs live to create an antithesis to the whole idea of society...(we know a lot of them don't know what this means anyway), the lonewolf is more passive.  He has learned to thrive, if not like being alone.  Sometimes he may fell lonely, but a lot of times, it's ok.  Deep down, he's an idealist and a hard-core romatic waiting for someone to come along to bust thru that quiet shell so that he can let loose his considerable emotions/energy stored away day after day since his inception.<br><br>This is the lone wolf.  Outcast from the normal stream, enemy of complacency, and quite respected by ahbengs (though they won't say it) for being able to handle himself ...such a manly thing.<br><br>But goddamn it, the girls just don't go for these types anymore. Maybe seen as too boring,quiet.  I remember when women used to like that quiet longing look in a man.  Now it's bright shirts, buck teeth and sharp combs.  Hot damn!<br><br>Ps- I'm sure all u loners out there liked my description...A bit romanticised, but cool none-the-less....:-)<br><br>"no army can withstand an idea whose time has come."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well no comment on your explanation firewire, but the SNAG is over-hyped up I feel.....with not much justification either.<br><br>Do girls really want SNAG ? Or do they simply long for certain aspects of one ?<br><br>One girl once told me that she preferred a guy to be slightly MCP and slightly SNAG but she didn't know the % of each. Which goes to show that if a guy is 100 % SNAG he won't be well-accepted either.<br><br>As for the topic of being yourself, I have always behaved in a way that portrays my true self, which contributes to my "downfall" sometimes. Girls are not used to a guy who shows emotions too much and when I do that, the reaction is more adverse than understanding. Nonetheless, I still will not behave pretentiously in order to generate more goodwill...because I'd rather people accept me for who I am.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>That's my side of the coin.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many women will gladly admit that most of the time they really don't know what they want.  We all know that they always like to say they prefer this and that(SNAG), but when presented with the choice, the snag is standing there alone.<br><br>I don't know, from expereiecne, women know exactly what they want in terms of physical aspects, but when it comes down to the personality/character, many of them are only guessing at what they want.  That brings about a whole new light on women already.  Maybe that's why so many of them, especially the pretty ones, end up with guys for all the wrong reasons.  Physically they know what they want, but....<br><br>And wouldn't any of us feel shitty, even IF one fine girl marries us, knowing that u were the last choice on her list.  It's like she considere everyone more worthy than u to make her happy and now that she's getting old-er...and slowing down...better settle for the best guy who can take care of me the best....<br><br>pointing a gun to my temple and pulling the trigger slowly.  sorry  a bit off track there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me attempt to paint something into the many minds here.<br><br>SNAG, the sensitive new age guy, tends to be more emotional. They can be a girl's best friend, ability to treat her well as a princess, understand her innermost feelings, cry and laugh together, willingness to take on the traditional feminine duties, etc.<br><br>Enigma, SNAGs are not fantasies, there are real-life SNAGs around you, you just need to observe. But just be what you are, changing personality isn't exactly the most easy task on earth.<br><br>Firewire, you may lack the experience of meeting enough women. Some women know exactly what they want for an ideal bf's personality, but they do not have powers to predict the physical aspects of the person who carries that personality. From your past relationships, have you formed a picture of the personality you really want for your life? If you are still brooding over why girls prefer bengs to nice guy, the very simple reason is you haven't met enough girls.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Musicwhiz, your circle of girl frens may not be used to an emotional guy. However, I beg to differ, there are girls who prefer the sensitivity of guys who can express their emotions. Between genders, there are already so much difference in thoughts, wouldn't a SNAG be a better choice for girls?<br><br>Imagine one day, the boy tells the girl, "Let me tell you, I don't like to cook. Period." It's not because the boy had bad experiences with cooking, it's just the way some boys are brain-washed from young that girls must do the cooking. Actually there's nothing wrong in this situation, it boils down to the willingness between couples to accept how each other behave, and that is why some girls prefer MCPs, some prefer SNAGs. Personality preference.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mei, may I ask you something?<br><br>Why do girls nowadays (I say nowadays because it is not happening 5 yrs ago) is asking more and more from guys rather than asking oneself to improve one's quality?<br><br>Wait! I know that you are going to protest, just hang on for a while.<br><br>There are many cases that I've seen with my personal eyes of people around me. Guys are doing all the sensitive things, being caring, being touching, being romantics, being capable of doing all housework, being financially very stable. On the other hand, girls just conclude everything in one sentence "It's not in my blood." Or another sentence, "If you don't want to do, don't do. Nobody is forcing you to do."<br><br>You could argue that women have been "suffering" for many years and it's about time for "revenge".<br><br>And my story goes on. One day, girls start saying things like "You are not a man at all, you always do what I want you to do. Where is your character? I don't like guys without character."<br><br>And there it goes again, it becomes another guy's fault. Why? Because they don't act like a man, they don't behave like a man, they don't scold their girls like a real man? They don't ....<br><br>Bottom line is, you get something, you lose something. Life is fair, in some way though not always.<br><br>I guess it still drills down to what is being expected from guys and girls in a relationship.<br><br>The worst thing is, on top of that, guys that are already a SNAG must still pocess good physical outlook and shape and ... blar blar blar.<br><br>When is all this going to end ...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So let me get this right - a SNAG is generally just a "nice guy"??? From the definitions given, i'd suppose there's no particular quality except the exclusion of "arseholes".<br><br>Which brings me to the fact that I believe that the sexual roles in our society have tried to develop, but have instead broken down. Women wanted to get out of the rut of a lack of education, etc. Men wanted to get more in touch with their emotional side. But somewhere, people have screwed it all up. I believe that a bunch of women got educated, took a sniff at power, got addicted, formed the movement called feminism, which had the aim of raising the social standing of women by PUTTING MEN DOWN. Shit, fundamental principle of society broken! DON'T PUT DOWN, BUILD UP!<br><br>So the balance (of sorts) that we once had is now a mess, neither men NOR women know what is REALLY expected of them socially and the rest of us who were born into this era are groping around in the dark for a PLACE. Trying and failing, trying and failing and eventually giving up.<br><br>Heck, I don't really blame us for this mess, in fact I'd EXPECTED it of the human race. The question now is - What the hell do we do now?<br><br>So can anyone answer me these questions three?<br><br><ol type="1"><br>[*]What is the woman's role in society?<br>[*]What is the man's role in society?<br>[*]How can we get everyone to understand this?<br></ol><br><br>------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Love never fails."</span><br><strong>Grail</strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1.  Women can be and do whatever they want.  Their roles are what they decide it should be...with husbands, partners..whoever else.  It is their indivual choice.  They have an equal say if they want it.<br><br>2. The man's role is to be the jack of all trade.  He's more burdened than the woman is in this sense.  Just read an Article inside Passion Magazine about that.  Not only is he expected to be a homemaker now, but must also be the major breadwinner in the house...janitor, plumber, TV repairman, cook, LAundry, etc...and more.<br><br>3. Open up ur mind.  "Let go of everything u know and everything u think u know...Just free ur mind..."  see things as they are.  Humans have this uncanny ability to see things that happens in his world through the filter of his eyes.  He sees what he wants to see (she also) and not what actually is there.  When u let go of all ur ideas and beliefs in things and all u think u know, u will see things as they really are.  Acceptance and understanding can only come about by letting go of all prejudice,or if u like, Pre-Judgement.<br><br>The problem is that most people cannot see beyond themsleves or go beyond how they were raised.  Does anyone here study Zen teachings?  Would u like 2 comment on this idea?<br><br>BTW-Feminism isn't about raising the status of women...AS with most radical groups, their goals are purely for their own ends...but they like to put a face on it to make themselves look better.  Feminism brings down men and women both.  I'm not afraid to make dumb remarks about them as most of them care nothing about women's issues.  It's only about their own issues, the hell with any women who disagrees or stand in their way.<br><br>It's just like anti-abortion activists.  They picket and fight for the right of babies to live.  Their goal is so that humans can have the chance to live, yet they can go and assassinate doctors, blow up women and families who have had abortions and etc...For people who are pro-life, they sure like to take it....<br><br>...Feminism is like this...I hope that all u feminists know this.  what u think is feminism isn't.  If u believe in women's rights, then don't work to put people down as Grail said.  Build up!!!Not down.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi! this is my 2nd post.My first was to the overwhelming "why do girls like bengs" topic.Now it seems that we are discussing about the other end of the fulcrum,a SNAG.I really wish to bring in the topic of do women REALLY wan a SNAG for BF but due to time constrain i'll leave it at the BEAUTY &amp; THE BEAST conclusion for now.<br><br>Now I'll just wish to try &amp; answer Grail's SUPER complicated ques. about the roles of M&amp;W in the society.From my tiny and unused mind sparks forth some interesting thoughts which I think is worth sharing.See bascially the crux of the ques. is that there more then ONE TYPE of society on this world,thus depending on the different nature of the society there evoles different roles of M&amp;W.<br><br>From what I can think of,there are bascially these fews kinds of society around.....<br><br>1)pre-historic--the caveMAN time where the roles of both gender are very well define.MALE would hunt and fight while feMALE would cook and breed.(Nice and simple...no complication,no confusing issues  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>2)Victorian times--Man are supposed to be GENTLEman while woman are to be LADIES.I open door,U step through.I display my wealth &amp; power &amp; status &amp;....... and U display your cleavarge and demure smile.(very sterotype but well define and agreed on by the mass)<br><br>3)Ancient China--Man the master and woman his pet.U exist only for my pleasure and to help carry my precious lines while I'll fed U.(not fair i'ld say but well,its still understood by everybody those are the rules &amp; regulations of the NATURAL world)<br><br>4)Amazon--Woman the master and man her breeding stocks(WOW!!)U help me populate my village and just maybe i'll not kill u...TONITE  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">...well from what i know their society is still surviving..<br><br>5)American spirit--EVERYONE are born EQUAL(oh U mean there's ppl with colours out there??sorrie,forgot to include them in the pledge <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">your gender doesn't really matter,as long as I have more money to sue U then I'm the master.(a volatile genders role but as long as everyone knows that it's okay)<br><br>6)Japanese world--oh...we all KNOW what Japanese society is like,so i shall save some typing strenght on that wonderful society :Ãž<br><br>and FINALLY,our poor confuse SINGAPORE society....<br><br>7)SINAGPORE society---SORRIE...lack of info,cannot compute solutions...TINK!<br>haha,actually I think that we living here has it all.Some family have the china kind,some the Japs kind,some the US kind and there might even be a few pre-historic laying around.<br><br>The problem lie in the fact that we are a migrated society who hasn't a common roots or cultural backgrounds,thus when it comes to defining the roles of man &amp; woman in society there's just no establised route to follow.Wat's more our society is so highly educated that we had SO MUCH info of what man and woman is SUPPOSED to do that we are being overloaded and thus look at the confuse state we are in now.<br><br>Possible solution(personel)--<br><br>there is no DEFINITE roles for both gender in the world.We just have to find one whom our PARTNERS &amp; US are comfortable with.Notice that i'm assuming that we all eventually get to settle down with our love ones,so that's what matters.If u like being pampered and taken care of,jump into the victorian style,if u like being in charge,take the amazon roles  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>One really don't have to worry too much about HOW I should behave in the society acting out my prescribe roles...bullshit!Just follows your heart and it will take u on an automatic pilot course your Shang Ri La.<br>HOWEVER I'm definitely NOT advocating the FREE ALL YOUR DESIRES route,there must always be your own personal untouchable codes of conduct that will see u through to your deathbed.Without those,one might as well go drown in the sea or jump from plane.it'll be the same,U're just FLOATING around in the currents until U hit bottom and that's it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Well I think I was being very carried away by my sharing of personal views.Hope I help a LITTLE in answering your ques. Grail,sorrie for so long-winded an assay.Hope my piece of work can generate some comments and remarks which might help me solidify my forming personal codes of honour....take care everyone!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i thk SNAGs have always existed but it's just tt more and more of them are being more open abt it now tt it's acceptable to society. but just like the definition for bengs, most cant really agree on what exactly constitutes a SNAG. for me, i wont want a SNAG for a bf. tt doesnt mean i want a complete MCP, but some MCP-qualities wld be gd.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> i wld respect a guy who isnt afraid of expressing his feelings or being emotional, but i dont want a guy who cries at the drop of the pin and acts more emotional than i do!<br>to me, the perfect SNAG wld be someone who is sensitive to the feelings of the ppl ard him w/o becoming overly paranoid or over-analysiing everythg. he's confident, and secure enough abt himself and his masculinity to express his emotions freely without worrying abt what his peers wld thk of him. he doesnt go out of the way to be nice to girls (ie becoming a doormat) but knows the true meaning of chivalry i.e. does simple thgs like opening doors, pulling chairs, offering to hold shopping bags, etc.<br>i dont know if this guy exists, maybe he'll only remain a figment of my imagination, but IMHO, this isnt only the perfect SNAG, but also, the perfect guy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah... so what about the answers to my questions? Judging from Firewire's and Blacklightning's replies... we don't really know! I think the "follow your heart" thing is a little too idealistic. What do you get when everyone "follows their hearts"? Even with a prescribed code of conduct you will still get a world full of people who want to do things their own way, and when your "way" isn't the same as someone else's "way", the have a WORLD of misery.<br><br>So the solution? Give way. The next question - When? When do we give way? There's no timetable or rulebook or "situation check". It's always different. And since it doesn't hurt to give way, I guess the safest answer is "Give way ALL the time." And THAT means you should never have it "your way". Selfishness goes into the gutter.<br><br>I've got a solution, but since it won't work because nobody is humble enough to accept it, then it's maybe better left unsaid?<br><br>------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Love never fails."</span><br><strong>Grail</strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's 2 basic views i have to present here:-<br><br>1) Difficulties increase the nearer we approach our goal. -Goethe<br><br>This is to answer airhole's query about how strange it is that it's hard to get what you want. So here's my answer. That few things are easy. Goethe is correct.<br>So why stop? This would be the romantic (some would say deluded) point of view: that someone out there is the RIGHT ONE, just that you haven't met that person yet.<br>And if you aren't the romantic type, and subscribe to Grail's suggestion of giving way; well, it's almost a declaration of retreating in the face of failure. A compromise. Why compromise?<br>NB: The choice, though, is ultimately up to your discretion; as to which is the better choice depends on the situation.<br><br>2) The greater the emphasis upon perfection-the further it recedes. - Haridas Chaudhuri<br><br>True SNAGs are rare enough as it is but as many here have rightly pointed out, they usually aren't Mr Right for most people.<br>And why demand for such people in the first place? Is it for the perfect man?<br>It's probably true enough that SG men of older generations tend to be more chauvinistic, so women of younger generations prefer to cast off such restraints.<br>This is probably a good thing. But they at the same time want qualities from both -  not difficult, I might add - and yet point fingers at either extremity. (This might just be a matter of personal preference and inaccurate representation, but.. i believe otherwise)<br><br>I believe, hence, that the whole business of the SNAG is almost bullshit. Guys call SNAGs faggots, gals call SNAGs wimps. The single redeeming principle is that chauvinism should be tempered with sensitivity; it was the whole aim of the SNAG movement anyway. People who are largely chauvinistic or largely SNAG tend to suffer when being chosen as a partner. Truth is, nobody likes an extremist.<br><br>Anything i missed?</div>
