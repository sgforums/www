We are discussing about lifeÂ’s are at menacing point whereby taxi drivers do not sense or experience agree on such because, they are always behind the playful wheels...

Majority affects minority, this is the always tradition in Singapore. It is like a cycle but I beg your pardon. Are you currently saying it to yourself rather then bring it up as a Contrast? I moderate people individually rather than in Bulk counts. As such, this complain should be written attention to Taxi Company and copy to LTA and Traffic Police. Since they do not cherish what they have been given, why should we be so troubled and forgiving about?

I learn to forgive when those are pardonable. Do you ask for forgiveness when you have committed manslaughter in front of a judge without jail sentence? Significantly, the judge will be receiving lot of KARMA in future because he always jail the wrong people and cane the precise rapists? Well, we should not have implemented lawsÂ… Because too much KARMASÂ… Lost counts already.<br><br>I feel that I am not ignorant regarding such debate, argument or whatever with laws regulation as the ruling or dispute bottom-line. Everybody needs to live on earth safely and happily on earth... Not just taxi drivers for GOD SAKE.

With such approach and problematical driving skills, I will land you with nowhere else to go. How about that? Tell me your Company and Plate number. I just need to prove you wrong once.

But remember, you are the shrinking balls and not the BOSS. You are just a puppet under controlled by the somehow said Privatized cum Government Division Sector.<br><br>More and more vocational license will be out and most under educated people are having it.
