Two-time Oscar winner Michael Douglas will smooch Ash in ‘Racing the Monsoon’ Indo-US joint venture.<br><br>Hollywood star and two time Oscar winner Michael Douglas is in Mumbai to tap possibilities to act in an Indo-US joint venture to star Aishwarya Rai. Titled Racing the Monsoon, the film is an international venture, co-produced by Sahara One Motion Pictures and Percept Picture Company.<br><br>Touted as an action adventure, the film will be directed by Steven Carr, who has to his credit films like Daddy Daycare, Doctor Doolittle 2 starring Eddie Murphy.<br><br>Bollywood diva Aishwarya Rai (under discussion) might play the female lead opposite Douglas in the film. Douglas, who will be playing the main lead in the film, is also producing the film. He says "Aishwarya and I met in Los Angeles last year - some months ago, where it was discussed that we should work together. Hope things work out. I’ve seen bits of Bride and Prejudice and Raincoat starring Aishwarya, but I must admit that I’m no expert on Indian films or Bollywood"<br><br>Elaborating further on the movie Douglas says, "Racing the Monsoon will be on the lines of Romancing the Stone and Jewel of the Nile. Right now we are developing the screenplay and hope to begin production in early 2006.<br><br>Four to six months will go in pre production aspects of filming following. After that we will begin shooting the film in India in Amby Valley Sahara Lake City. It will be the first American co-production to happen in India." Being a Hollywood venture, the film however boasts of a large number of Indian actors as explained by Douglas. "As the movie is based in India, there will be several Indian casts besides Aishwarya. Besides me, there will be one more foreign element in the film," says he. Interestingly, Douglas also looks forward to the song and dance rituals considered mandatory of any Indian films for the forthcoming venture.<br><br>"I have had an interesting and wonderful education on Indian music and the movie better have some songs," he humoured. He is, however, evasive on the budget of the film, which is rumoured to gross close to $20 million. "Investing requires a lot of outsourcing of jobs and since we are at the preliminary stage, we do not have the exact figures. It's difficult to comment on the budget at this stage" says he. But why a film based in India and with an Indian star cast considering his Hollywood stature, was the one question, which he claims has diverse reasons.<br><br>"Culturally India is making a large impact in the US. Indian culture, design, fashion and now films are all splashed everywhere in the world. I have been closely following and studying Indian culture and I'm quite fascinated by it. And when the subject of films came up, Percept showed interest through which I came to know about the Sahara group. Since I was looking for partners in India to do films here, I was happy that things worked out this way" says he.</div>
