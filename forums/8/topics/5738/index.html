            <div class='col-md body'>When a relationship fails, and when it is not an amicable break, the chance of one of the parties still feeling sore after the breakup is quite high...and may probably do some nasty things to his/her ex (from trivals like making prank calls to extremes like murder(!!)). Have anyone of you been the victim or the "executor" of such love "crimes"? Or maybe just harboured such a thought? Share wif us...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I for one have always believed that revenge is never the answer...look at the the great Shakesperean revenge tragedies...when things go wrong in a relationship, it's always sad, especially if the breakup was a rough one. But if you ever truly had feelings for your ex, I don't think you'd want to hurt him/her in that way, right? Besides, it would be awfully juvenile to want to "get back at" someone like that. Although it;s understandable how or why some people would...after all, everyone's human, and the kneejerk reaction to being hurt by someone would probably be to want to hurt that person back...I think it all stems back to when we were young...I remember seeing parents telling their kids to "beat the floor" after they fall down...kind of to cheer the kid up, but I think inadvertently it plants the idea that the solution to alleviating pain is to hurt someone or something else back...the whole idea of revenge is rather barbaric, isn't it.<br><br>------------------<br>Love &amp; poison,<br>Suede<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I for one had a very ugly ending with my first love. Because of a third party. Was really pissed and wanted revenge. After a while.....like one year, I realised that if she did not do what she did, we would have dragged on the unhappy relationship....which would have been meaningless.....<br>With this thoughts in mind, I have forgiven her. I mean that I hold no ill thoughts of her. I think it is better to feel this way then to be filled with hatred.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Sparkle :<br>As I have told you about my story in "All about Love", I guess, I have to be honest that I do harbour thoughts of revenge for a while. But at the end of the day, I convinced myself that I should not do it and be a prodigal. Maybe because I have encountered worst situations (being betrayed by people who are close to me) before, and I manage to give up the thought of vegenance. Even if I could cause havoc in their lives, it will not change anything. She will never come back to me at all.. I don't think I will get a sense of satisfaction even if I will revenge in the first place.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find it slightly ironic that suede was talking abt how revenge is not the answer etc, and then sign off as Love and poison! Not picking a fight or anything, but i couldn't help laughing! hahaha... sorry suede, i know the two things prob don't have anything to do with each other, it just jumped out at me and now i can't stop smiling.. heh<br><br>Love and Poison... two worlds apart it seems, but then again, maybe it does follow in the sequence of things esp when pple break up? then again, i think love IS a poision, taken in great quantities, it can kill someone... that's prob how they coined the term "lovesick". Love is like a disease... And notice how cupid strikes you with an arrow?? Not fairy dust BUT A FREAKING ARROW! what is with love and all these morbid connotations?? Any takers??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well a realtionship fails becos of one reason or other,but even if u had revenge would u feel happy<br>well u should be glad that u were once together and had many happy times,times that u treasure,well being together means u like each other ,well being apart does mean the person doesnt like u anymore,every breakup has its own reason,but i belive that all u have to remember is that u were happy together.so why take revenge when the realtionship is broken up<br>remember he/she was the person u once loved or maybe the person that u still love<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>there is never a rain thats never stop<br>the sun will never not rise<br>tomorrow is another day<br>Gambette ^_^</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To MsSeuss:<br>"i think love IS a poision, taken in great quantities, it can kill someone..."<br><br>Love and lust belongs to Desire, and Desire is always cruel.... That is why some people wanted revenge when they are hurt by the opposite party. Reminds me of the typical plots in Hong Kong mega-production dramas, where the main villain of the story is usually starting off as a nice guy, who lost a gal to someone else, and subsequently become evil... Even though they have a bad ending, I sympathize with them in the process.<br></div>
