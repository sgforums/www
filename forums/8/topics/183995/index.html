            <div class='col-md body'>Suicide is a very difficult matter that should be approached with compassion and understanding, with the ultimate goal that the would-be suicidee must always be advised against committing it, unless it is medical euthanasia (ie. because of an incurable, agonizing medical condition).<br><br>I'm a teacher myself, so I'm keenly aware of the difficulties that can drive a student, a teacher, or anyone to suicide. I've counselled attempted suicide cases before. And I tell everyone (all my students, and everyone on every forum), if you ever come to the point where you consider suicide, come speak with me first. I won't be able to solve your problem of course (if it can be solved so easily, you wouldn't need to even consider suicide!), but I can advise you on the reality of suicide, and what happens to you after a suicide, and the consequences on your future lifetimes. (This is non-religious advice, because reality exists beyond the need for any religion). And also, possible advice for what you can do towards making your current situation better for yourself. There's always something you can do.<br><br>Remember, if you're ever considering suicide, you have to take better care of yourself and love yourself more. Life is precious for you, make it so.<br><br>I can be contacted via my website here :<br><a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com" rel="nofollow">http://infinity.usanethosting.com</a><br><a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/main.htm" rel="nofollow">http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Heart.Of.God/main.htm</a></div>
