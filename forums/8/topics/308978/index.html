              <p>It's really a turn off, especially when I know who's the person who gave my msn address to someone else, but without my permission.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>
              <p>I just blocked someone in msn and he gave my msn address to his friends. I blindly accepted one request and what I got is preaching about why I shouldn't block him on msn just like that and the bullshit goes on. Of course, I blocked that person after that.</p>
              <p>This only makes me feel disgusted and annoyed. No point doing that. It's my own free will to block whoever I like and I don't need to give prior warning.</p>
              <p>This only seems just like a childish act.</p>

              <p><br>i think we do not really know what happened. Its too quick to judge for now.  Miss Tiny may be in the wrong. I mean in the 1st place, were they on chatting terms? If yes, then they are considered online friends already.   </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, unless the guy did something lewd like suggesting to have sex, or step out of the line, then sure he should be banned. But, if everything was normal, the guy behaved as how an online friend would, then i think it is kind of not right for you to block him sneakily.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sure, it's your right to choose to terminate any friendship, but you could have informed him. Its like the same as dealing with your real life friends. Do you just decide to stop contacting your friend and cease contact? if you got anything buay shong, you say it out and let your friend know. Does it kill you to inform him that you want to end this friendship?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is that how you treat friendships so lightly? If so, what about the higher level of relationships like marriage or kinship? Do you just divorce your husband by say silently move out of the house? With no proper accounting? Do you just decide to say disown one of your family members, and unilaterally say move out, or change your surname?</p>

              <p><br>understood. cuz no chemistry for a relationship, no common interests or poor 1st impression, the person is doomed to a death sentence. so block? if persistent then maybe block lor. can see that point of view.</p>

              <p>Ok, considered it's my fault for abruptly blocking him on msn. We are considered strangers because we haven't met each other in real life before. It's just like how you met someone online, and then I add you, you add me.</p>
              <p>We have been chatting less than 2 weeks. I don't want to be so direct as to "Hey, I want to block you now." Isn't that tactless?</p>
              <p>Fine, he didn't do anything wrong and I didn't sound unpleased during the conversation because most of the time I just "Lol" and short replies and had nothing much else to say. The reason why I wanted to block him is because I don't really enjoy talking to him yet he had the impression that I did. What do you want me to do? Enjoy continue to talk to him?</p>
              <p>I don't wanna continue this kind of conversation anymore so I decided to block him.</p>
              <p>Don't talk to me about treating my friendships lightly because you are not me. This is 2 different matters. Moreover, I don't really consider him as a real friend. In virtual reality, nothing is possible.</p>
              <p>That's it, I don't wish to elaborate any further. Period.</p>

              <p>misstiny, fair enough. but still, i do not believe that guy is so stupid to believe you enjoyed the chat with just your mere "lol" replies. There must be something else u did during the chat to mislead him to believe you enjoyed the chat too.  like you said you didnt sound UNPLEASED. Why the hell didn't u sound unpleased then? DUH, he will get the hint. So the fact is that you may cover it up to make urself look good in this forum. that is your own problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>bottomline, it is about the simple rules of engagement in life dealing w frenships, online or offline.you say you are clueless about telling him u wanna block him, so does that mean you don't tell him? So oh, a surgeon discovers a huge tumour in his patient but decide not to inform cz he is clueless on wat to say? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it is not so hard to turn down a person tactfully in your case here. How about telling him something like, <em>"hey, i do not think this is working for us. its good you stop messaging me frm now on. if u insist, i will block you online." As long as your words are polite with no vulgarities, it should work.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having said so much, i believe in reality, you may also have problems retenting your own friends right? So why are you here in forums? I believe to find online friends to ease your lonliness right? If so, how can you treat an online fren in this case so shabbily? Who else in sgforums will now ever consider to befren you?</p>

              <p>I can't believe you have split personality and using this nick to tell me all these bullshit stuff. Come on, get a life!

              <p>And FYI, I think you are the one who's lonely and seeking some pleasure in chatting up with girls. I don't have problem with my friends, you are the one who has all sorts of problems.</p>
