These are small and fairly humanoid with reptilian skin. They have very human like eyes with some "Asian" characteristics.<br><br>Next are the <a href="http://www.lucyindisguise.com/Images/CMSMA163.jpg"><span style="color: #5588aa;">Greys</span></a>. Those classic large headed critters, whose black eyes take up the majority of their face. They are the worker class beings. They do most of the dirty work like abducting and probing.<br><br>In 3rd place we have the <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~pagli/mantis.gif"><span style="color: #5588aa;">Ancients</span></a>. These tall creatures have an almost, Praying Mantis, appearance.<br><br>The <a href="http://dubroom.org/illustrations/nordic_demons.gif"><span style="color: #5588aa;">Nordics</span></a> follow up with their Fabio look alikes. These beings resemble humans in every way, except that they are perfect. The men look fit and athletic and the women have great jugs.<br><br>The <a href="http://www.aliensecrets.com/as/hybrids.girl.png"><span style="color: #5588aa;">Hybrids</span></a>, from what I understand resemble children with very fine hair.<br><br>The sixth race of alien is the <a href="http://politisink.com/pics/2006/04/sleestack2.jpg"><span style="color: #5588aa;">Reptilian</span></a>. These tend to be humanoid in proportion, but have huge eyes and even bigger mouths. They have three toes and probably a freaky forked snake tongue.<br><br>The final classification is the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Dimension/7127/alneo.jpg"><span style="color: #5588aa;">Neonate</span></a>. These small, fetus like creatures seem to be the most intelligent and resemble the small creatures on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Close-Encounters-Anniversary-Ultimate-Blu-ray/dp/B000VECACG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1218863109&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="color: #5588aa;">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</span></a>.</p></div>

              <p><span id="Childhood_and_youth" class="mw-headline">Childhood and youth</span></p>
              <p>Mullin was born in <a title="Salinas, California" href="/wiki/Salinas,_California"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Salinas, California</span></a> but was raised in <a title="Santa Cruz, California" href="/wiki/Santa_Cruz,_California"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Santa Cruz</span></a>. His father, a <a title="World War II" href="/wiki/World_War_II"><span style="color: #0645ad;">World War II</span></a> veteran, was strict but not <a title="Child abuse" href="/wiki/Child_abuse"><span style="color: #0645ad;">abusive</span></a>. He frequently discussed his heroic war activities and showed his son how to use a gun at an early age. Mullin had numerous friends at school and was voted "Most Likely to Succeed" by his classmates. However, shortly after graduating from high school, one of his best friends was killed in a car accident, and Mullin was devastated.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></span></a></sup> He built a shrine to his deceased friend in his bedroom. Later he expressed fears that he was homosexual, even though he had a long-term girlfriend at the time.</p>
              <p>In 1969, at the age of 21, Mullin allowed his family to commit him to a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Mental hospital" href="/wiki/Mental_hospital"><span style="color: #0645ad;">mental hospital</span></a>. Over the next few years, he would enter various institutions, but would discharge himself after only a short stay. He extinguished cigarettes on his own skin, attempted to enter the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Priesthood" href="/wiki/Priesthood"><span style="color: #0645ad;">priesthood</span></a>, and got evicted from an apartment after he repeatedly pounded on the floor, shouting at people who were not there.</p>
              <p>Many years later, famed FBI profiler <a class="mw-redirect" title="Robert K. Ressler" href="/wiki/Robert_K._Ressler"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Robert K. Ressler</span></a> would assert that Mullin had <a title="Paranoia" href="/wiki/Paranoia"><span style="color: #0645ad;">paranoid</span></a> <a title="Schizophrenia" href="/wiki/Schizophrenia"><span style="color: #0645ad;">schizophrenia</span></a>, manifesting as early as his senior year of high school, and could have been accelerated by the use of <a title="Cannabis" href="/wiki/Cannabis"><span style="color: #0645ad;">cannabis</span></a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="LSD" href="/wiki/LSD"><span style="color: #0645ad;">LSD</span></a>, or <a class="mw-redirect" title="Amphetamines" href="/wiki/Amphetamines"><span style="color: #0645ad;">amphetamines</span></a>.<sup id="cite_ref-RESSLER_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RESSLER-2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <h2><span id="Murder_spree" class="mw-headline">Murder spree</span></h2>
              <p>By 1972, Mullin was 25 and had moved back in with his parents in Santa Cruz. By now he was hearing voices in his head that told him an earthquake was imminent, and that only through murder could he save California. Mullin's birthday, April 18, was the anniversary of the <a title="1906 San Francisco earthquake" href="/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake"><span style="color: #0645ad;">1906 San Francisco earthquake</span></a>, which he thought was very significant.</p>
              <p>Mullin believed that the war in Vietnam had produced enough American deaths to forestall earthquakes as a sort of blood sacrifice to nature, but that with the war winding down so much by late 1972, he would need to start killing people in order to have enough deaths to keep the earthquake away.<sup id="cite_ref-RESSLER_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RESSLER-2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>On October 13, 1972, Mullin went out and beat a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Homeless" href="/wiki/Homeless"><span style="color: #0645ad;">homeless</span></a> man to death with a baseball bat. The man, 55, had been hitchhiking and Mullin struck him down after tricking him into looking at the car engine.<sup id="cite_ref-RESSLER_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RESSLER-2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Mullin was to claim later that the victim was <a title="Jonah" href="/wiki/Jonah"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Jonah</span></a> from the <a title="Bible" href="/wiki/Bible"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Bible</span></a>, and that he had sent Mullin a <a title="Telepathy" href="/wiki/Telepathy"><span style="color: #0645ad;">telepathic</span></a> message saying, "Pick me up and throw me over the boat. Kill me so that others will be saved."<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></span></a></sup> The man's body was found the next day.<sup id="cite_ref-RESSLER_2-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RESSLER-2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The next victim was Mary Guilfoyle, 24, whom Mullin also picked up hitchhiking. He stabbed her to death while he was driving. Later, he dumped her corpse in woods at the side of the road and sliced open her stomach. He then strung her intestines among tree branches to examine them for "pollution." When Guilfoyle's body was found, she was mistakenly thought to be a victim of <a title="Edmund Kemper" href="/wiki/Edmund_Kemper"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Edmund Kemper</span></a>, another serial killer operating in the area at the time. Because her skeletal remains were not found for several months, even though she was killed only two weeks after the male hitchhiker, police did not link the murders.<sup id="cite_ref-RESSLER_2-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RESSLER-2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Only four days later, on a Thursday in November, Mullin claimed his third victim when he went to confess his sins. In a delusional state, he believed the priest, Father Henri Tomei, wanted to volunteer to be his next sacrifice to keep away the earthquakes. He beat, kicked, and stabbed the priest to death. Father Tomei bled to death in the confessional while a parishioner watched Mullin run away. The witness description did not help the police.<sup id="cite_ref-RESSLER_2-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RESSLER-2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>After that, Mullin decided to join the <a title="United States Marine Corps" href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps"><span style="color: #0645ad;">U.S. Marines</span></a>, and passed the physical and psychiatric tests. However, he was refused entry when it was found out that he had a number of minor arrests for his bizarre and disruptive behavior in the past. This rejection fueled Mullin's paranoid delusions of conspiracies, behind which he believed was a powerful group of <a class="mw-redirect" title="Hippies" href="/wiki/Hippies"><span style="color: #0645ad;">hippies</span></a>.</p>
              <p>By January, 1973, Mullin had stopped using drugs, and blamed them for his problems.<sup id="cite_ref-RESSLER_2-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RESSLER-2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Mullin had purchased several guns and decided to kill Jim Gianera, a high school friend who had sold him marijuana. However, when Mullin went to Gianera's house on January 25, 1973, he found that his old friend had moved away. The house was now occupied by Kathy Francis, and she gave him Gianera's new address. There, Mullin killed both Gianera and his wife with shots to the head, then stabbed their bodies repeatedly. Mullin then went back to Francis' house, where he shot and killed her and her two sons, aged 9 and 4. Because Francis' husbandâwho was away at the timeâwas a drug dealer, the five murders were thought to be motivated by <a class="mw-redirect" title="Drug trafficking" href="/wiki/Drug_trafficking"><span style="color: #0645ad;">drug trafficking</span></a>. It would later be argued by prosecutors that the murder of Kathy Francis eliminated Mullin's claims of <a title="Insanity defense" href="/wiki/Insanity_defense"><span style="color: #0645ad;">not guilty by reason of insanity</span></a> because he killed her to remove a witness who could link him to the Gianera murders. In one published account of these murders, however, an FBI profiler states that Mullin killed the Francis family first and then wiped out the Gianera couple.<sup id="cite_ref-RESSLER_2-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RESSLER-2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>About a month later, in early February 1973, Mullin was wandering around <a title="Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park" href="/wiki/Henry_Cowell_Redwoods_State_Park"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park</span></a> where he saw four teenaged boys out camping. He walked over to them, engaged in a brief conversation and claimed to be a park ranger. He ordered them to leave because they were "polluting" the forest, but they refused. He told them he would return the next day. The boys, who were armed with a .22 rifle, did not take this seriously. Mullin did return, shot them to death, and abandoned their bodies, which were not found until the next week.<sup id="cite_ref-RESSLER_2-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RESSLER-2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The final murder took place three days later, on February 13. Mullin was driving alone when he drove past an elderly Hispanic man who was weeding his lawn. For no apparent reason, Mullin made a U-turn, stopped his station wagon, and laid his rifle across the hood to aim, killing the man instantly. Then he got back into his car and "calmly" drove off. It was broad daylight and there were a number of witnesses, one of whom gave police the license plate number. A "docile" Mullin was captured a few minutes later.<sup id="cite_ref-RESSLER_2-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RESSLER-2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p><span id="Trial_and_imprisonment" class="mw-headline">Trial and imprisonment</span></p>
              <p>In custody, Mullin confessed to his crimes, and said that he had been told by voices in his head to kill people in order to prevent an earthquake. He claimed that the reason there had not been an earthquake recently was, in fact, due to his handiwork.</p>
              <p>Mullin was eventually charged with 10 murders (he was not charged with the first three), and his trial opened on July 30, 1973. Mullin had admitted to all the crimes and therefore the trial focused on whether he was <a title="Sanity" href="/wiki/Sanity"><span style="color: #0645ad;">sane</span></a> and <a title="Culpability" href="/wiki/Culpability"><span style="color: #0645ad;">culpable</span></a> for his actions. The fact that he had covered his tracks and shown <a class="mw-redirect" title="Premeditation" href="/wiki/Premeditation"><span style="color: #0645ad;">premeditation</span></a> in some of his crimes was highlighted by the prosecution, while the defense argued that the defendant had a history of <a class="mw-redirect" title="Mental illness" href="/wiki/Mental_illness"><span style="color: #0645ad;">mental illness</span></a>, and many believed that he suffered from <a title="Paranoia" href="/wiki/Paranoia"><span style="color: #0645ad;">paranoid</span></a> <a title="Schizophrenia" href="/wiki/Schizophrenia"><span style="color: #0645ad;">schizophrenia</span></a>. On August 19, 1973, the verdict was delivered. Mullin was declared guilty of <a class="mw-redirect" title="First-degree murder" href="/wiki/First-degree_murder"><span style="color: #0645ad;">first-degree murder</span></a> in the cases of Jim Gianera and Kathy Francisâbecause they were premeditatedâwhile for the other eight murders Mullin was found guilty of <a class="mw-redirect" title="Second-degree murder" href="/wiki/Second-degree_murder"><span style="color: #0645ad;">second-degree murder</span></a> because they were more impulsive.</p>
              <p>He was sentenced to <a title="Life imprisonment" href="/wiki/Life_imprisonment"><span style="color: #0645ad;">life imprisonment</span></a> and will be eligible for parole in 2025, when he will be 78. He is incarcerated at <a title="Mule Creek State Prison" href="/wiki/Mule_Creek_State_Prison"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Mule Creek State Prison</span></a>, in <a title="Ione, California" href="/wiki/Ione,_California"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Ione, California</span></a>.</p>

              <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>Victoria is Australia's most violent state</strong></span> <br>Australian Herald<br>Sunday 14th March, 2010Â Â <br>(ANI)<br></p>
              <div style="font-size: larger; text-align: justify;">Victoria is Australia's most violent state, registering the most homicidal deaths in comparison to the country's five other states.<br><br>There were 185 homicides, which include murder and manslaughter. Of those, 124 happened in Melbourne - two more than the total homicides for all of NSW. <br><br>On a per-100, 000 population basis, Victoria's homicide rate is actually three-and-a-half times higher than that of NSW, reports The Age.<br><br>Deakin University criminologist Ian Warren says the police statistics don't tell the full story. n the one hand, the figures are compromised by different reporting protocols between the states. <br><br>On the other, they don't take into account that indigenous communities in crisis inflate the higher figures for violent crime in the NT, Queensland and WA. <br><br>At odds with the police figures, which represent the crime-related workload each state carries, are new figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics dealing with victimisation and perceptions of crime. They show that the majority of crime actually went unreported last year.<br><br>The bureau's National Crime Victimisation Survey for 2008-09 found that nearly 70 per cent of sexual assaults went unreported, as were 61 per cent of robberies and 55 per cent of assaults.<br><br>"The real issue is that most crime is going unreported, and any government is making flawed decisions based on flawed data if they rely solely on crime statistics ... They're left in the dark as to where resources should be allocated." (ANI)</div>
