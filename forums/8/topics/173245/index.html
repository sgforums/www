            <div class='col-md body'>For me it is bombay dreams  , more modern and funkier.  I ended up loving a lot of the music on it really stand out ones Chaiyya Chaiyya and Shakkallaka baby. THey orginal maker is not Andrew, it by an indian music maker. Chaiyya Chaiyya is part  the OST of  this hit song from the Bollywood film DilSe (accordng to a friend), a smash hit song from 1998. I had see the song performed atop of a moving train......also one of the world's top best songs. When  listen to it, u cant get it out of your head. Now there's english remix of it even better<br><br>Andrew was just producer of this Bombay Dreams, the songs actually done by the indian guy.The guy is like Amon Tobin , mostly doing techo-ishy stuff in India. Indeed his sound is  better than Amon Tobin.heard that he rocks big time in tamil and hindhi...But have u ever heard some of his other stuff, is pretty much more high tech ,different and sophisticated.  He did some chinese songs as well..<br>(one of his songs by Jolin Tsai?),<br><br>On the radio it said this song was by a person from india<br>U actually believe this is a chinese song made by a indian musician?<br>very very not Indian at all. Pure chinese. How this guy did it, he must be very talented?<br><br></div>

(Bombay Dreams). Phantom of the Opera is a classical western.<br>Bombay Dreams is more in current trends. Let me just tell u, the original creator of Bombay Dreams is not Andrew. It is ar rahman. some popular musician from india. u can see the differemce, because andrew does not like to have pop music like shakkalakka baby. arrhman is techno musician like amon tobin. i am not familir (except for the song by Jolin Tsai)with it but give me a rough idea that he's a "computer gimmick person"  but some people say he make music which is a decade ahead of time  .Andrew thinks the guy is his successor in an interview i read before (below).<br><br>Showbusiness: Lloyd Webber passes his mantle to a star of India<br>By NIGEL REYNOLDS<br>Saturday Premiere<br><br>HOT NEWS. There will be a brand new Andrew Lloyd Webber musical in London next year - or, to be strictly accurate, a new musical that has been forged, hammered and produced by him, but will not feature any of his music.<br><br>Work is progressing so fast on Bombay Dreams that Lloyd Webber tells me it will hit the West End next April. Extraordinarily, he claims that the composer is so good that he could be the key to the future of the musical genre.<br><br>His new protege, Abdul Rahman, 35, has written the music for more than 50 Bollywood films as well as numerous hit pop tunes. When Lloyd Webber heard his music on British television for the first time, he persuaded the film director Shekhar Kapur to effect an introduction between them.<br><br>Since then, Rahman has been flying back and forth between Bombay and London. He has now completed almost 16 songs for Bombay Dreams. Meera Syal (the wit behind Goodness Gracious Me) is writing the story (based on a five-page outline by Lloyd Webber and Kapur) and Steven Pimlott has already been hired to direct.<br><br>"I haven't heard a musical in the last 20 years which has got such good tunes," says Lloyd Webber - which is some compliment from the composer of Cats, Evita, Phantom, etc.<br><br>"Rahman is fantastic. His music is so beautiful, and I believe what he is writing is so far ahead of the game that we could be talking about the future of musicals for a very long time."<br><br>Just as pop music needed new influences from world music, so musicals need fresh infusion from other continents, he says. "I thought when the Iron Curtain came down that it would come from Russia. It didn't. Now, I'm sure that it is coming from India.<br><br>"I really look on Rahman as someone I can pass the mantle on to."<br><br>The plot, he says, is set in Bollywood. It features the daughter of a wealthy Bombay film producer who falls in love with a man from the slums, and their story is the struggle of love over prejudice.<br><br>"I think the old Lloyd Webber audience will go to this, but we are also after a new audience," he adds.<br><br>The first auditions have already been held, but Lloyd Webber is having difficulty finding the right British Asian actors. "Anybody who can help, please get in touch. I'll give you a clue what we're looking for - for the lead, we want a Hindi answer to John Travolta."<br><br></div>
