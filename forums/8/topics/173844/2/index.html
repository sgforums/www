            <div class='col-md body'>Ancient civilisations existed that possessed far more advanced technology than us.<br><br>There are also ancient accounts of nuclear wars being dug up in India. That archaelogical find was even before the Hiroshima and Nagasaki was bombed and not many people knew anything about nuclear warfare. The passage description is exactly like nuclear weaponry deployment - a Vimana (flying aircraft) flies and drops a bomb, it explodes, burning everything for a very very large area and a mushroom cloud is formed. Many people think the description is bullshit or pure fantasy, but when the nuclear bomb is dropped in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, they realised that it is EXACTLY as described in the ancient scriptures. They went back to the area where they found the scripture, and found that there are many kinds of stones (or some other minerals) that are deformed. Those stones can only be deformed when the temperature is more than 1800 degrees - fire definitely cannot reach this temperature. It is definitely due to nuclear explosion.<br><br><img src="http://www.crystalinks.com/hieroplanes.gif"><br><img src="http://www.ufonetwork.it/immagini/Oggetti_fuori_tempo/vimana/vimana04.jpg"></div>

A theoretical  physicist and the Supervising Scientist of the Manhattan Project, who was familiar with ancient Sanskrit literature, was giving a lecture at Rochester University. During the question and answer period a student asked a question to which Oppenheimer gave a strangely qualified answer:<br><br>Student: Was the bomb exploded at Alamogordo during the Manhattan Project the first one to be detonated?<br><br>Dr. Oppenheimer: "Well -- yes. In modern times, of course.<br><br>Charles Berlitz goes on to quote a number of passages from the Mahabharata that describe the impact of a weapon that I suspect  must be the brahmaastra, although he neither names the weapon nor cites those sections of the text from which his quotations are drawn (he lists Protap Chandra Roy's translation of 1889 in his bibliography):...a single projectile Charged with all the power of the Universe.<br><br><strong>An incandescent column of smoke and flame As bright as ten thousand Suns Rose in all its splendor......it was an unknown weapon, An iron thunderbolt, A gigantic messenger of death, Which reduced to ashes. The Entire race of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas....the corpses were so burned As to be unrecognizable. Their hair and nails fell out; Pottery broke without apparent cause, And the birds turned white. After a few hours all foodstuffs were infected......To escape from this fire. The soldiers threw themselves in streams to wash themselves and their equipment...<br><br>One is reminded of the yet unknown final effect of a super-bomb when we read in the Ramayana of a projectile:<br><br>...So powerful that it could destroy<br>The earth in an instant -<br>A great soaring sound in smoke and flames...<br>And on it sits Death...</strong><br><br>(source: Doomsday 1999 - By Charles Berlitz p. 118-122).

            <div class='col-md body'>Indeed it is mentioned in one of the Epic's Ramayana that the Pushpaka vimana or the Pushpaka aircraft or Pushpaka flying machine was used by the Demon King Ravana. In India Aircrafts are called as Vimana or Viman. May be because of this.<br><br>Lord Rama's wife Sita is abducted by Ravana.<br><br>The story of Ramayana goes on and in the end, Lord Rama kills demon King Ravana and returns to Ayodya along with his wife Sita in the Pushpaka vimana.<br><br>In Mahabaratha there is a mention of the huge explosion and the resulting deadth. But I don't know whether it is a nuclear weapon or not. In some articles I saw the mentioning of mushroom cloud and the shaking of mountains. If this is true, then it may be a nuclear weapon.<br><br>Brahmastra is the weapon given by Lord Brahma. To get this weapon he has to pray to god Brahma for many centuries. (According to the story), when the lord is please he will give the weapon to him. And the person who owns the Brahmastra cannot be defeated in war. It is the ultimate weapon. Once taken it need to be fired and once fired the enemy is finished. There is no counter to it. And only a person will be allowed to use it once. To win over the enemy.<br><br>Some say that the Brahmos cruise missile is named after this Brahmastra, the ultimate weapon which has no counter.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>quote:...Oppenheimer and Atom bomb in modern times<br><br>Only seven years after the first successful atom bomb blast in New Mexico, Dr. Robert Oppenheimer (1904-1967) Scientist, philosopher, bohemian, and radical. A theoretical physicist and the Supervising Scientist of the Manhattan Project, who was familiar with ancient Sanskrit literature, was giving a lecture at Rochester University. During the question and answer period a student asked a question to which Oppenheimer gave a strangely qualified answer:<br><br>Student: Was the bomb exploded at Alamogordo during the Manhattan Project the first one to be detonated?<br><br>Dr. Oppenheimer: "Well -- yes. In modern times, of course.<br><br>Charles Berlitz goes on to quote a number of passages from the Mahabharata that describe the impact of a weapon that I suspect must be the brahmaastra, although he neither names the weapon nor cites those sections of the text from which his quotations are drawn (he lists Protap Chandra Roy's translation of 1889 in his bibliography):...a single projectile Charged with all the power of the Universe.<br><br>An incandescent column of smoke and flame As bright as ten thousand Suns Rose in all its splendor......it was an unknown weapon, An iron thunderbolt, A gigantic messenger of death, Which reduced to ashes. The Entire race of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas....the corpses were so burned As to be unrecognizable. Their hair and nails fell out; Pottery broke without apparent cause, And the birds turned white. After a few hours all foodstuffs were infected......To escape from this fire. The soldiers threw themselves in streams to wash themselves and their equipment...<br><br>One is reminded of the yet unknown final effect of a super-bomb when we read in the Ramayana of a projectile:<br><br>...So powerful that it could destroy<br>The earth in an instant -<br>A great soaring sound in smoke and flames...<br>And on it sits Death...<br><br>(source: Doomsday 1999 - By Charles Berlitz p. 118-122). For more on Oppenheimer, refer to Quotes 21-40).<br><br>this is coming close to the Skynet war in T3 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know whether it has happened or not. I am not a historian or a Geologist. So commenting on an issue that is not known to me will be wrong. These things  clearly mentioned in the epics. We must appreciate the imagination and creativity of the writer.
