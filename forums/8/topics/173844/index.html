            <div class='col-md body'>Surfing the net at work, bored as usual.<br>Came across this, it may of been covered before, but is incredibally fasinating.<br>Im not sure of the exact date of when these manuscripts were written but heres a little info and pics, with links.<br><br>"The Indian Emperor Ashoka started a <strong>"Secret Society of the Nine Unknown Men":</strong> great Indian scientists who were supposed to catalogue the many sciences. Ashoka kept their work secret because he was afraid that the advanced science catalogued by these men, culled from ancient Indian sources, would be used for the evil purpose of war, which Ashoka was strongly against, having been converted to Buddhism after defeating a rival army in a bloody battle."<br><br>Now these Nine unknown men wrote nice books, presumably one each, called <strong>"The secret of Gravitation".</strong><br>And it is said it is kept in a secret libary in India, Tibet or North America.<br>Who has these Manuscripts?<br><br>Now heres this statment regarding China.<br><br>"Only a few years ago, the Chinese discovered some Sanskrit documents in Lhasa, Tibet and sent them to the University of Chandrigarh to be translated. Dr. Ruth Reyna of the University said recently that the documents contain directions for building interstellar spaceships!"<br><br>And then goes to say this<br><br>"Ancient Indian Aircraft Technology"<br><br>"Naturally, Indian scientists did not take the texts very seriously, but then became more positive about the value of them when the Chinese announced that they were including certain parts of the data for study in their space program! This was one of the first instances of a government admitting to be researching anti-gravity."<br><br>Is there evidence of China incorperating this in their space program??<br><br>Apparently there were 32 secrets the pilot must know to fly one of these machines, here are a few.<br><br>1. Goodha: As explained in 'Vaayutatva-Prakarana', by harnessing the powers, Yaasaa, Viyaasaa, Prayaasaa in the 8th atmospheric layer covering the earth, to attract the dark content of the solar ray, and use it to hide the Vimana from the enemy.<br><br>2. Drishya: By collision of the electric power and wind power in the atmosphere, a glow is created, whose reflection is to be caught in the Vishwa-Kriya-drapana or mirror at the front of the Vimana, and by its manipulation produce a Maaya-Vimana or camouflaged Vimana.<br><br>3. Vimukha: As mentioned in "Rig-hridaya", by projecting the force of Kubera, Vimukha and Vyshawaanara poison powder through the third tube of the roudree mirror and turning the switch of the air mechanism, produce wholesale insensibility and coma.<br><br>4. Roopaakarshana: By means of the photographic yantra in the Vimana to obtain a television view of things inside an enemy's plane.<br><br>5. Stabdhak: By projecting apasmaara poison fume smoke through the tube on the north side on the Vimana, and discharging it with stambhana yantra, people in enemy planes will be made unconscious.<br><br>6. Chaapla: On sighting an enemy plane, by turning the switch in the force center in the middle section of the Vimana, a 4087 revolutions an hour atmospheric wave speed will be generated, and shake up the enemy plane.<br><br>7. Parashabda Graahaka: As explained in the "Sowdaaminee Kalaa: or science of electronics, by means of the sound capturing yantra in the Vimana, to hear the talks and sound in enemy planes flying in the sky.<br><br>So.....<br><br>A Myth?, A lost technology?<br><br>I have not of this before so any comments or info would be interesting.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whats most disturbing is the discovery of an ancient atomic blast site in Rajastan, India.  carbon dating tests show the radioactivity there is a few thousand years old.It means ancient indians have knowledge of nuclear weaponary. This blast which wiped out an entire city until recently was thought to be a myth desribed in the Mahabaratha(?). As desribed in the story, sceitntists have found evidence that such a blast indeed occured as stated in the ancient indian epic during the era of the Rama empire...<br><br>The description is very much like what happened in Hiroshima.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Indian Epics, especially the MAHABHARATA, pick up the thread of<br>the tale of devastation and destruction. Atlantis, rather displeased<br>at its humiliating defeat, deceived that they were no longer<br>interested in subjugating the Rama Empire (An Indian Empire), and<br>decided instead to annihilate the major cities using weapons of mass<br>destruction. Sanskrit scholars could not comprehend what was being<br>described in the Epics until the dropping of the first atomic bombs<br>on Japan. There are AUTHENTIC VERSES from the Indian Epics:<br><br>"Gurkha, flying a swift and powerful vimana (fast aircraft)<br>hurled a single projectile (rocket) charged with the power<br>of the Universe (nuclear device). An incandescent column of<br>smoke and flame, as bright as ten thousand suns, rose with<br>all its splendor.<br><br>It was an unknown weapon, an iron thunderbolt, a gigantic<br>messenger of death, which reduced to ashes the entire race<br>of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas.<br><br>The corpses were so burned as to be unrecognizable.<br>Hair and nails fell out; Pottery broke without apparent cause,<br>and the birds turned white.<br><br>...After a few hours all foodstuffs were infected...<br>...to escape from this fire the soldiers threw<br>themselves in streams to wash themselves and their<br>equipment."<br>Ã„Ã„ The Mahabharata<br><br>Indeed, this story is said to be nearly 24,000 years old! If this is<br>true than we are not the most advanced. As the Bible says "There is<br>nothing new under the sun." Evidence for Atlantis is well<br>documented.<br><br>If the above was not enough to convince your let me take you in<br><br>Page 1<br><br>deeper into this nuclear war:<br><br>"(It was a weapon) so powerful that it could destroy the earth<br>in an instant Ã„Ã„ A great soaring sound in smoke and flames Ã„Ã„<br>And on its sits death..."<br>Ã„Ã„ The Ramayana<br><br>"Dense arrows of flame, like a great shower, issued<br>forth upon creation, encompassing the enemy...<br>A thick gloom swiftly settled upon the Pandava hosts.<br>All points of the compass were lost in darkness.<br>Fierce wind began to blow upward, showering dust and gravel.<br><br>Birds croaked madly... the very elements seemed disturbed.<br>The earth shook, scorched by the terrible violent heat of this<br>weapon.<br>Elephants burst into flame and ran to and fro in a frenzy...<br>over a vast area, other animals crumpled to the ground and died.<br>From all points of the compass the arrows of flame rained<br>continuously and fiercely.<br>Ã„Ã„ The Mahabharata<br><br>The Ramayana and the Mahabharata seem like science fiction. Not<br>only did aircraft exist such as Vimanas and Vailxi (as the Atlantian<br>craft are called), they had nuclear weapons. There seems to be a<br>fear of educating the worlds people about the distant past. Even<br>empires and leaders of China's past to Christians to Arab peoples<br>would destroy history in such a way that records of there amazing<br>cultures and events are nearly all wiped out. Indian Epics however<br>are still with us intact. Records of South American history all but<br>gone. Fear, and other factors have removed most of history before<br>5,000 years. Some only 1,000 years ago. In the America's just 300 -<br>500 years all most all lost! Today, perhaps some UFO records are<br>going the way of fears gate! However, again a few stories live on.<br><br>In another amazing Indian text the Agastrya Samhita gives the<br>precise directions for constructing electrical batteries:<br><br>"Place a well-cleaned copper plate in an earthenware vessel.<br>Cover it first by copper sulfate and then moist sawdust.<br>After that put a mercury-amalgamated-zinc sheet on top of<br>an energy known by the twin name of Mitra-Varuna. Water will<br>be split by this current into Pranavayu and Udanavayu. A<br>chain of one hundred jars is said to give a very active<br>and effective force."<br>Ã„Ã„ Agastya Samhita<br>(Indian Princes' Library)<br><br>By the way, MITRA-VARUNA is now called cathode-anode, and Pranavayu<br>and Udanavayu are to us oxygen and hydrogen. This document again<br>demonstrates the presence of electricity in the East, long, long<br>ago. In the not so distant past strange events are recorded in<br>Europe's past.<br><br></div>

As desribed in the story, sceitntists have found evidence that such a blast indeed occured as stated in the ancient indian epic during the era of the Rama empire...<br><br>The description is very much like what happened in Hiroshima.

            <div class='col-md body'>U can give this book a try:<br><img src="http://www.theseekerbooks.com/images/vimanas.jpg"><br><br>reviewed by Theresa Welsh<br><br>If you're into alternative theories of history, eventually you'll come across books by David Hatcher Childress. I admit I avoided them for some years, as they seemed too far out on the fringe even for me. But I could not resist this book about ancient flying machines when I found a mint-condition copy at a used book sale. Childress is not the first author to write about the "vimanas" mentioned in an ancient manuscript from India called the Mahabarata. Other authors have felt this puzzling source not only tells us about sophisticated flying ships, but also tells of nuclear wars raining terrible destruction on an apparently highly advanced civilization.<br><br>This particular Childress book is a hodge-podge of essays, pictures, and a complete translation of the "Vymaanika-Shaastra or Science of Aeronautics," purportedly a part of the famous Mahabarata, and found in an Indian library in 1908. This version is translated from the Sanskrit by one G.R. Joyser. The illustrations in the book make it worthwhile, as they are gathered from many sources and give numerous renditions of what the vimanas (from the Rama Empire of India) and the vailxi (from Atlantis) looked like. Okay, so these are just drawings and may arise only out of someone's imagination, but we cannot forget that much technology of today was predicted by novelists of yesterday.<br><br>Not all the illustrations are just imaginary though. The Sanskrit document included with the book gives detailed descriptions of how to build various kinds of vimanas. They were mainly powered by Mercury and magnetics. They were mainly saucer-shaped with a pole up the center. I will not attempt to explain, as the technical aspects are pretty obscure. I only skimmed the translated document, since it really is of little value to the casual reader. There are so many references to things that are unknown today, and words that have no meaning, and procedures that seem to make no sense. How can we be sure the translator has made sense of the original? Here is a randomly-selected passage, describing "Praana - Kundalinee Yantra"<br><br>"A peetha or stand 3 feet in diameter and 3 feet high, square or circular, should be made of vrishala metal, with 8 kendras or central spots. In each central spot, two wheels with revolving hinges; small peethas or plates with 3 holes, 4 teeth, 3 pivots, in their middle a central pivot, 3 red-colored tubes or pipes with opening and closing wheels, and switches for right motion, and reverse motion, with a shabda-nala in the center, with wheels (with hinges and rods) which will flap the wings; from the north-east and south-east Kendra and the middle Kendra in the west up to the middle of the course of the yaana kundalinee revolving wheels with pivots."<br><br>Reading this passage makes you yearn for a blueprint. How can anyone possibly evaluate such descriptions? Because the descriptions are so detailed (giving exact measurements and materials), they DO seem to arise from something real. But it is far from certain that anyone today could build anything from these descriptions.<br><br>The material on the Atlantis Vailxi is equally unreliable, but worthy of notice. The term "vailxi" (singular: vailx) comes mainly from an old occult manuscript called A Dweller on Two Planets, and from Edgar Cayce readings. A Dweller on Two Planets was dictated by automatic writing in 1883 by "Phylos the Thibetan," a spirit. It is a rambling story of many incarnations, including lives in Atlantis. The book includes illustrations of the vailxi that the author traveled in. These are long cigar-shaped craft that can go in the air or water. Edgar Cayce described similar vessels in his life readings for people who had previous incarnations in Atlantis. In the Cayce readings, the power source was a huge crystal kept in a domed building. The dome opened to catch the sun. This wireless source of power is reminiscent of Nikola Tesla's tower, which he said could supply power remotely. Unfortunately, Tesla went broke and his tower was destroyed before it could be put in operation.<br><br>This book contains some interesting speculation about electromagnetism and its relationship to gravity. The author discusses the work of William Clendenon (with whom he has written a more recent book, Atlantis and the Power System of the Gods: Mercury Vortex Generators and the Power Systems of Atlantis). He believes the caduceus, with its two snakes wound around a rod, and symbolic of the god Mercury, is an ancient indicator of flight powered by mercury andmagnetics. The central rod corresponds to the one in the vimanas. Further, Clenendon claims to have built vimanas that fly!</div>
