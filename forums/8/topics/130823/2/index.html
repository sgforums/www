            <div class='col-md body'>7 Eleven along Marine Parade Road (where most people get off the bus to go to ECP).<br><br>1). Lousy pay - $3.50 per hour. That's almost slave labour. Currently I'm working at a hotel as a bellhop during my uni holidays - and I'm getting $6 an hour for the same intensity of work.<br><br>2). Lousy boss. She smokes a lot. Cheap cigarettes at that. We all know what cheap ciggies smell like- yucks. I have to hold my breath every time I walk past her. Crude and unrefined some more - let's not go into details.<br><br>3). Lousy customers. It's not fun at all when I get showed the finger and get yelled profanities at cos I refused to sell them ciggies when they have no IC. Come on lah, not that I want to tekan you, but 7 Eleven management sometimes goes undercover to catch errant counter staff who sell ciggies to minors.<br><br>Another customer screamed profanities at me and cursed my mother just because we ran out of a certain brand of beer he wanted. He declared that as police sergeant he has the right to anything he wants and called for my manager, demanding that I get sacked. Bad move.<br><br>My manager (another one... not the chain-smoking woman) was a police inspector during NS... he screwed the bugger left right center. Good riddance. Scolding me is one thing, scolding my mother is asking for trouble.<br><br>4). Three schools nearby. All hell breaks loose every day from 1-3 when school ends. Worst of the three schools would be Katong Convent. I have nothing against the school.... some of my friends were from there. However, once I had three girls who made fun of my voice and imitated it in a mocking manner just because I have a bass, low-pitched psuedo-Brit accent. I just said, 'That will be $5, please', and they start making fun of me.<br><br>I guess I'm pretty sensitive about my voice, for my Sec 3 class once turned against me for almost a year because of it. They had the idea that I somehow 'cultivated' it. Never mind that my bro almost has the exact same voice. Extremely shallow and hypocritical, but there you go.<br><br>At least the next customer (another Katong Convent girl) apologised for them.<br><br>Good thing she did.... otherwise I would have gone down to their headmistress/principal and given her hell.<br><br></div>
