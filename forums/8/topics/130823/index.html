            <div class='col-md body'>I worked as a sales manager once in a European engineering company.<br><br>I brought in 60% of the company's annual revenues....but it was still losing money.  There were two directors here - one German, one British.  Both of them had full expat packages - luxury class cars, condos, home leave, family support, etc.  Other staff were all local ladies (about 4 of them).<br><br>Now, what I didn't like was that the directors treated their own colour well, treated the local girls well....but treated me like sh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>it.  These FT directors always had something bad to say about our culture, our lifestyle, etc....<br><br>For example, one day we were all having lunch together and the British director said "Why is it you Singaporeans eat rice with your table spoons?  Is it because you have big mouths?".  I showed him a dirty face, but all my lady ex-colleagues laughed at his 'joke'.<br><br>The above was just one example.  There were many other times....happened at least a few times a week.<br><br>I left after some months (which is how long it took to get another job at that time).<br></div>

There were two directors here - one German, one British.  Both of them had full expat packages - luxury class cars, condos, home leave, family support, etc.  Other staff were all local ladies (about 4 of them).<br><br>Now, what I didn't like was that the directors treated their own colour well, treated the local girls well....but treated me like sh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>it.  These FT directors always had something bad to say about our culture, our lifestyle, etc....<br><br>For example, one day we were all having lunch together and the British director said "Why is it you Singaporeans eat rice with your table spoons?  Is it because you have big mouths?".  I showed him a dirty face, but all my lady ex-colleagues laughed at his 'joke'.<br><br>The above was just one example.  There were many other times....happened at least a few times a week.<br><br>I left after some months (which is how long it took to get another job at that time).<br></div></blockquote>wow...that is BAD.<br>anyway, about what the British director said.....i wonder what he use to eat rice?</div>
