Mine is 600+ degrees each side. It takes some time to get used to the curved lens, maybe around 2 weeks. [b]The vision you get is not similar to your normal spectacles.</strong> The lens will cost you around 90buxx which is what i paid. I think they make the lens at the same place where they send all the spectacle to do lens. Sending your frame to USA to do a custom oakley lens will cost you 3 times what you paid for the frame. It is that expensive! One thing about this frame is that I realise it doesn't adhere to your face well....going down to larrikin(oakley official distro) to see whether they can modify the frame to stick to my face  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Bought the frame in Jan. Btw if you have more time than money, go look for the same frame on auction sites, make sure the seller has the warrantee and buy it to convert to specs...but i dunno whether that's covered under warrantee. I assume it should be, given that my retailer told me to go to larrikin if there's any problem with the frame even after I had it converted.<br><br>Hope this helps![/b][/b]</blockquote>i have called up few shops and they are sellling @$159. few of my officers bought it few year back. and the condition still looking good. i will buy and make custom sunglasses lens with degrees once i get my allowance <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
