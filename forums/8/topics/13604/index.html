            <div class='col-md body'>so i'd bet if enid blyton wrote the bible fisherprice u would believe in dwarfs and toothfaries..<br>another thing u christians should know is not to use the bible as a weapon of arguement, hence putting pressure unto the other party quoting crap from it to back up whatever u have to say.<br>if u think u would like to backup a particular event in the bible, show proof it did happen. do not use storybooks (bible) as a form of actual evidence cos u may have read that specific portion of bible, OTHERS HAVE NOT. AND ONLY YOU think the bible's legit, others do not.<br>its definitely because of the likes of people like fisherprice we have antichrists, atheists. your the reject of the common society and your head definitely deserve to meet a wall.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly Fish, I think you know squids abt the LORD. You know the bible well, yes, well trained bible scholar probably (probably as well trained as the pharisees and scribes and all during the Lord's time) but u know squids abt the LORD. If you had, you wouldnt have talked the way you did. Your harshness and arrogrance misrepresented the Lord. Honestly if I meet one of you on the street, I will spit at your words. You are in actuality using the LORD's name as an excuse to brag abt all in your puffed brain...I personally think its downright sick and distasteful. Go get a life. If you are serious abt getting souls saved, do it with the people ard you (or have u driven them all away???) and not bullshit on this forum. Dun be mistaken, the bullshit is not what you proclaimed in the context of the Word, but your arrogrance and "your greater than thou" rubbish.<br><br>Let me give you some advise for whatever is left in your thick skull. Too much study has screwed your brain I think. And this is basic PR skills on forum.<br><br>1. DUN USE CAPS BECAUSE THEY TEND TO MEAN U ARE SHOUTING!<br>2. Think, consider how your words will impact the other person. Nobody is asking you dilute the Gospel, phrase it with more graciousness (not sugar-coating)<br>3 Judge yourself by your fruits...if souls are the ones you are reaching then ask yourself AM I BEING A ARSE(brainless basically) so much so nobody is listening?<br>4. Realign yourself to be more effective.<br><br>If you are a pastor....gosh I will never step into your church! I will probably be thrown into hell the min I step in.<br><br>[This message has been edited by rubberduckie (edited 12 February 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by rubberduckie:</div><div class="quote_body">Honestly Fish, I think you know squids abt the LORD. You know the bible well, yes, well trained bible scholar probably (probably as well trained as the pharisees and scribes and all during the Lord's time) but u know squids abt the LORD. If you had, you wouldnt have talked the way you did. Your harshness and arrogrance misrepresented the Lord. Honestly if I meet one of you on the street, I will spit at your words. You are in actuality using the LORD's name as an excuse to brag abt all in your puffed brain...I personally think its downright sick and distasteful. Go get a life. If you are serious abt getting souls saved, do it with the people ard you (or have u driven them all away???) and not bullshit on this forum. Dun be mistaken, the bullshit is not what you proclaimed in the context of the Word, but your arrogrance and "your greater than thou" rubbish.<br><br>Let me give you some advise for whatever is left in your thick skull. Too much study has screwed your brain I think. And this is basic PR skills on forum.<br><br>1. DUN USE CAPS BECAUSE THEY TEND TO MEAN U ARE SHOUTING!<br>2. Think, consider how your words will impact the other person. Nobody is asking you dilute the Gospel, phrase it with more graciousness (not sugar-coating)<br>3 Judge yourself by your fruits...if souls are the ones you are reaching then ask yourself AM I BEING A ARSE(brainless basically) so much so nobody is listening?<br>4. Realign yourself to be more effective.<br><br>If you are a pastor....gosh I will never step into your church! I will probably be thrown into hell the min I step in.<br><br>[This message has been edited by rubberduckie (edited 12 February 2002).]</div></blockquote>duck, when did i misuse the name of the LORD, show me!<br>n where is my greater than thou rubbish that u hv accused me of?<br>show me!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>truth is, duck, i presented the Bible, clearer and more direct than what we Christians usually do.<br>so much so, that it becomes uncomfortable to those who hv not being doing so, n to those who are not accustomed to hearing it so.<br>we hv all been guilty of dilution.<br>think abt it.<br>where r the holier than thou cases u mentioned?<br>truth is, i always aligned myself with the sinner in the posts, becos i am one as well.<br>never did i say i was greater than any1.<br>but i had to reply those who are non-Christians, and hvnt read the Bible carefully when they claimed to use the Biblical facts on certain cases.<br>i dont know squid abt the LORD? is it for u to judge?<br>who's the judge here? u contradict urself.<br>n regarding the plank in my own eye, did i even pick on the specks in urs?<br>i didnt.<br>i talked generally abt dilution n such. u confessed to it urself. n claimed i was talking abt u.</div>
