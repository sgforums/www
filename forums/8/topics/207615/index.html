            <div class='col-md body'><br>I refer to this Togopart's thread<br><br><a href="http://www.togoparts.com/forum/showthread.php?page_id=190&amp;fid=16&amp;tid=43876&amp;loc=active" rel="nofollow">http://www.togoparts.com/forum/showthread.php?page_id=190&amp;fid=16&amp;tid=43876&amp;loc=active</a><br><br>Okie... now for a little background history!<br><br>I've been riding with this cyclist group called FNR (Friday Night Rides ) for the last half a year or so. We are a bunch of riders who ride every Friday nights in the city, going around and doing BMX/Street stunts at certain BMXers areas (Esplanade, Youth Park, etc...)<br><br>I must admit that I had fun riding with them sometimes even though I do not have BMX skills - I'm a Cross Country Rider but I just go there for fun. My friend who also dun know BMX skills tag along too sometimes.<br><br>Then last week when I wasn't around , a big sized guy(might be new comer ) joined the FNR ride. When they are at one of the BMX "pit stops " (I wun reveal the area where the fight happens..later FNR people say I "pao Toh" mata ), a FNR member accidentally knocked into the handlebar of the big guy's bike(refer to link above ). Big guy got angry and hit the FNR member (a small sized boy ).<br><br>What shocked and disgusted me is the reactions of the other FNR members:<br><br>1)There are so many of them, yet they did not Confront the Big Guy<br><br>2) They did not call the cops (hitting someone is considered assault )<br><br>3) They let the Big Guy go off scott-free.<br><br>What is this? Their friend got bullied and they just stand there doing nothing?<br>How disgraceful!<br><br>I mean, during happy times the FNR crew was all friendly with each other..joke with each other...<br><br>But when got trouble ?<br><br>It's every man for himself!<br><br>In another incident, I was playing football with some Malay boys at a public field. The 2 teams are Malay boys who dun know each other.<br><br>Then , one guy from Team A accidentally knocked into a guy from Team B.<br><br>The 2 boys started to fight, but the 2 teams quickly break up the fight.<br><br>1 Malay guy even said "We are from the same neighbourhood, why must we fight? "<br><br>The incident was quickly resolved and the game resumed!<br><br>So..to sum it all...<br><br>Do u think that the Malays of Singapore are more united that we  Chinese?<br><br>*disclaimer: No insult to either racial groups here...I'm just voicing out my opinions! *  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well...it's really not an issue between different races, as there are black sheeps in each and every race on this planet.<br><br>Righteousness comes from within ourselves and it resides in our heart and mind. Righteousness can be bred from people you come across, books, tv and personal conviction (belief).<br><br>There are few things you will need to consider...like how close were they to the person involved in the fights? How are their families' background? How old are they? How many real friends do they have among the groups?<br><br>I've met and known people from at least our 4 races and I must admit that I was disillusioned as you previously. However I realised that there are always another person in other races who are equally good/bad/better/worse, so it doesn't matter which race you have made friends with...it's up to the individual's character/DNA wavelength to complement yours.<br><br>So don't be shadowed by this 2 incidents to cloud your choice of friends and filter out the people that you might come across. Always keep an open mind an d make sure you're their best friend to them first and let them decide if they wanna be your best friend too.<br><br>Good Luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
