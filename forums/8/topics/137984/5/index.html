God went to his Celestial supercomputer, typed<br>in a few words and waited for the results.<br>The  computer printed out a slip of paper and God<br>read it.<br>"Well, it may be true that my invention is flawed," God said to Arthur,<br>"but according to these numbers, more men are riding my invention than<br>yours</div>

So his mother questioned the boy on why he kept asking for <span style="color: red;">50 cents</span>.<br><br>The boy replied that his friend told him that if you eat <span style="color: red;">50 cents</span> worth of peanuts a day you would become smarter.<br><br>Quickly his mother gave him $5. The boy asks Â“Why $5Â”, and the mother replied, Â“Buy <span style="color: red;">50 cents</span> of peanut for yourself and buy peanuts for your father with the balance.Â”</blockquote><blockquote>Teacher: If you had <span style="color: red;">50 cents</span> in one pocket and you asked your Dad for another <span style="color: red;">50 cents</span>, what would you have?<br>Student: <span style="color: red;">50 cents</span>.<br>Teacher: You obviously donÂ’t know how to add.<br>Student: You obviously donÂ’t know my Dad.</blockquote><blockquote>A traveling salesman checked into a futuristic motel. Realizing he needed a haircut before his next day's meeting, he called down to the desk clerk and asked if there was a barber on the premises.<br><br>'I'm afraid not, Sir,' the clerk told him, apologetically, 'but down the hall is a special machine that should serve your purposes.'<br><br>Skeptical, but intrigued, the salesman located the appropriate machine, inserted <span style="color: red;">50 cents</span>, stuck his head in the opening, at which time the machine started to buzz and whirl. Fifteen seconds later, the salesman pulled out his head and surveyed his head in the mirror, which reflected the best haircut he had ever received in his life.<br><br>Down the hall was another machine with a sign that read, 'Manicures - 25 cents.'<br><br>'Why not,' thought the salesman. He paid the money, inserted his hands into the slot and pulled them out, perfectly manicured.<br><br>The next machine had a huge sign that read, 'This Machine Provides What Men Need Most When Away from Their Wives - cost <span style="color: red;">50 cents</span>.'<br><br>The salesman was embarrassed and looked both ways. Seeing nobody around, he put in <span style="color: red;">50 cents</span>, then with great anticipation, since he had been away from his wife for two weeks, he unzipped his pants and stuck his 'thing' into the opening.<br><br>When the machine started buzzing, the guy let out this terrible shriek of agony!!! Fifteen seconds later, it shut off. With trembling hands, the salesman was able to withdraw his 'thingy,' which now had a button sewed on the tip.</blockquote></div>
