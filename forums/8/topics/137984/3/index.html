            <div class='col-md body'><span class="small">The notes are from an inexperienced Chilli taster named Frank, who was visiting Texas from the East Coast:<br><br>Frank: "Recently, I was honoured to be selected as a judge at a chilli cook-off. The Judge #3 called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking for directions to the Budweiser truck, when the call came in. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chilli wouldn't be all that spicy and, besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted."<br><br>Here are the scorecards from the event:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Chilli #1 (Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chilli)</span><br><br>Judge #1 A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick.<br><br>Judge #2 Nice, smooth tomato flavour. Very mild.<br><br>Judge #3 (Frank) Holy sh!t, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Chilli #2 (Arthur's Afterburner Chilli)</span><br><br>Judge #1 Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang.<br><br>Judge #2 Exciting BBQ flavour, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.<br><br>Judge #3 (Frank) Keep this out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich manoeuvre. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Chilli #3 (Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chilli)</span><br><br>Judge #1 Excellent firehouse chilli. Great kick. Needs more beans.<br><br>Judge #2 A beanless chilli, a bit salty, good use of peppers.<br><br>Judge #3 (Frank) Call the EPA. I've located a uranium spill. My nose<br>feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all of the beer!<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Chilli #4 (Bubba's Black Magic)</span><br><br>Judge #1 Black bean chilli with almost no spice. Disappointing.<br><br>Judge #2 Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chilli.<br><br>Judge #3 (Frank) I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds? Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills. That 300-lb. bitch is starting to look HOT... just like this nuclear waste I'm eating! Is chilli an aphrodisiac?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Chilli #5 (Laura's Legal Lip Remover)</span><br><br>Judge #1 Meaty, strong chilli. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.<br><br>Judge #2 Chilli using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.<br><br>Judge #3 (Frank) My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chilli had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those rednecks.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Chilli #6 (Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety)</span><br><br>Judge #1 Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chilli. Good balance of spices and peppers.<br><br>Judge #2 The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb.<br><br>Judge #3 (Frank) I shit myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally. She must be kinkier than I thought. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Chilli #7 (Sandra's Screaming Sensation Chilli)</span><br><br>Judge #1 A mediocre chilli with too much reliance on canned peppers.<br><br>Judge #2 Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chilli peppers at the last moment. I should take note that I am worried about Judge #3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.<br><br>Judge #3 (Frank) You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chilli, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit to match my shirt. At least during the autopsy, they'll know what killed me.<br><br>I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it; I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Chilli #8 (Tommy's Toe-Nail Curling Chilli)</span><br><br>Judge #1 The perfect ending, this is a nice blend chilli. Not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.<br><br>Judge #2 This final entry is a good, balanced chilli. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge #3 passed out, fell over and pulled the chilli pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor dude, wonder how he'd have reacted to a really hot chilli?</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was an archery competition and 3 top archers are competing to be the best.<br><br>The first archer took out his bow and arrow and took aim. When he was steady, he released his arrow from 30meters and hit the bull's eye! Everyone applaud and the archer was very proud of himself. He shouted: "Yes! I'm Robin Hood!"<br><br>The second archer now came forward. Instead of the 30meter mark, he stood at the 40meter mark and took aim. With one swift shot, the arrow split the arrow of the first archer into half and hit the bull's eye! Everyone was shocked. The second archer shouted proudly: "I'm Hou Yi!" (Hou Yi is the famous archer who shot down the nine suns in Chinese folk tales)<br><br>It is now for the third archer to shoot. To beat the competition, he stood at the 50 meter mark. However, just as he was going to release the arrow, some sand flew into his eyes and made him lose focus. Thus, the arrow went off target and hit a umpire nearby. He died on the spot. Alarmed, the third archer then exclaimed: "I'm....I'm......I'm sorry"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bubba was bragging to his boss one day, "You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them."<br><br>Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, "OK, Bubba how about Tom Cruise?"<br><br>"Sure, yes, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."<br><br>So Bubba and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and sure enough, Tom Cruise, shouts, "Bubba! Great to see you! You and your friend come right in and join me for lunch!"<br><br>Although impressed, Bubba's boss is still skeptical.<br><br>After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Bubba that he thinks Bubba's knowing Cruise was just lucky.<br><br>"No, no, just name anyone else," Bubba says.<br><br>"President Clinton," his boss quickly retorts.<br><br>"Yes," Bubba says, "I know him, let's fly out to Washington."<br><br>And off they go.<br><br>At the White House, Clinton spots Bubb on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, "Bubba, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a cup of coffee first and catch up."<br><br>Well, the boss is very shaken by now, but still not totally convinced.<br><br>After they leave the White house grounds, he expresses his doubts to Bubba, who again implores him to name anyone else.<br><br>"The Pope," his boss replies.<br><br>"Sure!" says Bubba.<br><br>"My folks are from Poland, and I've known the Pope a long time."<br><br>So off they fly to Rome.<br><br>Bubba and his boss are assembled with the masses in Vatican Square when Bubba says, "This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."<br><br>And he disappears into the crowd headed toward the Vatican.<br><br>Sure enough, half an hour later Bubba emerges with the Pope on the balcony.<br><br>But by the time Bubba returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.<br><br>Working his way to his boss' side, Bubba asks him, "What happened?"<br><br>His boss looks up and says, "I was doing fine until you and the Pope came out on the balcony and the man next to me said, "Who's that on the balcony with Bubba?"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Subject: Funny letter from India<br><br>My dear Jagjit,<br><br>I am in a well here and hoping you are also in a well there. I'm writing this letter slowly, because I know you cannot read fast.<br><br>We are not living where we did when you left home. Your dad read in the newspaper that most accidents happen 20 miles from home, so we  moved 20 miles.<br><br>I am not able to send the address, as the last Sardar who stayed here took the house numbers with them for their new house so they would not have to change their address. Hopefully by next week we will be able to take our earlier address plate here, and that our address will remain same too.<br><br>This place is really nice. It even has a washing machine, situated right above the toilet. But I'm not sure it works too well. Last week I put in 3 shirts, pulled the chain, and haven't seen them since.<br><br>The weather here isn't too bad. It rained only twice last week. The first time it rained for 3 days and second time for 4 days.<br><br>The coat you wanted me to send you, your Aunt said it would be a little too      heavy to send in the mail with all the metal buttons, so we cut them off and    put them in the pocket.<br><br>Your father has another job. He has 500 men under him.<br>He is cutting the grass at the cemetery.<br><br>By the way, I took Bahu to our club's poolside. The manager is Badmash.

What powerful rivers! What beautiful animals!", he said to himself. As he was walking along the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. When he turned to see what the casue was, he saw a 7-foot grizzly charging right towards him. He ran as fast as he could. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing, He ran even faster, crying in fear. He looked over his shoulder again, and the bear was even closer. His heart was pounding and he tried to run even faster. He tripped and fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up, but saw the bear right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw and raising his right paw to strike him.<br><br>At that moment, the Atheist cried out "Oh my God!...." Time stopped. The bear froze. The forest was silent. Even the river stopped moving.<br><br>As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky, "You deny my existence for all of these years; teach others I don''t exist; and even credit creation to a cosmic accident. Do you expect me to help you out of this predicament? Am I to count you as a believer?"<br><br>The atheist looked directly into the light "It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask You to treat me as Christian now, but perhaps could you make the bear a Christian?" "Very well," said the voice.<br><br>The light went out. The river ran again. And the sounds of the forest resumed.<br><br>And then the bear dropped his right paw ..... brought both paws together...bowed his head and spoke: "Lord, for this food which I am about to receive, I am truly thankful."<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>A waiter asks a man, Â“May I take your order, sir?Â”<br><br>Â“Yes,Â” the man replies. Â“IÂ’m just wondering, exactly how do you prepare your chickens?Â”<br><br>Â“Nothing special, sir. We just tell them straight out that theyÂ’re going to die.Â”<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>An engineer dies and reports to the pearly gates. St. Peter checks his dossier and says, "Ah, you're an engineer -- you're in the wrong place."<br>So, the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in. Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing and building improvements. After awhile, they've got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer is a pretty popular guy.<br><br>One day, God calls Satan up on the telephone and says with a sneer, "So, how's it going down there in hell?"<br><br>Satan replies, "Hey, things are going great.   We've got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and there's no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next."<br><br>God replies, "What??? You've got an engineer? That's a mistake -- he should never have gotten down there; send him up here."<br><br>Satan says, "No way. I like having an engineer on the staff, and I'm keeping him."<br><br>God says, "Send him back up here or I'll sue."<br><br>Satan laughs uproariously and answers, "Yeah, right. And just where are YOU going to get a lawyer?"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &gt;1. On a farm out in the country lived a man and a woman and their<br>three<br>&gt; &gt;sons.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Early one morning, the woman awoke, and while looking out of the<br>window<br>&gt; &gt;onto to the pasture, she saw that the family's only cow was lying<br>&gt; &gt;dead<br>in<br>&gt; &gt;the field. The situation looked hopeless to her -- how could she<br>possibly<br>&gt; &gt;continue to feed her family now?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;In a depressed state of mind, she hung herself. When the husband<br>&gt; &gt;awoke<br>to<br>&gt; &gt;find his wife dead, as well as the cow, he too began to see the<br>&gt; &gt;hopelessness of the situation, and he shot himself in the head.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Now the oldest son woke up to discover his parents dead (and the<br>cow!),<br>and<br>&gt; &gt;he decided to go down to the river and drown himself.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;When he got to the river, he discovered a mermaid sitting on the<br>&gt; &gt;bank.<br>She<br>&gt; &gt;said, "I've seen all and know the reason for your despair. But if you<br>will<br>&gt; &gt;have sex with me five times in a row, I will restore your parents and<br>the<br>&gt; &gt;cow to you."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The son agreed to try, but after four times, he was simply unable to<br>&gt; &gt;satisfy her again. So the mermaid drowned him in the river.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Next the second oldest son woke up. After discovering what had<br>happened,<br>he<br>&gt; &gt;too decided to throw himself into the river.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The mermaid said to him, "If you will have sex with me ten times in a<br>row,<br>&gt; &gt;I will make everything right." And while the son tried his best<br>&gt; &gt;(seven times!), it was not enough to satisfy the mermaid, so she<br>&gt; &gt;drowned him<br>in<br>&gt; &gt;the river.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The youngest son woke up and saw his parents dead, the dead cow in<br>&gt; &gt;the field, and his brothers gone. He decided that life was a hopeless<br>prospect,<br>&gt; &gt;and he went down to the river to throw himself in.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;And there he also met the mermaid. "I have seen all that has<br>&gt; &gt;happened,<br>and<br>&gt; &gt;I can make everything right if you will only have sex with me fifteen<br>times<br>&gt; &gt;in a row."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The young son replied, "Is that all? Why not twenty times in a row?"<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The mermaid was somewhat taken aback by this request. Then he said,<br>"Hell,<br>&gt; &gt;why not twenty-five times in a row?" And even as she was reluctantly<br>&gt; &gt;agreeing to his request, he said, "Why not THIRTY times in a row?"<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Finally, she said, "Enough!! Okay, if you will have sex with me<br>&gt; &gt;thirty times in a row, then I will bring everybody back to perfect<br>&gt; &gt;health."<br>Then<br>&gt; &gt;the young son asked, "Wait! How do I know that thirty times in a row<br>won't<br>&gt; &gt;kill you like it did the cow?"<br></div>

Two old pensioners are taking a trip down memory lane by going<br>&gt; &gt;back<br>to<br>&gt; &gt;the place where they first met.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Sitting at a cafÃ©, the little old man says, "Remember the first time<br>&gt; &gt;I<br>met<br>&gt; &gt;you over 50 years ago? We left this cafe, went round the corner<br>&gt; &gt;behind<br>the<br>&gt; &gt;gas works, and I gave you one from behind."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;"Why, yes, I remember it well, dear," replies the little old lady<br>&gt; &gt;with<br>a<br>&gt; &gt;grin.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;"Well, for old time's sake, let's go there again. and I'll give you<br>one<br>&gt; &gt;from behind."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The two pensioners pay their bill and leave the cafe. A young man<br>sitting<br>&gt; &gt;next to them has overheard the conversation and smiles to himself,<br>thinking<br>&gt; &gt;it would be quite amusing to see two old pensioners at it. He gets up<br>and<br>&gt; &gt;follows them. Sure enough, he sees the two pensioners near the gas<br>works.<br>&gt; &gt;The little old lady pulls off her knickers and lifts up her dress.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The old man pulls down his pants and grabs the lady's hips, and the<br>little<br>&gt; &gt;old lady reaches for the fence. Well, what follows is 40 minutes of<br>the<br>&gt; &gt;most athletic sex the man has ever seen. The little old man is<br>&gt; &gt;banging<br>away<br>&gt; &gt;at the little old woman at a pace that can only be described as<br>phenomenal.<br>&gt; &gt;Limbs are flying everywhere, the movement is a blur, and they do not<br>stop<br>&gt; &gt;for a single second. Finally, they collapse and don't move for an<br>hour.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Well, the man is stunned. Never in his life has he ever seen anything<br>that<br>&gt; &gt;equates to this -- not in the movies, not from his friends, not from<br>his<br>&gt; &gt;own experiences.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Reflecting on what he has just seen, he says to himself, "I have to<br>know<br>&gt; &gt;his secret. If only I could shag like that now, let alone in 50<br>&gt; &gt;years' time!"<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The two old pensioners have by this time recovered and dressed<br>themselves.<br>&gt; &gt;Plucking up courage, the man approaches the pensioner.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;He says, "Sir, in all my life I have never seen anybody shag like<br>that,<br>&gt; &gt;particularly at your age. What's your secret? Could you shag like<br>&gt; &gt;that<br>50<br>&gt; &gt;years ago?"<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The pensioner replies, "Son, 50 years ago, that fucking fence wasn't<br>&gt; &gt;electrified."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>7. Doris and Fred had started their retirement years and decided to<br>raise<br>&gt; &gt;some extra cash by advertising for a lodger in their terrace house.<br>After<br>a<br>&gt; &gt;few days, a young, attractive woman applied for the room and<br>&gt; &gt;explained<br>that<br>&gt; &gt;she was a model working in a nearby city center studio for a few<br>weeks.<br>She<br>&gt; &gt;said she would like the room from Mondays to Thursdays but would pay<br>for<br>&gt; &gt;the whole week.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Doris showed her the house, and they agreed to start straight away.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;"There's just one problem," explained the model. "Because of my job,<br>&gt; &gt;I<br>have<br>&gt; &gt;to take a bath every night, and I notice you don't have a bath."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;"That's not a problem," replied Doris. "We have a tin bath out in the<br>yard,<br>&gt; &gt;and we bring it into the living room in front of the fire and fill it<br>with<br>&gt; &gt;hot water."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;"What about you're husband?" asked the model.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;"Oh, he plays darts most weekdays, so he will be out in the<br>&gt; &gt;evenings," replied Doris.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;"Good," said the model. "Now that's settled, I'll go to the studio<br>&gt; &gt;and<br>see<br>&gt; &gt;you tonight."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;That evening, Fred dutifully went to his darts match while Doris<br>prepared<br>&gt; &gt;the bath for the model. After stripping her clothes, the model<br>&gt; &gt;stepped<br>into<br>&gt; &gt;the bath. Doris was amazed to see that she had no pubic hair. The<br>model<br>&gt; &gt;noticed Doris's staring eyes, so she smiled and explained that it is<br>part<br>&gt; &gt;of her job to shave herself, especially when modeling swimwear or<br>&gt; &gt;underclothes.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Later when Fred returned, Doris related this oddity, and he did not<br>believe<br>&gt; &gt;her.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;"It's true, I tell you!" said Doris. "Look, if you don't believe me,<br>&gt; &gt;tomorrow night I'll leave the curtains slightly open, and you can<br>&gt; &gt;peek<br>in<br>&gt; &gt;and see for yourself."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The next night, Fred left as usual, and Doris prepared the bath for<br>the<br>&gt; &gt;model. As the model stepped naked into the bath, Doris stood behind<br>her.<br>&gt; &gt;Doris looked toward the curtains and pointed toward the model's naked<br>pubic<br>&gt; &gt;area. Then she lifted up her skirt and, wearing no panties, pointed<br>&gt; &gt;to<br>her<br>&gt; &gt;own hairy mass.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Later, Fred returned and they retired to bed.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;"Well, do you believe me now?" she asked Fred.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;"Yes," he replied. "I've never seen anything like it in my life. But<br>why<br>&gt; &gt;did you lift up your skirt and show yourself?"<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;"Just to show you the difference," answered Doris. "But I guess<br>&gt; &gt;you've<br>seen<br>&gt; &gt;me millions of times."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;"Yes," said Fred, "I have -- but the rest of the dart team hadn't."<br>&gt; &gt;<br></div>
