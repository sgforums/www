The chicken was faced with significant challenges to create and develop the competencies required for the newly competitive market.  Andersen Consulting, in a partnering relationship with the client, helped the chicken by rethinking its physical distribution strategy and  implementation processes. Using the Poultry Integration Model (PIM), Andersen helped the chicken use its skills, methodologies, knowledge, capital and experiences to align the chicken's people, processes and technology in support of its overall strategy within a Program Management framework. Andersen Consulting convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts and best chickens along with Anderson consultants with deep skills in the transportation industry to engage in a two-day itinerary of meetings in order to leverage their personal knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit, and to enable them to synergize with each other in order to achieve the implicit goals of delivering and uccessfully architecting and implementing an enterprise-wide value framework across the continuum of poultry cross-median processes.The meeting was held in a park-like setting, enabling and creating an impactful environment which was strategically based, industry focused, and built upon a consistent, clear, and unified market message and aligned with the chicken's mission, vision, and core values. This was conducive towards the creation of a total business.<br><br>LOUIS FARRAKHAN:  The road, you see, represents the black man.

And the chicken crossed the road, and there was much rejoicing.<br><br>FOX MULDER:  You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens have to cross the road before you believe it?<br><br>RICHARD M. NIXON:  The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat, the chicken did NOT cross the road.<br><br>MACHIAVELLI:  The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares why? The end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was.<br><br>JERRY SEINFELD:  Why does anyone cross a road?  I mean, why doesn't anyone ever think to ask, What the heck was this chicken doing walking around all over the place, anyway?"<br><br>FREUD:  The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.<br><br>BILL GATES:  I have just released the new Chicken Office 2000, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook.<br><br>OLIVER STONE:  The question is not, "Why did the chicken cross the road?" Rather, it is, "Who was crossing the road at the same time, whom we overlooked in our haste to observe the chicken crossing?"<br><br>CHARLES DARWIN:  Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturally selected in such a way that they are now genetically disposed to cross roads.<br><br>ALBERT EINSTEIN:  Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road moved beneath the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.<br><br>BUDDHA: Asking this question denies your own chicken nature.<br><br>RALPH WALDO EMERSON:  The chicken did not cross the road... it transcended it.<br><br>ERNEST HEMINGWAY:  To die.

            <div class='col-md body'>At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated "If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving $25 cars that got 1000 mi/gal." Recently General Motors addressed this comment by releasing the statement "Yes, but would you want your car to crash twice a day?" and also noted the following consequences of GM imitating Microsoft:<br><br>1. Every time they repainted the lines on the road you would have to buy a new car.<br>2. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and you would just accept this, restart and drive on.<br>3. Occasionally, executing a maneuver would cause your car to stop and fail and you would have to re-install the engine. For some strange reason, you would accept this too.<br>4. You could only have one person in the car at a time, unless you bought "Car95" or "CarNT". But, then you would have to buy more seats.<br>5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five times as fast, twice as easy to drive, but would only run on five percent of the roads.<br>6. The Macintosh car owners would get expensive Microsoft upgrades to their cars, which would make their cars run much slower.<br>7. The oil, gas and alternator warning lights would be replaced by a single "general car fault" warning light.<br>8. New seats would force everyone to have the same size butt.<br>9. The airbag system would say "are you sure?" before going off.<br>10. If you were involved in a crash, you would have no idea what happened.<br></div>

The bartender walks up and asks what's in the bag.<br><br>The man reaches into the bag and pulls out a little man, of about 12 inches height, and sets him on the counter. He reaches back into the bag and pulls out a small piano, setting it on the counter as well. He reaches into the bag once again and pulls out a tiny piano bench. The little man sits down at the piano and starts playing a beautiful piece by Mozart.<br><br>"Where on earth did you get that ???" asked the surprised bartender. The man responds by reaching into the paper bag. This time he pulls out a magic lamp. He hands it to the bartender and says: "Here. Rub it."<br><br>So the bartender rubs the lamp, and suddenly there's a gust of smoke and a beautiful genie is standing before him. "I will grant you one wish - just one."<br><br>The bartender gets real excited. Without hesitating he says, "I want a million bucks !"<br><br>A few moments later, a duck walks into the bar. Another duck, then another soon follow it. Pretty soon, the entire bar is filled with ducks and they keep coming!<br><br>The bartender turns to the man and says, "You know, I think your genie's a little deaf.
