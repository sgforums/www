The panda bear tells the policeman that he's innocent and, if he didn't believe him, to look in the dictionary. The policeman gets a dictionary and looks up "panda bear."<br>It says, ''Panda Bear: eats shoots and leaves.''<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>A frog goes into a bank, and hops up on the desk of the loan officer. ''Hi,'' he croaks.''What's your name?''<br>The loan officer says, ''My name is John Paddywack. May I help you?''<br><br>''Yeah,'' says the frog. ''I'd like to borrow some money.''<br><br>The loan officer finds this a little odd, but gets out a form. ''Okay,what's your name?''<br><br>The frog replies, ''Kermit Jagger.''<br><br>''Really?'' says the loan officer. ''Any relation to Mick Jagger?''<br><br>''Yeah, he's my dad.''<br><br>''Hmmm,'' says the loan officer. ''Do you have any collateral?''<br><br>The frog hands over a pink ceramic elephant and asks, ''Will this do?''<br><br>The loan officer says, ''Um, I'm not sure. Let me go check with the bank manager.''<br><br>''Oh, tell him I said hi,'' adds the frog. ''He knows me.''<br><br>The loan officer goes back to the manager and says, ''Excuse me, sir, but there's a frog out there named Kermit Jagger who wants to borrow some money. All he has for collateral is this pink elephant thing; I'm not even sure what it is.''<br><br>The manager says: ''It's a knick-knack, Paddywack, give the frog a loan; his old man's a Rolling Stone.''<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>A little kid walks into a city bus and sits right behind the driver and starts yelling, ''If my dad was a bull and my mom a cow I'd be a little bull.''<br>The driver starts getting mad at the noisy kid, who continues with, ''If my dad was an elephant and my mom a girl elephant I would be a little elephant.''<br><br>The kid goes on with several animals until the bus driver gets angry and yells at the kid, ''What if your dad was a drunk and your mom was a prostitute?!''<br><br>The kid smiles and says, ''I would be a bus driver!''<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>50 <span style="font-style: italic;">other ways</span> To Say Â“I Love YouÂ”<br><br>1. Â“If my heart were a baked potato, IÂ’d serve it to you with extra butter and sour cream.Â”<br>2. Â“Your terrible personality isnÂ’t so terrible after a few drinks and even when I sober up, itÂ’s not as terrible as everyone says.Â”<br><br>3. Â“IÂ’d shave my entire body with a dull, rusty razor blade and take a vinegar bath for you.Â”<br><br>4. Â“I am rubber, you are glue, any feelings you have for me bounce off and stick to you. Ironically, I feel the same way.Â”<br><br>5. Â“The other day I saw this little girl day drop her whole ice cream cone on the ground and start bawling. After I stopped laughing, I thought, Â“IÂ’m the same way when you donÂ’t call when you say you will.Â”<br><br>6. Â“I saw you in the morning, on the toilet, and I didnÂ’t run screaming. So there.Â”<br><br>7. Â“Hug me. If you let go -- you lose.Â”<br><br>8. Â“UmmÂ… likeÂ… you and me? Yeah. You and me.Â”<br><br>9. Â“You are to me what an eye patch and parrot is to a pirate.Â”<br><br>10. Â“You are the hole in my donut.Â”<br><br>11. Â“I am the pork, you are the beans.Â”<br><br>12. Â“You make me want to vomit little chocolate hearts.Â”<br><br>13. Â“You are my personal parachute.Â”<br><br>14. Â“If you were a margarita, IÂ’d drink you by the bucket.Â”<br><br>15. Â“I really like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like you.Â”<br><br>16. Â“If I had my junior high dance to do all over again, IÂ’d lean against the far wall, stare at you, and hate myself for not asking you if you liked the punch.Â”<br><br>17. Â“I donÂ’t love you. I merely enjoy tolerating your existence immensely.Â”<br><br>18. Â“IÂ’ll still want to have sex with you even when youÂ’re old, fat, and ugly.Â”<br><br>19. Â“You had me at Â‘Stop following meÂ’.Â”<br><br>20. Â“Your farts smell like vanilla.Â”<br><br>21. Â“WeÂ’re a two person chain gang.Â”<br><br>22. Â“Â“I am valedictorian of the University of You.Â”<br><br>23. Â“If you needed a kidney transplant, IÂ’d also throw in a bonus lung.Â”<br><br>24. Â“The wet, fatty ball of muscle and sinew that pumps my thick, steaming blood to all of my internal organs starts to beat irregularly when you come into my line of sight.Â”<br><br>25. Â“You are to me what Oprah is to mediocre self-help gurus.Â”<br><br>26. Â“While youÂ’re in the shower, I collect your skin flakes from the sheets and now I carry them around in this little napkin I keep tied around my neck.Â”<br><br>27. Â“You suck! So good.Â”<br><br>28. Â“If you were frozen in Carbonite and taken by bounty hunters, IÂ’d gladly disguise myself, infiltrate a fortress of intergalactic gangsters, threaten them with a thermal detonator, and defrost you myself.Â”<br><br>29. Â“When I was a kid I was kind of stupid and I thought it would be fun if I stuck a fork in the wall socket and obviously I was thrown across the room. Well, that shock that made my teeth chatter and my hair fall out? ThatÂ’s like you.Â”<br><br>30. Â“We are totally codependent and I donÂ’t want it any other way.Â”<br><br>31. Â“This is the Â“happily ever afterÂ” part of the damn fairy tale, dig?Â”<br><br>32. Â“If you were a handful of genital crabs, IÂ’d never change my underwear.Â”<br><br>33. Â“IÂ’m not saying we shouldnÂ’t see other people. IÂ’m just saying IÂ’ll chase whoever you see out of town with a nail-studded baseball bat.Â”<br><br>34. Â“I am your blank check. DonÂ’t bounce me.Â”<br><br>35. Â“Shut your piehole! Okay -- now kiss me with that beautiful piehole.Â”<br><br>36. Â“If you were in a horrible accident and they put your head in a saline solution-filled fish tank, IÂ’d feed you, change your water, and carry you on my back everyday until they built you a kick-ass robot body.Â”<br><br>37. Â“If given the choice between playing roundball like Michael Jordan or raising rugrats with you in a trailer park then IÂ’d be the first to stand in line to buy diapers.Â”<br><br>38. Â“YouÂ’re such a fucking asshole! And so am I. LetÂ’s forgive each other, get drunk, and screw.Â”<br><br>39. Â“If I was smart, IÂ’d follow you around like a puppy and never, ever crap in the corner.Â”<br><br>40. Â“Not only would I carry you out of the factory and drive away you away on my sweet chopperÂ… IÂ’d also buy you a beer and a basket of fries.Â”<br><br>41. I wrote you a poem: Â“You walk in beauty like the night/ which means youÂ’re the hottest babe in sight/Come home with me so I donÂ’t get in a fight/I agree with what you said: you are always right.Â”<br><br>42. Â“IÂ’m a grown up and just face the facts that youÂ’re my security blanket.Â”<br><br>43. Â“You donÂ’t know it, but right here, right now, is the point in the musical montage part of the movie. LetÂ’s split a pretzel and go for a walk on the footbridge.Â”<br><br>44. Â“Not only would I die for you, IÂ’d bitch slap Satan a good one, too.Â”<br><br>45.Â“Look: youÂ’re the only one allowed in my bunker. So go get some batteries while IÂ’ll clean my shotgun.Â”<br><br>46. Â“IÂ’m a junky for your instant messages.Â”<br><br>47. Â“I had the weirdest dream last night: I was waking up just as dawn was breaking, but instead of the sun rising on the horizon, it was your glowing face. You were smiling and glowing and it felt to good. IsnÂ’t that just strange? I have NO idea what that means. Pass the ketchup.Â”<br><br>48. Â“YouÂ’re my best and only naked friend.Â”<br><br>49. Â“IÂ’d smoke five packs of you everyday and welcome each and every eventual tumor.Â”<br><br>50. Â“LetÂ’s set aside cool, ironic detachment for just a moment, shall we? I love you. WowÂ… wasnÂ’t that just like lame movie Reality Bites? YouÂ’ve never seen it? ItÂ’s awesomeÂ… in a totally stupid way.Â”<br></div>

During his stay, he got along well with the guards and all his fellow inmates. The warden saw that deep down, Andy was a good person and made arrangements for Andy to learn a trade while doing his time.<br>After 3 years, Andy was recognized as one of the best carpenters in the local area. Often he would be given a weekend pass to do odd jobs for the citizens of the community, and he always reported back to prison before Sunday night was over.<br><br>The warden was thinking of remodeling his kitchen and in fact had done much of the work himself. But he lacked the skills to build a set of kitchen cupboards and a large counter top which he had promised his wife. So he called Andy into his office and asked him to complete the job for him. But, alas, Andy refused. He told the warden, ''Gosh, I'd really like to help you but counter fitting is what got me into prison in the first place.''<br><br></div>
