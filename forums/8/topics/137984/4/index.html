On a farm out in the country lived a man and a woman and their<br>three<br>&gt; &gt;sons.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Early one morning, the woman awoke, and while looking out of the<br>window<br>&gt; &gt;onto to the pasture, she saw that the family's only cow was lying<br>&gt; &gt;dead<br>in<br>&gt; &gt;the field. The situation looked hopeless to her -- how could she<br>possibly<br>&gt; &gt;continue to feed her family now?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;In a depressed state of mind, she hung herself. When the husband<br>&gt; &gt;awoke<br>to<br>&gt; &gt;find his wife dead, as well as the cow, he too began to see the<br>&gt; &gt;hopelessness of the situation, and he shot himself in the head.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Now the oldest son woke up to discover his parents dead (and the<br>cow!),<br>and<br>&gt; &gt;he decided to go down to the river and drown himself.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;When he got to the river, he discovered a mermaid sitting on the<br>&gt; &gt;bank.<br>She<br>&gt; &gt;said, "I've seen all and know the reason for your despair. But if you<br>will<br>&gt; &gt;have sex with me five times in a row, I will restore your parents and<br>the<br>&gt; &gt;cow to you."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The son agreed to try, but after four times, he was simply unable to<br>&gt; &gt;satisfy her again. So the mermaid drowned him in the river.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Next the second oldest son woke up. After discovering what had<br>happened,<br>he<br>&gt; &gt;too decided to throw himself into the river.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The mermaid said to him, "If you will have sex with me ten times in a<br>row,<br>&gt; &gt;I will make everything right." And while the son tried his best<br>&gt; &gt;(seven times!), it was not enough to satisfy the mermaid, so she<br>&gt; &gt;drowned him<br>in<br>&gt; &gt;the river.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The youngest son woke up and saw his parents dead, the dead cow in<br>&gt; &gt;the field, and his brothers gone. He decided that life was a hopeless<br>prospect,<br>&gt; &gt;and he went down to the river to throw himself in.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;And there he also met the mermaid. "I have seen all that has<br>&gt; &gt;happened,<br>and<br>&gt; &gt;I can make everything right if you will only have sex with me fifteen<br>times<br>&gt; &gt;in a row."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The young son replied, "Is that all? Why not twenty times in a row?"<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The mermaid was somewhat taken aback by this request. Then he said,<br>"Hell,<br>&gt; &gt;why not twenty-five times in a row?" And even as she was reluctantly<br>&gt; &gt;agreeing to his request, he said, "Why not THIRTY times in a row?"<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Finally, she said, "Enough!! Okay, if you will have sex with me<br>&gt; &gt;thirty times in a row, then I will bring everybody back to perfect<br>&gt; &gt;health."<br>Then<br>&gt; &gt;the young son asked, "Wait! How do I know that thirty times in a row<br>won't<br>&gt; &gt;kill you like it did the cow?"<br></div></blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

He told me to stand in front of a mirror, stare at myself and repeat 'I do not have a headache; I do not have a headache, I do not have a headache.' It worked! The headaches are all gone."<br><br>The husband replies, "Well, that is wonderful."<br><br>His wife then says, "You know, you haven't been exactly a ball of fire in the bedroom these last few years. Why don't you go see the hypnotist and see if he can do anything for that?" The husband agrees to try it.<br><br>Following his appointment, the husband comes home, rips off his clothes, picks up his wife and carries her into the bedroom. He puts her on the bed and says, "Don't move, I'll be right back."<br><br>He goes into the bathroom and comes back a few minutes later and jumps into bed and makes passionate love to his wife like never before.<br><br>His wife says, "Boy, that was wonderful!"<br><br>The husband says, "Don't move! I will be right back."<br><br>He goes back into the bathroom, comes back and round two was even better than the first time. The wife sits up and her head is spinning.<br><br>Her husband again says, "Don't move, I'll be ! ! right back."<br><br>With that , he goes back in the bathroom. This time, his wife quietly follows him and there, in the bathroom, she sees him standing at the mirror and saying, "She's not my wife. She's not my wife. She's not my wife!"<br><br>His funeral services will be held on Monday.</div></blockquote></div>

The proud President replied "That's what I call guts!"<br><br>The Prime Minister of UK was pissed. He called his 3-star General and said "General, jump into the sea and swim 10 rounds around this ship!". The General replied "Anything for the Queen, Sir!", jumped into the shark infested sea and swam 10 rounds with the sharks chasing him like hell! After the 10 successful rounds, the Colonel came up to the deck and said, "Long Live the Queen!". The proud PM replied "That's what I call guts!"<br><br>The Prime Minister of Singapore cannot tahan ("tolerate" in Singapore colloquial). He had to show that his soldiers have it too. So he called one of his Privates and said "Soldier, jump into the sea and swim 50 rounds".The Private replied "Ooi, you seow is it ? ("mad" in Hokkien) I just bought my Executive Condo and I am paying through my nose. You want me to jump and die or what? If you want to ya-ya (show off in Malay), you jump into the sea lah". The PM smiled and said "Now, that's what I call guts!"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
