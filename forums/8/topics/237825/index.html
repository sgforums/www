            <div class='col-md body'>Well this is something i saw in another forum and thought that i might as well share it here,this is news released by the US FDA on suspected Salmonella Contamination and which resulted in ConAgra the manufacturer recalling the batch of peanut butter.I did a double check using google so i think this should be true.In the article,the batch mentioned starts with product code 2111 and i referred to the bottle i have at home and it does indeed start with 2111 (on the lid).I also checked that the bottle of PB is also made in the US so this article is relevant to the PP PB we find in our supermarkets.<br><br><a href="http://www.salem-news.com/articles/february152007/peanutbutterrecall_021507.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.salem-news.com/articles/february152007/peanutbutterrecall_021507.php</a><br><br><a href="http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2007/NEW01563.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2007/NEW01563.html</a><br><br>what is inside the article<br><br>FDA Warns Consumers Not to Eat Certain Jars of Peter Pan Peanut Butter and Great Value Peanut Butter<br>Product May be Contaminated With Salmonella<br>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning consumers not to eat certain jars of Peter Pan peanut butter or Great Value peanut butter due to risk of contamination with Salmonella Tennessee (a bacterium that causes foodborne illness).  The affected jars of Peter Pan and Great Value peanut butter have a product code located on the lid of the jar that begins with the number "2111."   Both the Peter Pan and Great Value brands are manufactured in a single facility in Georgia by ConAgra.  Great Value peanut butter made by other manufacturers is not affected.<br><br>If consumers have any of this Peter Pan or Great Value brand peanut butter in their home that has been purchased since May 2006, they should discard it.<br><br>Symptoms of foodborne illness caused by Salmonella include fever, diarrhea and abdominal cramps.  In persons with poor underlying health or weakened immune systems, Salmonella can invade the bloodstream and cause life-threatening infections.  Individuals who have recently eaten Peter Pan and Great Value brand peanut butter beginning with product code 2111 and have experienced any of these symptoms should contact their doctor or health care provider immediately.  Any such illnesses should be reported to state or local health authorities.<br><br>FDA's warning is based on a just-completed epidemiological study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the states and local health agencies, which links 288 cases of foodborne illness in 39 states to consumption of varying types of Peter Pan peanut butter.  This report was provided to FDA on February 13.<br><br>The outbreak appears to be ongoing and the first consumer may have become ill in August 2006.  The cause of foodborne illnesses can be difficult to identify.  As a result of extensive epidemiological testing and recent case control studies, CDC was recently able to identify Peter Pan peanut butter as the likely cause of illness.  Great Value brand peanut butter beginning with product code 2111 is manufactured in the same plant as Peter Pan peanut butter and, thus, is believed to be at similar risk of contamination.<br><br>ConAgra is recalling all Peter Pan and Great Value peanut butter beginning with product code 2111 that already was distributed.  The company also is destroying all affected products in their possession.  The company will cease production until the exact cause of contamination can be identified and eliminated.  ConAgra will advise consumers to destroy any Peter Pan and Great Value brand peanut butter beginning with product code 2111 in their possession.  To assist in this endeavor, FDA has sent investigators to ConAgra's processing plant in Sylvester, Georgia where the products are made to review records, collect product samples and conduct tests for Salmonella Tennessee.<br><br>FDA will provide regular updates as more information becomes available.<br><br>Consumers who have questions should contact ConAgra at 866-344-6970<br></div>
