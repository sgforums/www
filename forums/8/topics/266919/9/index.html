I still can't figure out such behavoir too.<br><br>I live in this HDB estate where there were 2 of the said ppl types. Yup...everytime they wanna ride out to the main road from the narrow snakey side road along the HDB blocks, these two jerks have to rev their engines out loud!!! They can simply ride out quietly and not disturb the whole neigbourhood, but they dun, instead they will rev and rev and rev and vroom loudly onto the main road. It's not as if they can ride out at speed to the main road!! The road is curvy and there's this huge bump to slow vehicles down and yet these jerks still wanna rev their engines. And they do it anytime of the day and night... and into very early morning too.....like at 1am----3am.. During these hour most ppl were in dreamland, than suddenly, these two jerks come vrooming loudly!!!!  CNNCB!!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>And it's not like they're riding a Harley ...that I can understand....but some skimpy Jap scramblers. Granted, scramblers sure makes a lotta noise..but it all boils down to discipline and control of the engine. I have friends who also ride scrambler, they know when to ride quietly when inside HDB estates. Nowadays, I hardly hear these 2 jerks anymore. Perhaps they have met their maker.........hehehehehehe....whahahahaha!!!!!!!<br><br>Guess these jerks just wanna show off they owned scramblers.....MFCCB!!!!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> Maybe it's in their blood, when have something different, must make one hell of a noise...otherwise no one will notice their so called achievement.<br><br>Same when they're at the playground, must make the loudest noise to attract attention.......MFAH!!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  Like kick the trashbin, stomp loudly and to ensure ppl notice their stupid [acrobatic] acts and all.  Others have been seen  splashing unwanted drinks onto void deck walls and tables, park their motobikes there too, scribble junk onto the walls.  Of course, they won't linger around to be caught, they'd flee!!<br><br>Once there were these other 2 jerks...they have nothing better to do than to set a part of the playground on fire. It was about close to 12 midnight. Luckily, there were ppl inside the RC centre nearby. So ppl started shoutin and managed to put out the fire b4 the fire trucks arrive!! Naturally, these 2 jerks ran off into the darkness, with some RC ppl hot after them [but did not managed to catch them]   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  Police came but managed to catch air only!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Why are they so inconsederate and anti social is beyond my comprehension......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Btw.......not all Malays are like the above......I know and interact with Malays too.  They are not like the above....Guess there's always some sore thumb somewhere in all the races....hmm.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
