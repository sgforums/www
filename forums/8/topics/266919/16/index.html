To make it clearer about how serious it is, imagine the TS used the same expletive to describe the sound of the daily prayers playing from the speakers of a mosque or the sounds of a Chinese funeral procession.<br>This alone can get TS into trouble already.<br><br><blockquote>Then why they must play with their motor bikes make until the whole HDB flat can hear them.<br>This one tradition? Almost all the wedding sure got alot of malays come with motor bike and on their engine loud loud.

That simple sentence of Â“ThatÂ’s the reason why I see no reason to tolerateÂ” will get him into some hot soup.<br><br><blockquote><span style="color: red;">Chinese songkah also not so noisy.<br>Chinese opera and lion dance also not as noisy as them ah.  </span></blockquote>The TS makes another fatal error. Now he is attempting to use Chinese traditional ethnic traditions to justify his grievances at the issue. This paragraph will certainly not go down well with our non-Chinese citizens.<br>In fact that paragraph of trying to say that itÂ’s worse then Â“songkah, opera and lion danceÂ” can and will lead to ethnic tensions, especially among our minorities who put up with the mentioned traditions they do not understand and are now told that Â“hey itÂ’s not as bad as what the NON-CHINESE do.Â”<br>Unfortunately TS can weasel all his want out of this and say he means this and that, but his words are clearly selected carelessly and without sensitivity. And worse, his corresponding actions to defend his points of view led him to say even more incriminating stuff. I wonÂ’t post all of them here, but you donÂ’t need to ask the admins for the logs to see them, you can just read them off the quotes by other users.<br>So what can potentially happen to our TS? LetÂ’s look at events not too long ago:<br></div>

I think because of the way this will be played up, it's negative publicity for the Singapore blogging community."<br><br>"Currently if you surf the net you will come across a lot of bloggers making such comments. You will probably see a drop in such cases henceforth. At the moment I am not aware of any cases except of a case in Iran where bloggers are charged. But Iran has a different legal system from Singapore," said Leonard Loo, managing partner of Leonard Loo &amp; Co Advocates &amp; Solicitors.<br><br>Channel NewsAsia understands that the Media Development Authority had asked host servers to remove a racist blog from the web.<br><br>Police are now investigating this matter.<br><br>While many racist blogs by Singaporeans can be found online, the blogging community is also quick to criticize any racist comments.<br><br>Channel NewsAsia has received many emails from viewers informing us about a few racist sites.<br><br>Viewers said they were "appalled as well as disappointed that a Singaporean could condemn" other fellow Singaporeans of a different race.<br><br>Lawyers warn that anybody who forwards seditious remarks to others via email can also be charged with abetment.<br><br>The case is expected to be heard in court again on September 21.<br><br>A person is deemed to have committed an offence under the Sedition Act if he performs any act which has a seditious tendency, or conspires with any person to do so.<br><br>It is also an offence to utter any seditious words or to print, publish, sell, distribute, reproduce or import any seditious publication.<br><br><strong>First time offenders can be fined up to S$5,000, or jailed up to three years, or both. </strong><br><br>For subsequent offences, they can be jailed up to five years and have their seditious publications forfeited and destroyed. - CNA /ct/ls </blockquote></div>

The Christian found charÂ’s blog, which contained this drawing by Jared von Hindeman.<br><br>It is not known if the cartoon is a metaphor for the corrosive effect of religion upon reason, or just a picture of Jesus munching on some kidÂ’s brain, but the Christian found it sufficiently offensive to demand that char remove it from his blog. Char responded by posting three more Jesus-themed pieces, and thatÂ’s when the police got involved.<br><br>Char was arrested, his computers confiscated, and he is now on bail waiting to see whether or not he will be prosecuted. He faces a possible fine of up to $5,000 or a prison term of up to 3 years.<br><br>Interestingly, the risen Christ is not the first zombie to feature in the bible.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sedition Act (Singapore)<br>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br><br>The Sedition Act is in Chapter 290 of the Statutes of Singapore. It was last revised in 1985.<br><br><strong>In September 2005, the Sedition Act was first used on individuals when three men, including a teenager, were charged for making seditious and inflammatory racist comments on the Internet.</strong><br><br><strong>Seditious tendency.</strong><span style="font-style: italic;">3. Â—(1) A seditious tendency is a tendency Â—<br>(a) to bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against the Government;<br>(b) to excite the citizens of Singapore or the residents in Singapore to attempt to procure in Singapore, the alteration, otherwise than by lawful means, of any matter as by law established;<br><br>(c) to bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against the administration of justice in Singapore;<br>(d) to raise discontent or disaffection amongst the citizens of Singapore or the residents in Singapore;<br><br>(e) to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population of Singapore.<br><br>(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), any act, speech, words, publication or other thing shall not be deemed to be seditious by reason only that it has a tendency Â—<br><br>(a) to show that the Government has been misled or mistaken in any of its measures;<br><br>(b) to point out errors or defects in the Government or the Constitution as by law established or in legislation or in the administration of justice with a view to the remedying of such errors or defects;<br><br>(c) to persuade the citizens of Singapore or the residents in Singapore to attempt to procure by lawful means the alteration of any matter in Singapore; or<br><br>(d) to point out, with a view to their removal, any matters producing or having a tendency to produce feelings of ill-will and enmity between different races or classes of the population of Singapore,<br><br>if such act, speech, words, publication or other thing has not otherwise in fact a seditious tendency.<br><br>(3) For the purpose of proving the commission of any offence under this Act, the intention of the person charged at the time he did or attempted to do or made any preparation to do or conspired with any person to do any act or uttered any seditious words or printed, published, sold, offered for sale, distributed, reproduced or imported any publication or did any other thing shall be deemed to be irrelevant if in fact such act had, or would, if done, have had, or such words, publication or thing had a seditious tendency.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Provision against racist comments<br>Subsection 3 of the Act describes the types of publication that have seditious tendency and these includes publication that "promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes". Singapore takes social cohesion and racial harmony in the country seriously because of its history of racial riots in the 1960s. More recent events of racial violence in neighbouring Indonesia in the late 1990s and early 2000s also serve as reminders of potential inter-racial conflicts in the region.</strong></span><br><br><strong>Cases in 2005</strong><br>In September 2005, the Sedition Act was first used on individuals when two men were charged for making seditious and inflammatory racist comments on the Internet. The two men are Nicholas Lim Yew, 25, and Benjamin Koh Song Huat, 27. They made their remarks on Internet forums in response to a letter printed in The Straits Times.<br><br>On July 14, The Straits Times published a letter from a Muslim woman asking if cab companies allowed uncaged pets to be transported in taxis, after she saw a dog standing on a taxi seat next to its owner. She said that "dogs may drool on the seats or dirty them with their paws". Her concerns had a religious basis as according to Ustaz Ali Haji Mohamed, chairman of Khadijah mosque, who pointed out that: "There are various Islamic schools of thought which differ in views. But most Muslims in Singapore are from the Syafie school of thought. This means they are not allowed to touch dogs which are wet, which would include a dog's saliva. This is a religious requirement.".<br><br>Two days later, on an online forum for Singaporean dog lovers www.doggiesite.com, Lim posted anti-Muslim remarks that allegedly "had a seditious tendency to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of the population in Singapore", according the charges. <strong>He pleaded guilty and served one day in jail and a fine of $5,000. </strong><br><br>The other man, Koh, is accused of making similar racist remarks filled with <strong>vulgarities and insulting to Malays </strong>and their religion. He also pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one month imprisonment.<br><br>In passing the sentences to Koh and Lim on October 7, 2005, Senior District Judge Richard Magnus said the two had crossed the red line by wantonly breaching the basic ground rules. He said passing a deterrent sentence was necessary so that such offending acts are tackled early and contained, adding that callous and reckless remarks on racial or religious subjects had the potential to cause social disorder, regardless of which medium or forum they are expressed.<br><br>On September 16, a third person, a 17 year old youth, was also charged with the Sedition Act for making racist remarks on his blog site. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 24 months supervised probation that includes counselling sessions and community service in the Malay community. [1]<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong later commented that such remarks will not be tolerated, even if posted on the Internet. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng said that the Sedition Act was under review to see if it should be strengthened or renewed.</strong></span><br><br><strong>Event in 2006</strong><br>In June 2006, it was reported that a 21-year-old blogger was under police investigation for posting mocking caricutures of Jesus Christ on the Internet. [2] He was later let off with a stern warning from the police. [3]<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>What TS can do to get out of trouble.</strong><br><br>Actually it's quite simple, but might be not guaranteed because this thread has already carried out as far as it did.<br><br>If the TS posts an CLEAR apology stating that he realized that the words he used were insensitive and hurting to people of other ethnicities, as well as renouncing the content of his original post, and make it clear to ALL who visit this thread, any investigation against him will probably be dropped at this point.<br><br>This probably means he has to make a detailed posts much akin to length and structure of his original post as well as a point-to-point apology and clarification, and not the half-past-six attempts at trying to backtrack that he has been making lately.<br><br>It will go a long way towards getting him out of trouble, instead of sticking around and moaning Â“the who post letter liaoÂ” or giving false smiles and going Â“IÂ’ll tell you guys when I get screwedÂ” or wondering when they are coming to get him.<br><br>The only person that can save him now is himself, but it all depends on if he is willing to eat humble pie.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I strongly agree with some of the things said, TS may have a genuine greviance about the noise. However, his tone, attitude and choice of words is inappropriate and rather crude.<br><br>I have not gone thru the entire thread nor have I read the original posts (not yet anyway), only read what sgrex has quoted so far.<br><br>Based on the little I've seen, his words are crude and kind of reflects his insentiveness about religious and racial issues. At most I would say he is not well educated or enlightened on such things. It does also hint towards racial intolerance. But the few quotes I've seen do not seem malicious unlike those mentioned in a certain newspaper article.<br><br>However, I'm not aware of any other replies TS may have made and already edited by now. Nor do I know of any other things, especially personal insults and remarks that may be race-specific.</div>
