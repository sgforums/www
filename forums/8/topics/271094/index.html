You have to either connect the STB to your rooftop antenna or the digital indoor antenna provided.<br><br>Hope this resolves your question!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Currently, shows which are in full HD format include CSI and lifeline.<br><br>HD5 is actually a simulcast of channel 5 with all their programmes enhanced so that viewers would be able to enjoy near HD quality.<br><br>Difference is noticeable in comparsion between HD 5 and Digital Channel 5.<br><br>You will also be able to view other channels such as channelnewsasia, TV Mobile, Channel 8 in digital format.<br><br>A set top box is a worthwhile investment as Mediacorp studios would be converting their terrestial signals to HD ones progressively in the next 2 years.<br><br>In my opinion - although a STB is slightly costly but affordable in this day, do get one and enjoy the clarity of HD 5 (if you mainly watch english programmes). Furthermore - the STB is a novelty now and will be a common item in the future. Getting it and allowing your guests to enjoy that extra eye candy is definitely worth it; with the gushes of compliments that is!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys and jeez.Just bought my Draco STB + ANT from someone selling his brand new unopened set.<br><br>Here's a mini review by me.<br><br>ANT 100 satellite comes with it.A small photoframe like object,also around 4X6 or so.<br>HD5 is clear and uncluttering with good placement of the ANT,u need to place the ant near windows.However to view the other digital channel ie Digital 8,u need to have really good placement of the ANT.I found that when i place the ant somewhere <span style="font-style: italic;">near</span> the window HD5 was ok and uncluttered.However other channels will start to lag.I ended up putting the ANT at the window,propped by the grill.<br><br>I agree on the agreement on HD5 being better than 5.However Digital 8 and 5 and CNA was noticability of poorer quality than my coaxial analogue.<br><br>Also,a little audio glitch.When u connect the optical cable to the STB for surround sound,it will work but the regular audio transmitted by the HDMI cable was not unmuted.I had to put the volume of the STB to 0%<br><br>Also,another glitch is that even though the STB is on standby,the audio signal in the connected optical cable remains and my subwoofer did not auto standby and remained on instead.I had to manually power off the sub</div>
