Maintaining it all boils down to effort lah - coz arranging meet-ups and all even between friends takes a lot of planning, with everyone having different schedules &amp; their own commitment [obviously family has come before friends, for me that is].  *shrugx*  Idk about others, but I find myself hanging out with different people during different periods of timeÂ… itz likeÂ… hang out with 1 group - then subsequent weeks/mths with themÂ… then after awhile, switch groupÂ… etc.  What someone mentioned to me is pretty true to a certain extent - u tend to be closer to those who are Â“convenientÂ” to you.<br><br>Am thankful though, that I do have a bunch of friends whomÂ… well if thereÂ’s anyone whoÂ’s gonna be friends with me foreverÂ… those are the ones.  We donÂ’t really meet up on a super regular basis - at times itz months in-betweenÂ… but somehow, the friendship still exists.</div>

As a friend, you should alway bless or help your friend and his/her family all the best.<br><br>There are many other relationship by which most of us have mistaken it as friends which  is actually not,  such as classmates, colleagues and teammates. Friend in one way or the other, is your private matter. In losing or accepting a friend, you should be a judge of yourself, but when the time comes, you hv to let them go as they too have to let you go.</div>

Some drift away and some still keep in contact. Only the very good ones treasure the friendships. If they remember your friendship in the heart, it is fine that we don't see one another there much.<br><br>Family is a responsibility.<br><br>However, i could advocate not to forget to have a life outside the family. Friendship can be a emotional therapy too, when you need someone to talk to, other than your hubby.
