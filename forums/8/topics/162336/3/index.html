            <div class='col-md body'>saw today ST paper, the four footballers 18 to 19 yrs old got probation for statuatory gang rape, in the toilet.  The girl is only 12.  6 to 7 years difference. A 12 yr old, they also want to rape.  this is a gang rape and sex crime.<br><br>This send a preceeding , there is no need to jail offenders if they are of value to the country.  The punishment does not even take account that the girl is 12, 4 yr below the 16.  So it speaks the same even if victim is 5 or10 years old.<br><br>The four will surely force the girl for a few more go once she exceeds 16.<br><br>And the two other cases,  the offenders get jailed big time.<br><br>The next future case of similar circurmstances might even be throw out the windows because its a tidak apa crime, small matter.  And if footballer again, the judges may shake their hands and say, "sorry for the inconvenience cause".<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>all those crap by authorities about going after and getting tough , punishing offenders on child sex crimes here and overseas and underage rape has been destroyed at the hands of this judge, who thinks football talent is necessary for singapore to survive.  The CJ has set all preceeding to be jailed and yet its has been throw away just because of four ,18 and 19 yr old footballers.<br><br>Well looks like sentencing is up to judges to please offenders and whoever these offenders report to, in this case FAS.<br><br>The sentence is just equivalent to having the case treated as a nuisance waste tax payer money case and a small matter.  Might as well abolish this under 16 age sex law.<br><br>12 yr old is just too young to be gang rape and worse in a toilet regardless of her behaviour.  She must have gone home complained private part extreme pain and have to walk legs wide open and need to see a doctor.  This case has set a preceeding that even rape for 8 or 10 yr old is consider a small matter and offenders need only a probation.<br><br>Through this case it  has set a new trend that under 16 sex and child sex punishment is probation and footballers may even don;t need probation and just counselling.  The contribution of offenders to society outweigh the crime and those child sex victims and parents have been unjustly treated by law.<br><br>To think that singapore go all way to hang a drug trafficker and yet go very soft to the point of  charging the 4 footballers  for  gang rape of 12 yr old victim as equivalent to very minor small crime and to a lesser sentence of holiday probation.<br><br>From this episode, in its simplest form a small matter to judges and up to judges to decide how to charge and sentence whether its drug trafficker or child sex crime.    Its all about how valuable the offenders are to the country and their status in society,</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think IQ and rational thinking of an 12 yr old or 10 yr old or 8 yr old or even 6 yrs old also plays a part and ability to rational what is right or wrong.<br><br>Whether its force or trick or sweet talk, those guys knew what they did is a jail time crime and they proceeded anyway thinking a 12 yr old will not report them. Anyway what do a 12 yr old know, cannot even tell the difference between can touch or cannot touch or normal, or she just follow as told.<br>Those guys could be telling her, its okay evryone does that.  Until she finds pain at her private part and ask ibu.  Not sure what schools have talk to them about sexual crime and outrage of modesty to children.<br><br>The oldest guy is a 19 yr old. 7 yrs difference.  Surely he must know what is right and wrong.<br>Its same as internet or neighbourhood sex predators that go around sweet talk below 13 yrs old into having sex and police comming hard on them and school talks.<br><br>Can a below 12 yrs old girl give okay for sex when she don;t even know right or wrong on such thing?   And worse all 4 guys.  If there were 20 guys around, she would have been trick into letting all 20 have fun with her.  She is 4 yrs below the 16 limit.  If a girl at 15 or 16 gets pregnant by any one of the four guys, the suppose to be father will mostly get a probation and families force weddings and the rest charged.<br><br>What happens if a girl is10 or 8,  does probation fits the crime?  In recent cases, to me,  in singapore court system,   the sentence of offenders whatever status of value to the country and connections,  outweigh the seriousness of crime and rights of the victims here.  So much for big talk by gov about protection of children rights and going after child sex seekers in batam or poorer countries.<br><br></div>

The offenders get off as light as possible and no jail time so that they can play football and no dent in their record and probably become future police NSF, and represent our national teams.   And they can go on with any below 12 yr old and mostly get away with it becasue of ther national football status.</div>

The probation for the 4 footballers gang rape of 12 yr old is just for show.<br><br>Might as well don;t sentence them at all.  Its like the probation is just a strict regiment for them to train football under the guise of representing singapore in future.    Might as well give them special footballer approved pass to commit underage sex.<br><br>The just jailed 17 yr old better protest, maybe he too can get a probation since its set by preceeding case that underage sex or rape is probation now.<br><br>No more jailing from now on. just probation.
