No need lawyers to argue or even consideration from probation officers , as long it goes inside the underage girl, its statuatory rape.  I think this case will go towards more leniency because of the footballer status.  Crimes of such crimes usually involves youths growing up and are usually the same ages as the 4.  For the judges to twist it soft means our judicial can have favourism on who's who.  All the judges over the years so far treat such cases so seriously, not even towards leniency as read from news over the years.<br><br>i hope the judges know what they are doing.  if not uncle Yong will double their sentences if he sees sentences less than those that he give jailed time previously for same offence.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What the freaking hell....<br><br>I am completely appalled at the notion that the boys may get away with their crime. 'Spotless records' or not, 'young' or not, footballers or not, the fact still remains that they took advantage of a 12 year-old girl to satisfy their carnal desires. Sure, the boys are young, but come on.... don't tell me that 17- and 18- year olds cannot tell the difference between right and wrong.<br><br>In a previous case, a bunch of guys who did it with a 14 year-old got jailed even though it was completely the girl's idea from start to finish. Now, I'm not making excuses for those guys, and they are pure criminals who chose to do the wrong thing instead of walking away. I don't know whether or not they have criminal records, but I say they completely deserve their sentences.<br><br>So why should these footballers be treated any differently? What kind of message are we sending to our youth? That you can get away with it as long as you are 'young', have 'spotless records' and good footballing skills?<br><br>I say put all those boys in prison and throw away the key. Heck, toss in a few strokes of the cane for good measure.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
