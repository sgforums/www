            <div class='col-md body'>Qwerty,<br><br>I do believe in the equality of sexes. Even though there is equality of sexes, it does not mean that we should abandon the code of being gentleman. What I meant by being gentleman, is not just about treating the gal to dinner and helping her to carry bags. Without being a gentleman, by helping her to carry the bags and treating her to a meal, you are merely extending the hand of friendship to a person. It is sincerity that makes a gentleman. If a person expects something out from C something else i.e. a r/s or something bad, then the whole idea of friendship is gone, and the code of gentleman is totally out of the question, because it is a sheer demostration of hypocrisy.<br><br>Then the next thing is about the complaint, and if she is superficial about you not owning a car, then u should not say anything.  One should not lower his dignity to a woman because he does not have any of the material possession. I think sending her home is perfectly valid. Sometimes, a gal don't want to be sent home because they think they can go on their own, I just let them do that, but I ensure that they reach home safely by calling them.<br><br>I am not on whoever's side. In Sparkle's version of J, there are some points which can refuted. A guy can only do as much as he can to help. I don't think all gals are like what u said of C.<br><br>Honestly speaking, I would say that you are fortunate to get someone out for a meeting.  Some people do not have the chance like you, and worse, they get snubbed and bad-mouthed for asking a friend out on a date and being misunderstood as something else.  Ask yourself why u are complaining, and in my opinion, I think that you expect a lot from the gal.<br><br>My 2 pennies worth, and have a good day. Maybe when u go out with C the next time, enjoy the date with her as a friend lor...<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 23 August 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>qwerty,<br><br>in my opinion, in physical sports, the guy usually has the advantage since they are physically stronger. maybe C knows that you are a tough opponent, that's why she's asking for a handicap. by asking, she's already admiting that she's a lousier player than you, and it wouldn't be fun anymore if throughout the entire squash session, she can't even score a few pts rite? giving her a handicap would make the game more exciting since it would be more challenging for you, and at the same time, C would enjoy the game more knowing that there might at least be some possibility of her beating you.<br><br>hmm, C seems to really like asking for treats. you can always choose not to agree to treat her, or ask her to treat you back if you are the winner instead.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sparkle ,<br><br>You are quite right . My impression of this C is that she's quite a weak person . She can't even hold things properly in her hands for along time .<br><br>The only part of her body that is quite active is her mouth . She likes whining and complaining . Thats surprising considering the fact that her mouth is quite small . It took her a long time to finish her food at chatterbox . But it's quite understandable if you talk with your mouth full . Wonder if she realizes it .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Maybe I should give her a treat to find out more . But we'll need an impartial observer as well . I would choose Miss Hui but I think she's biased against me and would support C somemore I don't want to be seen hanging out with such a shameless slut as Miss Hui .<br><br>Well..I'm still not sure about the handicap . I also dunno if I'll be satisified beating her with or without the handicap since you'll get no kick beating a much shorter person . I admit I'm quite short but I think she's shorter ... hehe<br><br>Well we'll have to wait and see . I dunno why I hang out with C except to train my patience .

Hmm...... and with Miss Hui around to protect C, I am sure the odd guy will prove himself to be obsolete.

            <div class='col-md body'>qwerty, even though youÂ’ve made the way C eat while she talks sound really bad, I believe that J is even worse, you really got to try to know him, maybe one day I intro him to you. If you see J, heÂ’s so skinny, yet his appetite is HUGE! ThatÂ’s all rite, actually, some people just eat a lot. The horrid part is the way he eats! He gorged down two bowls of rice in less than 5 mins, and people who dun know him would probably think that he had been starved for days. Even then, he still didnÂ’t feel full, and instead of ordering more food, he took from my plate and ate up more than Â¾ of my chicken slices. I canÂ’t believe I paid so much for the chicken rice and I only got to eat 2 pieces of chicken.<br><br>Qwerty, squash isnÂ’t abt height. You donÂ’t win simply coz you are taller. And wat satisfaction do you get from comparing your height with a girl? Just like J, he likes to compare his chest size with girlsÂ’, my gosh! And really, no matter how shameless Miss Hui is, sheÂ’ll still lose to J in terms of shamelessness. J is so skinny, he doesnÂ’t work out, yet when we went shopping, he insists on buying the smallest sized t-shirts coz he said he wants to show off his Â“assetsÂ”!! As if size S is not small enough, he even asked the salesgirl if the t-shirts come in XS!<br><br>Actually, come to think of it, if I compare J with C, C doesnÂ’t sound that bad. So your idea of treating her again isnÂ’t that bad, you can even use this as an excuse to date Miss Hui out. She isnÂ’t biased towards you, really. The other time, she told me she was attracted to you, and IÂ’m sure sheÂ’ll really be touched if you give her a treat as well.<br></div>
