If you see J, heÂ’s so skinny, yet his appetite is HUGE! ThatÂ’s all rite, actually, some people just eat a lot. The horrid part is the way he eats! He gorged down two bowls of rice in less than 5 mins, and people who dun know him would probably think that he had been starved for days. Even then, he still didnÂ’t feel full, and instead of ordering more food, he took from my plate and ate up more than Â¾ of my chicken slices. I canÂ’t believe I paid so much for the chicken rice and I only got to eat 2 pieces of chicken.<br><br>Qwerty, squash isnÂ’t abt height. You donÂ’t win simply coz you are taller. And wat satisfaction do you get from comparing your height with a girl? Just like J, he likes to compare his chest size with girlsÂ’, my gosh! And really, no matter how shameless Miss Hui is, sheÂ’ll still lose to J in terms of shamelessness. J is so skinny, he doesnÂ’t work out, yet when we went shopping, he insists on buying the smallest sized t-shirts coz he said he wants to show off his Â“assetsÂ”!! As if size S is not small enough, he even asked the salesgirl if the t-shirts come in XS!<br><br>Actually, come to think of it, if I compare J with C, C doesnÂ’t sound that bad. So your idea of treating her again isnÂ’t that bad, you can even use this as an excuse to date Miss Hui out. She isnÂ’t biased towards you, really. The other time, she told me she was attracted to you, and IÂ’m sure sheÂ’ll really be touched if you give her a treat as well.</div></blockquote>Hmmm... well I sort of empathise wif J . I mean I went out with this grrl once who ate so little that I felt the food was wasted on her so I helped finish it for her .<br><br>But then again she was a petite eater . Well I haven't seen you yet so I dun know wheither you're a petite eater or an amazon eater so I can't really tell if J was justified in eating your food .<br><br>Hmmm... I remember C was quite shameless too.<br>I think she's even more shameless than this J you mentioned . She buys sizes in XXS , she was even bold enough to say thats because she wants to flaunt her 'assets' . But the problem is she's such a small person that even XXS looks baggy on her . Later we had no choice but to shop for her clothes at Guess Kids and Elle Petite .<br><br>Sparkle I agree that squash isn't about height . Its about skill , agility , stamina and overall physical fitness . These are the qualities that C lacks so I still think its no kick to win over a wimp like C .<br><br>Hmmm.. I really want to meet this J character of yours . Since I thought I've already seen the skinniest person alive I want to see someone even skinnier .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I've also never seen anyone more shameless and vain than this Miss Hui apart from C of course so it should be an eye-opener .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>qwerty,<br><br>if the girl has already said that she doesnt want to eat anymore, and there's still lots of food left over, it's justified for you to finish the food for her if you think it's a waste. but the thing is, i was still happily eating and enjoying my food, and J just helped himself to my food as well, without even asking me...i didnt tell him that i can't finish my food. J is just being a glutton, you empathise with J? hmm, maybe you're like dat too? no wonder.<br><br>from what you say, i don't think that C is shameless in wanting to buy clothes in XXS. afterall, you yourself said that she's very small sized, so you dun expect her to wear oversized clothes rite? and if she's really that petite and can't get her clothes in the adult section, the natural thing to do is to go to the kid's section. it's all about buying something that fits, and not about shamelessness. J is different. He is at least size M, but wants to wear super tight fitting clothes in XS, now, this is wat i call shameless.<br><br>And again, you can't call C a wimp just coz her squash skills, her agility etc are not as good as yours. Seriously, i feel sad for C that you keep comparing her to yourself in terms of physical fitness. Girls are by nature less strong than guys, so qwerty, if you wanna compare, go compare wif other guys like revey instead.<br><br></div>

I dun think its humanly possible .<br><br>And there are inconsistencies in your story..first you say J was skinny then you say he was at least a size M ...ermm I think you're making up this story ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>And I never mentioned there was anything wrong with a petite figure but C kept mentioing about flaunting her assest when there were none .. that pretty much disgust me .<br><br>Isn't the thread about the equality of the sexes..
