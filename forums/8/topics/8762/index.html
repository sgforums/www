            <div class='col-md body'>In this day and age , do we still believe in the equality of the sexes ?<br><br>I went out with this grrl today , lets for the sake of argument call her C ( actually I'd rather call her spoilt) .<br><br>Well , C expected me to treat her to expensive chicken-rice at the chatterbox .<br>Okay lah..I suggested the place but I thought we were going dutch . She insisted on me paying in the end .What was I to do ? Argue with her and make a scene or quietly pay without any embarassment . Sad to say I took the coward's path and agreed to pay for her .<br><br>Then there was the thing with the shopping bags . I needed to go to the toilet and asked C to carry my bags for me . After I came out she immediately passed the bags to me and whinned about how heavy the bags were...never waiting for me to ask for it back . I was abit disgusted with her action that I ignored her for a while . After that , she continued carrying the bags for abit longer. She kept whinning about how ungentlemanly I was. Well I have to tell her its unlady-like to whine .<br><br>The worse was going back . She compared me to some other guys who had cars and said they always send her back...well the problem is I dun drive...I felt kind of hurt by her statment but being nice , I just took it in with a smile....actually grinding my teeth . I had the decency to wait with her for her bus at the bus-stop and guess what she said ?<br>She was training me for my future grrlfriend . Yes ! She used the word train as if I was a dog ...well if all grrls are like her I'd rather stay single .<br><br>[This message has been edited by qwerty (edited 22 August 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*Chuckle*<br>I must admit your date with this woman is a disaster. CanÂ’t help but wonder if she is in her late teens, her comments seems pretty childish to me. Anyway, I believe the reason you had a date with her is because you are interested in her, no? Well, it is better to see the true worth of her now than later and you are right, SNAG not withstanding, what is this silly thing about training us men? Sure sounds downright mean and make as much sense as me training my gal to be a wild pussy in bed. Tsk tsk.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi qwerty, bad experience you had i would say. well, i've had a similar encounter before. let me share with you one of my stories then.<br><br>I went out with this guy, let's call him J (i would rather call him a pampered kid actually). The reason why i went out with him was coz he owed me a treat (definitely not coz i was interested in him) at chatterbox (hey, wat a coincidence, haha). Since it was a treat, of coz i would expect him to pay for the meal. However, at the end of the meal, he shoved the bill right into my face and asked me to pay. Being the usual me who enjoys giving my friends treats, I said all rite, if that's what he want. Afterall, it's just for a plate of chicken rice.<br><br>I know that it's inconvenient for guys to carry shopping bags when they want to visit the washroom, so when J wanted to go, I offered to carry his shopping bags for him. When he returned from the washroom, he conveniently forgot abt the bags, and since i was used to carrying my own shopping bags when i go shopping, carrying those three heavy shopping bags was ok with me. So for the next hour or so, I carried his shopping bags for him, while he walked around free-handed. My hands got really tired after some time, and so I asked if he minded sharing the load. Guess what? He pretended not to hear what i said and go on walking, making me tagging behind him with those heavy bags...I felt like such a slave!<br><br>When it was time to go home, I had to take a bus from a really deserted busstop, there was nobody at the busstop. It's ok that J did not offer to keep me company while I waited for my bus, since I dun expect guys to do such things. However, since the place was so dark, I had to be thick-skinned and ask J if he could just wait for the bus with me. To my horror, J's response was "I would only do such things if I have an ulterior motive on that girl", and then left for the mrt stn to go home himself. I was stunned silent. Well, eventually, I waited for the bus myself, and luckily the bus came in less than 10mins.<br><br>now talk about equality of the sexes. in this age and day, i can't believe that such chauvinistic guys still exist. I'm ok if guys do not offer to do all the so-called ungentlemanly stuff like treating me, offering to carry my bags, sending me home etc, since i'm capable of doing such things myself. But J is the first guy that I know, and hopefully the last, who thinks that girls are meant to be bullied and treated around like slaves.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sparkle dearie , I empathise with your situation but we have to hear it from the other guy's point of view . I mean the poor guy can't defend himself since he does not even know about this forum .<br><br>I bet he made some unkind statement as a joke or something...perhaps you were sensitive enough to take it as an insult .<br>I'm not saying that definitely since I was not there to judge but I'm saying perhaps.. I mean we should at least give the poor bloke the benefit of the doubt .<br><br>As for the bags , I dun think it was quite heavy like how heavy are men's stuff compared to women's stuff . So are you saying its alright for a man to carry the woman's stuff but not vice versa ?<br>Please clarify my sweet Sparkle .<br><br>And you had to had to at least give him some credit for being honest about the ulterior motive part . At least he shows he wasn't trying to take advantage of you .<br><br>your qwerty</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>qwerty,<br><br>almost everybody uses a computer and surfs the net these days, i won't be surprised if the girl you are talking about actually reads this forum, if so, maybe you'll find her giving her side of the story soon  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>when you said you did not bother to help, are you saying that you did not bother to help her carry her shopping bags, or you did not bother to carry your own shopping bags? from your first thread, you said you were disgusted with her for passing you back your stuff immediately when you came out of the washroom, so you made her carry your bags longer. but isn't it reasonable for her to give you back you things to carry yourself? why were you so disgusted? so are you the type who would expect others to carry things for you?<br><br>yes, J did not wait for the bus for me. he gave me a dirty look when i asked, and then just went to the mrt station to take a train home. i'm sure if it were you, you would have waited for the bus with me, but well, J wasn't as gentlemanly.<br><br>yup, you are rite, maybe we shd get J and C together and see how they manipulate each other.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sweet sparkle ,<br><br>I know almost everyone is expected to know how to surf the net . Well , basic courtesy is also expected from everyone which I think she lacked . So I'm not exagerating if I say she can't use computers .<br><br>Anyway when I talked to her I found out that she was quite mentally challenged ..sighz.. so I'm justified in saying that chances are she would use a mouse as a walkie-talkie and treat the monitor as a TV...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for the bags I was disgusted by the way she returned the bags to me..thrust it infront of my face and insulted my man-hood .<br><br>I was abit pissed ..of course I ignored her for a while but just a while...why must she be so impatient<br><br>Well , I wonder if J treated you in a certain way , he must have a reason right ? But we wouldn't know since the poor dude is not around to defend himself .<br><br>[This message has been edited by qwerty (edited 23 August 2000).]</div>
