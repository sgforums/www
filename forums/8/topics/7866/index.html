            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all,<br><br>After looking at so many bickerings and unnecessary wars in the forums since I first started out, I find it really amused and puzzled that people in the cyberspace actually behaved almost the same in real life, except for one very major difference : In cyberspace, you can only infer someone's character in the postings.<br><br>We all formulate first impressions on people after we read about what they write and say in this forum. People start to put this pre-conceived notion without giving a chance to the other person. Then the next stage to me, would be people starting to meet each other and become real friends. The strange thing about this, is that once this cyber space is brought to real life, then clique formation would automatically happen, whether you like it or not. It goes like this, suppose your interests coincide, you clique and if you don't, you get outcasted. It appear to be a very obvious and trivial observation but nevertheless, human.<br><br>Then the question I would pose to people would be like this : do you want to meet the people after seeing all the "bloodshed" in the forum? My answer would be no and yes : no, in the sense of not meeting everyone, because I would say that all hell would break loose, since I started concealing my identity and limit the number of people who I think I can trust in the first place. Hypothetically, if I decide to be crazy and start meeting everyone, perhaps, someday, I would have some forumite writing another humility thread on me, with the first line saying something along these lines<br><br>"Humble Detector 1 : you know that you are not humble because you always write your English with bombastic vocabulary and flowery grammar."<br><br>Of course, I would be flustered if someone is to write something like this to me. I acknowledge my own faults and  would turn to self-reflect on the issue. The point here, is that sometimes, we get emotional because people say certain things bad about us, but the question one should ask is that what I have done to make people came to make such judgements. It is always nice to have praises, but it is always hell to hear criticisms. But yet, if we look at it in a more objective manner, the person who write such a thread is equally at fault, because something like that could be said thru a private email and nevermore. And look what happened, you open a can of worms and all hell break loose.<br><br>Back to the question I posed, I would say Yes, after talking to the people over the net and email them. For example, I would be glad to meet someone like Colette as a friend who is like an older sister to me, even though I was very tempted once to write a thread entitled "I hate you before I meet you" as she kept pressing my buttons. That follows for people who I know thru the singles thread and knows who I am.<br><br>How about you people out there who have no interaction with the forumites?<br><br>Have a good day.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br><br>Disclaimer : I apologize for my usual long posts, but it is just my horrible way of writing things.<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hallo prodigal,<br><br>I remembered the first time we meet online was when we crossed sword over the issue of Singlish way back in Jan. I came in blazing with both guns, defending the god damm right of heartlander to use whatever pleases us, and to hell with all those mumbo jumbo, england all poderful (let me indulge in some singlish here lah  :p) cosmopolitans like you and terence ( another opponent who now shared a "entertainment" biz venture with me  :p)<br>And, to phrase you, if you are feeling crazy and decides to meet all of us, most likely i will be the first one to post the "humility" thread on you.  :p<br>Oh well, i think i am way past that stage now. I loved to think of myself as belonging to the people...squatting at my neighbourhood kopitiam, slurping my coffee on broken porcelain and mouthing the lingua franca i am most comfortable with. Imagine my self-righteous madness when i saw 2 supposed scholars desecrating (wrong word i know but hey, in accordance with the mood  :p) my kopi language. hahahahaha, young and impulsive, thats me. As a student of history and being born poor, (bless my poor dad's soul, if only he had strike toto that time...) class differences and indifferences from the elites stirred my worker's soul (not that i ever worked in a shoe factory before but hey, stalin doesn't have the perfect pedigree too, he was born in a goddamm bourgeoisie family!!!) The differences between the have and have-nots, ahhhh, the classic making of revolution.<br>Enough of the bullshit, one word...i hated your guts back then. You have the backing of our government, the brains and the detailed future...in fact, you will most probably be my government and my future  :p<br>I derived this from all the posting you put up and you know what, i guess my prejudices was unfounded. I hardly know you...and yet i was so quick to judge you, pretty presumptious of me hor  :p We can't help making judgement on people's posting in here<br>do the occasional "profiling" (yoohoo colette, i would love to know if i fall under the serial killer under ur catalogue)<br>Well, we will be doing ourselve a injustice for doing this...cos we will never know who these fellows really are...in reality.<br><br>It would be a pity (can't believe i am hearing this) if guys like you stopped posting in here. Really enjoy (i must be mad, raving mad now  :p) those few posting you put in. See ya<br><br>"Stripped of ethical rationalizations and philosophical pretensions, a crime is anything that a group in power chooses to prohibit." --Freda Adler<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Hata San,<br><br>Well, I don't really have the impression that you really dislike me thru your posts on Singlish. Besides, everyone is entitled to his or her own opinions, something that is encouraged on my side of the world.<br><br>Strangely, if people who have read thru my old posts, they would share the feeling that Terence and I are allies, and no one recalled that both of us first crossed swords over the issue of Confucianism and other stuff as well... Well, we share our views on different issues, and respect the right that people would have them... But it is an enjoyment arguing with him, gaining some insight to the subject, and of course, the time which I have to spend reading the books on the subject while arguing with him.<br><br>Btw, I have not sold my soul to the Singapore government, and the generous benefactors to my professional bumming are from UK... Well, so chances are, I have the chance to venture out there...<br><br>Have a good day, and it's great to hear from you.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>The Prodigal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now, back to the topic.<br><br>I have actually been in this forum for slightly over two months, with a brief spell where I completely stopped posting. I wonder what it was that got me to post again, but that is besides the point.<br><br>Well, Proddy was the one who introduced this forum to me. And I still remember that when I first came in, the only thread that I posted to was the singles thread. Anyone still remember that??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I can remember briefly that it was Axl who started that thread, and Rinoa and Colette began to specially dedicate this thread to Proddy. And soon, everyone, like Rinoa, Terence, Proddy, Sparkle, basically everyone started to give inputs of their "ze ou tiao jian". Found it rather amusing. Sooner, everyone was posting in it. Tet, Maya, Lex, oh well, the list just goes on and on and on......<br><br>Of course, the thread digressed a little, and began to take the shape of the "post if you have anything to say" thread. Quite fun actually. Everyone taking pointers to each other about the art of flirting. And can you imagine Rinoa dear seeking pointers from my most flirtatious beauty Colette and this as her reply:<br><br>"Rinoa, honey, you're flirting with the guys I want &amp; you're asking me if your flirting skills have improved? do i look stupid to you?  should i even care? in other matters, i would gladly give you my undivided tention &amp; most sincere help, but on this flirting issue, honey you're on your baby!" ~ By Colette<br><br>Hehehe, oh yah, while scrolling through the pages, Barclays posts also struck me as rather interesting, his image of Maya in picture, hehehe, cute. And oh yah, with the limited number of "yandao" guys and "chiobu" gals, the rivalry for each other is tremendous. Let's see if I can get a quote on this:<br>"Hi colette,<br>stop seducing my ray! he's mine!<br>you've got Terence, Barclays, Prodigal etc etc..so just leave my ray alone would ya?<br>he's mine, and mine alone" ~ by Sparkle<br><br>And at the end of it, Rinoa and Proddy became cyberlovers, and on April Fools Day, they did the unthinkable, what did they do?? Ray and Sparkle, and of course, Terence and his MonaMayalisa, cute couples too. Must not forget Colette and Ocean, the karaoke couple. Well, hehehe, fun to think of it. By the time I joined in the action, everyone I flirted with had been attached to their other half, and well, I got my first most outright rejection from my Colette dearest *sob*.<br><br>Hmm......this flirt line from Barclays to Rinoa seems interesting enough, "<br>A Small Piece for Rinoa<br>------------------------<br>Much like the spring rain, you are incessantly resting on my mind now ; it seems impossible to see you in my mind's eye, surrounded as I may by potent imagery lavished by Nature in imitation of your kindness and radiance. Every blossoming gardenia, every busy bee, and in each awakening hedgehog, I see the signature of your touch, lifting the gloom and the early darkness of the winter of my soul.<br>And sentimentality does not become me, I know ; Keats and Shelley does not sit well beside the Focaultian Panopticon ... and yet in that discourse of power, the allegory of me running through a hall of mirrors in Versaille rings true. I am imprisoned and yet free ... because in you, there is liberation for me ; a promise of salvation from the deceit of men and the ambiguity of success in your rose lips.<br>Enough. My pen runs away in it's torrid deluge of affections. I am not yet the hostage to the sublime and the beauty.<br>I changed my basketball spot today. Not the hardwood floor and squeaking of sneakers for me - the sun is much too bright for that. So I shot in the light breeze , just me and the net, and it was bliss. Palm the ball, elbow righted, balance the on the ball of the foor, an arched back, and the ball leaves the cradle of my hand. The arc of the ball felt good today.<br>And in that moment of anticipation, between the flight of the ball and the gentle whooshing of the threaded net, there was a quietness - a placid serendipity that transcended the self-incriminations of a flawed, failed humanity. You know what I mean. You play basketball. The joy is not in the scoring, no, the joy is in the flight of the ball. And I wished you were here to bounce the ball back.<br>There will be no conversations on this court in the fields. I will return your ball and you will return mine. Everything that needs to be said is said in the flight of the ball."<br><br>I guess I better stop boring you all with the interesting stuff that made me join the forum. Oh yah, I was also drawn to the very intellectual exchanges of the likes of Proddy, Littleman and Terence. These are the three that strikes me the ones who usually emerge as most convincing in their arguments. So this is also one of the reasons of me joining the forum, hoping that one day I will reach the depth of argument these guys have. Sad to say, but with every huff and every puff I do, it is still nothing but hot air that emerges. Hehehe.....<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just realise I haven't answered the question. Hmm.....silly me.<br><br>i never met u guys before, so what i can give are my first impressions:<br><br>Rinoa: the goddess of love and beauty who loves the thrill of challenging guys to a game of competitive basketball even though they are taller than her, kekeke.....<br><br>Terence, Littleman: smart, definitely one of the smartest around. hmm..... maybe smart is not the word, how about indepth, to the point, and definitely have their little magic when handling words.<br><br>Colette: The evil one who breaks a young man's heart. (Don't kill me, kekeke, that was first impression, u r now my most lovable flirtatious baby colette).<br><br>Maya: smart gal, very nice and pleasant, truly one of the all rounded type (and nope, I am not saying she is round)<br><br>Tet: honestly, the fetish for veiny arms, err...... what type of impression would one develop from that?? kekeke.....<br><br>Sparkle/Ray: NUS deanlist regulars and no stranger to awards, must be real smart, unlike me, *sob*, puts me to shame.<br><br>I can't think of any other people who really left an impression, oh yah, one more.<br><br>Hello Kitty: the ultimately most interesting gal on the net. hehehe, never the one to hold back her words (remember, she claims to be the creator of the I love you virus), her auditions for her Dear Daniels, hehehe, she is everywhere, and there was a time when it was her thread and the singles thread which were fighting out to see who chalks up more numbers, hehehe...... needless to say, the singles thread emerged victorious, but who would have guessed?? "Most Imteresting Reply gets me Email" something like that, only Hello Kitty is capable of doing that. I think she is also equally straight forward in person, and will definitely be quite interesting a character.<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>
