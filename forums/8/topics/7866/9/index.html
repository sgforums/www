            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Proddy,<br><br>to be honest, I dun really remember crossing swords with you before. I left the forum a long time ago to cope with various pressures and obligations. The latter are much more vivid to me than anyting else  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Nonetheless, it is still a pleasure to talk to you.<br><br>I have a slightly different perspective to cyber relationships from you. I've gotta admit that my cyber persona is rather different from my real life character. I dun think I deliberately set out to deceive. It's a matter of revealing different parts of yourself, talking about different sets of things with different groups of friends. For example, with a particular friend of mine, I talk nonsense and laugh more becos he's a very cheerful and upbeat person. With another friend, I am more intense and introspective. All these balances me out.<br><br>I do agree with you about attention seekers on the net though. In the forum I used to moderate, people place great store in being an expert. They would deliberately put down others to show off their knowledge. They pretend to be so noble when they are really "giving advice" to boost their own egos. That's why they refuse to admit they are wrong- because their social standing is at stake.<br><br>However, I believe that the inability to listen to another point of view is not particular to the net, or even, to particular people. I have encountered many such people back in university and at work. I even admit that I am like this sometimes. People are by nature biased and it's not easy to accept another point of view when you dun agree with it. Some people make the leap to acceptance, but for others, they are simply unable to do so. I'm not trying to excuse people's foibles (especially when they take it personally and start hurting others) here, I'm just trying to understand them in an exercise to circumvent future conflicts. People dun change, not after a certain age, and certainly not for you. Besides, there's nothing as tiring and useless as an argument with somebody you've never met, so why waste your time?<br><br>I do get the sense that you are referring to incidents in the past, incidents which I'm not familiar with becos I've been away. I hope all these have not embittered you. From your essays, you seem to be able to let go and that's good. I hope they were a good form of catharsis!<br><br>Until we meet again in another thread.....<br><br>purr</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah, yeah, i forgot something, the Man must have wondered how did miss O.O. find the guts to holler in Wheelock Place after 10 just because some monkey tried to peek up her skirt, hahaha.<br><br>I disagree with your version, though, Miss OO never invited the Man for a threesome with T.  For the latter Miss OO has made an exception and decided that FFM is infinitely better because that man is meant to be shared, juicy bits and all.  As for you and my dream european lovers and the rest of the prince-toads, Miss OO feels like a million....but one at a time (winkwink)<br><br>Revelations: yeah, i've always wanted to taste foundation on a man's skin, hehe.  kidding, I wanted to hug you that night, but looking at how demure sparkle is, I decided to keep my arms to myself, heh heh<br><br>------------------<br>It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle if it's been through a blender first.<br><br>Les Barker:<br><br>[This message has been edited by MayaJade (edited 11 August 2000).]</div>
