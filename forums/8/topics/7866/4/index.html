            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by prodigal:</div><div class="quote_body">Dear all,<br><br>After looking at so many bickerings and unnecessary wars in the forums since I first started out, I find it really amused and puzzled that people in the cyberspace actually behaved almost the same in real life, except for one very major difference : In cyberspace, you can only infer someone's character in the postings.<br><br>We all formulate first impressions on people after we read about what they write and say in this forum. People start to put this pre-conceived notion without giving a chance to the other person. Then the next stage to me, would be people starting to meet each other and become real friends. The strange thing about this, is that once this cyber space is brought to real life, then clique formation would automatically happen, whether you like it or not. It goes like this, suppose your interests coincide, you clique and if you don't, you get outcasted. It appear to be a very obvious and trivial observation but nevertheless, human.<br><br>Then the question I would pose to people would be like this : do you want to meet the people after seeing all the "bloodshed" in the forum? My answer would be no and yes : no, in the sense of not meeting everyone, because I would say that all hell would break loose, since I started concealing my identity and limit the number of people who I think I can trust in the first place. Hypothetically, if I decide to be crazy and start meeting everyone, perhaps, someday, I would have some forumite writing another humility thread on me, with the first line saying something along these lines<br><br>"Humble Detector 1 : you know that you are not humble because you always write your English with bombastic vocabulary and flowery grammar."<br><br>Of course, I would be flustered if someone is to write something like this to me. I acknowledge my own faults and  would turn to self-reflect on the issue. The point here, is that sometimes, we get emotional because people say certain things bad about us, but the question one should ask is that what I have done to make people came to make such judgements. It is always nice to have praises, but it is always hell to hear criticisms. But yet, if we look at it in a more objective manner, the person who write such a thread is equally at fault, because something like that could be said thru a private email and nevermore. And look what happened, you open a can of worms and all hell break loose.<br><br>Back to the question I posed, I would say Yes, after talking to the people over the net and email them. For example, I would be glad to meet someone like Colette as a friend who is like an older sister to me, even though I was very tempted once to write a thread entitled "I hate you before I meet you" as she kept pressing my buttons. That follows for people who I know thru the singles thread and knows who I am.<br><br>How about you people out there who have no interaction with the forumites?<br><br>Have a good day.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br><br>Disclaimer : I apologize for my usual long posts, but it is just my horrible way of writing things.<br><br></div></blockquote>Yes, I would meet the person or whoever it is, beacuse I want to see what the real person is like, to see is to believe.  I think most forumites treat this as a place to make friends and idle the times away.  To accept a friend is to accept his/her weakness.  So this is up to individual to decide, some would never show their face, where some would.  Anyway this is a forum, a place for discussion, a place for fury debates and some hilarious chats...so I guess what is being post here should not be taken too seriously and emotionaly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Nothing can't be done, unless you don't want to</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why i've been missing (so much so until my historian enquired about my whereabouts):<br>it takes me a good 1 hour to access sgforums.com, just to open (not to read) two miserable threads.

Scary folks I am hanging around with.<br><br>Since I haven't said anything about Proddy's initial posts in this thread, I suppose when you stay around some people for a long time conflicts will rise.  Even if your original cause was to trash japanese manga sooner or later things more personal will get in your way and it will not be fun anymore.  Moreover with people behind the words you are less guarded, you'll tell them all things you won't tell strangers you meet daily and it hurts more if after this forced intimacy you find that there is a big gap between you two.  I for one will feel devastated should Terence baby says that I can't tell Lenin from Stalin and therefore shouldn't aspire to skinny dip with him in this lifetime.
