            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Sparkle,<br><br>You have been one of the interesting ladies whom I got to know thru this forum, with very simple requirements on guys, but I am sure, like all gals, you search for the man with the x-factor. Intelligence was only associated with you after I found out what you do. Yes, you share one of my most favourite passions presently : ballroom dancing. Suppose if we meet, I suppose ballroom dancing would be the topic. Speaking of that, I am still searching for my ball partner in the following week.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>yours sincerely<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear alex,<br><br>What you say definitely makes sense, and I wholly agree with you. Except that I would like to add something : when a person gets too much popularity, there is a chance of being loved and hated, because there is the clashing of personalities, otherwise you don't see a lot of flame wars beginning since the time of the great Sexy Idol.. People fabricate impressions when they actually read the posts or even communicate with ICQ or sometimes on the phone, yet they have never met. The only two people who I managed to speak on the phone was Rinoa and Colette, but they cannot really make a full picture of me yet.. I have not fitted my last jigsaw puzzle yet, and I wonder what the effect would be.... It could be disastrous...<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>The Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights.

Every blossoming gardenia, every busy bee, and in each awakening hedgehog, I see the signature of your touch, lifting the gloom and the early darkness of the winter of my soul.<br>And sentimentality does not become me, I know ; Keats and Shelley does not sit well beside the Focaultian Panopticon ... and yet in that discourse of power, the allegory of me running through a hall of mirrors in Versaille rings true. I am imprisoned and yet free ... because in you, there is liberation for me ; a promise of salvation from the deceit of men and the ambiguity of success in your rose lips.<br>Enough. My pen runs away in it's torrid deluge of affections. I am not yet the hostage to the sublime and the beauty.<br>I changed my basketball spot today. Not the hardwood floor and squeaking of sneakers for me - the sun is much too bright for that. So I shot in the light breeze , just me and the net, and it was bliss. Palm the ball, elbow righted, balance the on the ball of the foor, an arched back, and the ball leaves the cradle of my hand. The arc of the ball felt good today.<br>And in that moment of anticipation, between the flight of the ball and the gentle whooshing of the threaded net, there was a quietness - a placid serendipity that transcended the self-incriminations of a flawed, failed humanity. You know what I mean. You play basketball. The joy is not in the scoring, no, the joy is in the flight of the ball. And I wished you were here to bounce the ball back.<br>There will be no conversations on this court in the fields. I will return your ball and you will return mine. Everything that needs to be said is said in the flight of the ball."</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> you have no idea how jealous i was and how many sleepless nights i had over this thingy although i had problem understanding it. i remember requesting Barclays for poems and cartoons but the elusive Barclays just ignores me, yeah, heÂ’s still ignoring me.

It was relaxing and as one of the best punters in town, the rest of the people I see fell into the river and I happily get myself across the places... *evil snigger*.

Hehe...haiz, wat's wrong wif me nowadays? so thick-skinned..you didn't even invite me to the ball..hahaha...<br><br>actually, what you and revey impressed me was the fact that both of u guys actually enjoy dancing, among other things. it's hard to find guys who like dancing in my group of friends. my ex-bf seemed looked at me in disgust when i suggested learning ballroom dancing together. recently, i asked a guy friend, and he rejected me outright. told me to look for him only when it involves outdoor activities. could it be that guys who study overseas prefer such things? i just met up with my frd who's back from US for the holidays, and he also told me that he learnt social dancing in US. i was surprised, coz i never knew that he was interested in it.<br><br>The x-factor is very important in the search for a partner, for both guys and girls, don't you think? No matter how simple or difficult people set out their requirements of their partner, they always end up with someone whom they are able to feel the sparks with. you'd probably tell me that girls lower their expectations when as they grow older, so whether or not they actually love the guy, they'll settle down with him. to a certain extend, i agree with you. there are people who give in to pressure from their family, friends, society, and even themselves. once they hear their biological clock ticking, they'll probably just settle down with the next guy that comes along. However, for me, at this point of time in my life, I think I can live without a guy. After two failed relationships, although only the second one was a "proper" r/ship, i think my expectations of my future partner has increased because now I'm more aware of what I do not want (any guy whose character resembles that of my ex-bf i do not want!! haha..). Sometimes I even wonder if I should only go for good-looking guys now since my ex-bfs weren't that great-looking (i noe i shdn't, but well...*shrugs*). Well, anyway, right now I'm enjoying very much being single, so much that I think I'm ok with the idea of staying single for life. haha, i wonder how long this thought will last. maybe when i go out tomorrow i might meet <span style="font-style: italic;">the one</span> and get hitched immediately..who noes...<br><br>ok, enuff of blabbering away..<br><br>take care  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>(btw, how was your exam??)<br><br></div>
