            <div class='col-md body'>erm, I read in Tom Robbins' book (Still Life with Woodpecker) a suspicion that the old tale about the princess kissing a toad is actually a hidden symbolism.  Some say the initial fear of the girl symbolizes young woman's trepidation when faced with marriage and the happy ending shows that the young woman will eventually find that marriage is bliss.  Some oether people say that kissing a frog symbolizes fellatio.</div>
