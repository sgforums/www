It did not occur to me that you are some young gal in her 17-18. Particularly, when you posted in the singles thread, I was sure that you are at least in your 20s. Besides, you are always writing short paragraphs, unlike Colette who would write her grandmother essay in her replies.<br><br>Yeah, pity that you are not coming to UK for a holiday, otherwise you could be my partner for the Mayball which I am still short of finding the partner.

It's great to know that you liked dancing as well.<br><br>As you may know, to have a dancing ball in my wedding is my dream, and imagine that I can waltz the bride across the floor.  U can meet Revey to teach you latin dancing... I can meet you later if I can ever get back to SG for a short holiday... The thing is that ballroom dancing is one of the in-things in my small town, but I loved it because it is really cool if you can dance around with many ladies.<br><br>Well, it is not the Two, Three and Four or even Five, it is the One, and the one and only. Don't how to find her, now I will let her find me instead.... Though I have a lot of social pressure to yield to, because of my friends getting married, nevertheless, I have to contribute to the statistic being one of out of ten not married, and I am currently the one, until fitted to a new sample size.<br><br>The exam was fine, except got hammered all the way, and have a lot of loose ends to tidy up.<br><br>Well, if you are ever thinking of coming to UK in the first week of July, you can be my ball partner on the 7th July 2000...
