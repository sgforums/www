            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, I guess back to the topic, you never know how a person is until you truly interact with him/her. This is cyberworld. Cyberworld is always different from reality. And I always make sure I make a clear distinction about it. However, there are certain tell-tale signs of a person's characteristics in the way a person behave in cyberworld. And if the image portrayed is ugly, the real person can't be better off anyhow. In this forum, I know of very very very few people.

How have you been?<br><br>For me, I learned from experience, also partly my own fault in the past that I should not meet all the forumites (since I am perhaps enemy to some in some distant past), because I will be making the pathway for flamewars. So, I just get to know a few nice people here, and hopefully if I ever come home, I will just meet them and have a chat, and I think that is the best thing I can do. Unfortunately, sometimes, a person's past moved with them, whether they are changed or not. I prefer to move on with my life, and just not get involved with such bickerings.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Prodigal,<br><br>an interesting concept that goes into this area is Cooley's "Looking Glass Self". We see ourselves based on an understanding of how others look at us. In the Internet realm, where anonymity acts as a protective shield that allows us to be anything we want to be, we project ourselves according to how we think others will react to that image. If I think that guys will flirt outrageously with an tough talking seial monogamist, then it's she I'll become.<br><br>Of course, the "Looking Glass Self" is not within our total control in the Internet. As you have noted earlier, there are certain characteristics that will slip out. If a person is hot tempered in real life, he'll probably jump at all provocations, real or imagined.<br><br>However, I would disagree that a person who is rude and defiant in the Net would definitely be so in real life as well. This has to do with social control. How we fit in- whether we want to fit in at all in the first place- is explained by Mead's "I and the Me". "I" represents our immediate knee-jerk response while "me" represents the generalized attitudes of others (i.e. society) that we assume. It is through "Me" that society dominates. Of course, "I" and the "Me" often conflict internally before we engage in any form of social interaction.<br><br>How this concept applies is the sense of belonging a person has in the forum. If he feels he doesn't fit in or like the people in the community, the "Me" is low in his priority becos he simply does not care how others perceive him. Moreover, he knows he can get away with little or no consequence if he were to behave badly. This is unlike real life, where interaction is mainly face to face.<br><br>Note that I am only talking about behaviour related to social interaction (e.g. defiance, inconsideration to others, manipulation), not personal characteristics (e.g. hot temper, cruelty). Of course, it can be argued that personal characteristics prediposes us to certain social behaviour. Again, I'll like to bring up the role of social control (as discussed earlier) as an intermediary, a bridge between the two.<br><br>I'll like to end by saying that I used to moderate a forum. There used to be this really sarcastic and unpleasant person who liked to pick on the amateurs. Needless to say, I couldn't stand him. One day, I dropped by Malaysia and decided to pay him a visit and was very surprised that he was actually a very nice and gracious person. And because we've established some kind of social connection, we've come to respect each other as real human beings. Nowadays, he gives me more face as a moderator whenever he's involved in an argument. I am also less harsh on him.<br><br>Regards,<br>purr</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ah, if Proddy doesn't want to say it, i'll say it myself and hope to gawd that i'm not that accurate, you'll see why.<br><br>upon touchdown in C airport (real name of the airport can't be stated because of the whole shroud of secrecy that has to be maintained over the TickTockMan's secret identity) he saw a girl in bright, shameless but somewhat sweet orange who started to jump up and down at his sight.  He smiled back and the girl went to hide for a while, before appearing again without looking at him because she was adjusting her earpiece.<br><br>Went out, saw the girl smiling and asking wistfully if she had been smiling (and jumping around) for the wrong bloke and Proddy was too jetlagged to react appropriately.  he should have said, "no, i am not your friend, but I would like to be.  Can I have your number, please, Ms. Outrageous Orange?"<br><br>Impression on Miss O.O. ?  Slim, turns quiet and talkative, from extreme to extreme, looks like one of those girls who live in pubs (and we all know all of them look the same!), quite engaging actually, until Proddy saw the glint of greed when she spotted the bottle of bailey's he had bought for her (with the price tag attached, of course).<br><br>That was first meeting, then on telephones miss O.O has this tendency to turns everything into sex talk, even if we start talking about Bartrand Russel, she would suddenly ask "Is it weird if I like to imagine kissing princes to turn them back into toads and <strong>then</strong> have my evil way with them?"  Then she would start to expound on the multifarious sex encounters that she has gone through and I am kinda awed on how she has managed to stay alive by now...if she had lived in, say, San Francisco or New York, a serial killer would have skinned her alive, touch wood!<br><br>Took her for a dinner and karaoke, lousy use of fork and spoon, but the skirt was short enough to make the maitre d' ignored the blunder.  Went to karaoke lounge, she hogged the mike and sang and even danced with her hair twirled around like some rock star, luckily none dropped into my glass of coke.  Ah, can't say anything about Miss O.O. during second meeting, i was too distracted by someone else.<br><br>Heyyyyyy, proddy, any correction to be made?  I should be sorry for putting words into your mouth but even Straits Times does it to my president (and spend 2 pages predicting what he's gonna say while they could have waited another day and print the real thing instead!)...yeah, i should be sorry but I'm not, i'm a bitch wannabe.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Purr,<br><br>Glad to hear from you again. It has been a long time since we last engaged in the virgin thread discussions. Actually, it is a coincidence that I have written 2 essays on my thoughts about people in the cyberspace world recently and I will attach the URL for you to read and see what you have to say. One of them is entitled "Thru the Looking Glass", and it reflects about what I feel about relationships (all kinds) in cyberspace.<br><br>1)<a href="http://prodigal.diaryland.com/prodigal1.html" rel="nofollow">Thru the Looking Glass</a><br><br>2)<a href="http://prodigal.diaryland.com/prodigal2.html" rel="nofollow">A Penny For Your Thoughts</a><br>There are a few points I have in mind thru my encounters in cyberspace from years back to now.<br><br>1)In the past, there is an expectation on how people would be like in cyberspace. But now, when I engage in meeting somebody, I am just merely curious to get to know who this person is and how this person is in real life. It was funny in the past where one would want to seek a real life partner in internet. Thru several encounters, I grew up and believed that "You have got mail" scenairos don't happen in real life, unless u are very lucky. More or less, it is strange to see people with that kind of mindset in the past. In some sense, I don't expect anything, and because in that spirit, I am not disappointed with people easily.<br><br>2) There exist two groups of people : one, people who are consistent with their real life and cyber life, and two, people who are not consistent with their real and cyberlife. There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about. So, attention seekers or people with great egos seek to fulfil their desires for appreciation here. However, one would think that it is absurd, nevertheless it happens. One cannot be careful in his or her choice of enemies, and when a flame thread start, it becomes a situation, where people in the net are forced to take sides. Of course, there exist people who say things which they don't mean it... I am okay with that, but at times, certain statements should make with great caution and care.<br><br>3)It is always easy to keep saying that you are right. I find that most people engaged in internet discussions have the tendency to be biased. They cannot afford to be wrong. But why is it that people cannot admit their wrong? It is dogmatic and at times, tedious, because one has not able to be dynamic to accept the premises of the argument. There is always two or three or even more to an argument. Why let bigotry to come into the picture? Why is it that people takes it so seriously when someone wrote a thread to tell them their pitfalls in character? Worse, they take it personally and start hurting other people's feelings.<br><br>I am not sure whether I made any sense in the above. But what I prefer to do as an individual, is to be consistent in what I believe or not believe, because I don't believe in multiple personality disorders. There is only me and I am responsible for me as well.....<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br>"The Opposite of Love is not Hate, but Indifference." - Anonymous</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Maya,<br><br>Hmmmm, we can always rewrite the actual history into the version of what we want it to be. Besides, Hollywood would be glad to hear that we are following her tradition in the twist of facts. History is merely gossip, and a scandal is gossip made tedious by morality (if there exists any)...<br><br>Well, let me add no corrections but additions about your re-written history...<br><br>1)You forgot about the sexy breakfast we have with two guys drooling over Miss O.O. when she was eating with a voracious and sensual manner the sausages and the eggs.<br><br>2)The discussion with the Man, about which is better. The Man prefers threesome with the MFF combination like Wild Things, and Miss O.O. prefer the other which is MMF.... Well, Miss O.O. wants T and the Man to join her in her sexual fantasies.... The arguments are based with Plato's arguments on sexual desires, balanced with the exciting sexual history of Bertrand Russell on how he manage to sleep with his son's wife...<br><br>3)Well, the Man wants to be a Jerk, by bringing Miss O.O. to Hotel 81 and (the rest is up to your imagination).. *evil snigger*...<br><br>4)Miss O.O. held tightly to the hands of the Man while stuck in the midst of an avalanche of human wave.... She tried different versions of Western blondes holding the guy's hand on the Man...<br><br>I will leave it as it is...and add no further and u can add more, and when I feel like it, I will post the truth according to my book...
