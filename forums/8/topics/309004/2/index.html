              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Both cyclists and pedestrians need to share the blame. But first of all, let’s get one thing straight: Pedestrians have the right of way on footpath. Period.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Having said that, it is easier for pedestrians to give way to cyclists than it is the other way round. All a pedestrian need to do is to walk to one side. Conversely, for a cyclist to give way, they sometimes need to dismount from the bike, push the bike past the pedestrian, remount the bike, and cycle on etc.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The problem is that cyclists must recognize that pedestrians make way for them out of courtesy, not because cyclists have the right of way or that cyclists can bull their way through pedestrians. Accordingly, every time a pedestrian make way for a cyclist, it is an act of courtesy when must be returned. A simple "thank you" will do nicely.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But how often do pedestrians get this basic courtesy returned from cyclists? They ring their bell incessantly as though they own the road, and when pedestrians give way to cyclists, they just cycle past as if they have the right of way. This action will cause some pedestrians (like the aforementioned Mr. Johnny Seto) to take a hard stance against cyclists, which in turn makes cyclists even more reckless. It is a downward spiral which could be avoided if cyclists will just ease off the bell a bit, and say “thank you” whenever a pedestrian make way for them.</span></p>

              <p>Why couldn't they just blardy build a cycle path either on the pedestrain pathway or the road ? Even if it's only a lane wide enough for ONE bicycle.</p>

              <p>I am not sure that is correct except when there is no track for bicycle.  As far as Tampines is concerned, both tracks existed.  One for bicycle, one for pedestrians.  Therefore, they are 2 separate ways.  I also checked on my way back just now, on these PCN, there is this bicycle inprint on the ground.  Where there is no pave way for pedestrians, meaning to say, they are expected to take the normal pavement under HDB.  even in the park, there are both these tracks to be distinguished by the foot and bicycle inprint on the ground.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Certain sector on my way back, both ways are separated by a bus stop, and you can visibly see the foot inprint on the walkway and the bicycle inprint on the PCN.. My undestanding from the press, the intial intention for PCN was to connect up the entire island so that bikers can cycle leisurely all round the island.  From last yr press, Ma Bow Tan mentioned that there are already &gt;70km of connectors build to date and total &gt;100km when the entire connectors are completed so cyclists can move around in few years time. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do we really need such a track for joggers and pedestrians? I don't think so. There are places where people can walk and go, but not bicycle, some areas are illegal to cycle on.  Besides, people like joggers and pedestrians, has all fredom to go where they want with no restriction, but not cyclists.  Would majority of the people wants to jog or walk from one town to another?  I doubt, but I know there are minority that will do that, because I used to be one such person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just to put another point here, if you ever come to Tampines by MRT, do walk along side the MRT track and see for yourself, how "BIG" is the walk way for pedestrians to walk along, then compare the so call one lane (PCN) for cyclists.   However, you find many people also using the cycling track which its it more unsafe for cyclists like myself who go to Central often on that track.  I am not complaining, but when pedestrians  give us the cold shoulder... Certainly, I would be like many pedestrians who complain, DON"T allow cyclists on footpath... But now, why should pedestrians use bicycle lane? Same logic here..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So PCN has its uses, to say its for sharing, in a way, I can't agree because these PCN is indeed a spring off for cyclists so that people can also use.  Just that, I would like to demand for consideration as many would not let cyclists use the pavement, but when they use the connectors, we, as cyclists too would demand no for pedestrians.  Logical sense isn't it?  Much as you don't want cyclists to use their walkways,  then don't use the connectors when in fact, walkways are already created along this connectors, why intrude into our lane?  If you say its share, then why Gov create walk ways along connectors, and what about the existing walkway or pavement?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My last point here, I understand, not all estate has conectors, so pedestrians will more than often get ignored by many incosiderate cyclists... even I can't stand them....  This my my experience and encounter... not offence to anyone... but jsut to make my point</p>

              <p>So PCN has its uses, to say its for sharing, in a way, I can't
              agree because these PCN is indeed a spring off for cyclists so that
              people can also use.  Just that, I would like to demand for
              consideration as many would not let cyclists use the pavement,
              but when they use the connectors, we, as cyclists too would
              demand no for pedestrians.  Logical sense isn't it?  Much
              as you don't want cyclists to use their walkways,  then don't
              use the connectors when in fact, walkways are already created along
              this connectors, why intrude into our lane?  If you say its
              share, then why Gov create walk ways along connectors, and what
              about the existing walkway or pavement?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My last point here, I understand, not all estate has conectors,
              so pedestrians will more than often get ignored by many
              incosiderate cyclists... even I can't stand them....  This my
              my experience and encounter... not offence to anyone... but jsut to
              make my point</p>

              <p>To add on:</p>
              <p>There are also those that never give way to people alighting from the buses especially around those industrial parks. In the past, I can just alight from the bus without having to look around for bicycles but nowadays, more cyclists and some of those inconsiderate ones would just zoom past the bus stops even though they knew that there would be someone alighting.</p>
              <p><br>Furthermore, some cyclists seem to get the fun out of ringing their bells when no one is blocking their way. If the pathway is wide enough to accomodate 3 people walking together, they would still ring the bell when there is only 1 person moving in front of them on the left side and they are cycling on the person's right side, thus causing the person to shift to the right and almost collide with the cyclist.</p>

              If I am the cyclist, I will acknowledge that Mr Seto has the right
              of way on footpaths. I will dismount from my bike, push it
              past Mr Seto, and ride on. When I am dismounted, I am no longer a
              cyclist, just a fellow pedestrian pushing a bike. Mr Seto has
              no reason to be antagonistic to me, and he has no reason (and no
              right) to block my way.</p>
              <p>But there wouldn't be people like Mr Johnny Seto in the first
              place if cyclists refrain from sounding their bells
              incessantly (and oft times unnecessarily), and if they just say a
              simple "thank you" when a pedestrian make way for them.</p>

              Don't do that. If u dismount and push the bike together, u will occupy more space and make walking difficult for pedestrain. U shall stop pedal,continue seat on yr bike and bring down yr foot. Use yr foot to slowly push yr bike pass the pedestrian. 
              
              First, u will not off balance easily.
              Second , u will make more space for the walking pedestrian.
              Third,by using foot to push yr bike, yr speed is slow and less threatening to walking pedestrian.
              Finally remember to say ' Thank You ' to all pedestrian who make an effort to give u way!

              <p>Singaporeans are the only ones who cycle, dun forget tt 1/4 of the population is made up of foreigners. Not to discriminate, and , it seemed from personal observation that most cyclists who cycle like they have the right of the way of pedestrian walkways are foreigners, probably becos of their lack of knowledge of the law down here. there are also local youths who like to speed and cycle aggressively.</p>
              <p>personally do not advocate banning of cycling, but cyclists have greater responsibility and recognise who has the right of the way.</p>
              <p>pedestrians are at more risk in such situations and suffer in any of such conflicts. a pedestrian cannot try to stop a cyclist to tell him/her that cycling is not allowed, while not giving way like Mr Seto did, will be dangerous.</p>
              <p>building cycling paths will inccur high costs given that it is still not a common mode of transport. Dun forget there have been attempts in the past to promote this alternative mode of transport, for example the bicycle rental service in Bukit Batok (once sponsored by Singtel if I'm not wrong). These are implemented but not well received. given the increasingly jialat crowding situation in public transport, cycling should be more actively promoted.</p>
