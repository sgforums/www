              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Both cyclists and pedestrians need to share the blame. But first of all, let’s get one thing straight: Pedestrians have the right of way on footpath. Period.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Having said that, it is easier for pedestrians to give way to cyclists than it is the other way round. All a pedestrian need to do is to walk to one side. Conversely, for a cyclist to give way, they sometimes need to dismount from the bike, push the bike past the pedestrian, remount the bike, and cycle on etc.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The problem is that cyclists must recognize that pedestrians make way for them out of courtesy, not because cyclists have the right of way or that cyclists can bull their way through pedestrians. Accordingly, every time a pedestrian make way for a cyclist, it is an act of courtesy when must be returned. A simple "thank you" will do nicely.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But how often do pedestrians get this basic courtesy returned from cyclists? They ring their bell incessantly as though they own the road, and when pedestrians give way to cyclists, they just cycle past as if they have the right of way. This action will cause some pedestrians (like the aforementioned Mr. Johnny Seto) to take a hard stance against cyclists, which in turn makes cyclists even more reckless. It is a downward spiral which could be avoided if cyclists will just ease off the bell a bit, and say “thank you” whenever a pedestrian make way for them.</span></p>

              <p>the MP made a mistake, if the experiment goes thru', then it is legal for cyclists to share the footpaths which would not goes down well with the pedestrians. Cyclists would be even bolder and reckless thus causing more accidents...the cyclists would blame the LTA or TC or installing obstacles which cause accidents (a previous bridge accident test case)</p>

              <p>Tampines is coined a bicycle town in police brochue, I believe due to the high concentration of cyclists in the area.   Just some points I want to raise.  I am a cyclist cycling to work daily and encouter many incidents. Cyclists are king of road? not true, pedestrians too are king of cylcling track in Tampiness too.  There are park connectors in Tampines for leisure and cyclists to move from town to town.  However, the following happens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pedestrians gather and crowd along park connectors, leaving no space for cyclists to move, but to go onto walkway.  When walkway is separated from connector, I will have to ring my bell to alert them. Reaction I got was, some stared at me, some don't bother and 1 case, got scolding as pedestrians thought he had the right of way.  Of coruse, there are those who give way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another point, since connector being built, many pedestrians started using them instead of the walkway.  Something very strange and true.  Then you also have the sports enthusiasts who jogs on the connectors.  I am find with that... however, this adds on to the many hazards cyclists already facing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My experience, you probably encounter more rude or rather inconsiderate cyclists than good ones.  More problem when kids cycle as they tend to speed or rather can't stop on time. some even playing with friends even on bike. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cyclists going on the road? yes but more accidents to happened.  As quoted by figures, since the trial in Tampines started, less accidents. How true, that's waht they say.  like it or not, I see it coming, even if its not successful, as mentioned, they will try monitor and tune it. </p>
              <p>Widening of road, already been considered but have problems, create bicycle track, same problems as widening.  there are already park connectors as reported and this actually "eats" into the space... where to find more space to create bicycle lane? </p>
              <p>Cyclists never walk across crossing?  Wrong again, there are cyclists who walked their bike across... I had seen it so I can tell you this although most don't</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I am just quoting what the Traffic Police and Land Transport Authority is saying – ie cyclists must get off and push their bikes at pedestrian crossing.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I believe the Traffic Police and LTA will say that the cyclist if cycling on the road, he/she will have to follow the traffic light at road junction also, ie red light – stop, green light – go.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Yes, there are cyclists who ride across the pedestrian crossings, similarly there are cyclists who beat red light, similarly there are motorist who beat red light. <span> Other than the chance of getting</span> caught by the Traffic Police, it is a matter that there is higher chance of <span> </span>an accident to happen.</span></p>
