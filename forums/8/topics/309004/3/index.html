              <p><br>that's where you are wrong. The pedestrains have the advantage over the cyclist. How fast can a cyclist ride? I remember once a friend of mine and another guy was arguing.</p>
              <p>The other guy who was the cyclist decide to zoom straight at my friend. My friend easily sidesteps and then kick off his bicycle, causing the cyclist to lose balance and fall off. Bruises were everywhere. A scuffle continues after that until we finally separate the two of them.</p>

              <p>The prevalence of the matter need to be considered. Like you said there are bound to be errant cyclists, skateboarders, pedestrainsÂ or inline skaters. However,Â incidences of errant behaviour involving the latter three are mostly isolated cases.

              <h1 class="clr">Tampines considers extending trial to let cyclists share footpath with pedestrians</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : Going green is becoming a popular choice among some Tampines residents in this age of rising fuel prices.</p>
              <p>They are considering whether to extend a yearâlong trial of letting cyclists on the same paths as pedestrians.</p>
              <p>Cyclists can be seen all over Tampines, probably one of the most bicycleâfriendly towns in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Last May, it started a yearâlong trial to let cyclists share the footpath with pedestrians.</p>
              <p>They even had volunteer traffic wardens to educate both parties on the right use of the path.</p>
              <p>The areaâs MPs are now looking at three options â legislate the system, extend the trial or drop it altogether.</p>
              <p>But
              before a decision is made, residents got a chance to give their
              feedback on Sunday, and there were strong opinions for and against the
              idea.</p>
              <p>One resident said, "If cyclists choose to go on the footpath, then they must observe all the safety precautions."</p>
              <p>Another said, "Cycling on the footpath â I will definitely appreciate it."</p>
              <p>A third commented, "It is a good way to promote bicycling."</p>
              <p>A fourth noted, "I am of the view that (we are) not ready to legislate until the infrastructure is all ready."</p>
              <p>One concern the residents have is of pedestrians being knocked into, even when they have right of way.</p>
              <p>Another
              is that the authorities are merely shifting the problem of high
              accident figures involving cyclists on the roads, to the footpaths.</p>
              <p>But
              Tampines Town Council Chairman Ong Kian Min said cyclists were already
              on pavements all over Singapore, and the Tampines trial was to make
              things safer for everyone.</p>
              <p>In fact, wellâknown transport academic
              Dr Paul Barter even suggested having a "Mr or Ms Bicycle" within the
              Land Transport Authority (LTA) to coâordinate policies.</p>
              <p>However,
              all of them agreed that there is a need for three things to happen â
              education for all, enforcement for the errant few and improved
              infrastructure.</p>
              <p>National Development Minister and MP for Tampines
              GRC, Mah Bow Tan, said, "One day you may be a cyclist, and (on) another
              (day), you may be pedestrian, so donât think you are in one camp or the
              other. We are all cyclists or pedestrians at one time or another, and
              if we all learn to coâexist, we are actually making life more pleasant
              for ourselves and our families."</p>
              <p>A decision on the issue is expected in the next fortnight, after MPs speak with the Traffic Police and LTA.</p>
              <p>Regardless
              of the final decision, Tampines Town Council will be building at least
              2.2 kilometres of new cycle paths at the cost of S$1 million, and it
              will be ready by the middle of next year.</p>
              <p>Tampines GRC is also
              working with the LTA to not just create more bicycle paths but also
