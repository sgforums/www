              <p>Then pedestrian should walk on the road like Little Indian on
              the weekends loh. Give way to the bike so that bikers can ride
              safely on pedestrian walkway. Its call pedestrian pavement for a

              <p>Don't be stupid lah... when the sidewalk is overcrowded with people of course cyclist should walk their bicycle coz its almost impossible to manuver... but if you're a couple walking on a sidewalk and a cyclist is announcing his intention of over taking you, you should just give way instead of giving him the trouble of cycling on the rough grass patch or dismounting, walking fasting to overtake you and mounting again...</p>

              <p>that's what I have been talking about! the issue is the people. not just the facilities.</p>
              <p>with an official bicycle path, those who knock you down will spit on you lo.. or will demand saying, "hellO? this is a BICYCLE path!" in a foreign tongue perhaps?</p>

              <p>Don't be distracted by a tunnel vision mindset... My explaination is for the padestrian who are blocking the walkway and the cyclist have no way of passing if the padestrian don't give way...</p>
              <p>if there is room to manuver and the cyclist can turn left or right to pass the padestrian then be my guess, just pass...</p>

              <p>maybe they should convert the extreme narrow paths to be a standard "width" of maybe 2meters? should be enough for typical days except very congested times? you must also understand setting back space for footpath and bicycle path will end up eating into buildable land area..</p>

              where to drive and not drive at the oncoming traffic..</p>
              <p>take a look at the tampines path now, and u will see that BOTH
              cyclists and pedestrians are all over the path.. we assume that
              everybody is courteous, but how do u know where to walk? u don't! u
              keep left, the bike in the same direction keep left, the bike in
              the opposite direction is to ur right, everybody is just
              everywhere, how do u noe where to sidestep? no doubt the pavement
              is big, but u have to keep looking over ur shoulders to see whether
              there's a bike aiming straight at ur ass..</p>

              <p>pedestrian should just use common sense. why install a bell on a bike when it is not to be rang?</p>
              <p>to pedestrians out there, so would you rather a bike to approach you from behind or from front without ringing and alerting you? and do you go around down the entire streets going  "excuse me"?  imgaine that you are on orchard road, jam-pack with people. all i see is that people are either busy cutting each other or bumping into each other. i don't even see people with the so called "basic courtesy" as mentioned in the posts above, saying "excuse me" when they are overtaking somebody.</p>
              <p>most of the time, people just overtake or cut other people's path silently. since a street full of pesdestrians don't say "excuse me", why should you expect a cyclist to do the same? after all, he is essentially still a fellow human being. he is not god or animal. why expect higher standards from the cyclist, when you are not doing the same thing yourself?</p>
              <p>a bicycle, essentially, still occupies the same width as a pesdestrians walking on the streets. they do not take up additional width, so, why shouldn't they be entitled to their share of the road?</p>
              <p>more often than not, we see pesdestrians walking down the middle of the walkway, as if they own the path. they refuse to bulge even when you ring repeatedly at them. so do you expect cyclist to do? i have met this sort of case before, even when i had courteously ask the person the give way. the person just ignore me, and continue and insist on walking on the middle of the road. so i no choice but to go really really close to him, (to the verge of running him down), before he would bulge.</p>
              <p>sometimes, it is not really the cyclist fault, but rather, the egotist pesdestrians, who think that by virtue of their so called "vulnerablitity" that they can walk anyway they want.</p>
              <p>same case with pesdestrians jaywalking on the streets. just because they are the "weaker party", they do not have any rights to expect drivers, motorcyclists to brake and give way to them.</p>
              <p>just because the road is labelled as "footpath", it doesn't mean that it belongs to anyone travelling on foot. likewise, this applies to "bicycle paths". we see people walking on bike pathways in the parks, and on park connectors, and we din give any nuts about it. so why should we have double standards, and criticise cyclists for doing exactly the same thing.</p>
              <p>cyclists, too, do not wish to know into people. they are not psychomaniacs who not only wishes to inflict harm on others, and also at the same time harming themselves.</p>
              <p>when a cyclists run into someone on the streets, most likely, they would also fall from the bike, and also risk injury. no sane cyclist would have like to crash into anybody, may it be other cyclists or pesdestrians.</p>
              <p>so, here, i urge those anti-cyclist to be more pragmatic, and have a more neutral stance.</p>

              <p>okay, for neighbourhoods like Tampines, they should have either a wider path or like mentioned, a separate small bicycle track.</p>
              <p>the bigger the track, the bigger the cyclist community will get. Soon, more space will be used on building Bicycle Lots, if not the poor lamp posts all congested with bicycles.</p>
              <p>The path gets any wider and it'll be better to assign cyclist lanes on the road! I think there was a picture that I saw which I think was good? the Main road and the cyclist lane is separated with a line of parallel parking lots.. I think that's quite safe..</p>

              <h1 class="clr">S$2.8m cycling track to be built for Sembawang and Woodlands residents</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Sembawang and Woodlands residents will have a new cycling
              track that will make both cyclists and pedestrians happy, as it has
              enhanced safety features.</p>
              <p>At both these towns, there are many cyclists among the HDB residents and foreign workers living in nearby dormitories.</p>
              <p>They
              will be happy with the new 7.4—kilometre cycling track in their area.
              The S$2.8—million project will be completed in the middle of next year.</p>
              <p>As
              far as possible, the cycling track will be built alongside the existing
              roadside pavement. However, where there are constraints, there will be
              clear demarcations like boundary lines and icons to show which track is
              for cyclists and which one is for pedestrians.</p>
              <p>Speed—regulating signs with words like "slow" and "dismount and push" will also be put up.</p>
              <p>Health
              Minister Khaw Boon Wan, who is also the MP for Sembawang GRC,
              officiated at the ground—breaking ceremony for the project on Saturday.</p>
              <p>He said the cycling track will also help residents save money on transport and reduce congestion on the roads.</p>
              <p>Some 400 residents joined in the day’s activities, which included a brisk walk and other exercises. — CNA/ir</p>
