              <h1>S$2.8m cycling track to be built for Sembawang and Woodlands residents</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Sembawang and Woodlands residents will have a new cycling track that will make both cyclists and pedestrians happy, as it has enhanced safety features.</p>
              <p>At both these towns, there are many cyclists among the HDB residents and foreign workers living in nearby dormitories.</p>
              <p>They will be happy with the new 7.4—kilometre cycling track in their area. The S$2.8—million project will be completed in the middle of next year.</p>
              <p>As far as possible, the cycling track will be built alongside the existing roadside pavement. However, where there are constraints, there will be clear demarcations like boundary lines and icons to show which track is for cyclists and which one is for pedestrians.</p>
              <p>Speed—regulating signs with words like "slow" and "dismount and push" will also be put up.</p>
              <p>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan, who is also the MP for Sembawang GRC, officiated at the ground—breaking ceremony for the project on Saturday.</p>
              <p>He said the cycling track will also help residents save money on transport and reduce congestion on the roads.</p>
              <p>Some 400 residents joined in the day’s activities, which included a brisk walk and other exercises. — CNA/ir</p>

              <p>this is fantastic news, though i will not be around to enjoy it (i think) altho' i live in the north right now.</p>
              <p>in general, when on the pavement, cyclists should give way, just as cars/vehicles should be more tolerant of cyclists who are on the road. however, there are really annoying pedestrians on pavement. i met the fair share of them on rare occasions i cycle on the pavements. they are generally displeased of cyclists `invading' into their walk path. some completely ignore the bells from cyclists even from afar. if accident happens, they are equally at blame. give and take needs to be exercised here.</p>
              <p>cyclists should also take the general rule that if they are confident on the road, they should avoid the pavements all together. the road is where they should be. however, there are also cyclists who are not confident on the road due to various reasons, hence it is safer that they stay on the pavement.</p>
              <p>ideally, there should be markings on the road to demarcate the cycling path, so drivers can be conscious of the cyclists. as petrol prices go outta whack and people generally are more aware of cutting their own carbon footprints here, there will be more cyclists on the road.  </p>
              <p>the government can certainly influenced this in a bigger way by making singapore more bike friendly. it is really the way to go. </p>

              <p>I cycle alot (main form of transport) and usually cycle on the road. I try to follow the traffic rule as much as possible. When cycling on pavement and there's pedestrain, I will slow down and follow behind and overtake only when they give way.</p>
              <p>However, I do notice some cyclist don't follow traffic rules when cycling on road (not sure of their nationalities). They like to cycle against the traffic, cross traffic junction during red light which I think is quite dangerous.</p>
              <p>By the way, I usually cycle in the bus lane but I am not sure if this is correct? But seem like too dangerous to move to the second lane and be squeeze between buses and faster moving vehicles.

              <p>bus lane is fine....moving to the 2nd lane is extremely dangerous.</p>
              <p>near where i live, there is usually a bunch of indian workers who cycled from their living quarters in yishun to sembawang shipyard to work. those `jokers' cycle dangerously on a daily basis and i am shock no one has taken any action against them. they cycle in groups, not single file and even against traffic flow. they are an accident waiting to happen.</p>
