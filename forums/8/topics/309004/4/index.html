              <h1>Tampines considers extending trial to let cyclists
              share footpath with pedestrians</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : Going green is becoming a popular choice among some
              Tampines residents in this age of rising fuel prices.</p>
              <p>They are considering whether to extend a year—long trial of
              letting cyclists on the same paths as pedestrians.</p>
              <p>Cyclists can be seen all over Tampines, probably one of the most
              bicycle—friendly towns in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Last May, it started a year—long trial to let cyclists share the
              footpath with pedestrians.</p>
              <p>They even had volunteer traffic wardens to educate both parties
              on the right use of the path.</p>
              <p>The area’s MPs are now looking at three options — legislate the
              system, extend the trial or drop it altogether.</p>
              <p>But before a decision is made, residents got a chance to give
              their feedback on Sunday, and there were strong opinions for and
              against the idea.</p>
              <p>One resident said, "If cyclists choose to go on the footpath,
              then they must observe all the safety precautions."</p>
              <p>Another said, "Cycling on the footpath — I will definitely
              appreciate it."</p>
              <p>A third commented, "It is a good way to promote bicycling."</p>
              <p>A fourth noted, "I am of the view that (we are) not ready to
              legislate until the infrastructure is all ready."</p>
              <p>One concern the residents have is of pedestrians being knocked
              into, even when they have right of way.</p>
              <p>Another is that the authorities are merely shifting the problem
              of high accident figures involving cyclists on the roads, to the
              footpaths.</p>
              <p>But Tampines Town Council Chairman Ong Kian Min said cyclists
              were already on pavements all over Singapore, and the Tampines
              trial was to make things safer for everyone.</p>
              <p>In fact, well—known transport academic Dr Paul Barter even
              suggested having a "Mr or Ms Bicycle" within the Land Transport
              Authority (LTA) to co—ordinate policies.</p>
              <p>However, all of them agreed that there is a need for three
              things to happen — education for all, enforcement for the errant
              few and improved infrastructure.</p>
              <p>National Development Minister and MP for Tampines GRC, Mah Bow
              Tan, said, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"One day you may be a cyclist, and (on) another (day),
              you may be pedestrian, so don’t think you are in one camp or the
              other.</span> We are all cyclists or pedestrians at one time or another,
              and if we all learn to co—exist, we are actually making life more
              pleasant for ourselves and our families."</p>
              <p>A decision on the issue is expected in the next fortnight, after
              MPs speak with the Traffic Police and LTA.</p>
              <p>Regardless of the final decision, Tampines Town Council will be
              building at least 2.2 kilometres of new cycle paths at the cost of
              S$1 million, and it will be ready by the middle of next year.</p>
              <p>Tampines GRC is also working with the LTA to not just create
              more bicycle paths but also widen existing pedestrian footpaths, at
              the cost of S$3.5 million over the next three to five years. —

              <p>I dont see how a person who cannot cycle in the first place and have absolutely no desire to learn how to cycle(eg elderly and etc)...can become cyclist (on) another (day)...so I dunno what is the point that Mr Mah is trying to say...only 2 words are in my mind right now..."wayang" and "taichi".<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/sleep.png" alt="sleep.png"></p>

              pedestrians to give way to cyclists than it is the other way round.
              All a pedestrian need to do is to walk to one side. Conversely, for
              a cyclist to give way, they sometimes need to dismount from the
              bike, push the bike past the pedestrian, remount the bike, and
              cycle on etc.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The problem is that cyclists must
              recognize that pedestrians make way for them out of courtesy, not
              because cyclists have the right of way or that cyclists can bull
              their way through pedestrians. Accordingly, every time a pedestrian
              make way for a cyclist, it is an act of courtesy when must be
              returned. A simple "thank you" will do nicely.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But how often do pedestrians get
              this basic courtesy returned from cyclists? They ring their bell
              incessantly as though they own the road, and when pedestrians give
              way to cyclists, they just cycle past as if they have the right of
              way. This action will cause some pedestrians (like the
              aforementioned Mr. Johnny Seto) to take a hard stance against
              cyclists, which in turn makes cyclists even more reckless. It is a
              downward spiral which could be avoided if cyclists will just ease
              off the bell a bit, and say “thank you” whenever a pedestrian make
              way for them.</span></p>

              <p>Pedestrian see Cyclist ahead = either one move one side early to signal intention to stay that side.</p>
              <p>Cyclist coming from behind unawared Pedestrian = Slowdown, make some noise with a bell(once or twice positive ringing) or "Beep Beep" "Excuse me" with your voice. approach within 5m if the Pedestrian still appears unawared, go on the less risky grassy patch that the pedestrian will unlikely to siam in shock.</p>
              <p>Pedestrian see unawared Cyclist ahead = Keep walking but watch out if the Cyclist suddenly stop or what.</p>
              <p>It's actually a very simple courtesy that singaporeans should have instead of forcing cyclist on the road or building extra bicycle paths.. honestly, if walking on the bicycle paths bring you to where you wanna go faster, there will still be pedestrians on the bicycle paths..</p>
              <p>does that mean because they are on that path we have the right to knock them down?</p>

              <p><strong><span id="DetailHeadline1_dgHeadLine__ctl2_lblHeadLine">More cycling lanes in Tampines</span></strong></p>
              <p>In one to two weeks time Singaporeans staying in Tampines GRC will
              find out if further plans for bicycle lanes will be firmed up.</p>
              <p>This is part of the Tampines town hall forum series which started in September 2006.</p>
              <p>Residents and council members met up this morning to discuss issues surrounding cycling on footways.</p>
              <p>Tampines town council has been working on rolling out bicycle lanes as part of their 5-year work plan.</p>
              <p>Under the plan two dedicated bicycle lanes spanning 2.2 kilometres
              in total will be constructed to the tune of 1 million dollars.</p>
              <p>More plans are expected to be rolled out progressively over the years.</p>
              <p>Already the town council has completed a short bicycle lane that is about 34 metres in March.</p>
              <p>At the same time there is also a proposal to connect Tampines GRC via a bicycle network.</p>
              <p>The 7 kilometre route which will be implemented progressively by the
              Land Transport Authority over the next 3 to 5 years will cost some 3.5
              million dollars.</p>

              <p>how often do u see pedestrians obstructing a cyclist? how often do u hear a cyclist going ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring as if the road is theirs?</p>
              <p>i think ppl aren't pissed to share the pathway.. they are pissed with inconsiderate cyclists.. i for one wouldn't care two hoots about cyclists flying on rooftops, but there are always those teenagers and young kids who don't bother slowing down and go at top speed, risking your children and parents' safety, and now the govt are bringing such a danger even closer to pedestrians..</p>
              <p>there should at least be policies and maybe restrictions on the cyclists' use.. not just open up routes and say 'share', and when things happen, nobody is faulted and some team comes out and say "nobody is at fault in this tragedy, and the biggest tragedy is if we don't learn from this.."</p>

              <p>chibet and purpledrag,</p>
              <p>I think there are inconsiderate cyclists and pedestrians. and they are the ones causing this problem. I used to cycle a lot too. since I outgrown my bike and that it got stolen. I have since became pedestrian.</p>
              <p>so Chibet, we all know it's a foot path. But surely it can be also known as just a path. and anybody can use it. I understand your anger with cyclists but it's not fair to the considerate ones.</p>
              <p>Purple, if everything has to have policies and restrictions, I think soon it'll require us to have a licence to ride a bike.</p>
              <p>As mentioned in my previous post. I think its about personal upbringing on the values of being considerate that actually matters.</p>

              <p>I did got involved in an accident before when I was cycling crossing a pedestrian crossing. I checked the roads, it was clear. just crossed halfway kenna hit at my rear wheel.. I was lucky to be unhurt, it was a mercedes and the guy inside didn't get off seeing I'm still standing. He was talking on his handphone. but my bicycle was dented and the paddles were crooked.</p>

              <p>Seriously if people cannot behave civily towards each other, allowing them on bikes will only cause more trouble.</p>

              <p>it should be more courteous and convenient for cyclist to come down push his bicycle coz cyclist has more chances of costing hurts to padestrain.</p>
              <p>after clearing padestrain , cyclist can cycle as fast as he can to  catch up his lost time.</p>
              <p>padestrain cannot, lan lan stand there , time lost is loose, cannot walk up time lost while standing.</p>

              <p>Then pedestrian should walk on the road like Little Indian on the weekends loh. Give way to the bike so that bikers can ride safely on pedestrian walkway. Its call pedestrian pavement for a reason.</p>
