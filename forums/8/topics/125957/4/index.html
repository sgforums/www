            <div class='col-md body'>I just watched a taped version of the last episode and i must say that the ending is so terrible because of NKF. The scriptwriters have to kill Liangyi so that he can donate his kidneys, and i believe they made this decision so as to accomodate the wishes of their sponser, which is NKF.<br><br>Really, without all the NKF interference in the show, this drama is actually quite good. Nice love story between Feifei and Liangyi.. only to be spoilt by a ridiculous ending -&gt; After being whacked by 3 beer bottles, he can still ride without accident from Geylang to Sentosa, only to bleed from the head all of a sudden after reaching and die. And all this about Liangyi and Feifei within the last 8 min or so... Feels as though the scriptwriters ran out of time at the last minute and are trying really hard to squeeze the ending into 1 episode.</div>

They showed her and Dongping visiting the asylum where Hanwei was kept..<br><br>As for the baby i dunno leh, dun remember any mention at all.. I think the scriptwriters forgot all about it in their haste to finish writing and filming the drama. According to the Mediacorp website, they were rushing to complete the filming as all the filming was squeezed within a few weeks, just a month before the television telecast.<br><br>As for that Mar Tien Tien... he's always the momma's boy, at least that's the impression i got from the show.</div>
