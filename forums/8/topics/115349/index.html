            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Loch Ness Monster</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Loch Ness Monster</strong>Â—sometimes called NessieÂ—is a creature or group of creatures said to live in Loch Ness, a large lake in Scotland near the city of Inverness. Nessie is generally considered a lake monster. Along with Bigfoot and Yeti, Nessie is perhaps the best-known mystery in cryptozoology.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/79/Lochnessmonster.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hoaxed photo of the Loch Ness monster. Fair use of an image that probably is owned by the Daily Mail.</span><br><br>Most mainstream scientists and other experts find current evidence supporting Nessie unpersuasive, and regard such reports as hoaxes or misidentification of mundane creatures.<br><br><strong>History of sightings</strong><br><br>* Rumours of a monster or animal living in the loch have reportedly circulated for at least several centuries, though some have questioned the accuracy, reliability and the existence of such tales. Many local inhabitants argue strongly for its existence. Some skeptics suggest that this may be because the rumours of Nessie underpin local folklore and the tourism industry.<br><br>* "Monster" sightings have occurred as far back as 1,500 years ago. The earliest known reference is from the Life of St. Columba; it describes how in 565 he saved the life of a Pict who was being attacked by the monster in the River Ness. Some critics have questioned the reliability of the Life, noting a different story, in which Columba slays a wild boar by the power of his voice alone.1)<br><br>* The first modern sighting occurred on May 2, 1933. The newspaper Inverness Courier carried a story of a local couple who reportedly saw "an enormous animal rolling and plunging on the surface." The report of the "monster" (a title chosen by the editor of the Courier) became a media sensation, with London papers sending reporters to Scotland and a circus even offering a reward of Â£20,000 for capture of the monster.<br><br>* Later that year, A.H. Palmer, who allegedly witnessed Nessie on August 11, 1933, at 7 a.m., described the creature as having its head, which they saw from the front, set low in the water. Its mouth, which had a width of between twelve and eighteen inches, was opening and closing; its maximum mouth aperture was estimated to be about six inches.<br><br>* The modern preoccupation with the Loch Ness Monster was aroused by a photograph allegedly taken by surgeon R.K. Wilson on April 19, 1934, which seemed to show a large creature with a long neck gliding through the water. Decades later on March 12, 1994, Marmaduke Wetherell claimed to have faked the photo after being hired by the Daily Mail to track down Nessie (the photo had by that time, been printed worldwide as 'absolute evidence'). Wetherell also stated that Wilson did not take the photo and his name was only used to give added credibility to the photo.<br><br><strong>Theories</strong><br><br>Most accounts of the monster's appearance, including historical ones, indicate a creature resembling the long-extinct plesiosaur. Actual fossil evidence for this Mesozoic creature shows it to have been physically large, with a long neck and tiny head, with flippers for propulsion. The alleged connection of this creature with the Loch Ness monster has made it a popular topic in the field of cryptozoology. However, most scientists suggest that the idea that the Loch Ness Monster is a remnant of the Mesozoic era is highly unlikely Â— there would need to be a breeding colony of such creatures for there to have been any long-term survival, and, coupled with the fact that plesiosaurs needed to surface to breathe, this would result in far more frequent sightings than have actually been reported. Many biologists also argue Loch Ness is not large or productive enough to support even a small family of these creatures.<br><br>Other sightings, however, do not fit the plesiosaur description, or even a water-bound creature: In April of 1923, Alfred Cruickshank claimed to have seen a creature 3m to 3.5m long, with an arched back and four elephant-like feet cross the road before him as he was driving. Other sightings report creatures more similar to camels or horses.<br><br>Theories as to the exact nature of the Loch Ness Monster sightings are varied: pareidolia or misidentification of seals, fish, logs, mirages, seiches, and light distortion, crossing of boat wakes, or unusual wave patterns.<br><br>Very large sturgeon have been found in inland streams close to Loch Ness and, due to sturgeons' size and unusual appearance, one could easily be mistaken for a monster by someone not familiar with it. A recent theory postulates that the "monster" is actually nothing more than bubbling and disruptions in the water caused by minor volcanic activity at the bottom of the loch. This latter argument is supported Â— to a minor degree Â— by a correlation between tectonic motion and reported sightings.<br><br><strong>Evidence</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence against</span><br><br>Perhaps typical of the many unsatisfactory "facts" about Nessie is the alleged sighting of October 1871. In this incident a "D. Mackenzie" supposedly described seeing something that moved slowly before moving off at a faster speed. People who saw "the monster" were said to describe it as having a hump (sometimes more than one) that looked like an upturned boat. However, although this story has been repeated in several places, no original 1871 source has been cited, however, casting doubt on the report.<br><br>Sir Peter Scott, one of Britan's best-known naturalists, is a firm believer in the Loch Ness Monster, and has lent the weight of his reputation to the debate about it for many years, and has also promoted the use of a Greek name for it: Nessiteras rhombopteryx. This name, which was coined by himself and underwater photographer Robert Rines in December 1975, may be roughly translated as "The Ness monster with diamond-shaped fin.", but as London newspapers pointed out, the name is also an anagram for the words "Monster hoax by sir peter s."<br><br>In July 2003, the BBC reported that an extensive investigation of Loch Ness by a BBC team, using 600 separate sonar beams, found no trace of any "sea monster" in the loch. The BBC team concluded that Nessie does not exist.<br><br>The famed "Surgeon's Photo" (pictured above) was confirmed a hoax, based on the deathbed confessions of photographer Marmaduke Wetherell. Wetherell claimed this photo, which inspired much popular interest in the monster, was actually a staged photograph of clay attached to a toy submarine. Well before Wetherell's claims, however, others had argued the photo was that of an otter or a diving bird. Note that there are in fact two "Surgeon's Photos," which depict slightly different poses, leading some to argue the photos are evidence against a hoax.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence for</span><br><br>Some have argued a history of "monster" sightings in the loch is circumstancial evidence supporting the creature's actuality. Note that these notions have been challenged.<br><br>In the early 1970s, a group led by American patent lawyer Robert Rines obtained some underwater photographs. One was a vague image, perhaps of a rhomboid flipper (others have argued the object could be air bubbles or a fish fin). On the basis of this photograph, Sir Peter Scott announced in 1975 that the scientific name of the monster would henceforth be Nessiteras rhombopteryx1 (it has been humorously noted that the name is an anagram of 'monster hoax by Sir Peter S'). This would enable Nessie to be added to a British register of officially protected wildlife.</div>
