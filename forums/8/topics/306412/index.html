              <p>hmmm .</p>
              <p>i got a question for you all.</p>
              <p>a student gets late for his assembly. an intention to skip it.</p>
              <p>but eventually, he came back to the assembly and got punished for his traunt act.</p>
              <p>and while they were walking around the parade square for their punishment.</p>
              <p>DM shouted , "eh, Fat Guy!, get into the line"</p>
              <p>The student asked for an apology, but DM refused.</p>
              <p>reason because that student tried to skip assembly therefore not deserving his respect.</p>
              <p>both ended with no one winning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>may i have all the public views ? =] THANKS !</p>
              <p>there's no right or wrong answer.</p>

              <p>I do agree that some people say the kid has no right to demand respect but</p>
              <p>i believe the DM dun deserve his pay if he abuses his power.......</p>
              <p>the DM's job is to ensure and enforce discipline on the students.....i believe calling people fat won't do any good in enforcing discipline on the kid......</p>

              <p>telling the kid to do rounds is his job yes but does calling him names like "eh, Fat Guy!, get into the line" definitely is not part of educating him.......</p>
              <p>we cannot know his true vocal tone when he said this but there may have been two scenarios....</p>
              <p>one is a harsh tone and the other being a friendly tone like how you would call your friend.......</p>
              <p>if it was the first then he might have been abusing his power.......most people who use the first must definitely feel big headed thus giving himself his own reason to call em fat.....</p>
              <p>if its the latter then he should probably learn to not address his students liddat........</p>
