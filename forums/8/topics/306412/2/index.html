              <p>thats why i said that most of the time the students lose the case becoz their reasons weren't reasonable enough and 100% becoz of the fact that most of the class would've given proper eye witness accounts instead of making false accounts just to side their friend.......i'm sure the other students know better....</p>
              <p>unless its some corrupted private school where the principal's main priority are the students rather than keeping things balanced.....coz in this case the students would be the one paying their pays....</p>

              Purposely skip assembly still wan respect?
              Do you have any respect for everyone who make a point to attend the assembly?
              I think the DM have done no wrong.
              He is doing his job. If he keeps quiet after catching the person skipping assembly deliberately, then the DM is not doing his job.
              Abuse of power? How did he abuse it? If you did nothing wrong, how did he get a chance to say anything at all?
              
              Someone say complain to MOE and expect the DM to say sorry?
              Hahaha! Wake up lah! You think Singapore schools have become so useless untill DM say sorry to you?? 
              If that day come I will start bullying ppl in school and act pai kia, because I will get my way as I can complain to MOE!!

              <p>798, kudos, i agree with u.</p>
              <p>and wtf, if the guy is fat, wads wrong? DM is just being honest. ppl who do not agree cfm is nv go army, or is just abt to enlist into the current gu niang army.</p>
              <p>with weaklings tat are hurt by just some mere "fat" words, i doubt future sg can go any further.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if our dear PAP decides to get more FT based on above reasoning - sgaporean are getting to be weaklings, i will vote for them. i rather see PAP than losers who cannot even take some simple scolding.</p>

              <p>a teacher's job is to make sure that they educate the students properly.........calling people names does no good in educating them this is the reason why there are loads of dropouts and rebels........</p>

              <p>this reminds me of the case where the boy kena smack on the head with a textbook........</p>
              <p>in this case we can never know for sure how rude the two were to each other........</p>

              <p>i think one of the many reasons for this is also modernisation........</p>
              <p>kids get more pampered then older generations.......</p>
              <p>lifestyles nowadays and during and a few decades after ww2 was different then now......</p>
              <p>i remember my grandad telling me they ate bread that was so hard that it won't break even if they throw it against the wall.....</p>
              <p>my grandma in indonesia also told me of a scenario where jap warplanes were flying low to attack villages.....</p>
              <p>i think if this was ww2, things would definitely be different.......</p>
              <p>personally i kena slapped by teacher my teacher once when i was in primary school but i dun think i ever regretted not doing anything coz i was aware of myself being kinda rude and all.....</p>
              <p>some poeple cannot just say blame it on parents for pampering them.......they must also take note of the environment that they live in......if this was a third world country i dun think the kid would even think of asking the DM for an apology</p>
