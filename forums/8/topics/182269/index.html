            <div class='col-md body'>MORNING... RUSH HOUR... The time where people rushes to work... Couldn't help but to notice some people's behaviors on MRT transit and such... And no offence.. Somehow they're all "aunties".....<br><br>1st, there is this AUNTIE who always like to CUT people's QUEUE.. It has already been LONG UNDERSTOOD that one SHOULDN'T BLOCK the EXIT of the boarding passenger.... YET she can always be the OUTSTANDING ONE... EVERY MORNING WITHOUT FAIL... Being SO PROUD of IT.... WALKING RIGHT UP as if the OTHERS are INVISIBLE... Not that I can't help it, but sometimes I just arrive after her... Just 'buay song' that she's doing such things to the others...<br><br>2nd, there's this ANOTHER AUNTIE who also JOINED IN the QUEUE CUT.... I see her a bit old, couldn't be bother... She just SQUEEZED and PUSHED her way through the others to get a SEAT... Seemed rather PROUD of her 'ACCOMPLISHMENT' too... Just that ALMOST the moment she sat down without lasting even a min or so, she had to stand up... She's only for a short station... Seems to me like she wasn't getting the seat for the sake of sitting... But just to show that she can push through others to get the seat she wants.. I can still record that angry look on her face when the others did not let her have her way in cutting through....<br><br>3rd case in just a morning... This AUNTIE which 'FUNNY ENOUGH' I managed to recall what she was about to do even before she did it... Apparently, this isn't the 1st time... While the others (and me included of course) were getting to the door of the MRT.. Waiting for it to open so that we can rush off to office... She.. Just like to squeeze up to the door TOO... But the moment the door opens up, she'll just take her own sweet time to walk out of it... Blocking everyone behind her.. And nope... Don't try me she's weak or no strength or whatever.... Just look at the way she PUSHES her way THROUGH to get to the FRONT of the opening door... And the form of 'urgency' she seems to display on it... I mean I just find it FUNNY... This is NOT the only person I've seen doing such... SOME PEOPLE just like to SQUEEZE their way through right in front of you SO THAT they can just PARK up front and BLOCK YOUR WAY...<br><br>But that isn't the END of the 3rd story... The moment I managed to get out of the train and overtake her, I moved right up to the escalator and waited a bit for the up going queue to ease so that I can move right in... THAT AUNTIE came right up AGAIN... SQUEEZED right past me... Ok, I couldn't really recall what she's about to do and thought I shouldn't be so mean to an auntie... -_-" THEN it HAPPENS AGAIN... Moving on 2 lanes up the escalator... There're people resting by the left side and the right lane which we're taking, people are rushing up... She JUST STOOD THERE and BLOCKED the WHOLE WAY.... GREAT... FANTASTIC..... A ROUND OF APPLAUSE PLEASE....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>So I SIMPLY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND why there're SOME PEOPLE who just LIKES to SQUEEZE THEIR WAY THROUGH to BLOCK people's WAY when they OBVIOUSLY DON'T NEED to do that... But it's really 'okay' for now AUNTIES... For the NEXT TIME, it SHOULDN'T happen again....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U r not the only 1, dude.<br><br>This happens to me a few years ago. In the MRT also. I was about to sit down, this auntie just push me 1 side and took the seat. I was like  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  shocked. These type of pple actually exist.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Devil1976:</div><div class="quote_body">MORNING... RUSH HOUR... The time where people rushes to work... Couldn't help but to notice some people's behaviors on MRT transit and such... And no offence.. Somehow they're all "aunties".....<br><br>1st, there is this AUNTIE who always like to CUT people's QUEUE.. It has already been LONG UNDERSTOOD that one SHOULDN'T BLOCK the EXIT of the boarding passenger.... YET she can always be the OUTSTANDING ONE... EVERY MORNING WITHOUT FAIL... Being SO PROUD of IT.... WALKING RIGHT UP as if the OTHERS are INVISIBLE... Not that I can't help it, but sometimes I just arrive after her... Just 'buay song' that she's doing such things to the others...<br><br>2nd, there's this ANOTHER AUNTIE who also JOINED IN the QUEUE CUT.... I see her a bit old, couldn't be bother... She just SQUEEZED and PUSHED her way through the others to get a SEAT... Seemed rather PROUD of her 'ACCOMPLISHMENT' too... Just that ALMOST the moment she sat down without lasting even a min or so, she had to stand up... She's only for a short station... Seems to me like she wasn't getting the seat for the sake of sitting... But just to show that she can push through others to get the seat she wants.. I can still record that angry look on her face when the others did not let her have her way in cutting through....<br><br>3rd case in just a morning... This AUNTIE which 'FUNNY ENOUGH' I managed to recall what she was about to do even before she did it... Apparently, this isn't the 1st time... While the others (and me included of course) were getting to the door of the MRT.. Waiting for it to open so that we can rush off to office... She.. Just like to squeeze up to the door TOO... But the moment the door opens up, she'll just take her own sweet time to walk out of it... Blocking everyone behind her.. And nope... Don't try me she's weak or no strength or whatever.... Just look at the way she PUSHES her way THROUGH to get to the FRONT of the opening door... And the form of 'urgency' she seems to display on it... I mean I just find it FUNNY... This is NOT the only person I've seen doing such... SOME PEOPLE just like to SQUEEZE their way through right in front of you SO THAT they can just PARK up front and BLOCK YOUR WAY...<br><br>But that isn't the END of the 3rd story... The moment I managed to get out of the train and overtake her, I moved right up to the escalator and waited a bit for the up going queue to ease so that I can move right in... THAT AUNTIE came right up AGAIN... SQUEEZED right past me... Ok, I couldn't really recall what she's about to do and thought I shouldn't be so mean to an auntie... -_-" THEN it HAPPENS AGAIN... Moving on 2 lanes up the escalator... There're people resting by the left side and the right lane which we're taking, people are rushing up... She JUST STOOD THERE and BLOCKED the WHOLE WAY.... GREAT... FANTASTIC..... A ROUND OF APPLAUSE PLEASE....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>So I SIMPLY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND why there're SOME PEOPLE who just LIKES to SQUEEZE THEIR WAY THROUGH to BLOCK people's WAY when they OBVIOUSLY DON'T NEED to do that... But it's really 'okay' for now AUNTIES... For the NEXT TIME, it SHOULDN'T happen again....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote></div>
