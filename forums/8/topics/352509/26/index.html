              castle as ur current magic shop .. anyway magictheory13 i gotten a
              Wizard Dark Pk ring too its look damn cool. my personal liking is
              things that are black then this ring suit me a lot.</p>

              <p>Yes it is freaking cool. So damn nice. The previous one looks like a wedding band but the wizard dark look like a fashion accessory. Which suits youngsters like us. </p>
              <p>What is the name of the shop? So long it isn't selling pirated dvd I dun think it will be an issue to name shops that provide bad service.</p>

              <p>i'm not called magictheory for nothing. I travel around and visit different magic shops in different countries. And yes I will declare that I'm spoilt for choice at castle that most magic shops that I went to pale in comparison. I just wanna know which shop is it so I can avoid bringing fellow magicians or hobbyist there.</p>
              <p>If you do not feel comfortable saying here, can pm me. I just curious. I think I have an idea which shop could it be. : )</p>

              <p>Wow! I've never actually like illusions before cos I don't think
              I will ever perform them.</p>
              <p>But I saw how nice those on castle's website were that I can't
              help but called jay and ordered the illusions dvd! Haha!</p>
              <p>So for all those like me who are not performing full time
              but just want to find out the secrets, just buy the dvds!</p>

              <p>Magic hall selling scotch and soda on their website for $65. Other shops are selling it for less than $40.</p>
              <p>You trying to tell us that for people who knows about other shops' prices will get the same price at magic hall just because they told the staff there about it so they can beat the price?</p>
              <p>Then why put it at $65 in the first place and not $45? So people who don't know will still buy it at $65? Almost double the market price?</p>
              <p>And get cheated by them, YET AGAIN???</p>
              <p>Do you know what nonsense are you spouting?</p>
              <p>Oh ya, Singaporemagician, you trying to tell us that guy is handsome? What kind of remark is that for someone who has cheated so many people (most of them are here in this forum)?</p>
              <p>You said you entered ns in jan. It's only the first week in jan. Didn't know now army camp got internet access for recruits to use during their confinement bmt.</p>
              <p>Don't bother editing your previous post. From now on, I will personally copy the screen of every single post you put up.</p>
              <p>Singaporemagician, you claimed you are not magic hall. Every post that you put up is either bad things about other people or some achievements hall has cooked up.</p>
              <p>Everyone here is smart enough to tell, unlike you, stupid.</p>

              <p>good looking? All china man lookalike still good looking? Looks like their chinaman assistant comes free with their pirated made in china gimmicks. Cheapest price? Don't make me laugh. Hell I can get a moving pips in Castle at a price lower than that shithole and better quality somemore. Jealous of what success? Their successful scams? Only that? More expensive unit? How do you know it's more expensive? It's only looks smaller, dirtier, crammer and the same old homo solomon scamming people. again. Try harder and cook a better story next time Kenneth or whoever from Hall. Go take your pirated stuff and shove it up your rectum.</p>
