              <p><br>I found out about magic hall after reading about the iphone magic dvd from the newpaper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Quite surprised that newpaper actually wrote about them, despite the fact that the very dvd they are talking about is actually pirated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hopefully the editors will see this thread and write something on the papers to warn others about the piracy going on in the shop.</p>

              <p>Btw, I met a magician from the brotherhood of magicians in singapore. He's a fellow student at singapore poly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said that this thing about magic hall has spread to everywhere. That means everyone in magic in singapore knows about it! He said many people already know they doing piracy, but nobody doing anything about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now finally someone is. Sad to say, they kinda deserve it.</p>

              <p>Gosh! I was using google and just for fun, typed in the keywords "magic hall".</p>
              <p>First few links were to the shop, but after that, there was a link to this thread and it says "magic hall sucks"!</p>
              <p>I wonder what would people think if they were finding out more on the shop!</p>
              <p> </p>
