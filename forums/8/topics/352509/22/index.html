              <p>hahas.. actually i went to all the magic shop in singapore at least once already.. hall claimed to be the biggest shop in Singapore i can agree.. cos if u judging by shop size he indeed is biggest.. but as for selling things there are more places that sell better stuff compare to them.. like magic castle lo.. hahas..</p>
              <p>anyway glad that u did not buy the disc from them.. last time i was in a shop @ suntec which sell cards.. i heard a guy told his friend that he went to hall and the guy there keep asking him to buy the dvds somehow like forcing.. hahas.. u are not the first one to experince this.. i know how u feel cos i also went there i looking at decks then he say so have u decided what to buy? then i told him all the decks i have already then i say nvm i see how next time then his face change to like as if i owe him things he dont even say thanks.</p>
              <p>i went to other magic shop they say hi and they would just tell us abt the newest thing and even if i never buy he would say, okay hope u come again thanks for visiting.. &lt;== this is what i call service.. lols=x</p>
              <p>and btw i think he's not indian i think he's a malay... cos in the first few post there's people saying that his name is sulaiman.. hahas anyway u can try going other shop lo like magic castle @ shaw.. a few people in this forum have went and happy when coming back =D</p>

              <p>Magic Castle not branch of the stupid magic hall right? Are their things good? I saw a lot of decks very nice in magic hall. Does magic castle sell decks also?</p>
              <p>The suntec shop is the small cubicle that sells a lot of things include decks right? Ya, I buy at the parkway branch also, but they don't have so many kinds.</p>

              <p>hmmm.. hall is nothing related to castle.. they are different boss, company hahas.. anyway magic castle sell things like other shops, decks, dvd, teach in tricks also have good service cos i go there a few times for decks and trick =D hahas..my friend is member =x hahas.. suntec that shop sell decks still okay la.. but sometime i see quite expensive lo =x hahas.. anyway magic castle have website too..</p>
              <p>u can go see also =D .. hahas the best is go the main branch @ shaw tower.. hahas.. i compare a few shops to castle and around 90% of it they sell things a bit expensive than castle .. for me now castle is best in singapore lor.. hahas.. but is depend on people .. hahas..</p>

              <p><br>I agree with frezman. My parents really like magic castle owner jay's service. Magic castle and magic hall are totally not related at all.</p>
              <p>Shaw tower got many things too. But if you like decks, you should drop by their katong branch. They got a lot of different decks and you can learn tricks for only 25 to 35 dollars.</p>
              <p>This is the link to their katong branch</p>

              <p><br>For me is very worth it, cos I preorder the little man. The discount given is already more than the membership cost!</p>
              <p>And I receive email from them that their yearly membership is now lifetime! They said they will ask me to collect my free polo tshirt and plastic member card once its ready.</p>
              <p>Now they give free to all people who join member</p>

              <p>You can try go other shops, but you will still come back to magic castle. I used to go magic wand and magic boutique but now castle is the best.</p>
