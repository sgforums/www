I think it's fake cause the quality of the gimmick is like crap, and the box doesn't have Rosenbaum's trademark gecko picture on it, and the printing of the instructions is crap. I checked from penguin magic and there's supposed to be two different set ups inside as well as a dvd by Rosenbaum and Andy Amyx but after I got the gecko from TMH i opened it at home, and the gimmick sucks, the printed instructions suck, no dvd, one single set up in a crappy box.</p></div>

              <p>Congrats on finding out early that TMH sells fake stuff. I suggest you get a refend if you have the proof thats its fake. I got a refund from them for dvd becuase i can see that it is burnt from the originals.</p>
              <p>But regarding gimmicks and stuff depend on your luck ba.  Pity ppl are still talking about this and refuse to report this to the CID about it.</p>
              <p>Need more ppl to call!!!</p>
              <p>And spread the word around.</p>

              <p>tell them you have evidence that other people got their refund and you want yours also.</p>
              <p>if the malay guy keep saying no, ask to speak to his boss. if he don't want to let you, you can call him at this number - 83123232</p>
              <p>keep calling him until he pick up.</p>

              <p>Good for you to be able to get the refund. Same as me I got there and ask for refund they din ask any qns and jus refunded me. Just spread the word around.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And they dun issue receipts. When you go other shops just check the things before buying too. If buying dvd can ask them to open and show. They actually also heard about TMH. So when i told them they said can show me the back od the dvds if i am afraid its fake.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Called the relevant authorities already. But seems to be no news as i see the 'largest magic shop' is still bringing in new stuff.</p>
              <p> </p>

              After reading from page one i have decided to ask for a refund for the dvd i purchased.
              
              I wrote a email to kenneth. With evidence from the forum =)
              
              Hi Kenneth,
              
              I would demand a refund for the Dvd i purchased earlier this year during August. After reading through the sgforum, I realised that the Dvd is pirated and i had paid 45 bucks for it. This is definitely a scam.
              
              I believe it is only more than reasonable to ask for a refund. I will head down to the shop personally to get back the money.
              
              Please reply to me as soon as possible to notify me of when i can head down to the shop to collect the refund,
              
              Evidence is as follow :
              
              Hi, my name is Hock Tiong. Like many people who posted on this forum thread, I too, fell victim to this particular magic shop's scam.
              A few weeks ago, my son bought a couple of DVDs from this shop.
              Suspicious of the quality and authenticity of the DVDs, he approached friends as well as other magic shops to further investigate.
              His suspicions were confirmed days later after comparing a similar DVD title purchased by one of his friends from another magic shop.
              My son came to me and we proceeded down to magic hall to demand an explanation.
              The salesman denied everything that we threw at him and we had to leave the shop empty-handed, angered and frustrated.
              That was when I decided to take matters into my own hands.
              The following attachments were email dialogues between me and magic hall.
               
              
               
              As you can see from their first reply, they didn't question me anything and quickly arranged to have the situation resolved as soon as I mentioned about the law.
               
              
               
              The 2nd reply was an excuse that I personally think is nonsensical. I myself run a business that deals in the import export trade. Having knowledge of the contents of what we deal with is the lifeline of our business. If magic hall claims they don't open up their packages, isn't it the same as a drug dealer telling the police they didn't know they were carrying drugs?
               
              
               
              
               
              
               
              
               
              Read their reply very carefully- "...so that I can trace back on that transaction and get the ORIGINAL pieces for you."
              Confessions from the horse's mouth.
               
              
               
              This reply really says it all. Reason why they kept pushing for the titles is because they needed to re-order from their suppliers, which most probably will take a few days to arrive.
              That means all the DVDs and maybe a lot more other products, everything in their shop are pirated.
               
              
               
              In the end, I managed to get back a total of S$1350 in refund and the 17 original DVDs will be arriving at my house via delivery from them in a few days time.
