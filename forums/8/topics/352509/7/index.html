              <p>Like that you tell him, "Pick a DvD and i show you a scam"</p>
              <p>Like many of the magician, I've been to TMH and had been scammed. I once asked Soloman why are the dvd so expensive. He said he had to include the DVD shipment cost and the currency exchanged. His response was probably more respectful as i brought my dad there. Ever since, i stop buying from them as the price didn't add up. I thought they we making at least 20 buck profit. But, it turned out they were making hell more. D*mn Gay. Burn CDs.. wtf? I think the locations of better shop should be disclosed. At first, I only knew magic hall. So i was like, "No choice, they got profit earn, buy lor" But now i know some better shops and stopped going to TMH.</p>

              <p>As the name suggested, I went to the shop and purchased some

              <p>So you want us all, the victims, to march down to the shop and turn it upside-down ourselves and get caught by the police since the police refuses to take action against this piracy. You want ALL of us to be charged. OR do you want us raise a big sum of money, to sue them for scamming our money, thus losing MORE money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why don't all you, the BRAVE soul, take some action by SHUTTING up? That would be much useful that you opening your big mouth to utter some nonsense. Can't you read and see that people are doing something? They are RAISING AWARENESS. Go google it up if you still do not know what it is about</p>
