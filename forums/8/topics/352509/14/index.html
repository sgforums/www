              <p>now the boss will know what his staff is doing after work hours. Its a total disgrace of himself! This really explains a lot, when he put this video up, it was in june. they already know that people are aware of their piracty and cheating crimes, but still got time to dance around, recoerd it and show to the world.</p>
              <p>kenneth, if you are reading this, i can tell you that your staff is not very intelligent. But you are even worst because you are still keeping him.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I heard from one ex staff who used to work in magic hall that kenneth told him he can't sack sulaiman because he can't find anyone else to work for $850 salary. If this is true, then kenneth is smart, because at the end of the day, he can always tell the police that the whole piracy thing was done behind his back, and initiated by nobody else but the shop keeper.</p>

              <p><br>No la, i also wish they appear on that show. Magic hall appear on that show is a variety show  <span id="ctl00_cph3_ChannelSchedule6_dlTvGuide_ctl06_lblProgramTitleChi" class="TvScheduleProgramTitleEngAlt">éƒ½æ˜¯å¤§å�‘çŽ°</span> hosted by 4 host. I was thinking doesn't mediacorp know that shop selling pirated DVD? One of the guy i dunno is kenneth ornot perform some effect for the host one of it is distortion, he still can tell them the name of the trick call distortion, is like wtf!! So now the people watching this show know that the card is gimmick and not magic. Last but not least, solomon also got perform some effect for the host also.  I think they too famous for their cheating tatics thats why on tv.</p>

              <p>Hi <a href="http://sgforums.com/users/139405">Kinryu69</a>,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have you bought from magic hall? I was waiting for someone to support my claims.  Nobody seems interested to bring them down. Only talk in this forum. Sad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recently I went down to magic hall to refund back some dvds. And guess what solomon just called his boss i suppose its kenneth and straight away refunded me the money withouht asking much questions like why do you want to refund? Think they also scared ppl go report on them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really need some more ppl like me who have bought dvds from them to report it to the CID. Like I said if more ppl report then the relevant authorities would do something ba. </p>

              <p><br>First of all if you say learing free magic tricks from internet such as youtube den i must say, stay away from that  site if you are REALLY serious into magic, i mean if you just want to learn very simple magic tricks that  just to bluff ppl or impress girls den its ok cos most of the  people which provide free magic tutorial at youtube they themselves can't really even perform magic in real life situation, they just know the secerts behind  magic and expose it on on the net.</p>

              <p><br>The price is around $110-$120 if i am not wrong. You can go try magic castle at shaw tower near bugis see if they got it there. I advise you to get it from blogshop as it will be cheaper getting it from shops. Btw, are you new to magic? If you are den i won't advise you to get dan and dave triolgy cos you will have a hard time catching up what dan and dave is teaching.</p>

              <p>hahas.. yeah i agree with gambit_90 thread hahas.. tricks from internet mostly are not the actual performance trick the person might just figure out himself then post up and said that it's the way that the trick works.. i rather go buy from shop lor =D hahas..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>erm NoToMagicHall? D&amp;D triology i got but i tell u i've learnt magic for 2 years and it still require me to practise like hell if u wanna perform well .. i rather u go down to the shop that gambit said and ask the guy to intro u dvd for beginners.. i think there's quite a few for cards trick or coin trick..</p>
              <p>lols.. as i know now the place where sell most dvd are castle and hall.. but if u dun wanna be conned then better go castle lol..</p>

              <p><br>I start with crash course 1 and 2 when i first started out learning magic 2 years back. Frankly speaking i kind of regret getting it, cos i could have learn much more if i purchase Royal road to card college.  If you have crash course 1 and 2 and also ninja 1 and 2, i suggest you master these 4 dvd b4 moving on to Dan and dave triogly. Cos it will be much more harder. Build a solid foundation for your basic card handling b4 moving on to the more advance level, this way it will be much more easier if you are going to learn any advance sleights in the furture. By the way, where do you bought the 4 dvd which you mention? You can go back to the shop where you purcahse it unless is MAGIC HALL.</p>

              <p><br>hahas, you ask yourself what you want to learn after that? There are lots of effect in magic that you won't be able to learn finish, pick something which you like and you think you will be using it. If you don't wan to just perform with cards only, you can move on to learn daily objects which can be also perform magic, etc Coins, rubber bands, rings and some other stuff. For me i will be moving on to coins and rubber bands after i master army of 52 and xtreme begginerz.</p>
