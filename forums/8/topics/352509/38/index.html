              <p>After being outstation for so many months, can see that magic hall is still up to piracy.</p>
              <p>I received many pms from people thanking me that becos of this thread, they managed to find out about the truth and most of them got their refunds.</p>
              <p>so for people who just found out, go get your refund. Those who got it told me that they go there and told them that their going to call the police.</p>
              <p>whether you call or not you call the police, don't be afraid, because you are not doing anything wrong. It is them who created this shit.</p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think if you make enough of a fuss, they will eventually refund you. Because if you create so much noise and the security guards are called, they will ask what's wrong. Then kenneth and sulaimonkey will try to keep you quiet by giving back the refund cos they won't want the management to find out what they are doing and call the police in the end.</p>
              <p>So basically, make as much noise as possible to get a refund. Make sure the passer bys see what's going on.</p>

              <p>I guess I'm the latest victim of magic hall's scams. Bought a 70 dollar plus dvd 3 days ago.</p>
              <p>When I tried to play it on my dvd player, there was no reading. Tried a few times and realised nothing wrong with my player.</p>
              <p>Brought it back the next day to ask for another piece. And they gladly changed it for me.</p>
              <p>Only now when I found this forum, I realised why they were so eager to change the dvd for me, cos it's self-burnt.</p>
              <p>Yes, the back of the dvd is blue. I read many people's post here that they got a refund. They didn't give me a receipt. But I've emailed the people from ellusionist telling them my experience. I will want to try to get my money back from them.</p>

              <p>oh thats good.. hahas.. their new shops is not magic enough lo. last time i walk pass the shop then i saw he was teaching a guy an ace trick, step by step. i stood there and see and he looked up and smiled at me. </p>
              <p>teaching of magic should be more private lo, not to teach the trick/props with the table right in front of the shop</p>
