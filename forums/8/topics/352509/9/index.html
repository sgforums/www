              <p>Hi guys, my name is Julian.</p>
              <p>I registered on this forum just to share my story.</p>
              <p>I learnt about magic hall after passing by the place in Plaza Singapura about a month ago. I bought a deck of special magic cards. Was also told about their main branch at the old le'meridien hotel.</p>
              <p>Last week, I was around the area near to the hotel, so I made a visit to the shop.</p>
              <p>I was greeted by a guy who introduced himself as Solomon.</p>
              <p>We spoke for a while. He then brought to my attention the instructional dvds in the shop. He was describing how good and valued for money they were. I had my eye set on 2 dvds, but I was working with a very tight budget, so I gave him my word that I'll be back for them after my payday.</p>
              <p>I left without buying anything.</p>
              <p>Today, I found this forum. I read through the whole episode between you guys and magic hall.</p>
              <p>All I want to say is a big thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>
              <p>Because of what you guys did in creating this awareness, I found out about other better magic shops to patronize. But most importantly, you all have prevented me from been duped by magic hall's unscrupulous tactics.</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              <p>Can anyone tell me where Shaw tower is at? I want to join mastle castle as a member.</p>
              <p>To tell you guys the truth, I'm still quite a beginner in magic. Not having any source to start out magic, I relied on myself to source out stuff. Starting on double lift and jumping horrendously all around the magic world, learning irrelevant stuff. ( My first DVD was from TMH, Fallen. It was advance sleights and I haven't even perfected my double lift at that time yet.)</p>
              <p>TMH was my first exposure to magic. Their front really looked amazing, professional and stuff. You guys can guess what happened next.</p>
              <p>My point of saying this is, TMH will continue to thrive, as long as beginner have no way of sourcing out Magic shops. Their first exposure will be TMH and sooner or later, they would have spent quite some sum of money on that store. TMH is the top result if you google magic shop. Anyone can find and go to that place and become baits.</p>
              <p>We have to find a way to get this thread to the top too. We aren't targeting only to people who will research before buying. We are targetting beginners in magic, who will jump at their first chance to buy any magic stuff. Because their targetting them too.</p>
              <p>What about you guys? How did you guys get exposed to magic hall?</p>

              <p><br>Bro, not true. I just saw him in the shop yesterday.</p>
              <p>I showed one of my colleagues this forum and asked him if he wanted to visit the shop just to see see look look since our work place is nearby.</p>
              <p>So he went in while I waited around the corner.</p>
              <p>Guess how much solomon tried to sell my collaegue a bicycle deck?</p>
              <p>For your information, its a REGULAR RED BACKED bicycle deck...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>16 DOLLARS and 50 CENTS</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I told my colleague to pretend he knew nothing about magic and ask about different tricks. No doubt the truth is that my colleague indeed knows nothing about magic, he does know that a regular bicycle deck doesn't cost 16.50, cos I brought mine to the office before.</p>
              <p>But that's not the best part.</p>
              <p>I told my colleague to put more emphasis on the dvds as they are very much pirated.</p>
              <p>He asked solomon that if he were to buy the dvds, can they be burned so he can share the cost with a few friends and they can have a copy each to keep.</p>
              <p>Solomon said this is not advisable as it will infringe on copyrights(HAHAHA!!! JOKE OF THE DAY! INFRINGE ON COPYRIGHTS!!!)</p>
