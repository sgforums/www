              <p><br>Bro, not true. I just saw him in the shop yesterday.</p>
              <p>I showed one of my colleagues this forum and asked him if he wanted to visit the shop just to see see look look since our work place is nearby.</p>
              <p>So he went in while I waited around the corner.</p>
              <p>Guess how much solomon tried to sell my collaegue a bicycle deck?</p>
              <p>For your information, its a REGULAR RED BACKED bicycle deck...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>16 DOLLARS and 50 CENTS</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I told my colleague to pretend he knew nothing about magic and ask about different tricks. No doubt the truth is that my colleague indeed knows nothing about magic, he does know that a regular bicycle deck doesn't cost 16.50, cos I brought mine to the office before.</p>
              <p>But that's not the best part.</p>
              <p>I told my colleague to put more emphasis on the dvds as they are very much pirated.</p>
              <p>He asked solomon that if he were to buy the dvds, can they be burned so he can share the cost with a few friends and they can have a copy each to keep.</p>
              <p>Solomon said this is not advisable as it will infringe on copyrights(HAHAHA!!! JOKE OF THE DAY! INFRINGE ON COPYRIGHTS!!!)</p>

              <p>How come there's a breaking the magicians' code series banner on magic hall website?</p>
              <p>Is it because by doing this, they are supporting the masked magician on his campaign to destroy the art of magic?</p>
              <p>Or they are recording the series from tv and selling the pirated version of it? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>"Some" stuff there worth buying, many not worth buying... must know which to buy and which not... I also a fan of theirs, bought their cards... but now no because found lobang who sold at a very cheap price... But since late april I never buy their stuff already because they cheat... My friend told me he wanted to buy "Melting Point" from them but they said don't have and don't know what on earth is that but they can help us order. My friend rich kia ma.... can order and deliver to home but don't want and don't know why choose to let the shop order for him. So a week or 2, the good came and my friend went to collect. At first, he wasn't surprised in the first place. The seller (don't know his name) took out the instructional dvd and the gimmick and show it to him. The seller teached him how it was done and so and so forth. My friend song song think the seller kind enough to teach him. Until when he reached home, he realised that the parcel is supposed to be sealed and to be passed to my friend (goods assurance ma) but it didn't. So he kind of suspected when the parcel was delivered, the seller might open it and view the dvd at my friend's expense. "Maybe MHS can say how the pirated dvd came about" haha... Then my friend tried to buy another one from the same source and indeed it came with the same wrapping and what so ever... Indeed, he felt cheated...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is one at bugis... sell cheaper...<br><br>Recommend to buy online... Ship over... I now buy online because it's the same as buying from local magic shop. <br><br>TMH's de stuff expensive because they buy small quantity... They always buy from ellusionist de leh... ellusionist stuff also not cheap de lor...   </p>

              <p>Hello, I heard about this forum from quite a number of local magicians. Based on the number of years of active participation in the local magic industry, please allow me to share my views.</p>
              <p>Magic Hall was considered as the new 'in' place to be a few years ago.</p>
              <p>But their reputation quickly declined due to their unethical business direction.</p>
              <p>Not only are they spoiling the names of our other local magic establishment, they are practically destroying the amazing art of prestidigitation.</p>
              <p>No doubt many new local/foreign online stores are popping up on the internet, they can't be compared to a brick and mortar magic shop.</p>
              <p>Old school establishment like Ang House of Magic, Magic Castle, Uncle Charles Choo's shop as well as Magic Supreme not only provide props and gimmicks, but they are also always willing to share pointers, tips and advice to new young budding magicians.</p>
              <p>Even with fancy video demonstrations, creativity based website design or discounted merchandises(justified by almost non-existing overhead costs), these online stores will never be able to fulfil the needs and requirements in order to spread the art of magic.</p>
              <p>Magic is never about buying a trick just to find out the secret. It's about practicing and eventually perfecting it in order to able to perform the miracles that will in turn be even more graceful by incorporating one's style and presentation.</p>
              <p>You will never be a magician just by buying a magic product. And the person behind the website selling it to you will forever just be a salesman.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Magic Hall has lost its glory and respect. Internet Stores are dime a dozen. May I suggest, for anyone who really want to be a magician or even just learn a trick or two, do visit any of our local magic shops to feel a true sense of wonder.</p>
              <p>I promise you won't regret it.</p>

              <p>Based on what you've said, I'm pretty sure most local magicians know what's going on with magic hall.</p>
              <p>Just hope that newbies that just started in magic will find out soon enough to prevent themselves from being slaughtered.</p>

              <p>a few of my close friends attend the recent magic convention in malaysia early june.</p>
              <p>they were saying that the one of the main topics is a shop in singapore is spoiling market in the magic communtiy by cheating their customers.</p>
              <p>one of the rumours that there were no singapore magician taking part in the convention is because the asia magic community don't want any singapore magicians as part cos they are afraid that they are connected to the shop, then will spoil the image of magic in asia.</p>
              <p>wah lao, even the news of magic hall reach our neighbouring countries.</p>
              <p>so please, those who want to tell others they are magicians from singapore, also tell them you are not part of magic hall and totally disagree with their business tactic.</p>
              <p>if not, nobody will want to have anything to do with you.</p>

              <p>Few points to make:</p>
              <p>1. All of you should complain about the cheating to PS. leasing dept. They will sure to terminate their lease</p>
              <p>2. There was a guest perfomer from Singapore at the Malaysia magic festivals 2009.

              <p>3. They also have pirated DVD and wares problems there at the conventions. See link: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://forums.malaysiamagicfellowship.com/index.php?showtopic=2835&amp;amp;st=15">http://forums.malaysiamagicfellowship.com/index.php?showtopic=2835&amp;st=15</a></p>

              <p>1) Can i ask if you can make the complain on behalf of us?</p>
              <p>2) the guest performer was patrick wan. he is a dealer of magic, that's why he got a special spot to perform.</p>
              <p>3) selling pirated is no doubt not good...but people who buy them knows they are buying pirated...does the people who buy from magic hall know they are buying pirated and paying 5 dollars per dvd?</p>
              <p>4) magic botiqe sells original. so does the rest of the local magic shop except for magic hall. the catch? you wanna wait 1 month for your product? then go buy from botiqe.</p>

              </p><div class="im">(Content of this post has been approved by Yigal Mesika, creator of Tarantula.)</div>
              <div class="im"><br></div>
              <div class="im"> Hi all,<br><br>This post is about my story of
              purchasing a fake Tarantula and its purpose is to serve as a warning to
              those who are about to purchase, as well as a helpline for those who
              have purchased malfunctional Tarantulas.<br> <br>I purchased Tarantula from TMH and
              have since experienced many problems with it, including getting the
              basic function of the gimmick to even work properly. Many
              specifications were not met and the DVD casing had no manual in it. I
              tried testing the other Tarantula that the shop sold but both had the
              exact same faults.<br> <br></div>
              I was growing worried so I asked a few friends both local and
              overseas who got their Tarantula from various other sources to compare
              and see if they had the same problems and I discovered that it is only
              mine that has those problems. Also, there is a stark difference in the
              packaging that is used and the construction of the gimmick. I have
              since confrimed with Yigal Mesika that the Tarantula I have is a fake.
              <div class="im"><br> <br>Without revealing too much, I provide 2 images and the rest will be descriptions.<br></div>
              <div class="im"><br></div>
              <div class="im"><img src="http://i28.tinypic.com/108bb4p.jpg" alt="compare.jpg" width="639" height="345"><br>Firstly, compare the outer packaging. The one on the left is the one
              i bought from the shop and the one on the right is an original
              purchased directly from Ellusionist. In the one that I had, the box was
              significantly smaller in terms of height and the Tarantula on it was
              smaller as well. There was tape on the one I bought but not on the
              original.<br></div>
              <div class="im"><br></div>
              <div class="im"><img src="http://i25.tinypic.com/xldkpk.jpg" alt="compare2.jpg" width="640" height="480"><br>See the next comparison - the paper used to wrap the Tarantula and the
              paper. In the one I bought, the paper was folded with text facing
              outside while in the rest of the 5 Tarantulas my friends have shown me,
              the paper was folded with text facing inside. The paper used to wrap
              the Tarantula is also different from all the others which I have seen.
              According to a friend of mine, it's of cheaper, worse quality and is
              usually used to wrap fireworks in China.<br> <br>As for the construction of the gimmick itself - you should notice
              these features (or rather, deficiencies) if your Tarantula is fake -<br><br></div>
              1. Motherboard color (PCB where the battery is sitting)- Real Tarantula's should be black, fake's green.<br> 2. Motor's right wire color - Real Tarantula's should be black, fake's blue.<br>3 
              Switch colour - Real Tarantula's should be silver with a yellow cover
              for the switch's protection. The fake's silver with no protection for
              the switch.<br> 4. The stick switch - Real Tarantula's can be removed, fake's cannot be
              removed and so you won't be able to make your Tarantula shorter easily.<br>5.
              Invisible thread - Real Tarantula's invisible thread is 25ft long, much
              thinner and stronger. The fake's invisible thread is much shorter,
              slightly thicker but breaks very easily.<br> <br>If you are a victim of purchasing a fake Tarantula, Yigal Mesika would be most appreciative if you would contact him at <a href="mailto:support@mesikamagic.com">support@mesikamagic.com</a><p></p>

              <p>Hi, my name is Hock Tiong. Like many people who posted on this forum thread, I too, fell victim to this particular magic shop's scam.</p>
              <p>A few weeks ago, my son bought a couple of DVDs from this shop.</p>
              <p>Suspicious of the quality and authenticity of the DVDs, he approached friends as well as other magic shops to further investigate.</p>
              <p>His suspicions were confirmed days later after comparing a similar DVD title purchased by one of his friends from another magic shop.</p>
              <p>My son came to me and we proceeded down to magic hall to demand an explanation.</p>
              <p>The salesman denied everything that we threw at him and we had to leave the shop empty-handed, angered and frustrated.</p>
              <p>That was when I decided to take matters into my own hands.</p>
              <p>The following attachments were email dialogues between me and magic hall.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i29.tinypic.com/dxn0oo.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As you can see from their first reply, they didn't question me anything and quickly arranged to have the situation resolved as soon as I mentioned about the law.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i31.tinypic.com/aub1ip.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 2nd reply was an excuse that I personally think is nonsensical. I myself run a business that deals in the import export trade. Having knowledge of the contents of what we deal with is the lifeline of our business. If magic hall claims they don't open up their packages, isn't it the same as a drug dealer telling the police they didn't know they were carrying drugs?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i25.tinypic.com/verjfk.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i32.tinypic.com/1z4k0ls.jpg" alt="" width="1064" height="355"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i28.tinypic.com/30hvddj.jpg" alt="" width="968" height="287"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i26.tinypic.com/2jw4fp.jpg" alt="" width="1069" height="299"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Read their reply very carefully- "...so that I can trace back on that transaction and get the ORIGINAL pieces for you."</p>
              <p>Confessions from the horse's mouth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i26.tinypic.com/2cx6cd3.jpg" alt="" width="1052" height="317"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This reply really says it all. Reason why they kept pushing for the titles is because they needed to re-order from their suppliers, which most probably will take a few days to arrive.</p>
              <p>That means all the DVDs and maybe a lot more other products, everything in their shop are pirated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i29.tinypic.com/140jjiv.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the end, I managed to get back a total of S$1350 in refund and the 17 original DVDs will be arriving at my house via delivery from them in a few days time.</p>
