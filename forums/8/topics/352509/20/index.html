              <p>I made an order last week from Magic Castle's website. I paid non member price for it, but I still received superb service from them.</p>
              <p>Not only did it arrived within 4 days, they asked my permission if I wanted to open the package up so they can explain the whole thing to me.</p>
              <p>They took 30 mins to really explain in full details of the props as well as performance tactics. I really appreciate the effort they took to provide this after sales service.</p>
              <p>My advice to you guys is to join the membership, which I did right there and then. No doubt non-members will receive fantastic service still, but you get superb savings too.</p>
              <p>One last thing, collection from the shop itself is still the best. No collection fees and you have the best coaching you'll ever need.</p>
              <p>Go check out their faq and you'll know what I mean.</p>

              <p><br>My apologies. I mean no offence. What I thought was that since so many people had already been dubbed by them, might as well move on to a better outlet.</p>
              <p>I may not be able to put magic hall to task, so the least i can do is to share my good experience and hope everyone including those who are affected can find retreat at a much better place.</p>
              <p>I must make myself clear that I am not in anyway affliated with magic castle or its owner. I'm just sharing with you my experience, as are most people on this thread.</p>

              <p>I was a customer of magic hall many years ago. During the first few years of its operation, it was fantastic. Me and my friends used to go down almost everyday after school.</p>
              <p>Things started to change when kenneth hired solomon. That guy was arrogant and unfriendly. He was also very superficial and extremely impatient.</p>
              <p>Solomon was the one who started the whole piracy thing. Before he came, everything including tricks and dvds were all original.</p>
              <p>I don't know what solomon told kenneth, but kenneth fell into his trap. They started to pirate everything thing they could lay their hand on.</p>
              <p>Solomon is not a nice person. Please do not fall into his trap by taking his 'personalised' magic courses. He will teach you very very simple tricks and charge you sky-rocketed prices for them. He had been doing this behind kenneth's back for a long time.</p>
              <p>How I know? He asked me before and actually got me interested. But he said that we have to do it outside the shop and also to make full upfront payment by cash before anything.</p>
              <p>Kenneth, I really hope you are reading this. You shop was really good in the beginning. But I don't know why you allow solomon to do this to your shop.</p>
              <p>I will love it when one day, everything will be back to normal, where you stop cheating people and change everything back to originals.</p>
              <p>And please, this is the best advice for you. Sack solomon. Maybe you think without him, you won't survive. But let me tell you, with him around, he'll drag you down to hell faster.</p>

              <p>Going to the shop itself really makes a huge difference. I made an order through the magic castle website and went to collect. The website is super updated with all the latest things from around the world. They replied me within hours to tell me to collect the very next day cos they had it in stock!</p>
              <p>Even though it was not an expensive purchase, they're service really made me feel very good. I believe I'm progressing very well.</p>
              <p>Anybody who wants to progess in magic should really make a trip down. My best advice is to go down and experience the service yourself. You won't regret it!</p>

              <p><br>Hey, I'm happy for you man!</p>
              <p>Just to update, they are still selling pirated dvds. Someone bought a penguin magic dvd and it's still blue.</p>
              <p>If penguin is still blue, then i supposed every other dvd is.</p>
              <p>Penguin magic dvds are mostly for beginners. They sell these dvds to newbies who haven't found out about their bad cheating ways.</p>
              <p>We must continue to spread the word out more.</p>
              <p>Here's an idea. Its the holidays and i supposed a lot of people will be out looking for part-time jobs to earn some income.</p>
              <p>Might as well use their tactics to bite them back.</p>
              <p>Since magic hall don't issue receipts and god knows how many people they've cheated, I'm pretty sure they've got no way to trace.</p>
              <p>Even if they read this particular post, there's nothing they can do about it.</p>
              <p>For those of you who got cheated, just get some blank dvds, burn some material inside, colour copy the cover and go to tell and state that they sold you a pirated dvd.</p>
              <p>Since no questions asked during refunds, they'll give you the money straight.</p>
              <p>Burn a few more and claim a few more. Hey, that's a good way to make money right?</p>
              <p>Heck, even those who hadn't got cheated by them but sees this post can go try to make a few bucks too!</p>
