              <p>Attention Attention</p>
              <p>True case 1: For those people who interested to buy the DVD call  DAN and DAVE beware don't purchase for original price for those copy ones.</p>
              <p> Make sure that the DVD it's siliver like color from back and not purple. </p>
              <p> Just for sharing. Cos some people out there been rip-off before.</p>
              <p>Better ask for original before you buy. ( Apply to whatever product you want to buy )</p>
              <p>True case 2:  Recently my friend went down to Hall and ask for a magic product ( S$ 200 ) without delay he make the purchase. few days later we found this magic shop at shaw ( near bugis ) the product cost only ( S$ 150 ). what a difference my friend hammer himself a fews.</p>
              <p>Moral of the story: Check price between shops before making your purchase</p>

              <p>spoken to one of their customer who also kena left right up down centre that not only are the dvds pirated, apparantly, some or i would say most or even worst, all of their packet tricks are pirated.</p>
              <p>for instance, flow by paul harris, dvd is pirated and gimmick is also self-made.</p>
              <p>customer bought from magic hall 70 bucks and gimmick(can't say what lah...wait some cheapos go and make themselves!) is yellow in colour and looks like those can get from mama shop.</p>
              <p>then he found out from magic forums that the gimmick is actually black with paul harris name on it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This one is the ultimate of the ultimate...same customer told me that he saw a kid about 14 or 15 years old in magic hall asking how much is a particular trick he want to buy.</p>
              <p>solomon told him 80 bucks. kid says why so expensive?</p>

BULLS***! recently my boyfie wanna get some decks of cards and some tricks, but he's got no idea of where to get. he had want to try to go to shaw towers, but that 'soloman' says that the shop DO NOT EXIST ANYMORE!. but then he was told by other retailers that the shop stills opens. so he kinda try his luck to go to shaw towers, FUGG sia! the shop does EXIST! WTF!!.</p>
              <p>Nw hes a member of magic castle, and we've been there, and the service was FAR BETTER than soloman.</p>
              <p>The guy there was warm and sincere. if you wanna learned, be a member then he'll teached you like a real teacher.</p>
              <p>My friend told me that 'solomon' is actually SULAIMAN. hey isnt that a muslim name??and he claims he's a buddist. whattt..!!</p>
              <p>or who cares anyway.. its his problem and aint mine. jus avoid goin to magic hall.. let them go BONKERS.</p>

              <p>Hi Chocolatewinkle, yup, Solomon's real name is Sulaiman. He changed it to Solomon a couple of years back.</p>
              <p>I've been in the magic circle long enough to know that he actually used to work for magic castle in shaw towers.</p>
              <p>Imagine if he can tell you such things about his previous employer having already closed down when in fact, they're not, it proves certainly proves his intergrity, or the lack of it.</p>

              <p><br>Hi Jay, look, we probably were just off track for a moment. The fact of the matter is that close to 100% of the people here, no doubt are very new to this forum, were just voicing out their unhappiness about magic hall.</p>
              <p>All of us, and I'm not embarrassed to say, even me were clearly insulted by their despicable business ethics.</p>
              <p>I was being rough because as we were down there voicing our horrible experiences, someone just came in and took advantage of the situation to highlight/advertise another retailer.</p>
              <p>People complaining about sim lim don't want anyone to just come in and tell us to go to funan! Of course we know that there are other alternatives.</p>
              <p>We just want to share and hopefully, create an awareness about magic hall.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, between you and me, i hope we can just forgive, forget and move on.</p>
              <p>I apologise for my treatment towards you. I bear no grudge, and I hope you do not too.</p>
