              <div>(Content of this post has been approved by Yigal Mesika, creator of Tarantula.)</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div> Hi all,<br><br>This post is about my story of purchasing a fake Tarantula and its purpose is to serve as a warning to those who are about to purchase, as well as a helpline for those who have purchased malfunctional Tarantulas.<br><br>I purchased Tarantula from TMH and have since experienced many problems with it, including getting the basic function of the gimmick to even work properly. Many specifications were not met and the DVD casing had no manual in it. I tried testing the other Tarantula that the shop sold but both had the exact same faults.<br><br></div>
              <p>I was growing worried so I asked a few friends both local and overseas who got their Tarantula from various other sources to compare and see if they had the same problems and I discovered that it is only mine that has those problems. Also, there is a stark difference in the packaging that is used and the construction of the gimmick. I have since confrimed with Yigal Mesika that the Tarantula I have is a fake.</p>
              <div><br><br>Without revealing too much, I provide 2 images and the rest will be descriptions.<br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><img src="http://i28.tinypic.com/108bb4p.jpg" alt="compare.jpg" width="639" height="345"><br>Firstly, compare the outer packaging. The one on the left is the one i bought from the shop and the one on the right is an original purchased directly from Ellusionist. In the one that I had, the box was significantly smaller in terms of height and the Tarantula on it was smaller as well. There was tape on the one I bought but not on the original.<br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><img src="http://i25.tinypic.com/xldkpk.jpg" alt="compare2.jpg" width="640" height="480"><br>See the next comparison - the paper used to wrap the Tarantula and the paper. In the one I bought, the paper was folded with text facing outside while in the rest of the 5 Tarantulas my friends have shown me, the paper was folded with text facing inside. The paper used to wrap the Tarantula is also different from all the others which I have seen. According to a friend of mine, it's of cheaper, worse quality and is usually used to wrap fireworks in China.<br><br>As for the construction of the gimmick itself - you should notice these features (or rather, deficiencies) if your Tarantula is fake -<br><br></div>
              <p>1. Motherboard color (PCB where the battery is sitting)- Real Tarantula's should be black, fake's green.<br>2. Motor's right wire color - Real Tarantula's should be black, fake's blue.<br>3  Switch colour - Real Tarantula's should be silver with a yellow cover for the switch's protection. The fake's silver with no protection for the switch.<br>4. The stick switch - Real Tarantula's can be removed, fake's cannot be removed and so you won't be able to make your Tarantula shorter easily.<br>5. Invisible thread - Real Tarantula's invisible thread is 25ft long, much thinner and stronger. The fake's invisible thread is much shorter, slightly thicker but breaks very easily.<br><br>If you are a victim of purchasing a fake Tarantula, Yigal Mesika would be most appreciative if you would contact him at <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:support@mesikamagic.com">support@mesikamagic.com</a></p>

              <p><br>Dear Stardust.Love, thanks for the super input. I'm pretty sure after reading your post, many others will re-consider about buying not only dvds in magic hall, but any other things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seems like they've got sources to obtain replicated magic products and they are really out to sucker everyone on everything.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hi, my name is Hock Tiong. Like many people who posted on this forum thread, I too, fell victim to this particular magic shop's scam.</p>
              <p>A few weeks ago, my son bought a couple of DVDs from this shop.</p>
              <p>Suspicious of the quality and authenticity of the DVDs, he approached friends as well as other magic shops to further investigate.</p>
              <p>His suspicions were confirmed days later after comparing a similar DVD title purchased by one of his friends from another magic shop.</p>
              <p>My son came to me and we proceeded down to magic hall to demand an explanation.</p>
              <p>The salesman denied everything that we threw at him and we had to leave the shop empty-handed, angered and frustrated.</p>
              <p>That was when I decided to take matters into my own hands.</p>
              <p>The following attachments were email dialogues between me and magic hall.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i29.tinypic.com/dxn0oo.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As you can see from their first reply, they didn't question me anything and quickly arranged to have the situation resolved as soon as I mentioned about the law.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i31.tinypic.com/aub1ip.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 2nd reply was an excuse that I personally think is nonsensical. I myself run a business that deals in the import export trade. Having knowledge of the contents of what we deal with is the lifeline of our business. If magic hall claims they don't open up their packages, isn't it the same as a drug dealer telling the police they didn't know they were carrying drugs?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><img src="http://i26.tinypic.com/2jw4fp.jpg" alt="" width="1069" height="299"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Read their reply very carefully- "...so that I can trace back on that transaction and get the ORIGINAL pieces for you."</p>
              <p>Confessions from the horse's mouth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i26.tinypic.com/2cx6cd3.jpg" alt="" width="1052" height="317"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This reply really says it all. Reason why they kept pushing for the titles is because they needed to re-order from their suppliers, which most probably will take a few days to arrive.</p>
              <p>That means all the DVDs and maybe a lot more other products, everything in their shop are pirated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i29.tinypic.com/140jjiv.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the end, I managed to get back a total of S$1350 in refund and the 17 original DVDs will be arriving at my house via delivery from them in a few days time.</p>

              <p><br>Dear Hock Tiong, you and Stardust.Love really made my day.</p>
              <p>For months, many people from this thread have been doing all they could, providing information about magic hall and trying to prevent people from being cheated by them.</p>
              <p>Of course, I personally had my means and ways to gather information about them without me physically being there.</p>
              <p>But somehow or rather, there had been skeptics or maybe even supporters of theirs who had penetrated this thread and attempted to discredit our claims.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The moment I saw the posts made by you guys, I knew this was it. So much effort in creating awareness has finally paid up.</p>
              <p>Nothing speaks as clear as the evidence you have provided.</p>
              <p>As much as I'm hoping the authorities will clamp them down, I too, will try my luck in getting some of my money back before they close down. Because I believe they will.</p>

              <p><br>Its not as simple as just closing down. magic hall got contracts with the management. if they sign a one year lease, they will have to stay, regardless, unless they are willing to forfeit and pay damages.</p>
              <p>stardust.love, my i know if people from ellusionist are monitoring this forum or the shop? cos how would they know if they stop doing what they are doing?</p>
              <p>cos like what gambit said, i still see them selling their stuff on their website.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hi, my name is Hock Tiong. Like many people who posted on this forum thread, I too, fell victim to this particular magic shop's scam.</p>
              <p>A few weeks ago, my son bought a couple of DVDs from this shop.</p>
              <p>Suspicious of the quality and authenticity of the DVDs, he approached friends as well as other magic shops to further investigate.</p>
              <p>His suspicions were confirmed days later after comparing a similar DVD title purchased by one of his friends from another magic shop.</p>
              <p>My son came to me and we proceeded down to magic hall to demand an explanation.</p>
              <p>The salesman denied everything that we threw at him and we had to leave the shop empty-handed, angered and frustrated.</p>
              <p>That was when I decided to take matters into my own hands.</p>
              <p>The following attachments were email dialogues between me and magic hall.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i29.tinypic.com/dxn0oo.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As you can see from their first reply, they didn't question me anything and quickly arranged to have the situation resolved as soon as I mentioned about the law.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i31.tinypic.com/aub1ip.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 2nd reply was an excuse that I personally think is nonsensical. I myself run a business that deals in the import export trade. Having knowledge of the contents of what we deal with is the lifeline of our business. If magic hall claims they don't open up their packages, isn't it the same as a drug dealer telling the police they didn't know they were carrying drugs?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i25.tinypic.com/verjfk.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i28.tinypic.com/30hvddj.jpg" alt="" width="968" height="287"></p>

              <p><img src="http://i26.tinypic.com/2jw4fp.jpg" alt="" width="1069" height="299"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Read their reply very carefully- "...so that I can trace back on that transaction and get the ORIGINAL pieces for you."</p>
              <p>Confessions from the horse's mouth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i26.tinypic.com/2cx6cd3.jpg" alt="" width="1052" height="317"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This reply really says it all. Reason why they kept pushing for the titles is because they needed to re-order from their suppliers, which most probably will take a few days to arrive.</p>
              <p>That means all the DVDs and maybe a lot more other products, everything in their shop are pirated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i29.tinypic.com/140jjiv.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the end, I managed to get back a total of S$1350 in refund and the 17 original DVDs will be arriving at my house via delivery from them in a few days time.</p>

              <p>I went to Plaza Sing yesterday and met the chinese guy tending to the stall there. Showed me a couple of tricks, talk talk a bit, laugh laugh a bit then started on the topic of his boss.</p>
              <p>He told me he boss intend to sell the business off due to other personal commitments(Yeah right...).</p>
              <p>Business is very bad and the rent is killing. I told him in times like that, nothing is for sure. Better protect yourself before he kick you out!</p>
              <p>Funny enough, I found him to be quite a blunt fella. He was harmless and neutral. But to hire someone like him to work for you, better not reveal too much company information.</p>
              <p>Well, at least his is way better than the other malay demonstrator.</p>
              <p>Magic hall is up for grabs. Any offer?</p>
              <p>I think he may be selling the the two branches with all self-burnt dvds, self-made tarantulas, pirated china made tricks, evertyhing, for S$250/-</p>
              <p>If you negotiate well enough, maybe he'll let go at S$99/-</p>
              <p>Also in the package are fantastic securtity facilities- Police monitering of your goods and shop 24/7.</p>
              <p>Oh ya, there's a pet monkey included. Easy to maintain- Just feed shit to him 3 times a day.</p>
