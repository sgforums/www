              <p>ChingAlvin, if you've never crossed paths with the phrase 'Better late than never' then it's probably high time you stripped yourself of ignorance and googled it. Whether people gain awareness BEFORE or AFTER making purchases is of no issue as long as sales eventually comes to a halt. I doubt the thread was put up with intention of "making people feel even worst (i do supposed you mean <em>worse)" </em>as you claimed; it is inevitable for people to feel lousy having realized they've been cheated but once bitten, twice shy. (Maybe you could google this as well?) As long as this post has helped 1 consumer, it has served its purpose. But of course if you haven't already read for yourself it has helped plenty.</p>

              <p>Wth?! Deep freeze cold spray? I have the DVD frozen. Got it from another magic shop. It's not a cold spray, neither is it a spray that helps relief pain. It's actually a spray which is quite dangerous and unable to be used on body. They sell the gimmick? What kind of gimmick is that?!</p>

              <p>Wait. The topic we are discussing about is the Pirated DVD scam. Its not about bad service. If the problem is about bad service, i couldn't care less. However, as you should know, the DVDs being sold by that shop is pirated. They bought the actual DVD from america, at about 50+ sg dollars. What do they do? They BURN the DVDs and selling the copies for 70+ sg dollars.</p>
              <p>Let calculate the profit they earn, shall we?<br><br>DVD burners = 40+ dollars?<br>Blank DVDs (50) = $25, 50 cents for each Disk.<br>Computer = Not calculated<br>Original DVD = 50 dollars</p>
              <p>Total cost = $90.50 (For the first DVD. Following DVDs = 50 cents each)</p>
              <p>Profit for the second dvd sold = 2($70) - ($90.50 + 50) = $49. Following DVDs sold = +$ 69.50<br><br>They made a huge sum of profit by selling COPIES of the DVDs at the Price which they bought the DVDs. Maybe even more. This is unfair for the people who paid more than they needed for COPIES. The police won't help unless many people complain about the shop. Therefore, Before the Numbers of victims grow, we are trying to raise awareness to people who have not yet been victimized, citizens and Magicians alike.</p>
