              <p>I learnt the rubberband trick from solomon in magic hall. I paid 65 for it.</p>
              <p>Only after i came across this forum, i went to other magic shop in katong and they told me they charge only 25.</p>
              <p>I told solomon i'm a beginner and want to learn magic. So he taught me the rubberband trick. It was very amazing the first time i saw it, but it was a little bit expensive.</p>
              <p>After he persuade me, i told him ok. Never expect him to overcharge me like that.</p>
              <p>Come on man, 40 dollar difference is really a lot. Its not as it its 5 or 10 dollars more.</p>
              <p>And worst is he only teach me one move. When I went katong, i told the people there i learn this for 65 and they told me its too expensive. And they taught me more rubberband moves even though i never pay them anything. This is what i call service.</p>
              <p>I only learnt about the bad things they do after i found this forum. Please don't go magic hall again. If you want to buy any magic, best is go katong. The people there are really nice and helpful. They will guide you very well.</p>

              <p>Come on man, 40 dollar difference is really a lot. Its not as it its 5 or 10 dollars more.</p>
              <p>And worst is he only teach me one move. When I went katong, i told the people there i learn this for 65 and they told me its too expensive. And they taught me more rubberband moves even though i never pay them anything. This is what i call service.</p>
              <p>I only learnt about the bad things they do after i found this forum. Please don't go magic hall again. If you want to buy any magic, best is go katong. The people there are really nice and helpful. They will guide you very well.</p>

              <p>Solomon always give double pricing for his magic trick lessons. I know of this cos I used to patronise Magic Hall lot until the beginning of this year.</p>
              <p>I witnessed him charging $50-$70 per trick lesson to a beginner like yourself. For the same trick, I paid him only $35. I think its because he knows that I go to other magic shops too and he's afraid that I may leave Magic Hall if he charges to high.</p>
              <p>I've spoken to his boss Kenneth before and found out that all lessons are charged at only $35 per trick, regardless of who you are and your previous experiences.</p>
              <p>Its pretty obvious that Solomon may be pocketing the difference. Not surprising since he's already cheating other customers, might as well cheat his own boss too.</p>
              <p>Solomon is a despicable, shamless and cheap lowlife. I'm speaking from experience cos I've known him for many years ever since he used to work for Magic Castle, which he was sacked from for cheating the boss and trying to outrage the modesty of a female customer.</p>
              <p>He even cheated me countless times during the 4 years I've known him.</p>
              <p>Solomon, remember the times when we used to hang out at Clarke Quay? I'm pretty sure you know who I am.</p>
              <p>Remember what I told you the last time I saw you? What goes around comes around.</p>

              <p><br>Don't worry. I'm very sure solomon knows who i am. If he dares to deny the facts, he can call me and confront me.</p>
              <p>And if you look very carefully at my post, I mentioned that he was sacked for cheating his boss and "trying" to outrage the modesty of a female customer. It means he had the intention but the incident didn't occur.</p>
