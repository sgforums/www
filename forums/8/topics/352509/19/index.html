              <p><br>I followed your instructions and went to the magic shop at shaw towers.You're right, their service is very good. Apparently, even the taiwanese magician Liu Qian is a customer of theirs cos I saw a photo of him taken in the shop.The guy there told me they just launch their website and their prices for members are considered by many as one of the lowest in Singapore.Can I confirm this with some of you? Cos I want to join the membership, but I need to see what other's think about it first.</p>

              <p><br>Hi Patin, you won't regret joining the membership. I was cheated by magic hall also, but I found out about magic castle through this forum. I went there and and was very amazed to see so many magic stuff!</p>
              <p>Not only that, but the salesman was super helpful! He really put in a lot of effort to make sure we buy the correct things and the will always help to make sure we master the tricks.</p>
              <p>He told me that the website is for his customers who are busy to go to shop but can still buy the latest things. For me, I still think its best to go to the shop. In this way, he can speak to you and guide you more better.</p>
              <p>I have compared the prices from magic castle with other magic shop. The member price is really the lowest you can find! And not only that, if what you want is not in the shop, they will order and it arrives very very fast!</p>
              <p>After my bad experience from magic hall, i'm very happy i found magic castle. One of the testimonials from their website is even written by me! haha! felt very honoured! </p>

              <p>trying to change? sorry to disappoint you man...</p>
              <p>the truth is their not changing...new items like modern times are still pirate by them.</p>
              <p>if you know products quite well, you can see that the modern times made by them is made with a balloon....(if you know the secret)</p>
              <p>bottomline is, products that they make themselves, they sell it very close to US price, just to make people feel that they are selling very cheap.</p>
              <p>since they sell cheap right? tell them to sell coin bomber by johnny wong for 600 singapore dollars then.</p>
              <p>you already said they're old items still pirated, which means they are still selling to people.</p>
              <p>you call that changing?</p>

              <p>Hi guys, I've read throught quite a number of forums and also spoken to a lot of people. They all said almost the same thing as you.</p>
              <p>In the past, prices at magic castle was a lot higher than online shops, especially the magic babe ning magic boutique. Also that magic boutique you've gotta wait one month. Magic castle is at least still a shop, anything you need you can pop by and enquire.</p>
              <p>Now the way I see it is that magic castle really is taking good care of its members. Their prices are lower than magic boutique and you don't have to wait one month.</p>
              <p>I will take your advice and pop by the shop to sign the membership. Thanks guys!</p>

              <p>Hi guys, I've read throught quite a number of forums and also spoken to a lot of people. They all said almost the same thing as you.</p>
              <p>In the past, prices at magic castle was a lot higher than online shops, especially the magic babe ning magic boutique. Also that magic boutique you've gotta wait one month. Magic castle is at least still a shop, anything you need you can pop by and enquire.</p>
              <p>Now the way I see it is that magic castle really is taking good care of its members. Their prices are lower than magic boutique and you don't have to wait one month.</p>
              <p>I will take your advice and pop by the shop to sign the membership. Thanks guys!</p>

              <p><br>You should check out the website. They mentioned that every week, they'll have a product that members can buy at super low price, and it just started! I just saw it in the evening.</p>
              <p>The card through window that is supposed to be 190 dollars is not only 149 for members! That'a discount of 40 dollars!</p>
              <p>Where to find this kind of price!</p>

              <p>I made an order last week from Magic Castle's website. I paid non member price for it, but I still received superb service from them.</p>
              <p>Not only did it arrived within 4 days, they asked my permission if I wanted to open the package up so they can explain the whole thing to me.</p>
              <p>They took 30 mins to really explain in full details of the props as well as performance tactics. I really appreciate the effort they took to provide this after sales service.</p>
              <p>My advice to you guys is to join the membership, which I did right there and then. No doubt non-members will receive fantastic service still, but you get superb savings too.</p>
              <p>One last thing, collection from the shop itself is still the best. No collection fees and you have the best coaching you'll ever need.</p>
              <p>Go check out their faq and you'll know what I mean.</p>
