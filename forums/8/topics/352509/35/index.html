              <p>Hi Ray, unfortunately, like what frezman said, its very much illegal to own or possess an altered legal tender. It can be considered as vandalism if you are caught, so don't take the risk. Charges for vandalism includes caning!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>To Nerd- I'm sure a lot of people have made complaints to various goverment bodies like case, so far, nothing much has been done...yet...</p>
              <p>We do hope that the piracy and cheating can be stopped soon, but seems like they are still selling over priced pirated dvds and props, under table, to a lot of lay people. Flash gordon confirmed this recently.</p>
              <p>Also, anyone noticed if their branch in Vivo is closed? Cos I was there last weekend and they weren't there anymore. Maybe Vivo management chanced upon this forum and chased them out! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I didn't know that besides selling pirated dvds at original prices, magic hall is actually selling pirated dvds at even higher prices than original!</p>
              <p>I bought the coin dvd ponta the smith original version from castle at $54. Then last week I just pass by magic hall plaza sing and they selling the pirated version for $72!</p>

              <p>Yup, hall prices are really ridiculous. Not only are their dvds pirated, also almost all of their products are also.</p>
              <p>Castle has have a very good reputation, and their prices are also very affordable.</p>
              <p>Like tarantula, hall selling $165. Magic bougtique selling $120. Then magic castle selling only $88, member even lower at $78.</p>
              <p>That's why many people here recommend magic castle as the best place to buy their magic stuff.</p>

              <p>Anyone noticed how Ning's "new" and improved" website is so much similar to Castle's?</p>
              <p>And I'm pretty sure I read somewhere in her blog that "intellectual property should be respected"</p>
              <p>Tried looking for that blog post. Guess it got deleted.</p>
              <p>Don't believe me? Try googling "magic babe ning blog intellectual". For followers of her blog would be aware that she accused a local magic shop (she did not state the name of the shop) for "stealing" her intellectual property and layout and format of her previous website. It was posted on 18 July 2009.</p>
              <p>Now that her new website is up and it looks identical to Castle's. It's deleted.</p>
              <p>Clever whore.</p>
              <p> Interestingly, she mentioned she has a US warehouse. For crying out loud she just muthafarking orders her stuff from Murphy's who are her supplier. Warehouse in the states. Bullshit. If she can have a warehouse in the states and ship everything to Sg, why not set up shop and just sell straight. idiotic bitch</p>
              <p>Brick and mortar shops would still beat online shops hands down because a demonstrator is still required to answer the questions and enquiries of customers. Youtube can't answer questions regarding the trick.People wanna see how the trick is done live.</p>
              <p>And for goodness sake please put on some farking clothes. Magic is wholesome entertainment and a good hobby for a wide demographic which includes kids i.e. dean wong from 1 min of fame. And now you have a half naked slut posing-for -playboy pictures all over the website. What would people think?</p>
              <p>Wanna strip please go geylang BS or New Shanghai. At least still got tip $20.</p>

              <p>When JC Sum used to still have his Concept Magic office inside Roxy Square Katong, that was during the time when the local magic community had a lot of respect for him.</p>
              <p>JC was very determined to bring the local magic scene to the next level, and to be honest, he very well had achieved this goal.</p>
              <p>I can't say the same for Ning.</p>
              <p>As much as she is as driven as JC, she was never as polite, respectful and humble as he was.</p>
              <p>If you were to carefully read JC's writing (whether on blogs, websites or articles) as compared to Ning's, JC stresses a lot on the art of magic, where as Ning's are just accounts for her to express her ego, big time.</p>
              <p>How to properly perform magic, tips, history and the whole package. One can really learn more about magic after reading JC's writing. I myself thoroughly enjoyed reading about the history of magic in Singapore that started with the Great Wong.</p>
              <p>We can tell that JC really put in a lot of time and effort to dig up, compile and write such a brilliant article that will in turn allow the newer generations to know their roots.</p>
              <p>Ning, nobody respects you. Simply because you never respect anyone. And honestly, after looking at those sleezy pictures on your online shop, it just occured to me that you don't even have a tinge of dignity, intergrity and respect for yourself.</p>
              <p>Stop trying to boast about your life. Stop letting your huge ego climb over your head.</p>
              <p>You always said that you are the first female magician in Singapore, even putting down your own associate Adeline aka Kinetic Gal, by dupping her the SECOND female magician.</p>
              <p>When will you ever learn that David Coppefield wasn't the first magician as compared to the ancient Egyptians? It doesn't matter who's first. It only matters who's best.</p>
              <p>If I were a female, I would quickly take advantage of the market you created. Because I'm sure any girl out there can do a better job then you.</p>
              <p>When you come for the next IBM meeting, please be aware of who's looking at you. Because I can tell you right now, I'm speaking on behalf of more than three quarters of the IBM members who are utterly digusted by your presence.</p>
              <p>Last but not least, magic hall did illegal things to bring in money because they were desperate. You posted illicit pictures of yourself on your online shop and what? Hoping to bring in more customers? Just to earn more money?</p>
              <p>Whatever happen to your wanting to do your part by taking care of the local magic community? You take care of us by putting yourself down like that?</p>
              <p>We don't need you to take care of us. We need you to stop acting like a low life and bring magic to a whole new level of LOW in singapore.</p>
              <p>JC, we still respect you because you are who you are. Ning, don't bother. You are far worst and stink more than the spit on the ground.</p>

              <p>TS should just take the dvd he wants and walk out of the shop without paying. If he should be stopped for the theft, just tell them to report to the police lor............!</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>When JC Sum used to still have his Concept Magic office inside
              Roxy Square Katong, that was during the time when the local magic
              community had a lot of respect for him.</p>
              <p>JC was very determined to bring the local magic scene to the
              next level, and to be honest, he very well had achieved this
              goal.</p>
              <p>I can't say the same for Ning.</p>
              <p>As much as she is as driven as JC, she was never as polite,
              respectful and humble as he was.</p>
              <p>If you were to carefully read JC's writing (whether on blogs,
              websites or articles) as compared to Ning's, JC stresses a lot on
              the art of magic, where as Ning's are just accounts for her to
              express her ego, big time.</p>
              <p>How to properly perform magic, tips, history and the whole
              package. One can really learn more about magic after reading JC's
              writing. I myself thoroughly enjoyed reading about the history of
              magic in Singapore that started with the Great Wong.</p>
              <p>We can tell that JC really put in a lot of time and effort to
              dig up, compile and write such a brilliant article that will in
              turn allow the newer generations to know their roots.</p>
              <p>Ning, nobody respects you. Simply because you never respect
              anyone. And honestly, after looking at those sleezy pictures on
              your online shop, it just occured to me that you don't even have a
              tinge of dignity, intergrity and respect for yourself.</p>
              <p>Stop trying to boast about your life. Stop letting your huge ego
              climb over your head.</p>
              <p>You always said that you are the first female magician in
              Singapore, even putting down your own associate Adeline aka Kinetic
              Gal, by dupping her the SECOND female magician.</p>
              <p>When will you ever learn that David Coppefield wasn't the first
              magician as compared to the ancient Egyptians? It doesn't matter
              who's first. It only matters who's best.</p>
              <p>If I were a female, I would quickly take advantage of the market
              you created. Because I'm sure any girl out there can do a better
              job then you.</p>
              <p>When you come for the next IBM meeting, please be aware of who's
              looking at you. Because I can tell you right now, I'm speaking on
              behalf of more than three quarters of the IBM members who are
              utterly digusted by your presence.</p>
              <p>Last but not least, magic hall did illegal things to bring in
              money because they were desperate. You posted illicit pictures of
              yourself on your online shop and what? Hoping to bring in more
              customers? Just to earn more money?</p>
              <p>Whatever happen to your wanting to do your part by taking care
              of the local magic community? You take care of us by putting
              yourself down like that?</p>
              <p>We don't need you to take care of us. We need you to stop acting
              like a low life and bring magic to a whole new level of LOW in
              singapore.</p>
              <p>JC, we still respect you because you are who you are. Ning,
              don't bother. You are far worst and stink more than the spit on the
              ground.</p>

              <p>Well said. </p>
              <p>And let me remind everyone that magicslut Ning is not the first female professional magician. It's Priscilla Khong, together with her father Lawrence Khong. </p>
              <p>She was featured in papers, shows, radio talkshows and theatre works way longer before magicslut ning knew how to look like a retard trying to do a straitjacket escape.</p>
              <p>Plus everyone in the local magic circle knows your close up sucks. </p>

              <p>totally agree she muz be realli despo to the max to post half naked photos of heself all over her website! but I dun think paster khong and his daughter are professionals that's why media allow that ning to call herself sg first professional female magician. media not so stupid what, if not later kenna sue how. i read this ning's wiki "discussion" page and there got pple talk abt this also. damn cheem, but i think got sense there.<br><br>    I do admire young talents, particularly a beauty like her. However, a whole bulk of information provided in this Wikipedia page of hers can be easily discredited. Everything is wither misinformed or ill-conceptualized in publicity. She's nowhere near "the first professional female magician" in Singapore when there's already someone else who has reached those grounds long before the name Ning even pops out in the local magic scene. Go do a research on "Magic of Love" and "Magic of Lawrence &amp; Priscilla" on the internet and you will see why Ning's PR team should be utterly embarrassed of itself. Do these publicists even track the magic scene? Sex sells, doesn't it? —Preceding unsigned comment added by 218.186.9.238 (talk) 02:34, 20 January 2010 (UTC)<br><br>    What is the "whole bulk of information" that can be discredited? Wiki requires proper referencing which seems to have been done unless all the references made are incorrect? So are you discrediting all the references as in accurate because many of the references are reputable media outlets? The key contention of "First Professional Female Magician" seems to be "professional". The fore-mentioned "Magic of Lawrence &amp; Priscilla" refers to Senior Pastor Lawrence Khong &amp; his daughter who perform magic as an evangilism tool for their mega church Faith Baptist Community Church and not on a full-time professional basis. Priscilla might have been Singapore's first female magician but not professional, whose occupation and living is derived from being a magician.TulipsInShoes (talk) —Preceding undated comment added 16:41, 2 July 2010 (UTC).<br><br>then can also read from pastor khong's wiki they are really doing it for church lah. very long lah, you want can go his wiki page read (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Khong).<br><br> so okay lah, give it to ning. sg first professional female magician watever. but those photos over despo liao.<br><br> <br></p>

              <p>I found this post in a forum-</p>
              <p>I would like to share my experience with fellow Magicians of what i have encountered a few days back.<br><br>I was at the concorde's branch magic hall and i witnessed a group of youngsters raising their voices at the salesman, demanding for refunds; insisting the DVDs and items are pirated.<br><br>I was curious, i went nearer to them and pretended to look around, i overheard about the salesman saying whatever they are selling are original and approved by the MDA. It was quite a scene for around 15minutes till i saw the salesman refunded some money to the youngsters, but refused to refund on the DVD.<br><br>Those youngsters even spoke to the boss of the magic hall through their shop's phone dialed by the salesman. But i guess the magic hall is quite firm about not refunding the DVD.<br><br>Shortly after the youngsters called for the police, the salesman requested the youngsters to get out of the shop as he needed the gents. He locked his shop and headed for the toilet. I was camping outside and to my surprise the police came much faster than what i've expected. The salesman has not returned and the police were interviewing the youngsters. <br><br><br>And the funny thing is, the police together with the youngsters waited for the salesman to return! I thought the salesman chickened out but he did came back.<br><br>I was outside the shop and i saw the salesman refunded the youngsters money for the DVD under the police presence. The youngsters left happily with their money refunded and left the salesman behind with the Police. I stayed behind and watched how the police took the salesman's particulars and throwing him lots of questions.<br><br>I didn't have sufficient time that day and this is how much i can share.<br>___________________________________________________________-</p>
              <p>I found out that magic hall is using mda as a tool to prove that they are selling originals, but that's not really the case.</p>
              <p>I believe mda has stickers on the dvds that have been approved for sales. If they are telling me that mda approved copied or pirated dvds for sale, it is impossible.</p>
              <p>Only possibility is that magic hall is either forging the stickers from mda and sticking them onto their pirated dvds( not difficult considering that all they gotta do is go to any cd or dvd shop, buy an original movie dvd, scan the sticker and have it printed in mass).</p>
              <p>What they are doing now is not just piracy, which happens to be a criminal offence that carries a mandatory jail sentence, they are dealing in forgery.</p>
              <p>They've already been selling gimmicked singapore coin magic tricks which requires the alteration of Singapore's legal tender. And they are now forging government documentation in the form of mda's sticker.</p>
              <p>Now that the police are aware, their time is near.</p>
              <p>They are definitely heading towards their own end very very soon, which in this case, at least a few months in Changi prison.</p>
