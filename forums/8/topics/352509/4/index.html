              <p>Don't worry, we may not see it, but I believed this thread has done some good for the public, to people who might have been potential victims to magic hall's unethical business ways,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As long as magic hall continues doing this, we'll be here every single day to rely the truth to the public.</p>

              <p>But seriously, I really hate people with attitude. I always boycotte these shops and refuse to buy anything from them, I'll just go in walk-walk to annoy them more. Some hawker centers are also like this, as thought they don't want to do business like that...</p>
