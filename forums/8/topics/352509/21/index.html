              <p>Hehe. I thought of that. But i think they can remember the dvds they
              sell cuz i doubt turnover is high. Also the image quality on the disc
              and the cover is difficult to emulate</p>

              <p>I went to Magic hall last week. The indian magician working there isÂ very rude! He keep pushing me to buy dvd even though i just want to buy decks. Now I know why. Didn't know they sell not originals!</p>
              <p>Basket, I was looking aorund and he dare to tell me see for 5 mins already still not enough ah?</p>
              <p>Lucky he is such a prick that I left. If not, he might have sold me some pirated things!</p>
              <p>Arrogant dick! Like that want to do business! Claimed to be the biggest magic shop in Singapore some more!</p>
              <p>Bullshit service and attitude!</p>
