              <p>I would like to share my own experience with the shop magic hall.</p>
              <p>About a month ago, my nephew showed me this trick where he levitates a coin he had borrowed from me. After asking him where he got it from, he told me he paid $165.00 for the trick called The Tarantula from a shop in Plaza Singapura call The Magic hall.</p>
              <p>2 weeks later, my husband and I were walking around town and we chanced upon another different magic shop. We were thinking that since my newphew loves magic so much, we decided to buy him a trick for his birthday at the end of November.</p>
              <p>After our purchase, I was just telling the salesperson that my nephew had bought this levitating trick for $165.00.</p>
              <p>It was only then that the salesperson told me that they are selling the exact same trick for less than half the price!</p>
              <p>I was really shocked and disgusted when I found out that not only this particular trick was over-priced, there were a lot more magic tricks that are being sold at The Magic hall for more than 2 to 3 times the price you can find elsewhere!</p>
              <p>I guess we were just too naive to think that these kind of incidents will not be found outside Sim Lim Square or Lucky Plaza.</p>
              <p>No doubt my nephew and I should have done more homework finding out what's the market retail prices for these items, I still do not condone such acts from The Magic hall.</p>
              <p>So to all parents out there whos' children like magic, please do more research before commiting to any purchases.</p>
              <p>And stay away from Magic hall.</p>

              <p>Hi Teo, we all understand your plight. In fact, just a few posts prior to yours, we were talking about magic hall selling some playing cards for $140+ while the exact same cards can be found in other shops for only $22+. That's a really huge difference.</p>
              <p>If your nephew wants to buy more magic stuff, you can bring him to this shop call magic castle at the old cathay building. Their prices are really good and their service is excellent.</p>
              <p>Even though the shop names sound similar, they are not related to each other.</p>
