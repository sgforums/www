              <p>brothers, i'm no hero. When i started this thread, i only have one thing on my mind, to ask for advice on what to do when kena cheated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I never thought that this thread will be what it is today. i think we are really doing a very good job warning people of how f*cked up magic hall is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i never want to bring down their reputation. They brought it down by themselves doing what they are doing. I just help to spread the word out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You guys know what? don't even have to go to stomp. All the sucky truth about magic hall and the dancing monkey attracts attention by itself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People who read this thread and watch the video knows that they are really making a fool out of themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No doubt people do complain about the online boutique magic and how their service sucks, this thread is about magic hall. whether the online shop sucks or not, i don't know cos i never buy things from there before.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I only know that a lot of people don't don't like the service from the online shop and also cos magic is very different from anything, you can't just buy it from the internet, cos it always better to have someone to talk to you can trust.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>don't worry brothers, as long as magic hall still sucks, i will continue to keep this thread alive. but i doubt they'll improve anytime soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you guys so much for contributing too...keep the posts coming man!</p>

              <p>No need rocket science to do piracy ah.</p>

              <p>Like someone mentioned, if they sell at pirated prices, maybe they will not get into so much trouble.</p>

              <p><br>I think those decks are losuy quality that failed the qc test at the bicycle factory, that's why they sell it a lot more cheaper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Magic hall sells these low quality cards at normal prices. If you compare those bought from magic hall to those from other shops, you'll definitely notice a difference in texture and look.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cos I bought a deck from plaza sing the other time together with the stupid pirated dvd (that was before I found out about this thread) and I have an original one which I bought from magic castle in shaw towers. Totally different...</p>
              <p> </p>
