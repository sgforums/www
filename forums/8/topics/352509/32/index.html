              <p>Just a piece of advice to you guys, you might wanna check out The Shufflers.</p>
              <p>It's a Singapore card blog shop, selling all sorts of cards, as well as some magic props.</p>
              <p>They have close-up mats, all sorts of decks (including invisible and gaffs), DVDs, even limited edition decks (eg. smoke and mirror 2nd edition). Best of all, everything is really cheap.</p>
              <p>For eg. there was a promotion some time back, where I got an Arcane deck for just SGD $10. Arcanes are now just $12, most places outside selling about $16? Mental photography deck used to be just $13 including the DVD (but it's out of stock for now). Their close-up pads are just $20 as well (though I'm not sure what brand they are).</p>
              <p>I've already purchased a couple of decks from them in the past, and you have the option of either Cash-on-delivery or request for home delivery after paying through bank account.</p>
              <p>The URL is here: http://www.the-shufflers.com</p>
              <p>It's impossible to prove this, but I'm not a staff at The Shufflers, I'm just a very satisfied customer, as their prices are REALLY low. In fact it hasn't been updated in awhile because the owners are kinda busy with other stuff. It was just updated not long after CNY though. Hopefully there'll be more updates soon :D</p>

              <p>I heard from some deck collectors that even their overpriced
              deck they bought from magic hall feels quite weird to the

              <p><br>I'm sure there are some people here who tried doing that. Or else, most of the them who got cheated are students or children who doesn't have the kind of resources to bring this case up.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, I'm sure one fine day, hall's luck will run out. It's not IF, it's WHEN. It will also be HOW LONG, not HOW MUCH, in comparisonÂ to a jail term rather than a fine.</p>

              <p>there is some news circulating among the magic community that came from a reliable source.</p>
              <p>The authoritiesÂ has been monitoring magic hall for at least a month. The officers from intellectual property branch has been sending undercover officers to purchase products from magic hall and also has been in contact with various magic community members local as well as magic production houses from USA to verify the authencity of the products.</p>
              <p>they say this news came from very reputable members from the magic circle in singapore.</p>
              <p>Whether or not it's true, that i'm not sure. but it's good to know that 99% of the local magicians know what hall is up to. Hope more beginners will find this forum and know the truth too.</p>
