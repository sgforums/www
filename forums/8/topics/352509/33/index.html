              <p>there is some news circulating among the magic community that came from a reliable source.</p>
              <p>The authorities has been monitoring magic hall for at least a month. The officers from intellectual property branch has been sending undercover officers to purchase products from magic hall and also has been in contact with various magic community members local as well as magic production houses from USA to verify the authencity of the products.</p>
              <p>they say this news came from very reputable members from the magic circle in singapore.</p>
              <p>Whether or not it's true, that i'm not sure. but it's good to know that 99% of the local magicians know what hall is up to. Hope more beginners will find this forum and know the truth too.</p>

              <p>Hind time huh...i hope the police will crack the case and make magic hall close shop once and for all.</p>

              <p>I couldn't agree with you any less. I'm not really a coin magician, but the member prices are so cheap at magic castle that I couldn't resist buying the scotch and soda, for ONLY $22!</p>
              <p>And I bought the david copperfield misled trick also, for only $19!</p>
              <p>And best of all, they are all original, no pirated or homemade nonsense! For those who are really serious about magic, the membership at magic castle is nothing less than a life saver!</p>

              <p>Hall overpricing every single thing is nothing new. In fact, I think 90% of the magicians in Singapore knows that they are selling OVERPRICED PIRATED products.</p>
              <p>I totally agree with you wonderboy, magic castle's prices are so tempting that I just couldn't resist joining their membership.</p>
              <p>The good thing is that even thought hall has damaged the reputation of magic in Singapore, there are always people like magic castle will pick up the pieces and salvage whatever it is to please those in need.</p>

              <p>My my... so much anger towards Magic Hall and it's demonstrator. Seems like a smear campaign.</p>
              <p>I see not a single negative remark about Magic Castle which does lead me to wonder if all these posts are just a way of making a competitor look bad.</p>
              <p>I personally know Solomon for 8 years and he's not arrogant and he's a great teacher. Patient and a funny guy too. Nobody complained about him during the 5 years he worked at Magic Castle, so why now? Because he works at a competing magic shop?</p>
              <p>Speaking of piracy, I used to be a customer of Magic Castle for around 8 years. The wonderful, Jay, sold pirated VHS tapes for years at 20 bucks a pop. Nobody said anything then. That probably makes him one of the pioneers of piracy in the magic circle. Magic Hall is a new player in town. It doesn't make them less guilty, but it doesn't make them more guilty either.</p>
              <p>Let's stop bitching about prices and piracy and other bullshit. If something is cheaper at one shop, then by all means go there. You don't complain here if a tv at Courts is cheaper than one at Harvey Norman. So cut the crap.</p>
              <p>Visit both shops and decide on your own... and last but not least, Wonderful Boy and alot of the other personnas could probably just be the same person with different accounts... with alot of time on their hands... and with something to gain by putting Magic Hall down. I know who you are... You know who I am... and we both know I'm on to you... So stop your nonsense.</p>

              <p>Wow,</p>
              <p>Hey guys looks like there is a new guy in here supporting magic hall.</p>
              <p>We don't know about magic castle if they sold any pirated VHS tapes back then. AT LEAST they don't sell it NOW like hall.. So if you are unhappy about what you see here then don't come in to read all the 'crap'. Bought from hall before. Still selling pirated stuff at way high prices. Maybe if hall change to sell real authentic products, this thread will be stopped. Then maybe we will stop your so called 'nonsense' in here.</p>
              <p>Oh, and about castle,if they are selling pirated stuff, a new thread might be started too. Its just for others to be aware that there is a place selling pirated magic products.</p>
              <p>Please dont come in to read for your own sake. Thanks</p>

              <p>I think that there's no bad remark about magic castle because there is nothing bad to remark about them.</p>
              <p>If you think I'm bias towards magic castle, I can tell you I really am. Why? Because they offer good pricing, good advise and good service.</p>
              <p>Like you said, go both shops and you'll know the difference. I've been to both, so I'm sharing with others what I think are the major difference. Magic hall sells pirated products, over priced and their service is very bad.</p>
              <p>Archand, you don't seem to complain about magic hall selling pirated products at original prices. It only makes other readers wonder why. No one of the right mind will not be bothered being cheated like that by them.</p>
              <p>Since I can admit I'm bias towards magic castle, don't you think you should admit being bias towards magic hall just because you knew solomon for 8 years? Does that justify you shooting at people like us who got cheated paying $80 for a pirated dvd? Or me paying $65 to learn the linking rubberband trick?</p>

              <p>Honestly, you make yourself sound rather like solomon, no offence. Hope you understand that people here have been cheated by magic hall and also a lot have found magic castle to be a good place. That's why they are just sharing their pointers.</p>

              <p>OoooOOoOOoOoooooo.... I'm a persona. So are you.</p>
              <p>Firstly, the majority of the complains towards your "friend" is the bad attitude and service he gives towards newcomers to magic. You look like you got cash he smile at you and try to con your money.  Look like a poor poly student, he don't give 2 shits about you.</p>
              <p>You sure that he had received no complains when he was working in Castle back in the days? Any idea how much money he pocketed while working there by jacking up the price of a in-house trick? Or using the shop's props and stuff to film for his own purposes? Seen that "magic" of solomon vid? If he's that good or honest a person, why is he working at Hall instead of Castle? </p>
              <p>Realise that this thread has never make much fun of the ah tiong working at the  PS branch but rather your "friend", simply because alot of people can tell, though the ah tiong may be a noob in magic, he's provides a MUCH more friendlier service than your "friend".</p>
              <p>VHS tapes? Or crying out loud that 8 years ago the common used video format/platform was VCDs before we turnt into a DVD era. Magic tapes at 20 a pop. What are you gonna use to watch it with? I see it as more of a clearance sale. What's wrong with that?</p>
              <p>Fact is this, no matter what happens in the past, as long as someone change, we'll put it all behind us. But as more awareness has been generated from this forum, Hall is still sticking by their dishonest ways and continuing to scam newcomers and prevent the proper growth of future magic ethusiasts and hobbist. Magic is just trying to hardsell your pirated products. Proper guidance and recommendation to proper material is needed and that's the service that I get at MAGIC CASTLE. not muthafarking MAGIC HALL.</p>
              <p>Sound hardcore all you want. I know a couple of people from this forum personally and WE can ENSURE you that WE are not multiple personas of a same person. WE are a united bunch of PISSED OFF ex- CUSTOMERS of that f**ked up place called Magic Hall.</p>

              <p>magic hall doesn't issue receipts for their sales, so guys, please be careful. I'm sure those who bought and got cheated and finally found this forum may be too late to go back for a receipt.</p>
              <p>But you can always use those people who got their refunds as a good example, just be tactful and don't let them push you around.</p>
              <p>Remember, YOUR money is at stake. Either you get it back and spend it on yourself, or idiots like magic hall will be happily spending YOUR hard-earned money.</p>
