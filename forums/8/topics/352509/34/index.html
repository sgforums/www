              <p>Has anyone ordered from card freaks b4? If so, may i know is it good? In case you dont know what i am talking about, this is the website <a rel="nofollow" href="http://card-freaks.blogspot.com/">http://card-freaks.blogspot.com/</a> .

              <p><br>i buy from them before. at first is not bad, then after buying from them few times,. i noticed their deck always come in not very good condition and the printing on some is off line.</p>
              <p>After those few times i tried to ask for refunds and they won't want to give me.</p>
              <p>This happen not only to me, but also a few of my friends. so at first i thought i very sway, but it turns out i think the cards they carry is either rejected stock or maybe even no original.</p>
              <p>this is my personal and honest experience opinion. I rather buy from shops cos at least when i see and hold, i know what i'm paying for. If you want cheap, then take the risk and get lousy goods. If you can afford, go buy from shops better.</p>
              <p>if you ask me i would recommend, i won't.</p>

              <p>Saw on the local magic forum that there's a new magic shop in tampines mall.</p>
              <p>Went to check it out since it's near my place.</p>
              <p>Small shop, nothing much, got a group of youngsters hanging around.</p>
              <p>That's not the big news.</p>
              <p>Guess who I saw there? Non other than our friend, the owner of the ill-reputed Magic Hall, Kenneth.</p>

              <p>hi all,</p>
              <p>i personally have been a customer for magic hall. and as far as i know, the shop at tampines mall have just been opened for 2 weeks.. coz the shop keeper there tells me tat he knows kenneth..so most probably could be his shop..</p>

              <p>I didn't see the name, but the shop itself is nothing substantial. Nothing much to offer.</p>
              <p>Maybe just like how the other branches of magic hall operates, you pretend to be a newbie then they will take out the pirated dvds from under the counter and try to sell you. Because they know seasoned people know about their bad reputation. Only newbies have no clue.</p>
              <p>If the shopkeeper knows kenneth, then he should warn others about what hall is doing. If he doesn't say anything, then it's obvious that he works for kenneth.</p>

              <p>wow!! wow!! lots of people are complaining about TheMagicHall.  I'm also one of the guys like you all. I realiazed that the magic hall made the gimmick theirselves till i bought the ring flight. i paid $50 dollar for ring flight which is just the modified coin potch and a reel. You can buy coin potch for $1.5 and reel for $1 at local $1 shop. The day I bought I found something fishy cos Solomon asked me money first. Then I said I would pay. He was like not so happy.. end up i paid and then when I saw the Ring Flight gimmick , I was like F***. No wonder he asked me money first. The ring flight was not the one i saw on their web.. I stop buying there after that. They are really targeting to newbies.. I bought a few items from them.. So guys spread this to your friend not to get cheated by TheMagicHall.</p>

              <p>That's what i initially thought also, cos when i went to plaza sing, i don't see their pirated dvds being displayed.</p>
              <p>But I pretended to be new in magic and that's when they took out their pirated version of the dan dave dvd for me.</p>
              <p>Come on man, dan dave dvd comes in paper sleeve, not plastic covers. And I told them I'm new, so how can they sell me dan dave dvd?</p>
              <p>So apparently, they still don't care about customers and still doing piracy. They are going for the new people in magic that don't suspect anything.</p>
