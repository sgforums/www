              <p><br>Erm, i will advise to buy a dvd and learn it from the dvd. Learning a magic trick from magic shop is quite ex as times goes by. Most of the local magician learn it from DVD or books.</p>

              <p> Is safe, if you are still worried you can do a COD with them, that means meet them and collect the stuff and hand them the money lor. I will recommed you buy Decks and dvd from blogshop although they don't carry all of them as much as magic shop but they are cheaper. You can send an e-mail to them and ask what kind of dvd or decks they carry.  Go and visit <a href="http://www.the-shufflers.blogspot">www.the-shufflers.blogspot</a>. or <a href="http://www.cardhigh.blogspot">www.cardhigh.blogspot</a>( for cardhigh he can help order dvd for you  just send him an e-mail  and ask he do have it ornot quite a friendly guy).</p>

              <p><br>Yup, I totally agree...the best thing about blogshops are the prices. Without the need to pay rental, staff and bills, they can then transfer their savings over to their products so that consumers like us can enjoy them.</p>
              <p>On second thoughts, more often than not, blogshops don't really offer the range unlike physical magic shops. We are pretty much limited to buying only products that they import based on their popularity.</p>
              <p>Of course, they do offer us an option to bring in products that they don't offer but only when a customer orders and will eventually have to wait slightly more than 2 weeks to a month to receive them.</p>
              <p>Blogshops offer us more by giving us alternatives to where to get the best things at the best prices.</p>
              <p>Besides that, true service can only be experienced at a physical magic shop.</p>
              <p>I patronise both physical and virtual magic shops. Good physical magic shops have fantastic service and knowledgeable personnel to advice me in what is most suitable to buy and areas to work on in order to present an entertaining performance. Also, going to a magic shop is a magical experience by itself. You are well surrounded by toys that us grown ups may have long forgotten to love. Not knowing what new tricks you're going to see, the sense of awe and of course, the exchange of thoughts and ideas with other people who share your passion! Blogshops can't offer that.</p>
              <p>But of course, due to the physical attributes that surrounds a physical shop, prices of products can't be lowered to an extent similar to those of a blogshop.</p>
              <p>Currently there is non in Singapore, but if someone can offer the perks of a physical shop as well the product prices of a blogshop, I would consider that the ultimate success.</p>

              <p><br>In business, there are endless possibilities. Cheap may not always mean its lousy. Why is breadtalk so successful? Why was sakae sushi such a hit when it first hit the market? (I mentioned when it first hit the market cos now the standard a bit dropped)</p>
              <p>These businessmen know that their products are good and people will definitely win the hearts of people. So instead of taking advantage of their monopoly and charging sky high prices, they combined the basic keypoints of a business- cheap and good.</p>
              <p>They'd rather earn lesser per product, but by doing so, more people will buy, and thus, creates mass quantity sales for them.</p>
              <p>So what I'm trying to say is, magic shop don't have to bring in cheap and lousy products. They just have to earn lesser per product so that more people will buy more, and in the end, more sales for the owner.</p>
