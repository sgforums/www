              <p>its not that i wanna say such things about them.</p>
              <p>But you put yourself in my place, when i approached them about their pirated dvds, you have got no idea what they said and they way they said it.</p>
              <p>at first, solomon denied about the dvds. then after when i kept inisting, he simply said- you have already bought. there is nothing else you can do. we don't entertain refunds. so what if they are pirated? go and call police ah...</p>
              <p>will your blood boil when someone talks to you like that?</p>

              <p>Cool men, dunno worry, we take note of his shop and spread the news for you. I think reporting to the police is of no use, so is to case, those are lazy bums, they simply ask you to write a report and then said they will get back to you, but damn, they always never get back to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is 3 ways to get them, either thru the media, call up shin min, today or newspaper, like the newton hawker cheating and sim lim conning cases, make it a national news, they like to hear from you. The other ways is by nets spreading and finally, write or email to IP agencies in Singapore.</p>

              <p>i think everyone is entitled to their opinion. :) magic boutique was at magic day and items were being sold at a discount. and the discount i think was large. *shocked face* i didnt buy anything la cause there to follow my friend only. and not that interested.. haa. so i suppose if you went there, then, the waiting time wont be an issue. :X besides, there's penguin magic or ellusionist I think available if you google to search. thats what i got by google.</p>
              <p>anyway, back to topic, if you really dont like a shop. dont go there lor. simple. and if you are really distrubed by pirates, just report to police lor. then just ask what police will do.</p>

              <p>Please don't take us as fools...magic hall is already doing that to us, don't be the second one.</p>
              <p>As you can see from this<a href="/users/251891/posts"> link</a>, posting non-credible comments to increase your number of post is one lame way to capture attention.</p>
              <p>I've got nothing against most people here, but to people who think they can insult our intelligience, please seriously re-consider.</p>
              <p>Since you mentioned about your online shop, let me give you my personal comments.</p>
              <p>I'm going to be very very impartial in this.</p>
              <p>Good points-</p>
              <p>Your site is well up to date with products.</p>
              <p>Prices are relatively more affordable than a lot of places.</p>
              <p>Being an online shop, you give people the comfort of having their items sent to their houses.</p>
              <p>I would say that with the number of articles you guys are featured in, your credibitlity speaks for itself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now for the bad points, which unfortunately are based on your good ones. Its a double edged sword.</p>
              <p>Anyone can update a website in minutes. Complete descriptions as well as videos being taken from actual sites which retail the particular products and youtube is not rocket-science.</p>
              <p>With bulk purchases being done once a month, anyone can obtain wholesale or distribution prices from one of the many magic suppliers in the states.</p>
              <p>This theory has been in the process for at least 8 years. It is call MO, or Mass Order. If you were to visit other threads in this forum, you will see many members offering mass orders for popular products that can't be found in the local market.</p>
              <p>What they get to enjoy are bulk purchase discounts and shipping rates are shared.</p>
              <p>Shopping online definitely has it perks, but not really in Singapore. Singapore's size is the biggest strength of brick and mortar physical shops. Anyone wants to get anything specialised, they don't have to travel 5 hours to get it.</p>
              <p>Army market for supplies, Sim Lim for Computers and Far East for accessories, how difficult can it get? Waiting time is also one big factor, and as for your case, it may be your downfall.</p>
              <p>You really expect people to pay first, then wait weeks for something which they can get on the day itself at a local shop? And the perks? You get to save only a few dollars more. Go figure.</p>
              <p>Last but not least, your credibility. You guys are semi-pro magicians. Would someone buy clothes from a model wearing them, or the designer who made them?</p>
              <p>Your website markets your ownselves and your shows. The online shop very clearly indicates that you are doing nothing more than selling/pushing products.</p>
              <p>Are you telling me that if I buy all the things in your shop, I can be a performing magician right away? The misconception is that you are using your status as a magician to sell magic.</p>
              <p>Magicians are meant to perform. Magic demonstrators are meant to guide.</p>
              <p>If I can't master a french drop, are you going to spare me your time to teach me?</p>
              <p>Ning, leave the magic business to the pros. You should divert your time on other more important things, like really putting more effort to practise for your act.</p>
              <p>Trust me, even local hooter girls draw more attention at Clarke Quay.</p>

              <p>I fully admit that I edited the post. It was pretty long cause I really like them. I always get my stuff from there as its one of the few shops in Singapore that supports anti-piracy. afterall, like most of you, I had a bad experience with the local shops as mentioned earlier by you all.</p>
              <p>So far I'm really happy with the service I get from Magic Boutique and I feel the stuff she has done has really helped local magicians here. she has done tv shows and appeared on magazines. it has raised awareness to the people in Singapore that there exists magicians in Singapore too and that people should support local talent. :)</p>
              <p>Anyway, I'm not Ning or JC Sum. I dont think someone as busy as her/ him has the time. Looks like you have something personal against Ning. Liking her magic or not is another totally different thing and its subjective to different people.</p>
              <p>If you feel you need to discuss about your grudge with me or something you are free to pm me so that we can talk over the phone.and as klivee say "nothing is perfect".</p>

              <p>Don't go to personal. Anyway next time ask the shop people ( regardless which shop you go ) if the DVD is original before making any purchase.</p>
              <p>Just to avoid any dispute in future. ( remember to keep the receipt also just in case people try to lie their way out ).</p>
              <p> buying thing online the main problem is the condition of the product and if the product got problem you will have problem to ask for replacement. ( compare to physical shop ).</p>
              <p> Also if you got problem with the props or magic you buy over the net. Who the hell going to help you. So think again before you act.</p>
