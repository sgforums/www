              <p>True story,</p>
              <p>My brother &amp; I started out in magic a year ago. Being greenhorns to this mysterious art, we were drawn by the seemingly impressive shop at Concorde. My younger brother started out the hobby first and before we know it, we both have purchased a huge number of dvds from the f**king cheats. As mentioned, being greenhorns &amp; newbies, we have no idea of the piracy issue going on and religiously purchase dvds that are getting us to no where. We weren't performing well. There was no love or guidance from arrogant Homo Solomon despite our regularity in purchasing dvds from them (Everytime I go down, he thinks I'm a different customer. WTF?!) and we weren't learning the right way.</p>
              <p>The piracy started to unveil itself when I purchased the Dan and Dave Buck Trilogy series from those pirates. It was a Xmas present to myself and having done research on the internet. I was hyped about getting this collectible dvd set from one of the most established card flourishers and magicians in our time. When I headed down to hand over my hard earned money, All I was got was 3 obviously burnt dvds, 3 cd holders pasted on a paper packing. Hell, even the booklet included was photocopied!!! Even for dvd pirates, couldn't they have a proper dvd casing? I thought they were fooling me but Homo Solomon said that's how it was packaged to them. Being the not-so-naive newbie, I knew something was wrong, therefore I just took the dvds home and to confirm whether the original dvds look like this</p>
              <p>It was then I was f**king disappointed. Hell I even felt like buying kerosene to burn that muthaf**king shop down. SGD $200 for freaking obvious pirated dvds. Hell even the fake branded bag guys put in more service and effort in their products to convince people to buy them.</p>
              <p>For a moment I was lost. I had no idea where were the other magic shops located in Singapore. I started to share this problem with other fellow magicians. One of them introduced me to Castle and that is where it all began for me.</p>
              <p>When I first stepped into that little magic haven, I was greeted warmly by the friendly shop owner. Let's call him J. I was kinda wary at first as the shop wasn't as impressive looking at Hall and it looked kinda old. Seriously. And I was fed up with the piracy issue at Hall therefore I was kinda cold towards J. However, like the magician that he is, he read my mind and proclaimed that his dvds are not pirated. </p>
              <p>Firstly I was like "how did this sonnovabeach know what I was thinking?" He then went on to tell me that he gets that (the cold look and attitude) alot from people who are weary of Hall's scam and Homo Solomon's arrogant attitude. He even went on to teach me how to differentiate the original dvds from the pirated ones. He was concern on what I bought from them and allowed to me to compare the original gimmicks he had in the shop with the fake ones I got from Hall (fellow magicians, you know, moving pips, Flow etc.) The more I found out, the more I feel like burning that place down.</p>
              <p>It was then I decided to start magic over again. Under the guidance of J. I was with Hall for 2 months and I wasn't even scratching the surface of magic. Hell I do not even dare to show what I learnt to anyone as I know what I got from Hall is nothing. Hall will just hardsell their products without appraising whether the customer's level is appropriate for the relevant material. By purchasing the material recommended by J for my level as I progressed. I can feel my confidence and act as a performer grow exponentially as time goes by.</p>
              <p>Slowly I got wind of this forum from fellow magicians that there was a hero by the name Magic hall sucks creating awareness about the scams of Hall. I've been following this thread and decided to be part of the action. After reading the success stories of other people who got scammed getting their full refunds, I bravely send those f**kers a mail. However I had my concerns as most people here are only making small refunds and I got a bulk of 26 dvds (including some which I bought from Malaysia which I'm done with just to give them a taste of their own medicine. </p>
              <p><img src="http://i899.photobucket.com/albums/ac200/magictheory13/Triumph.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Look at my brief but relevant email. I took alot of drafts to make it short and bitter. I want my f**king money back and guess what?Surprise surprise! The outcome? Angry ex-customer 1 Scamming magic shop 0!!!! Hurray!!! 5 word reply from Kenneth himself. After the reply I immediately bagged all 26 dvds I got from and headed down to Hall. I got back.....</p>
              <p>SGD 1720!!! </p>
              <p>The record? I emptied the Concorde store's cash register and cash box, Homo Solomon's wallet and even had the BOSS, Kenneth ibank it to my account later in the evening in one afternoon. $1720!!! I had those f**kers crying later that night and doing math to figure out how many pirated dvds they have to sell to earn that much back. I freaking annihilated them. 4-0 !!!!!!</p>
              <p>My point is this. I'm not biased towards Hall. I still get decks once in a while (gotta admit, they got a good location) from them. I'm not a paid forum user to post an advertorial on any magic shops behalf. Neither am I some boss of a local online magic shop trying to earn a quick buck or draw disappointed customers of Hall into my clientele. </p>
              <p>I just want other fellow magicians, especially the budding ones, to be aware of Hall's scamming ways and that there are other magic shops where you can get proper guidance for your act and learn the art of magic as it is. Not as some seduction tool like some magic shop in PoMo or be treated like a fool in the eyes of the arrogant dancing monkey Homo Solomon. Don't fooled by the Hall's bright lights and huge shop space. It is a sinking ship. Go check out www.ellusionist.com or www.theory11.com  Alot of new material is out but do you see Hall holding them? They can't cause they're blacklisted by major magic suppliers around the world (apart from China or Hong Kong, maybe India and Malaysia, the lands of piracy) and what's a magic shop without the magic suppliers. It will only be a matter of time before they sink into their own greed and scams but before that happens, know that there are other places where you can learn the art proper. Stand up for yourself and get your hard-earned money or allowance back from those f**kers. </p>
              <p>I sincerely thank Magic halls sucks for generating awareness in the online community and eventually alerting the magic supplier of Hall's scamming ways. It will be a matter of time before Hall realises that they can't survive on adolescent card jugglers and decks collectors to survive. They're going down if everyone is this forum who bought sh*t from them gets a refund.</p>
              <p>Say it out loud *I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!*</p>

              <p>When I first stepped into that little magic haven, I was greeted warmly by the friendly shop owner. Let's call him J. I was kinda wary at first as the shop wasn't as impressive looking at Hall and it looked kinda old. Seriously. And I was fed up with the piracy issue at Hall therefore I was kinda cold towards J. However, like the magician that he is, he read my mind and proclaimed that his dvds are not pirated. </p>
              <p>Firstly I was like "how did this sonnovabeach know what I was thinking?" He then went on to tell me that he gets that (the cold look and attitude) alot from people who are weary of Hall's scam and Homo Solomon's arrogant attitude. He even went on to teach me how to differentiate the original dvds from the pirated ones. He was concern on what I bought from them and allowed to me to compare the original gimmicks he had in the shop with the fake ones I got from Hall (fellow magicians, you know, moving pips, Flow etc.) The more I found out, the more I feel like burning that place down.</p>
              <p>It was then I decided to start magic over again. Under the guidance of J. I was with Hall for 2 months and I wasn't even scratching the surface of magic. Hell I do not even dare to show what I learnt to anyone as I know what I got from Hall is nothing. Hall will just hardsell their products without appraising whether the customer's level is appropriate for the relevant material. By purchasing the material recommended by J for my level as I progressed. I can feel my confidence and act as a performer grow exponentially as time goes by.</p>
              <p>Slowly I got wind of this forum from fellow magicians that there was a hero by the name Magic hall sucks creating awareness about the scams of Hall. I've been following this thread and decided to be part of the action. After reading the success stories of other people who got scammed getting their full refunds, I bravely send those f**kers a mail. However I had my concerns as most people here are only making small refunds and I got a bulk of 26 dvds (including some which I bought from Malaysia which I'm done with just to give them a taste of their own medicine. </p>
              <p><img src="http://i899.photobucket.com/albums/ac200/magictheory13/Triumph.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Look at my brief but relevant email. I took alot of drafts to make it short and bitter. I want my f**king money back and guess what?Surprise surprise! The outcome? Angry ex-customer 1 Scamming magic shop 0!!!! Hurray!!! 5 word reply from Kenneth himself. After the reply I immediately bagged all 26 dvds I got from and headed down to Hall. I got back.....</p>
              <p>SGD 1720!!! </p>
              <p>The record? I emptied the Concorde store's cash register and cash box, Homo Solomon's wallet and even had the BOSS, Kenneth ibank it to my account later in the evening in one afternoon. $1720!!! I had those f**kers crying later that night and doing math to figure out how many pirated dvds they have to sell to earn that much back. I freaking annihilated them. 4-0 !!!!!!</p>
              <p>My point is this. I'm not biased towards Hall. I still get decks once in a while (gotta admit, they got a good location) from them. I'm not a paid forum user to post an advertorial on any magic shops behalf. Neither am I some boss of a local online magic shop trying to earn a quick buck or draw disappointed customers of Hall into my clientele. </p>
              <p>I just want other fellow magicians, especially the budding ones, to be aware of Hall's scamming ways and that there are other magic shops where you can get proper guidance for your act and learn the art of magic as it is. Not as some seduction tool like some magic shop in PoMo or be treated like a fool in the eyes of the arrogant dancing monkey Homo Solomon. Don't fooled by the Hall's bright lights and huge shop space. It is a sinking ship. Go check out www.ellusionist.com or www.theory11.com  Alot of new material is out but do you see Hall holding them? They can't cause they're blacklisted by major magic suppliers around the world (apart from China or Hong Kong, maybe India and Malaysia, the lands of piracy) and what's a magic shop without the magic suppliers. It will only be a matter of time before they sink into their own greed and scams but before that happens, know that there are other places where you can learn the art proper. Stand up for yourself and get your hard-earned money or allowance back from those f**kers. </p>
              <p>I sincerely thank Magic halls sucks for generating awareness in the online community and eventually alerting the magic supplier of Hall's scamming ways. It will be a matter of time before Hall realises that they can't survive on adolescent card jugglers and decks collectors to survive. They're going down if everyone is this forum who bought sh*t from them gets a refund.</p>
              <p>Say it out loud *I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!*</p>

              <p>Hi Melven, if I were you, I'll call and book myself a taxi to concorde. Once I reach there, I'll have a hearty and expensive meal first.</p>
              <p>After that, you tell yourself that you've spent money coming here and you are not willing to go home empty handed without getting a refund back.</p>
              <p>Push yourself. I'm sure a lot of people who think that getting a refund from them is near impossible, but just look at this forum!</p>
              <p>So many people have realised that they've been dupped by this unethical shop and most of them have done something about it, either getting their refund or spreading the word out.</p>
              <p>Yes, you have probably bought fake stuff too. I'm aware that they have moved to the first level of concorde, hoping to lure passerbys who have no clue of the bad things they are doing.</p>
              <p>FYI, they have the fake version of the trick called Meteor by Juan Mayoral. It's very obvious it's fake and you know what? It's not even released in the world wide magic market yet!</p>
              <p>Just imagine what else they have in the shop are fake! I think 100%! The only things that are real in there are the hard-earned money they cheated from people selling these fake things!</p>
              <p>Go get your refund back. They are spending your hard earned money on god knows what, obtaining it by lying to you.</p>
              <p>And also tell your friends about magic hall. I'm sure someone told you about it and this stopped you from giving your money to them anymore in future.</p>

              <p>Fellow magicians this is true. Meteor is a have-not-been released product and how can a blacklisted shop have it. My problem with Hall is this. Deal with your pirated dvds and gimmicks. However, have the balls to own up to the consumers instead of charging them the original prices for pirated stuff. Pirated gimmicks or dvds at a pirated price. Fair enough. </p>
              <p>However they are conning the masses by marketing their pirated stuff as originals and misleading the magic noobs by letting them think that the products they are purchasing is original. If people buy it being aware that it is pirated, so be it, Their choice. However, stop scamming of their hard-earned money. Magic is an expensive hobby no doubt, however when people like me spend, I want the f**king real deal.</p>

              <p>GUys, thank you for supporting this thread. We will carry on doing this until everybody they cheated will know the truth.</p>
              <p>I will keep this going for as long as i can becos like what melven say, there are still people going there and unknown to them, they are being cheated.</p>

              <p>Yes, i told a lot of my friends about magic hall, most don't even do magic, but am very angry that such shops exist in singapore, somemore at orchard road!</p>
              <p>For all those who want a nice place where you can really learn a lot and good price, i recommend Magic castle at shaw towers.</p>
              <p>The guy there is super friendly, knowledgeable, prices very cheap and many things in the shop.</p>
              <p>No regrets!</p>
