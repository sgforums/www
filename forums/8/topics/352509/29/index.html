              <p>Went down to Hall today. Heard from some longtime customers of Hall (yes, they do exist) that Hall's changed their ways.</p>
              <p>Requested to look at a couple of dvds. Instead the SPD (sarong party dude) kept hard selling me gimmicks and decks. It is only when I insisted I wanna take a look at dvds then did he took a few out for me to review.</p>
              <p>All I can say is this:</p>
              <p>A cheater will never change its spots or stripes. </p>

              <p>firstly, what jeremy pei is doing is selling props. Props have many manufacturers and depending where the prop is made, hence the cost price. That fellow magician of yours seem aware of where the prop is from and hence bought it from Jeremy which is lower than what is Hall is selling. Stuff from overseas don't just get air dropped. They have to be shipped. </p>
              <p>What Hall is doing, is selling you, pirated dvds and lousy quality props at the ORIGINAL PRICE. Moving pips from Seo, I can get at 25 bucks and of high quality. Movings pips from Hall, 30-50 (forgotten, I haven't been bothered with their pricing lately)  and is poorly made. I read magictheory13's post, I'm also one the Buck twins' fan, bought my trilogy series at 200 for collection purposes, turns out to be the same packaging as described by magictheory13. I realise I wasn't the only one being scammed. There are many people here too!</p>

              <p>yes they are the bottom dwellers of magic. I do not think they had claimed a million dollar income but they do claim they are Singapore's highest paid magicians with a 5 digit income. However, are their shows better than those in Vegas?</p>
