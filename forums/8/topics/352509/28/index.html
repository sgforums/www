              <p>sorry lah, Criss wasn't even interested in this don't know what award..please read quote : "Unfortunately Criss wasn’t on hand to personally accept the award, so they allowed a homeless person wearing Angel’s clothes to accept it on his behalf."</p>
              <p>Giving Criss this award is just a publicity stunt to get media attention on the unknown International Magic Society and nothing more.</p>
              <p>I have for the longest time thought that the International Magic Society and all others was a load of crap. I too took the time to review all the awards given out by these groups and they are usually given to nobodies. If any of you saw the 2007 Magic Awards you know what I’m talking about. The worst acts received these so called awards. If I ever received an award I would accept it and then throw it in the garbage.</p>

              <p>True true. IMS is just some organisation that you pay = publicity plus awards plus false recognition. Hence Singapore's "best" duo. Look at UK's Magic Circle or US's Magic Castle, when those magicians receive awards there, they are beaming with pride. Because those awards mean prestige. The ultimum in a Magician's career. Merlin's = Can be bought with Money.</p>
              <p>Yes that chinadoll and the midget really have no pride in saying that Merlins = Oscars. Even our Mediacorp's Star Awards has more prestige than that plastic statue.</p>

              <p>ning doesnt perform tricks, she just plays with props.. its only because she is marketed by jc sum that she is what she is today.. she has no talent, no skills.. only marketing factor, because frankly speaking, female magicians in this region just aint popular or have the oppourtunity too..</p>

              <p><br>Yes. But give some credits to the props. Jeremy Pei's linking rings act is first class and there are magicians whose selling point is their dancing canes and stuff. The props do not make the magician but the magician make the props magical. To Singapore's "best" duo, they simply just have the money to spurlge on "self-designed" illusions but simply have no skill, flair, charisma or stage presence.</p>
              <p>Ning's just being marketed as Singapore's magic barbie doll. Although credits to her stunt in which she refuses a safety net, however the attitude that they both is simply a huge turn off.</p>

              <p>My name is Nizam. My friend said that he saw me in the picture taken with magic babe ning during the magic show at NP. He also told me about this forum where someone said that she said mentioned I was deemed to be 'taking my time' with the intention of checking out your bottom in the photo.</p>
              <p>Please let me reassure you that I wasn't checking you out. My girlfriend was present at the show too. What you wrote about me is very degrading and insulting. You told me to tighten up the strap, and that was exactly what I did. You are supposed to be known as Singapore's best female magician, but yet you brought yourself this low to malign me and my integrity.</p>
              <p>I understand that it is your blog and you can say whatever you want. But since you are part of the event at the inauguration, I'm sure some of my fellow NP classmates may have visited your blog, one of which was my friend. This may result in students in NP misjudging me.</p>
              <p>Attached is a caption of the picture. I will try to spread the word out to as many people as possible to visit this forum so that this misunderstanding can be cleared once and for all in order for me to get on with my life.</p>

              <p>When you guys talked about how cheap magic castle sell their stuff, I was thinking like oh ok, they're cheap. But last night, I got nothing to do so I just surf their website to find anything interesting, then I realised, not only they are VERY cheap, they are the CHEAPEST in Singapore!</p>
              <p>All shops, and I mention again in bold, ALL SHOPS are no match with castle's prices! Look, their little man is selling only for S$399 when it's $300 US Dollars everywhere else!</p>
              <p>From the way I see how castle run their business, with such a big team, illusions, services and of course, prices, I don't think anyone else comes close to how great they are.</p>
              <p>I'm not their staff, but I'm a member of magic castle. I really feel proud to wear their shirt out! I remember people looking at me in the mrt when I wore their shirt! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Yeah! They are the cheapest! I also compared the prices of other online shops and also from overseas. Non of them can beat castle's price.</p>
              <p>But I think what I really like about castle is the people there are very knowledgable! This is something you can't get from any other shops.</p>
              <p>I also like to wear the shirt! Very comfortable! haahaa!</p>

              <p>Hi! </p>
              <p>I'm new here. Seems like there is a huge commotion on about Hall and Sum and Ning. I personally is not a fan of Singapore magic unless it's the premier performers like Kiki Tay, Patrick Wan or Jeremy Pei.</p>
              <p>I seriously think that their 4D prediction is fail and cannot make it. </p>

              <p>For anyone who ever bought decks from magic hall, please compare and check with similar decks sold at other magic shops.</p>
              <p>I met some magicians who bought decks from there and upon handling them, I felt a vast difference compared to regular decks.</p>
              <p>All of the normal as well as designer decks felt lighter and the finishing is ridiculous.</p>
              <p>I suspect not only their dvds and products are pirated, so are all of their decks.</p>

              <p><br> Yes..this is how the scam will work..they will have to buy

              '<strong>science and math' </strong> and later
              switch the winning ticket for the one in the box. They will
              lose money but in exchange for fame. They claim to have 
              bought only one ticket, let the dogs f**k both of you. If
              that somebody could only have taken the ticket down from the
              box their scam will be exposed..'cos it will have little chance

              <p>Actually i know how it works... Just that I've never been a fan of them as I feel they lack the flair and charisma as a stage performer unlike the big names in Singapore. Magic insiders know how fail they are. Mightyfcutory were you one of them (as in the poor group who suffered under them) previously?</p>

              <p>Ya.... Hall's products really really cannot make it. I didn't know they've moved to the basement along the streets. Apparently I think they got chased out. The new shop seems like a make shift shop ready to move out once police come. Haha.</p>

              <p><br>true. Continuing their scam with the young and naive. Losers. Right now I see their webby do not even dare to place new products in fear of backlash. All their new products updated at a tiny corner at the bottom. HA!</p>
