              <p>Hey man, I don't think it's very wise to say that this forum has done nothing.</p>
              <p>Honestly, it sounds like you are the owner of magic hall.</p>
              <p>I was cheated by magic hall before and it was this forum that made me realised it early and not get cheated by them again.</p>
              <p>The deco and self proclaimed title on the internet was what attracted me there in the first place. But it all turns out to be the biggest scam ever. Just because it looks good means they won't cheat people?</p>
              <p>For me, I'm considered lucky. I was prevented from being cheated more by them with their over priced pirated dvds, over priced and lousy magic lessons and over priced non-original props.</p>
              <p>Also, I found out about the shop magic castle where I'm very happy with from this forum too! And now I'm trying to spread the word out to people not to get cheated by magic hall.</p>
              <p>Not only myself, but like magictheory13 and also this guy here call ht lee (link below)</p>
              <p><a href="/forums/8/topics/352509?page=10">http://sgforums.com/forums/8/topics/352509?page=10</a></p>
              <p>got refunds of $1000 over dollars! And how? Because of this forum.</p>
              <p>They can use all the money they cheat to move shop, decorate, even open a church or a temple, but at the end of the day, just to look nicer so they can cheat more people.</p>
              <p>This forum does a very good job helping people who wants to get their money back from being cheated into buying pirated things from them.</p>
              <p>Maybe you can start contributing something useful to this forum, help to spread the word out or create more awareness, since you are the one who said they seem to be growing, instead of just sitting and doing nothing but post messages like that.</p>
              <p>Unless, of course, I'm correct and YOU ARE the owner of magic hall.</p>

              <p>that could one way. however the one thing I don't like about ordering online is 1) you gotta have a credit card or some paypal acc or sorts, 2) there is no guidance from anyone and once you've purchased something you stuck to learning it yourself 3) the shipping prices and the wait can be a real killer. </p>
              <p>That's all I'm saying. However there are some really good products out there that can only be bought online. </p>

              <p>Ever since the times of Neil Strauss's The Game, magicians had been linked to another art form. Pick up. Seriously, I want to astonish and amaze people. It is not like everytime I perform a trick I'm trying to get into someone's pants. Alot of times when I perform for strangers out of boredom or just to hone my skills as a street or close-up performer, I get this all the time " Are you picking me up?". Be it boys or girls, man or woman, aunts and uncles (WTF?!). </p>
              <p>Which brings me to another concern about the current state of magic in Singapore. First we have the "largest piracy scam" in Orchard (PS &amp; Concorde, Ironically the Istana is between the 2 biggest scam) and lately a certain organisation somewhere is promoting magic as a seduction skill. WTF?</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.divaasia.com/article/5757">http://www.divaasia.com/article/5757</a></p>
              <p>Seriously. Check out the hair. We may have a bald dancing monkey at Hall, the last thing we need is a horny baboon who needs a hair cut. I was overseas when I heard about this article and by the time I get back I can't find the original piece. It was today when I chanced upon this article and decided to share with everyone here. This whole magic-used-as-pick-up thingy has been bothering me for ages and I decided to share with everyone here now that I found proof.  </p>
              <p>I heard from fellow magicians regarding that article is that this baboon demonstrated how his rubber band trick can allow a guy to cosy up to a girl, namely the reporter. According to the reporter, It was a turn off. Firstly, you are called S S (whatever your stupid name means) and you given away one of your secrets. Brillant. *clap clap* I've never know where they're located and never want to know. I'm afraid the kerosene which I'm leaving for Hall might be used on them.</p>
              <p>Seriously. This is another one of those business antics that enforces into people's mind that Magic = Pickup and only degrading the art of magic. Seduction magic course? Apart from the old birds of magic (whom pro magicians know who) like John, Bob or Lawrence, I getting cynical and skeptical towards the standard of magic courses conducted by these people. Yes magic can be a good ice breaker when you wanna know someone. So is being a fire swallower, expert Guitar Hero or a even toilet paper collector. Women just want men who have the balls to do what they do and one need not spend SGD 150 in learning 10 lame ass tricks to pick them up. </p>
              <p>Let magictheory13 teach you how to find your balls:</p>
              <p>Step 1: Extend your right hand (or your left hand if you're left handed)</p>
              <p>Step 2: Using your thumb, rub against all your fingers and make sure you can feel all your fingers</p>
              <p>Step 3: Reach down into your pants and underwear and locate your testicles (for the ignorant, it's the medical term for your balls). </p>
              <p>Step 4: Grab it real hard and enjoy the sharp painful sensation.</p>
              <p>Step 5: Realise that you have balls and be a man to do the right thing.</p>
              <p>And I do need you to pay SGD 150 for a lamo course. Magic is not pick up and pickup is not magic. Pick up is the art of socialising within groups to make one stand out. Social dynamic as some call it. Magic is the art of pure astonishment. Magic can be used as a tool in pick up but it will only degrade the art of magic and it's what this hairy baboon is doing.</p>
              <p>I need to take my chill pill after reading this article. First scammers and now horny guys who can't get a date. Has local magic come to this?</p>

              <p><br>Wow! I don't mind being the owner! Can get such a big shop and so many tricks to see for free! Hehe! No need to be owner, as long as I work for Magic castle I'm happy enough! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Singaporemagician, I took your advice and went to the l and l to see. I recommend you to join the membership of magic castle. Cos when I added the 13 steps mentalism dvds to the cart, it says chapeast shipping is US$11.</p>
              <p>But it takes 2-3 MONTHS to arrive in Singapore!!!</p>
              <p>So together with the US$120 dvd and shipping US$11, converted into Singapore dollars (x 1.45) is $189.95.</p>
              <p>Magic castle member price is $190! And it comes within 4-7 days fro the USA, and most of the time they have the stock in the shop!!!</p>
              <p>So if you want fast shipping from l and l, it's going to cost more. So might as well join Magic castle membership and get it cheap, original and fast!</p>
              <p>Somemore Jay the owner can guide you!</p>
              <p>Haha! Good right? When you join, just tell them Ben give you more information to join ya! Cos I told them want to help people know about them and my parents very happy also!</p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>

              <p>I agree with you. Singapore's magic scene is also too damn political. Everyone's trying to be the next big thing and if you're not under any of the major player's wing, you're f**ked. Look at our own <a href="http://forums.singaporemagiccircle.com/">http://forums.singaporemagiccircle.com/</a>. Look at all the rules and regulations and if you say something that the moderators do not like, you're banned from it.</p>
              <p>For insiders, we know that the forum is run by the old birds of magic and by the only magic association in Singapore. Look at how dead it is. Why? Because there is no freedom of speech. They are like the PAP of magic. You have no voice there because if the moderators do not know who you are, they will not bother with your threads. Say something "illegal", you're banned. In the end, people come here to talk. I can say f**k as many times as I want without having a "big shot" moderator come put me down. I can comment on how screwed up the local magic scene is without a worry. Because I have a voice and their stage is not meant for me.</p>
              <p>That is why local magic scene is screwed and you'll never have magicians as good as the taiwanese, Japanese, British and the US. Understand that politics is everywhere, but Singapore's magic scene is TOO POLITICAL.</p>
              <p>For those who follow the local magic scene, check out the previous few winners of those contest. Are they really as good as those we see in Da Mo Jing? But once they're crowned winners, you'll see that typical Singaporean ego. Next thing is look at the judges and later ask the winners or even the participants, who are their teachers and you'll know what I mean.</p>
              <p>The fat shorty illusionist and his plastic partner. Do they have the flair, the charisma of those real pros of other countries? How did they make it? See their endorsers before their huge plastic trophies and magazine covers grace their credentials. Magic babe? Just because she's featured in FHM in cakes of make up and a push up bra doesn't mean she's a really good performer. Singapore's only professional female magician? My a**. What about Priscillia Khong? She's been doing this even before Ning started to grow boobs.</p>
              <p>See how screwed up is our local magic scene. That is why you have people like Hall and SS doing all their weird antics. Because local magicians do not give a f**k.</p>

              <p>See... that's what I mean. One of Singapore's best is trying too hard when he performs and looks like a retarded imbecile.</p>
              <p>The other plastic barbie doll just have $$$ to buy good props. Come on. Look at magiccastle.com.sg. Check out their promotions. With less than SGD 1K  you can get our own Ning set with strait jacket escape and strait jacket, razor blade swallowing!!!!</p>
              <p>Real magicians know that close up and street magic is the real deal. Insiders will know that Cyril started out in stage magic but he was going nowhere. He started close up he got a TV deal in the States before he made it big in Japan. The one which require most skills. Stage illusions you got $$$ can already. Unless you're Jeremy Pei with his wicked linking rings routine or you have crazy hands like Jeff McBride doing his card productions. If not, I've never seen Singapore's best duo do any close up.</p>

              <p>True true. She was just a magic blogshop owner. Her rise to fame is also due to riding along the shorty uncle's $$$. Well knowing the standard of magic in UK with pros like David Forrest, Michael Vincent, John Van Der Put and many more, I'm not surprised that our best is of that standard. But given that short fart, I dun think he has the balls to go up to perform in front of them.</p>

And the shop make 50% profit out of nothing....isn't it great?</p>
              <p>To make it clear I do not buy from any physical shops so none have offended me...just a magic hobbiest. I wonder why the 'F' brand make copies of magic and no one boder to complain? Is it because it is marketed by an 'Ang Mo'?</p>
