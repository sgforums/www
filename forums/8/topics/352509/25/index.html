              <p>Yes, magic hall is selling china made pirated products at original price. Confirm.</p>
              <p>Just because now they are getting non original products straight from your suppliers, you can start pushing the blame that you didn't know when confronted?</p>
              <p>Kenneth, just how stupid you think your customers are? You think everyone is as stupid as you and your pet monkey?</p>
              <p>I pity your parents. You failed your degree half way, beg your father for money to open this shop, then you screw up like that...sigh...</p>
              <p>Start doing the right thing, no need 2 shops to sell pirated products. You should combine and centralised them...best place with huge traffic you can sell, outside the gates of the istana.</p>

              <p>i had spent over $600 at TMH, but none of the things i bought are CDs, most of them are gimmick decks and close-up magic. So if i am not wrong all those are also pirated right? Because i bought a WOW by masuda and its dirty when i first bought it and also it is tough to push the card into the sleeve. Also, the split deck which i bought was not cut evenly and i could even see roughing dust on the cards.</p>
              <p>The shop owner is also quite smart by showing me a coin trick, inducing me to buy it. When i decided to buy that coin trick, he sold me the coins that he used to show me the trick, saying that it was the only one left and he had to KINDLY take it out from the packet to show the trick to me.</p>
              <p>i guess at that time i was such a fool to believe his nonsense....</p>

              <p>That's their way of hard selling. And sadly yes they're gimmicks are pirated. Okie. Not really pirated but of lower quality. Pirated only applies to gimmicks which belong to a brand i.e. tenyo, masuda, yigel mesika and they market it as the original though the gimmick is not. </p>
              <p>If it's the dvds you can identify whether it's pirated or not. However, non-branded gimmicks are a tricky thing unless you can prove the gimmick to be pirated (i.e. compare original Tango shell coins with the ones they sold.) If you can do that, bravely check my template on sending them a mail and getting your money back. The money you spent there can get you much better quality stuff elsewhere and I strongly promote magic castle as I get all my stuff there after this incident.</p>
              <p>All the best in getting your money back. It can be done. Many people who read this thread have succeeded. </p>

              <p>If those u bought are not Dvds i tink it is not tt easy to get a refund. anyway for the WOW. i tried to refund it when i went to refund the dvd, but then they did not allow me 2. anyway after some time when i helped my fren got his WOW online, my WOW and his do not have much difference even though i bought it from the hall. So for the WOW itme itself i tink it is ok. However for other stuffs i would definitely say go try to refund, cos even frm the packaging can see it is fake alrdy.</p>

              <p>Tonight I was watching the X'mas parade at Orchard Rd. and
              walked into the new Magic Hall on the ground floor. I must say it's
              impressive the renovations and everything. No matter how much
              bullets the fourm here shoots at them they never die only grow
              stronger and grander...mmmm...wonder????</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I've been to their new shop. Well it's true they've moved to the basement of shops along the walkway. Apparently they've given up their shop space at the main lobby of the hotel. Inside their old shop space was those machines which you can pick up dolls and soft toys.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">And well, here's my input. It's definitely not bigger and grander. their new shop space is longer. But the old one was bigger. Grander...? No. The renovation seems simpler. And the shop space definitely simpler and plainer. They seem to carry lesser products now. Not surprising due to the fact that alot of legitimate magic dealers stopped dealing products to them.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">So to all fellow magicians against piracy of magic products, we have succeeded. It will only be a matter of time as they downsize and downgrade til they have nothing left unless they change their ways.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Keep saying it, I want my money back!!!</p>

              <p>I used to not like the idea of going to magic castle in the past, cos I know solomon used to work there.</p>
              <p>But after what I read about some of the good experiences you guys post, I just went down to see see look look.</p>
              <p>I have to say that all that is mentioned here about magic castle is indeed true.</p>
              <p>This shop offers the lowest price and good service. Truly a place magic lovers will enjoy being part of.</p>

              <p><br>sadly but true that homo solomon used to work a castle and it was his unethical and arrogant ways that ruined the magic experience for magic lovers thus tarnishing the name of hall in the past.</p>
              <p>However. there is no denying that it is the best place to shop for magic. Hell I'd go 2-3 times a month just to check out new stuff and have a chat with the boss. Try doing that at Hall. Anyway I'll be heading down this saturday, any fellow magicians wanan join me? I've been dying and wanting to know more local magicians and magic hobbyists.</p>

              <p>look at what "singaporemagician" said, bigger and grander. My ass. Hell, even my grandmoma's ass is bigger and grander than their f**k up shop. You guys have really gotta see how pathetic their current shop is. And lately their PS booth seem to hire another cannot make it cheena or malaysian dude. GAWD! these idiots know nuts about magic but act like they know it.</p>
              <p>The other day i saw the cheena dude perform a t****tip trick to a layman and was beaming happily while people from the side can see the f**king gimmick like sticking out like sore. WTF!!! Ask people who dunno magic to sell magic, pirated one somemore. How low can Hall go?</p>

              <p>Hi all.</p>

              <p>I am an Advertising and Public Relations student and my current assignment is to produce documentation and commit public shaming(through the mass media ala youtube and other online means) of people who do fradulent acts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is because my 'Marketing' and 'Media in Society' lecturer wants to see journalistic documentation of our project "Retailers who chase profits at the expense of integrity". I am thinking, since there is such backlash over this company, I was wondering whether or not to commit public shaming acts on this person(and/or company) for my project. I will let you guys know how this goes. I have to discuss this with my group members...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So wish me luck in my filming... Hope I dun get heckled too bad by that Solomon guy.</p>
