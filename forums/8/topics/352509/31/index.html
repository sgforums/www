              <p><br>maybe jeremy pei is still a silent partner. of course he won't show himself now that the shop already like that. Anyway he also always sell pirated products to many magicians here in singapore. I won't be surprise he is supplying all the pirated things to kenneth since he travel to china so often.</p>

              <p>I had wanted to bring my 12 yr old son to magic hall next week becos he recently wanted to pick up magic after watching the Taiwanese magician call Liu Qian.</p>
              <p>Thank god I chanced upon this forum and found out about magic hall. I managed to prevent my son from experiencing a bad impression on his very first visit to a magic shop.</p>
              <p>Thanks for stopping us from going there and worst, destroy my son's love and faith towards magic.</p>

              <p><br>$6 is very expensive for a regular deck! I buy from magic castle for only $4. Even non member price is only $4.50.</p>
              <p>Magic hall is crap for selling at $12, obviously!!!</p>
              <p>I used to buy from inqbox until i found magic castle. They are definitely the cheapest anywhere!</p>

              <p>Don't be surprise if bernard sim is also a partner of magic hall, cheating new magic hobbysist who join their stupid magic club then get them to go magic hall and spend money. All scammers, all good for nothing!</p>

              <p>Just my 2 cents worth for beginners,</p>
              <p>Do your own research or even ask other experience ppl what magic tricks is suitable for you before going down to any magic shops. Because if you ask recommendations from the shop keepers, They may recommend you some unpopular titles which they are unable to sell and offer you so that they can recoup some losses.</p>
              <p>You may never know what they are thinking. :)</p>
              <p>And of course stay away from magic hall = pirates.</p>
