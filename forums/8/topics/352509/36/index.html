              <p>Magic hall is obviously still overpricing their products by so much.</p>
              <p>In the magazine article, the scotch and soda is $45??? Somemore wrong spelling...SCOTH and soda!!!</p>
              <p>And the invisble deck with dvd is $35???</p>
              <p>If you click on the links that i put up here, you can see that Magic castle's website is selling the scotch and soda for only $32.</p>
              <p>And the best thing is? If you're are member, it's only $22.</p>
              <p>As for the invisible deck with dvd, it's only $22 and $18 for members.</p>

              <p><br>I think the authorities are not exactly doing nothing. Don't be surprised they are already laying ambush and gathering intel about this shop.</p>
              <p>The police will only do a raid when there is substantial evidence collected against the business, otherwise, it'll be a waste of manpower and resources, to not be able to prosecute them after raiding.</p>
              <p>Basically, once they get raid, it'll be more or less guilty unless proven innocent.</p>

              <p><br>I couldn't agree more. When I told my friends who works in the police about this case, he said that it's not that the police are not doing anything, but the key word is when.</p>
              <p>The Singapore goverment takes copyright infringement as well as counterfeiting very seriously. Anyone found prosecuted by these two laws can see themselves slapped with a minimum $50,000 fine, or a few months in prison.</p>
              <p>The police will know how long you have been operating, so even though magic hall has made tons of money during this time, the court will make sure that the fine is two to three times the amount they have earned.</p>
              <p>Good luck to kenneth and solomon/sulaiman. Because once they get caught, it's either bankruptcy or whole life scarred by a criminal record.</p>
