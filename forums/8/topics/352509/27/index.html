              <p>This may be a little out of topic, but I just wanted to share my views about this. I came across this article on the internet about magician jc sum. I found him to be extremely insulting towards us, hobbyist magicians. Go read and you'll find out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Was in singapore for a couple days for business. Had a day off and went to watch the show and man! it was pretty darn bad. The magicians lacked finesse and the illusions were really sub standard especially the teleportation and the huge fan thing which was rather akward in such a small setting.</p>
              <p>This was a month back. I was here again and just 2 days ago i saw JC sum on channel news asia and he really came off bad and i had to write somethign being a magic enthusiast from america. He was asked what the difference was between a trick and illusion. He replied in a smug manner saying, dogs do tricks! THe nerve of the man,</p>
              <p>There are many good close up magicians doing for say coin TRICKS and they even went on to do a card trick which they themed an illusion! Being an amateur i felt very insulted being called a dog as i do small tricks for my kids and friends.</p>
              <p>Oh well.. i am really on the fence for this show</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This idiot claims that only dogs do tricks. So is he trying to say that since his was born, he can perform illusions? Or did he started out with magic tricks first?</p>
              <p>Then does this make him a dog too? A very short dog, as a matter of fact.</p>
              <p>Then what about the rest of the magicians in Singapore or even the rest of the world?</p>
              <p>What about the people in the International Brotherhood of Magicians Singapore Ring?</p>
              <p>Might as well change it to SPCA then!</p>
              <p>Please jc sum( I can't even bother to capitalise your name because you don't deserve any respect from me or any other magicians), you have got no substance.</p>
              <p>And the best part is, like what the reviewer mentioned is extremely correct, you performed a "dog" card trick "as quoted by you" and you call that an illusion?</p>
              <p>Illusions are what people think is happening, but it isn't - Just like your height.</p>
              <p>You think by wearing heels, you look a little taller (1.60m), but once you reach home and remove your shoes, the illusion becomes reality (1.50m).</p>
              <p>If you want true performers with skills and showmanship, I'd go for Jeremy Pei.</p>
              <p>Also, your playdoll ning is nothing compared to a true performer like Priscilla Khong.</p>
              <p>Don't be so shamless to call yourself the first woman illusionist in singapore.</p>
              <p>Priscilla has been performing illusions with her father Pastor Lawrence Khong ever since you were in primary 8. (Heard you failed PSLE and stayed back for 2 years)</p>
              <p>I never like the both of you from day one, but I never hated you. But now, not only me, I guess everyone who has ever done magic despise you and your playdoll.</p>
              <p>Come on, don't put people down just because you think you've done it all.</p>
              <p>Since you're so good in magic, grow taller then.</p>

              <p>oh my gawd. My exact same sentiments. This is exactly the point I've been trying to tell everyone about the "best" in Singapore Magic. They aren't really the best. And that is the problem with most singaporean, EGO. Once it gets into their head, they'll never progress. They think they are good. But seriously, they have no flair, charisma, finesse, skill and class. Instead they suck, are arrogant, are short and ugly and lied.</p>
              <p>go to castle's website. See the recently introduced illusions. Do some of those look familiar? Yes it is performed  by the said dwarf and his ugly barbie who apparently "design" their own illusions. What a joke.</p>
              <p>and yes Priscillia Khong was doing this even before Ning got her first menses and she even had the audacity to declare herself the first female professional illusion. The greatest illusion she ever did was the one that made many desperate guys think she's hot.</p>
              <p>That's why great local  magicians like Jeremy Pei, the Khong family can't be bothered with such losers.</p>

              <p>Wah, he actually say until like that ah?</p>
              <p>Actually, i used to order from ning. Then i realised that she doesn't care about her customers at all.</p>
              <p>She claims she's the best in asia, but she over claim and under deliver. Once payment is made, no news, nothing. There was a few times my order as well as my friend's came after 2 to 3 months later!</p>
              <p>I already stopped ordering from her few months ago. My friends still order from her, but they all totally stopped and will never do so again.</p>

              <p>let's be objective here. I'm not saying that as a b-list "celebrity" magician you cannot have your personal time i.e. playing violin, camwhoring, enjoying good food. However, she has to realise that their act sucks, and her magic "boutique" is sinking. So stop being like a chinawoman and horde every single f**k thing and concentrate on one. Even as a performer, by setting a shop, she has a obligation towards her customers. Why do I need to order stuff from her and wait for 3-4 months to get it when I can get it right away at Castle or even a week or 2 the most.</p>
              <p>If she's busy performing she just gotta focus and brush up on their lame ass sh*t. If she's wanna do her magic "boutique" out of passion, then she gotta take care of her customers, which she isn't. Hell. I can go online right now and order a penguin or panda and it wouldn't take 3-4 months to arrive. What mail service are they using? Snail mail?</p>

              <p>yes that dwarf is really a midget. I suspect he is a cross breed between an asian and a leprechaun. Hence that ugly hair (god you have money to buy huge ass illusion props no money to get a nice hair do), perverse smile and platform shoes. </p>
              <p>It will only be a matter of time as Sum will fade behind the scenes. Look at their history. When they started out, Sum was calling the shots, Ning his assistant. Slowly as she gained more fame, Sum said they're partners. And now, read his latest post,</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; color: #b0b0b0;">
              </span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">N</span><span style="color: #000000;">ing helmed the first 3 shows with different show formats. The first show was an illusion show which she starred in (alongside her very able assistant ‘me’), followed by 2 one-gal shows. She was the highlight at each New Year’s eve party and did a fantastic job commanding the stage and mesmerizing the audience with her “Deadly Sexy Magic”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I’m really proud of how she comfortably owns the stage with crowds of 500 and draws them in. The demand for Singapore’s first professional female magician and the ‘Magic Babe’ brand was so great that we had to turn down shows after all 3 time slots of the night were booked up</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">http://backstagebusiness.wordpress.com/2010/01/01/2009-in-review/</span></p>
              <p>He is losing his stage to her. People want to see a chinawoman trying to look like she's doing a striptease but giving despo guys blue balls. Not this midget and his self designed illusion. I don't hate these guys but their actions and behaviour have pissed not only me but alot of magic purist out there. But then again, here's everyone's favourite chinawoman of magic saying:</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 20px;">I was tired, having performed at three earlier stage gigs, but it’s always about having fun with the audience. Honestly. I don’t care about so-called “magic purists” and their self-indulgent ways, it’s always about the audience and never about your ego for professional commercial entertainers like ourselves."</span></p>
              <p>About the audience? Not the customers? Your so called egos have called us magic hobbyist a dog. F**k you "professional  commercial entertainers".</p>

              <p>what's new from hall. Continual hard selling, poor quality gimmicks and pirated dvds. They can do no worse as a f**k up magic shop after being downsized. And as I predicted, they will go down. They are a sinking shop even if we stop throwing pebbles at them. It's only a matter of time. No supplier or distributor want to supply them products to sell already what else can they sell? Homo Solomon's dancing monkey act?</p>
              <p>This forum is not a hate thread towards every other magic shop but more of the services that those shops provide which totally is wrong, like our newest "victim", the screwed up duo.</p>

              <p>yes it is true. I have no idea who you are knowing that much details, however the fact about the mightyfactory is true. They only person stuck there is this cannot-make-it person.</p>

              <p>Let's not deny that she has the goods but to stick around those losers means that she probably have problems marketing herself, obviously cannot think for herself  and is hoping to hop along for the ride. Hopefully that one day JC might want to sleep with her and make her famous like chinawoman.</p>
              <p>And yes singapore's highest paid duo of magic apparently have very limited costume change. Hell even the short barf keeps wearing the same jeans over and over and over again. Got money buy illusion no money buy new jeans?! Or they trying to act poor and evade the tax auditors?</p>

              <p>true true, and here I thought I was the only one observing all these but it seems there are fellow comrades noticing the same thing too.</p>
              <p>Look at magic boutique. Bob Chua used to do reviews for them for their magic products before the Merlin Award issue but their arrogance made him drop out anything that involves them. IMS. What a joke.  Check this out.</p>
              <p>http://blog.ellusionist.com/angel-gets-merlin-award/</p>
              <p>Let's not deny the fact that Criss Angel did receive an award from them. But then who hasn't? You give $25 you get cert, membership plus mentalism dvd. You wanan get into Magic Circle or Magic Castle's membership, be a good performer, go for test and be recognised (like Cyril getting 2007's Magic Castle Magician of the Year). Hell God knows if the duo paid that Andre the Giant look-a-like to give them a piece of plastic shit. </p>
              <p>Last I heard, was that Chinawoman threatened to leave that short barf after they were kicked out of Arena that if they do not get anywhere, she's leave him and his "conceptmagic" will collapse. Poor poor Sum. You've let that chinawoman get the best of you. </p>

              <p>sorry lah, Criss wasn't even interested in this don't know what award..please read quote : "Unfortunately Criss wasn’t on hand to personally accept the award, so they allowed a homeless person wearing Angel’s clothes to accept it on his behalf."</p>
              <p>Giving Criss this award is just a publicity stunt to get media attention on the unknown International Magic Society and nothing more.</p>
              <p>I have for the longest time thought that the International Magic Society and all others was a load of crap. I too took the time to review all the awards given out by these groups and they are usually given to nobodies. If any of you saw the 2007 Magic Awards you know what I’m talking about. The worst acts received these so called awards. If I ever received an award I would accept it and then throw it in the garbage.</p>
