              <p>Hi, my name is Hock Tiong. Like many people who posted on this forum thread, I too, fell victim to this particular magic shop's scam.</p>
              <p>A few weeks ago, my son bought a couple of DVDs from this shop.</p>
              <p>Suspicious of the quality and authenticity of the DVDs, he approached friends as well as other magic shops to further investigate.</p>
              <p>His suspicions were confirmed days later after comparing a similar DVD title purchased by one of his friends from another magic shop.</p>
              <p>My son came to me and we proceeded down to magic hall to demand an explanation.</p>
              <p>The salesman denied everything that we threw at him and we had to leave the shop empty-handed, angered and frustrated.</p>
              <p>That was when I decided to take matters into my own hands.</p>
              <p>The following attachments were email dialogues between me and magic hall.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i29.tinypic.com/dxn0oo.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As you can see from their first reply, they didn't question me anything and quickly arranged to have the situation resolved as soon as I mentioned about the law.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i31.tinypic.com/aub1ip.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 2nd reply was an excuse that I personally think is nonsensical. I myself run a business that deals in the import export trade. Having knowledge of the contents of what we deal with is the lifeline of our business. If magic hall claims they don't open up their packages, isn't it the same as a drug dealer telling the police they didn't know they were carrying drugs?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Read their reply very carefully- "...so that I can trace back on that transaction and get the ORIGINAL pieces for you."</p>
              <p>Confessions from the horse's mouth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i26.tinypic.com/2cx6cd3.jpg" alt="" width="1052" height="317"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This reply really says it all. Reason why they kept pushing for the titles is because they needed to re-order from their suppliers, which most probably will take a few days to arrive.</p>
              <p>That means all the DVDs and maybe a lot more other products, everything in their shop are pirated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i29.tinypic.com/140jjiv.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the end, I managed to get back a total of S$1350 in refund and the 17 original DVDs will be arriving at my house via delivery from them in a few days time.</p>

              <p>Hi Lee, after reading your post, I can't help but tried to hopefully get a refund for an item I bought from magic hall too.</p>
              <p>I got it.</p>
              <p>It wasn't a big amount, but I still felt better after realising that I got duped by their lies.</p>
              <p>I thought after getting a refund, I don't want to have anything to do with that shop anymore.</p>
              <p>But after monitoring this forum for a few weeks, I made a trip down to plaza singapura and confirmed that they are still selling the fake prop which I bought, openly and having little or no remorse of what they had done.</p>
              <p>Hence, I just wanted to post my email here and urge fellow victims to go get their refund back. If they refuse, step up and demand they do. Tell them about this post, this evidence of Lee's and mine. Tell them that why is it that they refunded these people but not you! There's nothing to lose. They are breaking the law, not us. They cheated and treated us like idiots like there's no tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Since they have no regards of the law and authorities of Singapore, let's make them pay a higher price for cheating us.</p>

              <p>Dvd and other items already fake to cheat people.</p>
              <p>When everything is exposed to the public, they still dare to come up with more ways on how to cheat people with their magic lessons? </p>
              <p>man that can't be move is right. anyone can learn better and more tricks at other shops and a lot more cheaper.</p>
              <p>First day i start this forum, i told everyone that i will never let this go, even if they close the shop, re-open under a new name. as long as sulaiman and kenneth are behind it, i will hunt them down all the way.</p>
              <p>Even if its not a magic shop, i will make sure their business will never prosper.</p>

              <p>To <a href="http://sgforums.com/users/257900">Demarco_DonJuan</a>, how do you prove that the dvd is pirated? What are the signs so I could point it out to them. I am a newbie you see. It doesn't have the IFPI number at the back. Does that count?</p>
