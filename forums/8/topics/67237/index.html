            <div class='col-md body'>I totally lost interest in going back to work (on hosp leave now).<br>This year, the management hire a female boss.  She is bossy and gei kiang.  Try to make changes for the sake of proving that she is working, but all the changes are unnecessary and will lose money one.  Tell people to give her this report and that information, but give a very short notice (eg. today ask us, today we must give her).  But she only asks people pia for her for fun only.  Some of the things that I manage to rush for her, she didn't even comment on it (I think she didnt' even look at it).   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>The worst of all, she bian tai one.  She doesn't like female staff to be younger and prettier than her.  My colleague warned me against that.  But can't expect me to look older than her what!  She is 40 plus already!  How to look uglier than her?<br><br>I didn't want to believe that at first.  But later on, I heard some talks about what she said/did behind my back.<br>My colleague also warned me not to flirt better than her with customers.  Ok lor.  In the first place, I don't flirt with customers.  But all my customers are definitely nicer to me, cuz they have been working with me for so long.<br><br>If I want to write everything that she did within this month, I can write a book liao.<br><br>Every day, my immediate superior (who's a guy) calls me to complain kenna harassed by her, even during weekends.  But what can I do?  I could only encourage him to accept her so that life can be easy for the rest of my dept.<br><br>Every day, this guy calls to complain the harassment and all the stupid changes that she tries to implement.  (stupid changes include removing products that bring in millions of dollars).  I hear all these complaints until I don't feel like going back to work anymore.<br><br>how?    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Last time, I have a colleague quite similar to that bian tai lady boss u mentioned. The worst thing is I am working directly with her and only her, excluding my direct boss...... She is 40+ and married with children.... Seems like Singapore got a lot of Bian Tai ladies (regardless of married, single, divorce or whatever marriage status)  in 40+...<br><br>In the end, I buai tahan her and left the job willingly..... I dun want to suffer and stress because of this (I dun mean work, I mean her). If I want to counter-act her, I will need to be more bian tai as her, which I think I am not that type of person and dun wish to become one.<br><br>Bian Tai ladies really make the world worst.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

She is bossy and gei kiang.  Try to make changes for the sake of proving that she is working, but all the changes are unnecessary and will lose money one.  Tell people to give her this report and that information, but give a very short notice (eg. today ask us, today we must give her).  But she only asks people pia for her for fun only.  Some of the things that I manage to rush for her, she didn't even comment on it (I think she didnt' even look at it).   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>The worst of all, she bian tai one.  She doesn't like female staff to be younger and prettier than her.  My colleague warned me against that.  But can't expect me to look older than her what!  She is 40 plus already!  How to look uglier than her?<br><br>I didn't want to believe that at first.  But later on, I heard some talks about what she said/did behind my back.<br>My colleague also warned me not to flirt better than her with customers.  Ok lor.  In the first place, I don't flirt with customers.  But all my customers are definitely nicer to me, cuz they have been working with me for so long.<br><br>If I want to write everything that she did within this month, I can write a book liao.<br><br>Every day, my immediate superior (who's a guy) calls me to complain kenna harassed by her, even during weekends.  But what can I do?  I could only encourage him to accept her so that life can be easy for the rest of my dept.<br><br>Every day, this guy calls to complain the harassment and all the stupid changes that she tries to implement.  (stupid changes include removing products that bring in millions of dollars).  I hear all these complaints until I don't feel like going back to work anymore.<br><br>how?    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>now den i noe u do flirt around....hehe......</div>

I'm still in charge of this company!"<br><br>You see this woman wants to be in charge of everything.  Even things in other department.  So the executive director buay tahan and told her off.<br><br>But the rest of the senior management wants to be politically correct and not challenge her.  Why?  Because she was brought in by the number one guy in the company.  She was working with the number one guy last time for more than ten years in other company.  (I wonder how the hell did she manage to keep the job for so many years when she totally cannot work one).<br><br>Now when she proposes something stupid, all the other directors will say "oh yes yes.  This is a great idea.  I'm sure this will turn our company around".</div>
