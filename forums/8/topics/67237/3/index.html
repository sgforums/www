They 'jump hop' from  company to company like a PEST.. After they've messed things up they just change job... And they move in a 'group'.. Meaning when one of them manage to get a job, they try to get the others in..... These are the people who ain't really interested in their job nor the company's outcome... Usually just enjoying life as the day pass and sometimes even bossy and like you've described... 'Trouble-creators' for fun....<br><br>Of course, other than the 'official' way, there're also 'darker ways' of doing things...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>But try not to confront the other guy who brought her in....
