I think its the ligament or tendon which is hurting....probably nothing to do with veins.<br><br>The general rule is....don't use any part which hurts (its your body's way of telling you that it needs rest and recovery!).  Most minor sports injuries will cure by themselves, but I wouldn't take every case for granted.<br><br>Er....I'm not a medical expert and I don't think any gym trainers are, although some may claim to be and talk like one.  Please beware of advice from such people.  Best is to see a doctor, pal....really.  I think to see a specialist, you have to be referred by a normal doctor first.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by xwin:</div><div class="quote_body">anyone here knows how to train chest muscle? not in the gym...like at home or stadium...pls give me advise...thanks...</div></blockquote>To build a well defined and handsome chest, you will need dumbell and barbell with a bench. These need not be in the gym and can be done at home.<br><br>Anyway, here is an article from <a href="http://www.sgfitnessonline.com" rel="nofollow">www.sgfitnessonline.com</a><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>So You Want A Gladiator's Chest</strong></span><br><br>Heh... who doesn't? Here is how you can do it.<br><br>Although many people thought that there are 2 separate chest muscles, well there arenÂ’t. The chest muscle that you see is all one muscle, although they may be called by different names such as pectoralis major, minor, clavicle head. All chest exercises work your chest muscle but from different angles which places different stress on your chest.<br><br>You need to use a variety of chest exercises at various angles to properly stimulate growth. Each different angle you use with any chest exercises will reach into various fibers for effective stimulation of different area of your pecs.<br><br>It is highly recommended that you use free weights than machines for chest developments. There are many reasons for it of which we will discuss in another article. Chest exercises that use any chest machine should be avoided as it has many disadvantages that will not only produce the results you want but may cause injuries because of its narrow range of movements and the lack of involvement of synergistic muscles.<br><br>As with any lifting, proper lifting form and technique are of paramount importance.<br><br>Many people seem favor using only 1 or 2 types of chest exercises and almost invariably, itÂ’s the flat bench press and flyes. Well, to build a powerfully broad chest, that is a fatal mistake as you do not adequately hit the pecs from all angles.<br><br>Here are some common but effective exercises that you can perform to build that gladiatorÂ’s chest! All chest exercise will not only work your chest but also your delts, biceps and triceps. But you need to focus and visualize to concentrate the force on the chest. Also work on the full range of motion and squeeze your chest hard at every top of the movement. Never never bounce or use momentum with the weights as that may not only cause injuries but nullify your efforts. Lower your weight slowly.<br><br>A word of caution though. You will need a spotter or a trainer for safety. At the same time, your spotter can correct any mistakes and help you with forced reps to reach into the deep tissues to elicit maximum stimulation.<br><br><strong>Flat bench press: </strong><br><br>You may perform this exercise with dumbbells and barbells.<br><br>To start any flat bench exercises lie on a flat bench and firmly position your feet flat on the floor. Never at any time lift them off the floor as you will many people doing that in the gym. Make sure that your butt, back, shoulders, and head are firmly in contact with the bench! Never arch your back!<br><br>Using a grip wider than shoulder width place your arms straight up with your hands gripping the bar with your thumbs wrapped around the bar.<br><br>Hold the barbell/dumbbell above your body then lower slowly to the lower part of your chest even with your nipples. Then drive the barbell/dumbbell up until your arms are straight and your elbows almost are locked, the squeeze those pecs hard. Repeat for the next rep.<br><br>Incline bench press: Exercises like the incline bench press will target your muscle fibers from the upper chest area. For the mature folks, this exercise is recommended because with age, your muscles and skin may sag and so developing the upper portion of your chest will make it broader and hold the chest muscles up. Doing flat bench press emphasizes on the lower part of the chest and so may result in the drooping look. In body building terminology, those are called bitch tits. You want a massive chest, not tits.<br><br>Your form, methodology and equipment will be exactly the same as the flat bench press described above except that you are doing so on an incline bench. The incline should not be more than 45 degree as anything more, the emphasis will be on your delts and arms.<br><br><strong>Dumbbell flye :</strong><br><br>For this exercise you will need a flat bench and a set of dumbbells.<br><br>Sit down on the edge of a flat bench with one dumbbell in each hand. Lie back, keeping the dumbbells close to your chest. Lift the dumbbells over your chest by extending your arms.<br><br>Maintain a slight bend in your elbows. Keep your hips and shoulders flat on the bench, and your feet flat on the floor. Again, as with other exercises make sure that your butt, back, shoulders, and head are firmly in contact with the bench.<br><br>Your arms should be lightly bent and slightly wider than shoulders and your palms should be facing each other. Keeping a slight bend in the arms slowly lower the dumbbells to the sides of your body in an arc-like motion.<br><br>At the lowest point, your bent elbows should be on a horizontal plane, even with the bench. Slowly bring the weights back up over your chest in an arc. Imagine you are circling your arm hugging a tree. The bend in your elbows should remain constant throughout the exercise.  As with the other exercises, remember to squeeze those pecs and focus on your pecs working.<br><br><strong>Incline dumbbell flye:</strong><br><br>For this exercise you will need an incline bench and a set of dumbbells.<br><br>Incline flye exercises follow the same principles as the flat bench flye chest exercises and the incline bench press.<br><br>Flat bench dumbbell press:<br><br>For this exercise you will need a flat bench and a set of dumbbells.<br><br>This exercise will work on many synergistic muscles and is excellent for overall growth.<br><br>Sit on the end of the flat bench with one dumbbell in each hand resting on your knees.<br><br>In one smooth motion, roll onto your back while bringing the dumbbells up to a position slightly above your shoulders.<br><br>With your palms facing out and elbows bent at a 90-degree angle so that your upper arms are parallel to the ground. Press the weights out over your chest in an extended movement.<br><br>As you lift, concentrate on keeping the weights balanced and under control. Then follow the same path downward as you lower the weights until your arms are slightly below parallel to the floor.<br><br>As usual, keep your butt, shoulders and hips firmly on the bench.<br><br>Incline dumbbell press exercises:<br><br>For this exercise you will need an incline bench and a set of dumbbells. This exercise will work on the upper portion of your chest.<br><br>Forms and techniques are exactly the same as the flat dumbbell press except that the bench is inclined at not more than 45 degree angle. You can also experiment with various inclines less that 45 degrees.<br><br><strong>Dips: </strong><br><br>The dip bars should just be outside shoulder width.<br><br>A forward leaning dip will work your  chest, triceps and shoulders being. In using dips as chest exercises, instead of for your triceps, your hands should be slightly wider than shoulder width. Make sure as you lower yourself that you let your elbows flare out and lean your body forward.<br><br>Lower your body down until your shoulder joint is below the elbow joint and try to avoid locking your arms at the top. When you gain strength in time to come and able to do more than 10 reps per set, you may wish to add on a weight belt for greater resistance.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>Remember that you need to lower slowly and in a control manner for your exercises to be effective. Otherwise its just plain gravity that pull your weight down and thus you are cheating yourself of tremendous gains.<br><br>There are many other chest exercises, for example, the pec deck, cable cross-over machine, etc. But if it's size, strength a physical appearance you're looking for stick to chest exercises like the ones listed here. You can perform the other exercises for varieties though.<br><br>When you perform these exercises meticulously and eat sufficiently with the right supplementation coupled with enough rest for muscle recovery, in 3 months time, you may be able to tell Hercules to move over for here you come!

Last time I checked, dips worked your triceps.  You may stretch it while your doing dips but it doesn't work your chest was well.<br><br>As for push-ups, you have to find a way to increase the resistance.  That's what weights are for.  You can subsitute weights with the rubber tubes or tapes.  They come in different resistance.  But generally, without increasing your resistance (or weights) you won't see a big increase in strength or size.  The other factor is maybe you're a small person with nothing to work with.  Your body needs something to work with.  Increase your protein intake unless you're already a porky type person. lol</div>
