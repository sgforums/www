            <div class='col-md body'>dreams are said to be representations of the subject's subconscious, ie, the true feelings of the person or some has said, a collection of all past and present events shaped together.<br><br>from your description, i gather that you might be experiencing or at least expecting hosility from your family members. was it something you did recently? how is your relationship with your family members?<br><br>of course, there is a minority out there who hypothesized that dreams are omens of future events. this might mean you shall watch your relationship with your family ppl and do not take them for granted etc.<br><br>if you keep having the same dream as the days go on, it is advicable to seek the advice of a trained psychologist.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yoz, a few cents worth of advise:<br><br>You really think too much. dreams do have meaning but its hidden. It is not what you see, but what you cannot see. Just some tips, dreaming of ya father knocking ya head, may means that there is something important that you may forgotten. Just my prediction. Pushing you room to room may means that you may face different conditions/ environment recently. Each family members may just be giving you hints on how to adopt to these environment. ha ha<br><br>take care and dont think too much</div>
