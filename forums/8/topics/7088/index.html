            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ray,<br><br>looks like i am very busy with the forum nowadays, with so many posts directed to me hahaha ! I thought i can just focus on the "Poly vs JC" one.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by ray:<br><strong>it is strange you would say you are reacting to them separately when in your first post you say that you will help his mother if possible and hope that he will "stop backstabbing me after that".<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>note that i did not use the word <strong>hope</strong>. I said "I <strong>believe</strong> he will stop backstabbing me after that"<br><br>Hope and believe are 2 different things.<br>Hope --&gt; desire<br>believe --&gt; be certain of<br><br>So i did not help his mother bearing the "desire" that he will stop the backstabbing. It is not a trade.<br><br>But I am certain that my good deed will be able to <span style="font-style: italic;">influence</span> him to be truthful as well. And do things that are right and not things that he likes (and not right).<br><br>However, i recognise that such "influence" can be weak hence i stated in the last sentence "Even if he does, I have no regrets". Because my deed is not done in exchange for his mercy, so what is there to regret ?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>i'm curious abt your concept of "truthfulness". care to elaborate?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Interesting question. I will elaborate briefly.<br><br>Truthfulness means :<br><br>sincere<br>honest<br>frank<br>truth-speaking<br>truth-telling<br>truth-seeking<br><br>When you do things, do it from the heart (<strong>sincere</strong>). Be <strong>honest</strong> with everyone you interact with, and most importantly, be honest with <span style="font-style: italic;">yourself</span>. Be <strong>frank</strong>, but not to hurt. Practice <strong>truth-speaking</strong> and <strong>truth-telling</strong>, do not make up stories about other people and do not lie. And most importantly, have a <strong>truth-seeking</strong> mind.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>you hope that he will "stop backstabbing me after that"?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>again, i would like to highlight to you that i did not use the word "hope" but "believe"<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>is your "truthfulness" conditional upon hoping ("hoping" being the key word, whether it actually happens is another thing) that he will stop the back-stabbing?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>again, no hoping<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>your idea of "truthfulness" seems to be one that is "in-itself", a kind of authenticity regardless of outcome, tho in practice, there seem to be strings attached.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>no hoping, no strings attached. It is not a trade.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>what would the "true" motivation to act be then?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>you act with compassion. You act in the way which is morally and ethically right. You act towards the truth. And you don't act for the benefit of yourself (gain happiness or self-satisfaction) although you <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> benefit from it.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>what happens if i know that in doing a good deed i will feel good. and that is my motivation. am i then acting in a non-moral way?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>yes, that can be a motivation. A person being paid to do good deeds has money as his motivation.<br><br>But the intention of helping is wrong.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>even if i bring abt good consequences?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>If you do bring about good consequences that is great, but your intention of doing good deeds is wrong.<br><br>When it comes to truthfulness, it is not only about doing good deeds and helping people. But also doing it with the right attitude and with sincerity. Only then your attitude and believes will last.<br><br>If you help because you would like to seek happiness, one day, when you no longer find happiness in helping, you will stop helping. Therefore you help because you believe you <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span> help and not because you <span style="font-style: italic;">like</span> to help.<br><br>Truthfulness starts from oneself, and through his pursue for truthfulness, his soul will be enriched and strengthened.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi again<br><br>don't have much time to write. try to keep this short. but i doubt i'll succeed.<br><br>yes, i know there's a difference between "hope" and "believe", but the way you have elaborated on it makes your "belief" more insidious than it needs to be. you say:<br><br>"But I am certain that my good deed will be able to influence him to be truthful as well."<br><br>while "hope" and "belief" may be different states of mind, the way you have used the terms imply the same outcome. in both cases, there is "influence" (your word, not mine), because the possibility of influence comes from your prior action and not because of your state of mind. but your state of mind (your intention) may accompany your prior action, in which case both "hope" and "belief" aim at the same outcome. (btw, i wouldn't equate "believe" (or rather "belief") with being "certain of" something. if u were certain then you wouldn't have to qualify that statement with "Even if he does, I have no regrets".)<br><br>so you say: "...i did not help his mother bearing the "desire" that he will stop the backstabbing."<br><br>let's substitute it with your preferred phrase then, shall we?: "...i helped his mother "certain of" the fact that if i did, he will stop backstabbing me".<br><br>i think you made yourself look worse than i ever intended.<br><br>"you act with compassion. You act in the way which is morally and ethically right. You act towards the truth. And you don't act for the benefit of yourself (gain happiness or self-satisfaction) although you may benefit from it."<br><br>the question asked was the source of your motivation. what is the basis for what you consider to be morally or ethically right? what is this thing you call "truth"? were you born knowing it? did you hear it from somewhere? were you brought up in it? is it following what society (or a religion) thinks is right? is it all and only a process of socialisation? what does it mean to act from compassion? what is this thing called compassion? what is the real motive behind your actions. that's my concern.<br><br>"yes, that can be a motivation. A person being paid to do good deeds has money as his motivation.<br>But the intention of helping is wrong."<br><br>you may have misunderstood the initial statement, which was: "what happens if i know that in doing a good deed i will feel good. and that is my motivation. am i then acting in a non-moral way?"<br><br>let's say that i know that helping an old lady across the street will make me feel extremely proud of myself. i will feel good abt it. and so i help her. is my action still morally praiseworthy? and if not, why not? is your conception of what constitutes moral goodness too narrow?<br><br>"If you do bring about good consequences that is great, but your intention of doing good deeds is wrong."<br><br>is "intention" the only criterion for the attribution of moral worth?<br><br>"When it comes to truthfulness, it is not only about doing good deeds and helping people. But also doing it with the right attitude and with sincerity. Only then your attitude and believes will last."<br><br>as an extension of my example, i know that helping an old lady is a good thing. but if i didn't feel good abt myself for doing it, i may not do it at all. so the motivation for my doing it is that i feel good after doing it. would that be morally wrong? what is the "right attitude" and what is "sincerity"? that i should be altruistic and help the old lady just because i "should"? but why "should" i? what is the reason behind this "should"?<br><br>"If you help because you would like to seek happiness, one day, when you no longer find happiness in helping, you will stop helping."<br><br>on the contrary, it would seem that the more i help someone, the more it would seem to myself (at the very least) that i am a "good" person. and so the more i will want to help in the future, because i feel good abt myself (which, incidently, is different from "seeking happiness"). i have provided an explanation for continued moral action - that we feel good doing it. what is the psychological motivation for continued moral action in your notion of "should"? if there is no motivation at all, then under your account, there is no reason to act morally at all. it's just something ppl do. so would you say there's no reason behind moral actions? or are you going to talk abt some vague notion of the "right attitude" and "truthfulness" again? is there an objectively "right attitude" and notion of "truthfulness"? it seems from your account that there must be since you say: "with the right attitude and with sincerity. Only then your attitude and believes will last." if i act on something (some belief or attitude)that has only subjective validity, then surely my "right attitude" and "sincerity" will not be something that can "last". or if it lasts, then it does so only as something that constantly changes. does "right attitude" and "sincerity" fluctuate?<br><br>"Therefore you help because you believe you should help and not because you like to help."<br><br>again, why do i believe i "should" help? and it would seem as tho if i help because i "like to help", that would make me more morally praiseworthy than someone who helps because they think they "should" help.<br><br>i'm just playing the devil's advocate in all this. i'm interested in your view of moral actions. have a pleasant day.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ray,<br><br>nice to hear from you again   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> You make me laugh when u said you want to keep the post short ! haha. But sometimes, it is just difficult isn't it ? Who can write a one sentence book ?<br><br>Well, before i continue my discussion with you, i will like to highlight that the issue we are discussing here is a very <span style="font-style: italic;">personal</span> one. That means, i only state <strong>my</strong> stand. It is my own believes in life and i do not represent anybody else.<br><br>Glad that you would like know more about my believes which i strongly hold. This is a good time to test my own believes   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> see how much I understand my principles in life.<br><br>Here we go,<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>in which case both "hope" and "belief" aim at the same outcome.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>this is the intelligent side of truthfulness, ray. In truthfulness, we stress more on the "intention" of doing things instead of the "outcome". I believe that with the right "intention" the "outcome" will be right. Sometimes in life it is difficult to judge a situation. For example :<br><br>When I was younger, i used to hate giving beggars money because i always doubt if they are really beggars. Know what i mean ? So i never give them a cent. But til I understand "truthfulness" i begin to think that it is the intention of doing something that is more important. So now i give them money. It is a guide in my life. It guide me what i should do and what i should not do.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>let's substitute it with your preferred phrase then, shall we?: "...i helped his mother "certain of" the fact that if i did, he will stop backstabbing me".<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>truthfulness is powerful. But its power takes time to unleash. I believe truthfulness will spread. I believe if i am truthful to people, one day they will be truthful to me, though i don't know how long it will take them.<br><br>Your quote is not my original words too. I said "I believe he will stop backstabbing me after that"<br><br>if you put the "certain of" into it, you'll get :<br><br>"I am certain he will stop backstabbing me after that"<br><br>This "believe" and "certainty" is given to "truthfulness" and <span style="font-style: italic;">not to him</span>. It is the believe that "truthfulness" will one day makes an "untruthful" person see the light.<br><br>If i write the sentence with more elaboration, it will go like this :<br><br>"<strong>I believe</strong> that the power of truthfulness will guide him to the right path eventually and <strong>he will stop backstabbing me after that</strong>"<br><br>note that the "believe" is given to "truthfulness" and not to him.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>what is the basis for what you consider to be morally or ethically right?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>this is a very tricky issue. Schools have been teaching the students what are "morally and ethically correct" for centuries but yet we do question that sometimes in our lives. I question that too.<br><br>My guide to what is "morally and ethically correctly" is this :<br><br>a. do not hurt other's feelings<br>b. do not lie<br>c. help when approached (if it is within your ability that is)<br>d. help when you can<br><br>these are the basic things which guide me along.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>what is this thing you call "truth"? were you born knowing it? did you hear it from somewhere? were you brought up in it?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>yes, we are not born to know it. That's why when you asked me what is my definition of "truthfulness" i stated "truth-seeking" as my last but most <strong>important</strong> point. We need to have a truth-seeking mind. And a truth-seeking mind is not all that complicated.<br><br>What i like about the idea of "truthfulness" is its simplicity and yet powerful.<br><br>Of course, it is always not easy to find out the truth in this complex world. And that's why in "truthfulness", we emphasize on oneself. We should seek the truth <span style="font-style: italic;">within ourselves</span>.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>is it following what society (or a religion) thinks is right? is it all and only a process of socialisation?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>religion and society do have an influence over one's thinkings and believes. But truthfulness, at least to me, does not link me to any religion. I do not believe in the existence of supernatural beings. But the teachings of Buddha does come close to it since in Buddhism, there is no supernatural being.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>what does it mean to act from compassion?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>that means you do things from your <span style="font-style: italic;">truthful</span> heart.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>what is this thing called compassion? what is the real motive behind your actions.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>you do not do things <span style="font-style: italic;">for</span> compassion, but you do <span style="font-style: italic;">with</span> compassion.<br><br>actions are only physical realisations of our believes.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>you may have misunderstood the initial statement, which was: "what happens if i know that in doing a good deed i will feel good. and that is my motivation. am i then acting in a non-moral way?"<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>i have not misunderstood you ray, i understand your point. I brought up the "money" thingy is because i will like to show you that the "outcome" of things does not reflect too much on a person.<br><br>One person may help a needy from the heart and the other being paid to do it (but reluctant to do it without money). They may result to the same outcome. Commonly in life, we only see the outcome and we judge people with that. In "truthfulness" we want to see the "intention" of the people more.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>is my action still morally praiseworthy? and if not, why not?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>your action is praiseworthy, your outcome is is praiseworthy too but not your intention.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>is your conception of what constitutes moral goodness too narrow?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>you can have your own judgement after you are clearer with my idea of "truthfulness", ok ?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>is "intention" the only criterion for the attribution of moral worth?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>"intention" should be in the picture when you are talking about "moral worth" Not just the act itself or the outcome of the act.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>but if i didn't feel good abt myself for doing it, i may not do it at all.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>yes. And that is the problem i face in my social work. People usually do things only when they "feel good". We cannot blame them. Students at the age of 13 to 16 (the majority of volunteers in Singapore) may not understand my idea of "truthfulness".<br><br>And most of their intention to join in social service is to "feel good". For example, one of the forumites is down lately, and she did some social work and she felt good (dunno if you had read her post). Many young volunteers are like her, started doing social work because they are "down" and then they left after they are "up" again. Their service does not last though some do.<br><br>I will not reprimand her on her intention becos many social workers started doing social work because they want to "feel good" as well. Because by helping the needy makes you feel you are "better" and "useful" it is very therapeutic. It increases the self-worth of an individual. But we hope that ultimately, that social worker will come to a point when he no longer carry out his task simply becos he wants to "feel good". "Doing good deeds becos one feels good" is only a <span style="font-style: italic;">start</span>.<br><br>That is why we always encourage people to take part in social work. And that is also why government make it complusory to make secondary school students to do certain amount of community service in a year. Our intention is not to "force" them to help. But to let them "involve" in the "helping". There is this saying:<br><br>"teach me and i will forget<br>show me and i will remember<br>involve me and i will learn"<br><br>we are doing the "involving" part now and not just the "showing" and "teaching". Many will leave the social service once their "complusory term" ends, but we hope some will stay. We hope some will go beyond the "feel good" part and really pledge their long term service.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>what is the "right attitude" and what is "sincerity"?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>i had already covered the "right attitude" part, it is similar to my definition of "truthfulness" and my defintion of "morally and ethically right"<br><br>Sincerity is about doing things from the heart. It acts towards the truth. You help because there is a need to help and you are able to help not because you gained something after you help. Any gains will only be "by-products" which you may or may not have it at the end of the day.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>that i should be altruistic and help the old lady just because i "should"? but why "should" i? what is the reason behind this "should"?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>what i "should" do and what i "should not" do is guided by my "morally and ethically right" definition. (see it again if you like)<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>on the contrary, it would seem that the more i help someone, the more it would seem to myself (at the very least) that i am a "good" person.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>yes, you are very right here. Like i say before, doing good deeds is very therapeutic. That's why we encourage those youngsters who are "at the edge" to help in social work. You may not know about this.<br><br>Those youngsters who are on probations are posted to different social service centres to help, hoping that during the "helping" process, it increases their self-worth and guide them back to the "right path" again.<br><br>But in real life, the feeling of "good person" is not enough to support the large need of volunteers in Singapore. Students only help when they are free (during school holidays). And we will have lots of volunteers during the school break. So many that we dunno what we can let them do. But during the other seasons, we have a great shortfall of volunteers. <span style="font-style: italic;">Only those who truly sees the need to help will bother to set aside some time to do social work.</span> Hence the feeling of "goodness" does not carry one person very far.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>because i feel good abt myself (which, incidently, is different from "seeking happiness")<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>they are the same, both are personal gains.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>what is the psychological motivation for continued moral action in your notion of "should"?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>it is the <span style="font-style: italic;">believes</span> that one holds that provide the motivation.<br><br>We live in a society full of people. And i see that i have a <span style="font-style: italic;">social responsibility</span> to every single individual around me. They deserve my help and do not deserve my hurtings.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>so would you say there's no reason behind moral actions?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>it is the responsibility that i have towards others that make me help.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>or are you going to talk abt some vague notion of the "right attitude" and "truthfulness" again?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>hahaha, "truthfulness" is vague to me initially too. Cos it is so simple and yet so powerful. And we usually don't believe something <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> simple can be so powerful. We usually look for sophisicated ideas and thinkings and believe that they are great even though we can't fully understand them. Human can be that foolish.<br><br>Hope after these discussions with you, you will have a better idea of my "truthfulness"   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>is there an objectively "right attitude" and notion of "truthfulness"?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>you are repeating your question, but nvm, i think you wrote this post in a rush right ?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>does "right attitude" and "sincerity" fluctuate?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>my definition of "right attitude" and "sincerity" is very simple (scroll back and see ?) and I do not see how they can fluctuate.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>again, why do i believe i "should" help?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>you are repeating your question again.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>and it would seem as tho if i help because i "like to help", that would make me more morally praiseworthy than someone who helps because they think they "should" help.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>yes, in this world many only value the outcome of things and neglected the intention totally. It is sad. I personally wish that things will change. But "intention" is something hard to see, how do you gauge a person's intention ?? That's where the "truthfulness" comes in, you have to be frank, honest and truthful to yourself <span style="font-style: italic;">becos only you yourself can see your intention.</span><br><br>I do not do good deeds because i like to be praised. Praisings, like self-satisfactin and happiness, are only by-products of my actions. Sometimes i have these by-products, sometimes i don't even if i do the same good deed.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>i'm just playing the devil's advocate in all this. i'm interested in your view of moral actions. have a pleasant day.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></strong></blockquote><br><br>no problem ray, i like it when people challange my believes in life becos that is the only time when i can put myself to the test.<br><br>I do like to continue this discussion with you   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But i will like to remind all forumites out there again that the issue we are discussing here is a "highly personal" one. The believes i stated only apply to <span style="font-style: italic;">myself</span>.<br><br>[This message has been edited by LittleMan (edited 25 April 2000).]</div>
