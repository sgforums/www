            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there,<br><br>Here it goes :<br>1.Love is something when you take away all the hatred, all the pain, all the beautiful and all the memories, yet you are concerned about the other person and still feel for the other person.<br>2.Every now and then, even years later, something reminds you of the other person - a certain smell, a few notes of a song, a place, a few words and some item which    trigger your thoughts - and suddenly you feel just as bad as the day the other person had told you he/she never wanted to see you again. If you want to know the honest truth... you never completely get over a person you really cared about.<br>3.The way I see it, people are either meant to be together or they're not.<br>4.What makes a relationship is not whether how smart, good-looking or any kind of good qualities that one must possess, all you need is X-factor, that thing which allow you to attract the other party.<br>5.If love, whether human or divine, was the solution to the person's problem, it was not<br>the one that could be given; it had to be bestowed by a gift. That is the most difficult part for a person in his/her search for a relationship. If love is ever a choice, who would want exquisite pain....<br>6.Romantic love is a dream where we wasted half our lives searching for,  and realize in<br>the end, we came here alone since we are born and in the end, leave this world alone as well.<br>7.There are 2 tragedies in our lives, one is not getting the relationship which we want,<br>and the other is getting the relationship we want that ended in realizing the other<br>person is not the One. I always prefer the latter. What about you?<br>8.We do what we must in life... Sometimes we can choose the path we follow. Sometimes our choices are made for us. And sometimes we have no choice at all. Love is something that we try to seek the path, but never know where we are all the time...<br>9.It is always surprising how small a part of life is taken up by meaningful moments. Most often they are over before they start even though they cast a light on the future and make the person who originated them unforgettable. So much are those fast going romances, where you find a moment that you love someone and then he's gone from your life and it is a flash of the moment.<br>10.If you love someone, set her free. If she comes back to you, she is yours forever, and if she doesn't, it is never meant to be.. It is something sad yet, we have no control over<br>these things...<br>11.I wish that someone could come into my life and love me, then set me free from the<br>shadows of the past and push me to higher heights of life. But love is not about trying<br>to get someone to relieve your pain, but to make you a better person by loving someone.<br>12.Love is the wierdest thing.. At one point, you think you will not love this person, and<br>somehow, fate makes a twist and you realize that this person is not that bad afterall,<br>and then you decide to love this person, the other person does not share the same feeling anymore. What an irony yet sad fact of life.<br>13.Love comes when a person least expects it... So, don't bother to search, it will just comes to you when you don't bother about it...<br>14.Love &amp; Lust belong to Desire, and Desire is always cruel.<br>15."You are mortal: it is the mortal way. You attend the funeral, you bid the dead farewell.  You grieve. Then you continue with your life. And at times the fact of her<br>absence will hit you like a blow to the chest, and you will weep. But this will happen less and less as time goes on. She is dead. You are alive. So live." from Dream to those who cannot get over with losing their loved ones to Death...<br>16.Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so a simple phrase like "maybe we should just be friends" or "how very     perceptive" turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart.<br>17.When you wake up from your dream the next morning, realize that the other person is    no longer by your side, you will be feeling pain and sorrow for the loss, and wonder    why you are still in the same position as before. Love is a double edged sword, it     heals and yet hurts at the same time.<br><br>Have a good day<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>

No human vocabulary can be used to describe 'Love' in full.<br><br>Love is when someone whom you love hurts you really badly, you will be able to forgive them and still be able to care, cherish and feel the same way about them before they hurt you.<br><br>Love changes you and makes you become a better person. Love makes you see the world and people around you in a different perspective. Love gives you hope. Love is well... Love!<br><br>-----------<br>Love is patient and kind;<br>love is not jealous or boastful;<br>it is not arrogant or rude.<br>Love does not insist on its own way;<br>it is not irritable or resentful;<br>it does not rejoice at wrong,<br>but rejoice in right.<br>Love bears all things,<br>belives all things,<br>hopes all things,<br>endures all things.<br>Love never ends.<br>~ 1 Corinthians 13:4-8<br><br>-----------<br>And now abide faith, hope, love, these three;<br>but the greatest of these is love.<br>~1 Corinthians 13:13</div></blockquote>Well Peiyi, although I'm a Christian, she's not. And maybe this might be one of the factor that prevents me from being too open with her since she's very against my religion.<br>Thanks for the bible verses anyway! I feel a bit better...i think.<br></div>
