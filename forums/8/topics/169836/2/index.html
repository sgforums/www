            <div class='col-md body'>actually buying electronics nowadays depends on 'LUCK' more...same with computer stuffs...  Last time if u buy the old TV.. they can last very very long... some of my family members even have the TV from father's era 1970s-1980s... never have any problem...<br><br>but now.. they come up with 'warranty', 'extended warranty' 1 year, 2 years n so on... Why huh? maybe those engineers are so sly that they can design their products which can last only within 1.5 years.. then they give warranty for just 1 year.. After 1.5 year, when u go there.. only hear .. "sorry.. no more warranty"...<br>Dunno lah.. maybe nowadays  really buying electronics depend on luck... some can buy things and never spoilt.. some can buy branded things and break down most of the time... I got an IBM computer last time always hang no matter i format it.. but no problem with my cheap self-built computer now...<br>Whatever it is.. Companies WIN!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's just a solid pad with a fan underneath utilizing forced convection to remove heated air faster.  You get the same effect blowing a normal size fan from the sides back or front, but of course you need a gap underneath to allow air to ventilate.  Newer laptops utilize their keyboards as heat sinks.<br><br>The speedball thingie merely raises the laptop to allow the gap and natural ventilation.  You can save 10 bucks and find something like book to prop up your lappie instead but of course make sure it don't block the fan that ventilates the cpu. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
