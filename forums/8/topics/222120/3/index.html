            <div class='col-md body'>Most likely either a berry aneurysm at the base of brain or an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), which can occur anywhere on thye surface of the brain. The former is due to a weakness in the wall of the blood vessel whilst the latter is an abnormal formation of arteries and veins.<br><br>Rupture can lead to rapid death and treatment has to be quick and not always effective. Treatment before it ruptures is much more successful but it is often silent, the only common symptom being epileptic fits in some (not all) patients. Yes, it does occur in young people and is one of the causes of sudden death in them.  A berry aneurysm can be part of a syndrome and may be associated with hypertensiona and renal disease in patients with polycystic kidney disease. AVM is not associated with high blood pressure.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow this is scary as I am in the same age group.  Is this aneurism thingy linked to lack of sleep or too much mental stimulation?<br><br>I'm not sure but the way our world is running so fast and furious on a computer screen, I find that our brains simply have not enough rest.  Instead of doing any off-screen rest or unwinding, I find more and more pple going into the internet or playing computer games to unwind.<br><br>Personally, I am not sure if the brain or eyes are really rested or more tensed and stimulated as a result of such "unwinding".</div>

The guy was only 30+ too and his daughter was 2..One day we did not ever see them again.Nobody knows whether he had woke up or.........ICU is a solemn place where alot of sadness is so automatically strangers,families and frns hanging around there somehow find strength in one another</div>

He goes home to look after his kids after work.<br><br>the "vice" that she can think of was that at one time, he joins a cycling group that cycles all over Singapore over-night. After the cycling session, he goes home to sleep.<br><br>He helps out at the RC and so the Joo Chiat MP knows him. The Joo Chiat MP was going to visit him at the hospital, according to wife, I did not know if he actually visited. I assumed he did. Rather thoughtful of him, IMHO.<br><br>More info on his illness:<br><br>he started having headache on the 11th or 12th<br><br>He continued to go to work (business, husband and wife team, no employees)<br><br>During this period when he was suffering from headache, (he went to work but could not do much since he has the headache and was sleeping at the office most of the time) his wife carried the burden of running the business and worked until midnight almost everyday.<br><br>POINT TO NOTE: I think that it is better to find a wife who is there in times of "sickness" than a wife who looks like a super model and is only there in times of "health." Not that those who look like super model are only there in times of health. BTW the wife is not bad looking.<br><br>Last thursday, 23rd / 24th his wife went to bed after work at around mid-night and he showed her that his left arm had no feelings and reaction.<br><br>He held up his arm and let it drop to show his wife....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
