              <p>Is it really useful to take a specialist/advance diploma from Polytechnic?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because specialist diploma is like only a part time course which can be completed in 1 year time..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I am the employer I will not recognise it lor just like why some employers do not recognise diplomas issued by private schools simply because they only take a few subjects and it is completed in 1 year..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taking a specialist diploma from polytechnic is like taking a diploma/higher diploma/degree from a pte school, not really recognised..</p>

              <p>for me, I worry about it when I get the specialist/advanced dip first. institutions are like brand names. poly's are always better branded and recognised for their quality than private schools. perception is reality to the beholder.</p>

              <p>To angel7030: Many poly students will go overseas uni since they are given alot of exemptions and can graduate up to 2 years earlier for certain degree courses so not everyone feels that NUS/NTU are the world. Local unis never granted any good exemptions for local poly students so a decent number of the top poly students all rather do their degrees overseas.</p>

              <p>To some people, 2 yrs off their education gives them an earlier chance to enter the working world and start earning. Considering 2 yrs of salary and the bonus, pay increment u will get in 2 yrs. Some people feel its more worthwhile compared to wasting extra years in a local uni.</p>
              <p>It should be well known that taking a degree at the university itself and taking a degree from an overseas uni that offers their degree locally in a private school has very different value. A degree taken in private schools here are less valuable with relatively the same fees so its best to just take it at the actual university.</p>

Alot of reshuffling and remodelling of the courses in recent years so i am unsure about it now but during my time it was possible. Not sure about the other adv dips since i only know about the adv dip relevent to my field of study that time.</p>
              <p>To angel7030: Many poly students will go overseas uni since they are given alot of exemptions and can graduate up to 2 years earlier for certain degree courses so not everyone feels that NUS/NTU are the world. Local unis never granted any good exemptions for local poly students so a decent number of the top poly students all rather do their degrees overseas.</p>

              <p><br>I heard about it last time you can get direct masters in University of Wales or some other Universities in UK.</p>
              <p>But if it's a scam or not, nobody really knows. Not surprising since you can go direct to University with only your O'levels.</p>
              <p>And I don't think employers here in Singapore are confident enough to hire employees with Master degree without their Bachelor degree.</p>

              <p>To some people, 2 yrs off their education gives them an earlier chance to enter the working world and start earning. Considering 2 yrs of salary and the bonus, pay increment u will get in 2 yrs. Some people feel its more worthwhile compared to wasting extra years in a local uni.</p>
              <p>It should be well known that taking a degree at the university itself and taking a degree from an overseas uni that offers their degree locally in a private school has very different value. A degree taken in private schools here are less valuable with relatively the same fees so its best to just take it at the actual university.</p>

              <p><br>I am not saying it as different value, there are many students from overseas coming here to enrol in our U, i think a degree is just an education and discipline attained, and the most important is when you go and apply it into your working, some top U grad are just line managers, and some diploma holders are already GM. In public sector, NUS and NTU is priorty, as for private sector, they dun mind overseas U grad.</p>
              <p>As LHL said, "we bring the universities to your doorstep" so that you save all your cost and still get degree, because govt knows that most of them who went overseas, tends to work and stay overseas, ending in talent drained</p>

              <p>U do notice that our top students are mostly also going overseas to UK, US, Aust etc while those coming to sg are mostly from Asian countries so theres still a difference.</p>
              <p>Uni degree is just an entry ticket to the workforce but to alot of people, the quality of that entry ticket is important.</p>
              <p>A overseas degree done locally has lower value because u are not taught by the same staff in the overseas uni even though u do their exams and get their certs. A uni ranking is more base on their amount of research output etc etc and the profs producing such results are not the 1 teaching u so u are in a way not getting the full value from that uni.</p>

              <p>Considering the number of years the polys have already been offering such a thing, i believe there are still companies willing to hire such students since our polys all have good reputation in local companies and any tieups they have with foreign universities should receive a certain level of creditability.</p>

              <p>Is it really useful to take a specialist/advance diploma from Polytechnic?</p>

              <p>Because specialist diploma is like only a part time course which can be completed in 1 year time..</p>

              <p>If I am the employer I will not recognise it lor just like why some employers do not recognise diplomas issued by private schools simply because they only take a few subjects and it is completed in 1 year..</p>

              <p>yes.</p>
              <p>Since you are already a polygrad and working, taking an advanced diploma will certainly add on to your career path (+ a few hundred dollars more).</p>
              <p>But it must be something of relevance to your current work and discipline or for your future work.</p>
              <p>And ... taking this kind of advanced course is supposed to enhance your work performance. it is different from getting a diploma to be qualify for an interview.</p>

              <p>You are also right. Let me put it from two perpectives.<br><br>1) the poly would want to make it as much viable as possible for them to run the programmes. So they will not do a cost/benefit for u. The onset is for u to ensure that u enrol in something that benefit and not burden u later.</p>
              <p>2) benefit is a subjective matter here.  On the flip side of what u said above.</p>
              <p>Say u are a dip in business grad from the poly. You <strong>are already</strong> in a career in the retail industry. You go n take a spec dip in retail from the poly and after graduate wouldn't it gives u a good advantage in applying for a retail supervisor/management job?</p>
