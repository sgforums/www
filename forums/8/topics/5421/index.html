            <div class='col-md body'>I gotta agree with ataraxia on why people prefer to have the irc approach instead of the real life approach.<br><br>First of all, there is no need to get embarassed over those long pauses inbetween conversation speeches afterall its very common to pause for a while then reply later or much much later in irc.<br><br>Secondly, the person gets to choose who they want to associate themselves with later on if they found out that that person they known earlier on isnt such a nice person or such. Because, words is always easier to express in the form of text instead of speech or face to face conversations which words that you may want to say will never come out at all.<br><br>Thirdly, anomaly. People can avoid you on irc if they figured you're a cad or a luuzr by just changing their nicks and ident informations. But if you met that person before they will almost certainly recognise you unless you go for a plastic surgery  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your answer: Girls on the streets and Girls in chatrooms are different. For one thing, you may not know for sure if the person you are chatting with is a girl at all. Also, in a chatroom, you can lie without having to keep a straight face.<br>Also, chances of finding a really attractive female specimen in irc is very slim. I know this because I've gone out with alot of them before and well, what can I say? There have been a few who impressed me with their wits and seem stylish on the net but when I actualy met up with them, I was so disappointed with their looks that I cut the evening short. Call me a jerk, I dun care but I was really disappointed.I guess really attractive gals seldom need to find a life on the net and have other priorities alerady (like how to shake off admirers).<br>ironically, I was at Borders 3 mths ago (beautiful pple galore!) and I noticed a rather sweetlooking girl with long hair and big eyes standing opposite me, reading a book. When I went to Cineleisure to meet up with friends, I saw her again in the ticket queue so I thought, what the heck, might as well say hi to her. Have got nothing to lose. And what do you know? We started talking and it seemed quite natural after a while(after supid cliche lines like" you come here often?" on my part.)<br>That girl is now my gf.<br>So guys out there, do not hesitate to chat up someone you like on the streets because you never know, she could be the one for you. And it won't hurt us to say a few words to them.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Ash, I was a monk once when I was 16 pr 17 yrs old....It was fun.  REally.  Even though u have to endure sitting on ur leg the whole day (literally) for initiation, and the constant praying and one meal a day thing, it was quite fun...manual labor, and a sense of doing something for ur soul and ur families soul that gives u that inner glow....and the $100 question...<br><br>Did I ever think about girls?  Believe it or not, becoming a monk doesn't stop ur urges, in fact, all the young monks were horney perv because we weren't allowed to touch or let girls touch us in any way.  Chat is ok if it's for friendly purposes or religious purposes....But we would just gather as a group and look at girls and comment...ha ha., quite bad actually, but a lot of fun.<br><br>I guess it was like ur NS, but a shorter term sentence, but less rigor and more praying and concentration for spirituality....but fun....:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Huh??<br>Firewire!What kind of monk were you!?!?!*utterly stunned beyond words*<br>Let us not generalize..I am sure not all monks are horny pervs. By saying that, does it make you a horny perv as well?Hmmm...<br>Geez!! I'll never look at a monk the same way again!<br>As for your question, Fellowes, I dun know about irc.It seems everyone is hiding behind a web of deceit or putting up a facade to an extent. I think that what Rifraff advocated sounds right. Face to face conversation is more sincere and body language speaks volumes more than words.<br>I dunno wat the preoccupation with irc is, the last time I tried was 2 years back when I was still in sec sch and it seemed like a pretty lame place to hang out and a lame thing to do unless one is running a 40 degree fever and cannot do anything else to entertain oneself(ie go out).<br>I'm for real life vs cyber existence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunatley we weren't taught a fighting style....hah hah...:-)<br><br>It was a peaceful thing....Buddhists don't believe in violence in general....  And it wasn't just me that was a perv.....at that age, the hormones are still raging!....  Believe me, we went to other temples a few times a week to pray with others.  Sometimes the drive would take the whole day, literally.  We would drive around in what we called the MONK MOBILE....A really cool van..really big.<br><br>Anyway, we would go to these other places and guys who've been in longer than us, some younger (13yrs) and some a bit older(20++)....but it was always the same.  Don't forget that we're still humans here.  That's what makes the priesthood and mionk-hood so respected and holy is because they aren't castrated....They live their lives having to deal with their human "needs" and urges and impulses.  How do u attain enlightenment if u don't have to struggle to attain it.  If u didn't feel it, then u shall never attain Nirvana...The whole idea behind it all is to be self-sufficient, control ur urges, but don't deny that they exist.  U must have a distinct knowledge of it's existence for u to manage it....Which was why they didn't allow females of any kind to even touch us or brush by us....they must stay far enough to not allow contact by accident.<br><br>And we thought we were pretty slack at our temple, but when we visited the others, they were even more slack.:-)  Yes, they had to pray more than us, but when visiting, we had to follow their schedule of prayers and when we bow down to pray (as buddhist monks do), u could hear some of the other guys breathing very heavily and not coming backup when we came up to finish prayers...it's really funny.<br><br>Great experience....<br><br>And there was this one time when we "little Buddahs" had to get out and refill the petrol, we encountered a whole gang(5 guys) of black guys who were really big in a car next to us. (our temple was in the middle of the really scummy neigboorhood).  The leader came up to us and asked us what we were...and knowing that Americans have this perception that all monks are taught how to defend themselves by way of the Shaolin Style, (thanks to Hollywood), I told the guy that we  were monks....Then the guy started to back away slowly....Then he said." Oh shit, u mean, like that Shaolin shit u guys be learning since young?!!"<br><br>Then the other guys from the group started coming in also and said that we knew most forms of hand to hand combat...The guy promptly returned to his vehical cursing and apparently telling his gang what we were...as they drove off, they just looked at us in a very scared manner......<br><br>Let's look at it like this...if u grew up thinking that monks knew how to kill u with a few twist of their wrists, u would be scared also if u saw a whole van full of them walking out just to fill one petrol tank....<br><br>As for online personae, I would like to say not everyone has a false persona online....What u read from me u'll find that I am like this in real life....Except for the anger....in real life, anger is almost non-existent...almost.:-)   I also think that there is a difference between the bulletin boards like this and IRC.  I guess board posting is more personal and thus more of ur real self comes out....<br><br>The IRC is about u interaccting with strangers on a real-tinme basis so u say what comes to ur mind what.....so want to have fun also can.....on the message board, there's usuually some thought before things are said...and I also prefer here than the IRC...real life more interesting also than IRC.</div>
