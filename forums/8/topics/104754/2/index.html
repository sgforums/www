Those that I have met and worked with in real life are great people -- people that I'll respect.<br><br>But hor.... on the internet, those that I met, each and every likes to talk about sex.  I was playing internet game.  One of them as for a/s/l of everyone (as usual lah).  I usually don't respond to that cuz the ang moh usually dunno where Singapore is.  And I have to explain it's in Asia lah blah blah blah.<br><br>Tonight I just put there Singapore.  One of them, while the game was still on, sent me PM to ask me where it is.  So I told him it's between Malaysia and Indonesa, a very very small island.  Then he told me what he does lah and ask me what I do for a living lah.<br><br>Then slowly he asks me about my body.  I didn't reply him.  Then he told me about him having sex four times last night lah.  Wah liew!!!!!!   The game ended fast.  Thank God!!!  When the game ended, I quickly logged off.<br><br>I long long long time never talk to stranger already.  I think after this, I will again long long time don't respond to PMs in that kind site.  </div></blockquote>ai yoo. My dear girl.. u dun even know who the heck u are speaking to on the net lorr. At most if u are in a clarke quay pub and this angmoh guy keep bugging u about ur bod then u got a case, whoa, if u wanna diss angmor at least get some credible evidence "laaarghhhhh" roflz <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>but i guess, of all my friends, its the white people who talk about sex the MOST rather than asians.
