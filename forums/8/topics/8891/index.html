            <div class='col-md body'>I've always felt that nurses are so noble, but doctors get more reconigition as they diagose the diease. But nurses are the ones that take care of you and bring you back to good health. However, Singapore employs a lot of nurses from other countries and some of them seems to be here because of a better pay and seems rather bochap.<br>Maybe nurses pay should be higher, they work so hard but get so little.<br><br>------------------<br>**I want u to be with me.....<br>be with me in the morning...be with me in the nite...with me when its dark out...with me when its light...<br>I want u to be with me...no matter what we do...just keep this reminder...of how much I love u...**</div>

Its cos that they like to be nurses or that the academic qualifications only allows them to be nurses and none higher. Who wun like to be doctors and be respected and have a higher income?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Thats their job, cleaning shit, clearing patients waste and doing all those dirty jobs.

            <div class='col-md body'>Okie.. I know that they are some nurses who haf no where else to go so they turn to nurses.. But I haf heard of cases where pple who go to Bishan ITE Nursing Course, get rejected. I think they are pretty strict on this. Ur attitiude.. Ur dressing... all these determines ur application in to the nursing courses. they will even scold u on the spot becoz u wear coloured contact lens.. They say that u will scare ur patients, and hence naturally u will not get ur place in the institution.<br><br>I know that it's a joke for many of us when we were back in our Sec sch days.. saying that we will go to nursing if when we do very badly for our O'levels. Sounds as if it's a place for condemned pple...  But Strangely, there are a lot of pple out there who have this passion for nursing that they can score as low as 10 points of less and join nursing in the poly.<br><br>I think the students nurses are not as bad as we think... If not there will not be foreign pple wanting to come to S'pore to be nurses. Furthermore, there was this report on the news the other day saying that there none of the nurses interview wanted to leave S'pore even when the hospitals are paying better salaries even in S$. Maybe there is some biasness in the interview or in the selection for the interview. That I wun know...<br><br>Even though they leave for greener pastures they still have to clean all the messy shit, to handle large amount of blood, and needles... It's their job that initiated my admiration.<br><br>Maybe even if there is some education qualification involved, I think they still did their best serve us. I think their service it's already beyond their education level.<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
