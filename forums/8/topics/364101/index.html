              <p>50%???</p>
              <p>Where got so much free time? Even if u take all my long breaks everyday its just max 3 hrs of breaks a day and thats at most twice a week and thats spend sleeping or project discussion.</p>
              <p>Exercise as far as i know only NP has a complusory programme for yr 1 and other polys still have nothing similar yet but might be changing since the poly napfa pass rate is super low.</p>

              <p>It is not true that 50% of the time in poly is spend on misc
                                      activities like exercise and random talks. In poly, we do projects very often and for temasek poly, i do not think that there is a exercising program... It also depends very much on the course that you're in. For example, business courses in tp do have quite a lot of project but there are also exams too as compared to some science courses. In year 3, there is also Student Intership programs where students are attached to a company for experience and I think poly diploma's are much more recognised as compared to night schools.</p>

              <p>It doesn't mean that if you have bad results, taking a private cert will be better than a local poly diploma.</p>
              <p>The 1st thing you should do is cut down on gaming and start to really work hard. If you keep on gaming, no matter where you go, your results will still be like crap. ( No Offence )</p>
              <p>For example, there are people who get their ACCA cert in 2 years, and there are people who couldn't get it even after 6 years, so go figure about it yourself.</p>
              <p>Just as gunner suggested, retaking "O" level is an option, but that is only if you are willing to put in extra effort and time.</p>
              <p>Another two questions in mind are what career do you want to have next time in the future., and what courses interest you.</p>
              <p>If you just try to jump into any course which will take you, odds are your results will still be crappy as you do not have an interest in these courses and will not be motivated to work extra hard on your studies.</p>
