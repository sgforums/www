I was at a Hong Kong site and the people there commented that Singapore forums talk nothing intelligent and mostly only about crude sex...<br><br>I think that this is because Singaporeans are in a sexual no man's land. The people are confused. Prostitution is illegal but just go to Geylang and it is openly available.<br><br>A little schizophrenic don't you think?<br><br>Cinema Restricted shows are so mild but you can see bestiality on the net.<br><br>Very schizophrenic don't you think?<br><br>So when people are confused... they have to try to figure it all out for themselves and one way is to express themselves in the forums. Until they come to terms with it, the issue is in their head all the time and they talk about it constantly.<br><br>It is only natural that many Singaporeans think about sex all the time since they are suppressed and it does not make any sense.</div></blockquote>AndrewPKYAP is asking for admission to IMH to understand what is schizophrenia. Before you claim split mind or mindset, understand it is a split from reality. Next, before it really gets out of topic, we must understand humans are sexual creatures but we do have the odd deviants who are totally asexual. So please do not claim that Singaporean males are of a single mindset only.</div>

In my opinion, even those guys who posted sex crap in the bar forum are just jokers trying to make people laugh and make the bar forum more lively.<br><br>Thread starter should not take the information in bar forum as facts in reality.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by red_amoeba:</div><div class="quote_body">Dear Slipshade,<br><br>Which of those foreign forums have you been to that are "clean" and stay away from "sex", those religious forums huh?<br><br>If you look at sgforums it self, there are various topics for different discussions - if you are looking to discuss serious topics, there are the relevant topics.  If you look at Chit Chat or Bar and draw the conclusion that Sg guys always post sex, then its ambigious.  Thats what Chit Chat and Bar is for.  If I want to talk about computers, I won't post in Chit Chat.  The name Chit Chat and Bar already suggest the theme of topics.<br><br>And for your information, there are lup sup forum sites in HK, China, Taiwan and US - and the topics they post are more crude and more explicit than what you get here.<br><br>And I also disagree that only guys are involved in posting such threads, if you look at some of the blogs that the girls have put up, you will know. </div></blockquote>.........................<br><br>Some guys here have officially convinced me that some Singaporeans either have a habit of reading selectively, or they have problem comprehending simple English. Most of your questions, can be answered in my original post.<br><br>And no, I <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">DO NOT</span></span></strong> go to bar forums. So yes, those Singaporean guys are talking excessively about sex in very normal forums.<br><br>I'm not sure about the girls because I have not encountered any Singaporean girls who acted in the same way, unless you are talking about a certain topic in 'Aunt Agony' that made its way to the papers. But that topic itself is rather debatable. LOL<br><br>I wouldn't know how bad those lupsup Western and Asian forums are because I don't go to such forums. So my only references would be those normal and DECENT forums.<br><br>Will I be surprised to find all sort of crazy topics in lup sup forums? The answer is 'no'. Why? Because it's lupsup.<br><br>It also amuses me that how some of you innocently, or maybe arrogantly thinks that what I've said only took place would only take place in lupsup forums.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Quinsy:</div><div class="quote_body">You already know. So why start a topic to talk about them? They ARE afterall, TEENAGERS. Raging hormones and immature mind. Let them be. <span style="font-style: italic;">Geez.</span></div></blockquote>Here goes the comprehension problem again. I'm not even going to bother telling you the real purpose of this topic.<br><br><blockquote>i dun see why the refraining from talk abt sex is a virtue. probably its onli my opinion but care to further more explain it?<br><br>wat i think that talking abt sex is juz another common topic among men juz like talking abt the latest season of ladies clothings could be also a common topic among women. if u dun like it den dun read it or walk away.</blockquote>Another comprehension problem.</div>
