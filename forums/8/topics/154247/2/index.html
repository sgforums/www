            <div class='col-md body'>I think all rankings are somehow or another baised. You can never find a set of rankings that can truely reflect the quality of the university in question. Thus, we should never put too much faith in it.<br><br>While saying that, not everyone sees it that way, what about employers? I'm sure if they are to hire someone, they'll look for some kind of gauge that would identify the quality of the institution the perspective employee comes from.<br><br>Maybe some of the forumers who are in HR could enlighten us as to how employers actually look at individuals and the institutions they came from. This has been at the back of my mind for some time, trying to decide for myself which uni to go to, but those rankings are always giving me doubts, not on my part, but my employability in the future.

That may not be the most accurate but it's the best way.... that's how they have been ranking unis for so many years</div></blockquote>But high paid CEOs, presidents and all that may not be that great also mah..what about people like Durai, Chen Jiulin and L.Dennis Kozlowski? Would you want to rank their schools based on them? Maybe they were brilliant, but something went wrong somewhere? Doesn't mean you receive a world class education from a world class institution means you're a world class integrity figure..<br><br>Just my two cents  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
