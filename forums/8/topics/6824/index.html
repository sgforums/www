            <div class='col-md body'>Pui eh... i had a dream abt a funeral too. In the dream, i was attending a funeral wif my family, i didn't know whose funeral was it, so i kept running to the front, but no matter how fast i tried to, i juz couldn't c who it was. When i woke up, i was so scared. Not long after, my uncle passed away. He didn't passed away normally, had a heart attack n nobody knows, was juz left to rot in his own house.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>N in another dream, when i was much younger, i didn't know abt this until my cousin told me a few years back. N when she told me, i couldn't recall doing anything of dat sort. At that time, my paternal grandma was lying in hospital (4 wat i dun remember, think it was stroke). During dat period, while i was at home, i suddenly screamed in my slp. My parents came rushing to me n according to my cousin, i sat up n told them dat "Ah Po mei2 you3 lu4 zou3 le", n juz laid back onto the bed. A few days later, she was discharged n they were supposed to go fetch her. B4 they could get out of the house, the hospital called us... they told us that while my granny was preparing in the bathroom, she had a terrible slip n had to be hospitalised. A few days later, she was gone too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Sometimes when i think back of all these, i feel so scared.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Y does it has to be me...<br><br>------------------<br>ming4 zhong1 ruo4 you3 zhong1 xu1 you3<br>ming4 zhong1 ruo4 wu2 mo4 qiang2 qiu2</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know whether you call this a dream or not. But it's kinda strange that it happened to me only.<br><br>In my unit, there's this dog which we RPs love very much. Though only an animal, the dog was very much like a human being to me. Whenever all my colleagues go out for supper, leaving me alone to guard the gate, I would TALK with the dog and treat it like a proper human, I never told my colleagues abt this crazy behaviour of mine.<br><br>However, our Unit Head hated this dog very much and wanted to get rid of him. One day, he juz ordered one of his men to bring that dog on a transport and send the dog all the way to Sembawang Sea Sports Club and dump him there. This was to ensure that he cannot find his way back. All RPs don't know abt this until a staff told us abt it!<br><br>We had to force the dog up the transport and as we shut the door, we saw him crying. I volunteered to send the dog off and had the nasty job of throwing him there. Sigh...<br><br>A few days later, I had this strange feeling when I stepped into camp a few days later. It was only when all of us went to bed when I had this dream...<br><br>The dog was well and alive and was running around happily in the camp compound. I was hugging and playing with him, I even remembered the dog giving me licks on the hand. Juz then, I felt something like a presence in the restroom, I woke up quickly and sensed 'Something' in the room. The feeling that I was being licked by the dog, still remained on my hand. And there was also a garlicky smell on it.<br><br>(P/S: I did not eat/handled ANY garlic b4 I go to bed! I used to feed the dog with raw garlic during his meals)<br><br>Next day, I told my colleagues that the dog is dead and was killed by the dog-shooter frm PPD. None believed me...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey Bush, know something? You got kinda a psychic skill. You'll be able to use this skill to find out about things like winning 4D numbers, forsee the future etc.<br><br>This is what I read from "Mind Control" by De Silva.<br><br>Here are some of the bits and pieces I picked up.<br><br>The mind is at its most efficient stage during 'Alpha' when we are asleep as compared to 'Beta' when we're awake. Thats why we often read reports that the human seldom uses more than 5% of his brain's potential, the truth is that this potential(sixth sense, forcast the weather, mind healing) can only be unleashed during Alpha, or Theta during deeper sleep.<br><br>However as we can see, more of us can't have control over our thoughts during sleep i.e dreams, (if not I'll be dreaming of a new  Hollywood star every other day). The key is to be 'dynamic' in your dreams rather than 'passive'.<br><br>So Bush, you have demonstrated some dynamicism in your dream. Try to control urself in ur dream to find out stuff that you want to know. BTW, if you really see some 4D numbers, don't forget to post it up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey ppls...dreams are just your brain doing some overtime work while you sleep.If you examine it carefully..you will come to realised that when you are tense in your work or studies..you don't usually sleep well and have all sorts of dreams or nightmares. But if you have a nice day without much worry... or a workout at the gym or other sport...it is likely that you will wake up fresh the next morning. The bed, matresses and pillows..also do play a part in how you sleep in the night. As for the unexplains happening which was interpreted in your dreams..they are coincidences. I do have an Uncle who happened to see his elder brother in his dream. When he woke up..he went to see his brother (both are married and not staying together) to checked on his well-being...but he was alright.That was 2 years ago. He is still around today...touchwood.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dreams are indeed mysterious. It has got to do with the power of the brain, an organ which no one has yet been able to decipher fully. If I'm not wrong, Einstein only made use of 7% of his brains. Who knows what we can use the remaining percentage for. Telepathy, psychic healing, travelling through time, predicting the future, who knows what our next dream might mean......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, ok, here's the book that will fulfill ur dreams i.e go on a 'date' with XXX chio bu(notice how I'm trying not to sound explicit).<br><br>Its called The Silva Mind Control Method by JosÃ© Silva. I got it at Borders @ $15.99, could be leeched off somewhere there. So maybe you'll like to buy it somewhere else. Yes I know, u cheapos out there must be thinking of the library. See? I have sixth sense already, proving that the book is useful.<br><br>Well, this book is not all about dreams but rather the way to tap the unlimited potential of your brain. Right now, you are using your brain as much as if you are using your 'little brother' to pee ONLY.<br><br>Of course, not all that you dream are 'sixth sensical'. Your dreams are affected very much by your daily experiences. The old adage that 'Ri you shuo si, Ye you shuo meng'(English: Day think what, Nite Dream what) is quite true in that sense. Just had a dream that my stocks fell by 70 cents, woah, scary.......which leads to my advice especially to Bush to be extra discerning with regards to 4Ds that you meet in your dreams. They may very well be the product of your day thoughts!<br><br>Once the powers of the mind is unleashed, the possibilites are endless. Think Uri Geller, who has the documented power to bend metal stuff. I sense someone wondering if he could harness his brain power to do the reverse i.e. to straighten 'stuff'. Answer the question yourself, get the book!<br><br>I can't really gurantee any success you have with the book. Cos the 2 things u need here is patience and discipline, which is why Shaolin monks are so highly skilled in this aspect. But I have personally experienced significant improved health after practicing some techniques in the book.<br><br>One last point to note is that you must not attempt to use your powers for evil purposes, otherwise, you run the risk of going 'Zou Huo Ru Mo' i.e running amok. And, no, I don't know if having sex with Pamela Anderson is considered evil.<br><br>Space and time really limits what I can share with you guys, so try it urself and share with us what u have! Ciaoz!<br><br>P.S: Don't bother to search the internet for this stuff, cos you can't find anything more than creative ways to make desserts out of brains.<br><br>Hey, I think I really have sixth sense.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Axl (edited 03 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, mind control discussions aside. A question for you.<br><br>Do you prefer pleasant dreams or nightmares?<br><br>It sounds obvious at 1st glance, but think this way, when you have a pleasant dream such as hitting 4D, you wake up and find it is only a dream. You feel miserably disappointed.<br><br>But you have a nitemare, and you wake up(assuming you do), "Whew! Luckily for me, that was only a dream!" I personally feel relieved and glad after a nitemare in that sense.<br><br></div>
