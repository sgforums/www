            <div class='col-md body'>hmm....i remember an incident 3 years ago when i was studying for my Chem common test in JC. I spent 8 hours doing nothing but studying organic chem until i was quite saturated.<br><br>when i went to sleep, i dreamt of benzene rings. not as interesting as Kekule's dream of the structure of benzene though.<br><br>another incident was when i was trying to figure out some chem problem which i couldn't solve. i spent lots of time on it till i was damn tired and fell asleep. i dreamt that i was working on the problem, and was actually making headway.<br><br>i woke up 6 hrs later and immediately knew how to solve the problem. apparantly, i figured out the solution in my dreams. queer, but true.<br><br>mysterious dreams? i've never quite had a nightmare, but i had one dream which make me wake up rather stunned.<br><br>i dreamt that i was in a old dilapidated room in a broken down house. it was dark and the only light in the room came from the moonlight streaming in from the window. there was an old sofa and a wooden table in the middle of the room with a box on the table. i was inexplicably drawn to the table and saw that the box was full of old books. i took up the first book and a photo fell out. it was an old black and white photo which was yellow with age. it showed a girl sitting on a sofa with 5 other girls around her. while i recognised the girl on the sofa, and 1 of the other 5 girls, i couldn't see the faces of the rest. without any reason, i just felt an overwhelming sense of melancholy, sadness and regret. i cried on the spot.<br><br>waking up, i found that i was really crying. duh....<br><br>enuff of old stories now...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I have lots of dream, and one of the reasons I like to sleep, is becos I get to dream  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, just want to share with you some of my dreams  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>(1) I have a couple of dreams that came true. One is about my exam... I actually dreamt of taking the exam, but can't remember seeing the paper  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> If I remember, I might have gotten full marks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>(2) Once, I dreamt that I was being chased by an assasinnator...was killed... but that dream was a little too ridiculous... more like the scenes you see in a movie, example, things like douging (spelling mistake here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ) from bullets...<br><br>(3) I dreamt I condemned Andy Lau's song in front of him  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>(4) all kind of R(A) dreams...<br><br>(5) I dreamt of my dead grandma...there was this dream where I dreamt of my grandma, and her clothes is like magic...keeps changing before my eyes.... Well, and it seems I'm the only one in the family who dreams of my grandma quite often...dun know why...<br><br>Yeah...that's all for now...see if i can remember more  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
