Women who were not having sex at all scored about 13.5.<br><br>Depression in the students who sometimes or never used condoms was more severe the longer they went without sex.<br>The scientists looked at other factors, such as the use of oral contraceptives, frequency of sex and personality type, but none could account for the findings.<br><br>The magazine said the results are not a complete surprise as scientists know that semen contains several mood-altering hormones, including testosterone.<br>'Some of these have been detected in a woman's blood within hours of exposure to semen,' it said. --Reuters<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>An interesting "urban legend" reaches my mailbox. Amusing and hopefully worthy of sharing with you :<br>Eating Sperm is another old n ancient "Urban Legend" dating back to the Biblical times. The fact is there are countless women the world over who love consuming sperm than anyone cares to imagine.<br><br>French women are the most avid sperm-eater in Europe, having learned from the Arab females whose Arab husbands believed that by 'eating' his sperm on both 'mouths', the wife can be addicted to be faithful.<br>In fact in Algeria n in many other Arab countries the husbands penis is, must be for the first time, be inserted in the wife's month n thus the first drop of sperm on a wife is consumed by the mouth before the pussy had the chance. (If the woman displeased the husband, sodomy is the punishment, but strangely some women loves this rear entry after a few 'punishments')<br><br>And so the legend just lives on. In fact it is a secret craving and culture among almost all females. In the old days, a Chinese family will always appoint "an adviser" to the bride on the secret arts of sex, the doÂ’s and donÂ’ts, and it's various articulations, rewards and consequences. The adviser will always get a fat angpow when a baby boy is born and a smaller one or nothing if a daughter is born in the first year of marriage.<br><br>One of these 'teachings' is the male sperm is the "core" of the males' (thus family's) health n essence of life. Too much of it 'spewed' must be replaced almost immediately by simple consumption of "Essence of Chicken' or consuming Chinese herbs regularly. The Cantonese and the Hakkas are champions in this concept and so we can safely say they are the greatest sperm-eaters among the Chinese. The Japanese women are not far behind.<br><br>Since so much value is placed on the sperm, the consumption<br>of it is "discouraged" as it drains the husband's youth and vigor.<br>So it is considered a 'selfish' act by the wife. But if the husband is hale and healthy, then it is OK but still, it must be 'replaced'.<br>Sperm-eating is "dangerous" if the husband is sick or ill. Besides, consuming the sperm is just transferring the sickness or disease to the woman.<br><br>But the smarter women 'steal' sperm regularly as long as she 'replace' it. Otherwise over a period of time if the husband is noticed to be suffering from ill-health, she woull be blamed for draining away his youth, vigors and general 'wellness'.<br><br>Just remember the old Chinese adage "Chiak Shi Hock, Hock Shi Chiak"<br>in refined translation it means :- "To Eat is Luck n Blessing and Food itself is Luck n Blessing too"<br><br>Woman are great sperm connoisseurs - 100 percent- all of them.<br>The only difference is more or less, regularly or once in a while. Some do it with ginseng drinks or other nutritious drinks as 'chasers'. Great and famous beauties Like Cleopatra were reputed to be living on a regular daily dosage of male human sperms. The list extends to vicious demons like Empress Dowager of China (Manchu Dynasty) even to Queen Victoria of Great Britain, even perhaps to the present QE2.<br><br>Celebrities like Marilyn Monroe, Mae West, Elizabeth Taylor, etc. are also said to be regular consumers. Helping them keep young and youthful, improve their sexual prowess and all that spout from the "Fountain of Youth"<br><br>There is low-profile but highly profitable companies from Texas<br>to Tasmania selling to women all over the world capsules deep-frozen<br>Male Bull's sperms and that of other Exotic wild animals at very<br>high prices.<br><br>Personally, I know a woman who actually paid young Bangladeshi contract worker to eat their sperm "fresh from the cow". She is an 'old' woman now (62) but in her youthful hey days as a night-club dance hostess, she was red-hot or super 'red-label'. I knew of this because she was caught "milking sperm" directly by the<br>supervisor (a woman too) whom I also know. She pleaded to my friend to keep mum thus keeping her reputation and her job but her supervisor pitied her, warned her not to do it at the work-place (in the seldom used darken stairways).<br><br>When I ask her one day why she did it, she said that without the 'dosage' she felt old, 'pain n wind all over'. She had always preferred sperm in her mouth rather than in her pussy and she never had sex with any "hak yean" or 'blackies' which is hard to believe.<br><br>This sperm 'secret' she told me was passed on to her by a "Mummy"<br>who also happened to be her "adopted" Mum, who in earlier days used to work as a 'Ah Mah' for some rich Chinese family, and "sometimes" as mistress to the boss n boss's friends. (This is interesting because she said she born in Malaysia and when I suggested that for all she knew, her Mum could have been pregnant and sent over there to give birth.) Her Mum's house-keeping duties included taking care of the employer children and in the process, Mum milked the young boys almost everyday.
