The train is 11 o'clock. They didn't pay anything for us. We have to go there with our own money by taxi."<br><br>Another passenger commented, "I have to go Kuala Lumpur....(that is) very important.

Then I (have to) go to my country New Zealand."<br><br>A third passenger added, "They just told me that the train is postponed but they say they will work 24 hours to fix it.
