It was a stupid qn asked in a rude manner . Dun be idiotic, i was here to share this hsow with everyone , n here comes someone who thinks that i am sent by my boss. And u expect me to say erm "no , i am not someone to promote this show la" And if ever i want to share anymore shows here in sgforum , do i have to clarify that i am not sent by any bosses to boost ratings? Or do i have to get a license from you?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey! domyoji33, Prodigy and Silenthunter carry on with ur chats and analysis abt the programme. It was great! Dun juz stop coz of some disturbance.<br>Afterall, he/she came with a 'purpose' to 'protect'(wow and i thought is was the job of moderators?) this forum, from any form of 'abuse'(i wonder wat kind of). Moreover, since he/she juz want domyoji33 to explain, within a time limit, juz explain lor(since she/he is 'learning'). The 'challenge' is juz one of the 'purpose'(other than 'protecting') for him/her to be here in this forum, so dun be 'threatened'.<br>I understand that u came in pursuit of finding and introducing this tv programme to Chatters here Its juz his/her nature to be agressive(in order to 'protect' and 'challenge'), so dun mind so much abt it.<br><br>Last but not least. Hope to see u guys chatting here again!<br><br>'Failures are divided into 2 classes - those who thought and never did, and those who did and never thought.'<br></div>
