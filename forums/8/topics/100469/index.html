            <div class='col-md body'>Cant be bothered to go searching for the thread so I just open a new one.<br><br>Source : <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/sub/lifestyle/story/0,5562,282277,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/sub/lifestyle/story/0,5562,282277,00.html?</a><br>Oct 31, 2004<br>Flying high in a man's world<br><br>The new man in the cockpit is a woman. SANDRA LEONG reports<br><br>THE next time you fly SilkAir, the pilot of the plane may well be Ms Vanessa Ess. She is among a very small number of female pilots here. Her father was a pilot with Singapore Airlines for 35 years and she grew up 'always wanting to be in an aeroplane'.<br><br>After completing her hotel management and tourism degree at the University of Surrey in 1994, she spent about $10,000 getting a private flying licence with the Seletar Flying Club.<br><br>She joined SIA as a stewardess in 1995. But each time recruitment ads for cadet pilots came out, she applied even though the airline was looking for males, the 32-year-old says.<br><br>A friend later suggested she try her luck at SIA's subsidiary SilkAir, which in 2001 accepted Ms Anastasia Gan as its first female pilot. The latter had served as a transport pilot with the Republic of Singapore Air Force for 22 years.<br><br>A year after Ms Ess applied for cadet pilot training in 2000, she was accepted in the 2 1/2-year scheme. She passed last October, making her the first female to graduate from the Singapore Flying College based in Singapore and Perth.<br><br>Today, she co-pilots an Airbus 320 to destinations within a five-hour radius of Singapore. The plane can seat 142 passengers. Besides Ms Ess, SilkAir now has four female cadet pilots undergoing training. The airline has 117 pilots in all.<br><br>As for Ms Gan, she is now a first officer with Qantas' new low-cost carrier Jetstar Asia based here. It has two female pilots out of its crew of 40 - the other is an Australian citizen.<br><br>Ms Gan, 46, whose office is also an Airbus 320, recalls the pressure of being the rose among the thorns at SilkAir: 'I was very apprehensive because all eyes were on me. I had to work doubly hard.'<br><br>She joined Jetstar to be part of an 'up-and-coming' airline. Presently undergoing an upgrading course in Singapore and Australia, she may be promoted to captain at year-end if all goes well - another first for the female flying community here. In a plane, the captain is the overall commander. The first officer assists the captain.<br><br>So with Ms Ess and Ms Gan showing the way, will more Singaporean women be headed for the cockpit?<br><br>In other parts of the world, female pilots have become less of an exception. Airlines like Cathay Pacific, United Airlines, KLM, Northwest and even neighbouring AirAsia have all hired women.<br><br>In Singapore, however, opportunities remain considerably fewer. In a statement to LifeStyle, a spokesman for SIA says its criteria for appointment is designed to get the best and most suitably qualified pilots.<br><br>'The fact is almost all suitably qualified applicants are male, and this is the case with most airlines which operate the long-haul fleet as we do.'<br><br>SIA has about 2,000 pilots, both working and in training.<br><br>But women who do get the breaks have to be prepared for the sacrifices that come with the job. Ms Ess, who is single, says: 'You can't have kids in the early stages because it's better not to break the training process.'<br><br>Despite this, Ms Gan, who is married to an oil trader and has three daughters, thinks women high-flyers are as capable as any male pilot. In fact, she thinks that females bring another dimension to the job.<br><br>'Women have a softer touch and that can be an asset in the cockpit. The other male pilots trust you and warm up to you more easily.'<br><a href="http://" rel="nofollow"></a></div>
