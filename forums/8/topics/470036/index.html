              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>I'm travelling to Singapore in a few weeks to meet my boyfriend's family. I'm filipina while he is Singaporean-chinese. We have both grown up in New Zealand and are at university here.</p>
              <p>When I met his father briefly while he was visting New Zealand, I got the impression he may have been a bit racist. He made a few references to "mainlanders" and black people and indians and tended to stereotype them.</p>
              <p>Should I expect other singaporeans to generally be like this, or is father especially racist? I'm filipina so obviously I'm a bit worried I might be looked down upon since his extended family probably have maids from my country.</p>
              <p>Will I be welcomed as his girlfriend or will there be some awkwardness/hostility due to the fact that I am not Chinese? Not too sure what to expect, any insight would be much appreciated.</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance :)</p>

              <p>Isn't this the same way you treat Taiwan/China/Japan?</p>
              <p>Maybe the father is from Taiwan, or has a relative killed the exculsive economical zone area. </p>

              <p>The Philippines might be the same, but I'm not. I'm an individual and don't appreciate assumptions about me being made on the basis of my country of birth. Assuming that just because other countries may have a general racist environment excuses your own, is flawed reasoning. Yes, preferring your own race isn't racism. Can't really police people's thoughts and preferences. But it is racism to treat people negatively because they are a different race to you. His father is most definitely not from Taiwan. Even if he was, are you trying to imply that it would justify potentially racist attitudes?</p>

              <p>Nicolem, </p>
              <p>Unfortunately your concerns and worries are definitely well founded. </p>
              <p>Singapore is an incredibly racisist country due to the majority of Singaporeans being so small minded. What I mean by that is, they have never been outside of Singapore and do not appreciate other cultures and there worth. This compiled witht the extreme elitist attitude of the majority, means that you, as a Pinoy, will no doubt be either subjected to racism or looked down upon by your partners family and the general public.</p>
              <p>But worry not, do not let these types of individuals drag you down to there level, rise above it as they are misguided souls and still have good in them.</p>
              <p>Summer hills responses are typical of the way many of my own country men act, never taking accountability and trying to shift blame to others. </p>
              <p>However there ARE Singaporeans who are not racist, who are intelligent and wise enough to understand that all humans on this earth have the same inherent value and we Singaporeans are equal to everyone and they to us.</p>
              <p>Good luck! </p>

              <p>Racism is an issue we all should try to eradicate. I think it only ever comes up because it somehow affected us on a <em>personal level</em> at some point in our lives. People from any part of the world will be racist towards another person for one reason or another because whether we like it or not, some people generalize a person's actions and interpret it as a another race or another nation's actions.</p>
              <p>But for Arami who asked if it's the same in the Philippines, Chinese-Filipino interracial (I'll use interracial for the sake of simplicity but I don't think it's the correct term) relationships are not as controversial as - let's say - a caucasian person dating a Filipino/Filipina. The reason is perhaps, it has become a norm.</p>
              <p>Do tell us about your experience in Singapore. I too am in a relationship with an Indian- Singaporean person and I will be visiting Singapore in the near future.</p>
              <p>Thank you!</p>

                              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>I'm travelling to Singapore in a few weeks to meet my
              boyfriend's family. I'm filipina while he is
              Singaporean-chinese. We have both grown up in New Zealand and are
              at university here.</p>
              <p>When I met his father briefly while he was visting New Zealand,
              I got the impression he may have been a bit racist. He made a few
              references to "mainlanders" and black people and indians and tended
              to stereotype them.</p>
              <p>Should I expect other singaporeans to generally be like this, or
              is father especially racist? I'm filipina so obviously I'm a bit
              worried I might be looked down upon since his extended family
              probably have maids from my country.</p>
              <p>Will I be welcomed as his girlfriend or will there be some
              awkwardness/hostility due to the fact that I am not Chinese? Not
              too sure what to expect, any insight would be much appreciated.</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance :)</p>

              I think in the Philippines itself there are some prejudices amongst its population. This is the current situation in Singapore now. Those filipino maids that are working in Singapore are shun by those filipinos working in other industries in Singapore. They separate themselves from those filipino maids. Why?
