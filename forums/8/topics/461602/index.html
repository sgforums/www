              I have got Rheem water heaters installed in both my bathrooms since I moved into my current house 1 year ago. Around 3 months back, a sudden dispense of hot boiling water after my wife turned on the tap, caused both of her legs to be scalded. Thinking that this could be a one-off malfunction, we decided to stick to the water heater. The same situation happened again about 1 month off the first incident. Thankfully this time my wife learned from her previous experience and directed the showerhead on the floor after turning on the tap.
              
              Immediately I called the company. Not very impressed by their customer service as the incident can result in physical injuries and they only arranged for a technician to come to my house a few days later. The worse is yet to come!! Huge disappointment after the technician came, where he meddled arrogantly with the water heater and concluded that nothing was wrong. We accepted his observation as there wasn't any boiling water dispense during his on-site visit. When questioned what went wrong, he said he never encountered such problems before and asked us to continue using the water heater to see if there are similar occurences before contacting the company again!! Mind you, hot boiling water! Meanwhile, he told us the best he can offer us is his customer feedback form to reflect the incident to the company. What's the point of repeatedly reporting the incident so many times and nothing is done? The next day, the company called us and informed us that the manager will contact us to settle the issue. Till date, 2 months down the road, we are still waiting, perhaps for spider web to grow on us. Our best solution: Do not use the water heater!!

              <p><br><em><strong>from: <a href="http://www.case.org.sg">www.case.org.sg</a></strong></em></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Singapore's "lemon law" will kick in on September 1, 2012.<br><br>The
                   new legislation will provide more options through additional remedies, 
                  such as repair and replacement, and provide greater clarity on the 
                  burden of proof for defective goods.  <br><br>The lemon law will have a 
                  two-stage recourse framework for consumers. At the first stage, 
                  consumers may ask the seller to replace or repair the defected goods 
                  within a reasonable period of time. But if this isn't possible, 
                  consumers can move on to the next stage, where they can keep the 
                  defected goods and ask for a reduction in price or return them for a 
                  refund.<br><br>Currently, the exchange or refund policy can differ 
                  between retailers. Some shops may offer up to seven days to exchange 
                  products, while others have a strict "no refund" policy.<br><br>Customers at Swedish furniture giant IKEA have all along been benefiting from its 100-day return policy.<br><br>This
                   means that if customers change their mind on purchases, they can return
                   the items within 100 days from the date of purchase.<br><br>With the lemon law in place, they will now have up to six months to take action on any defective product.<br><br>Most customers welcome the lemon law.<br><br>One
                   customer said: "When there was no such law, I would not be bothered to 
                  go back and change (the item), because I am afraid there will be this 
                  and that, a lot more issues. So, now that there is such a law, I will 
                  definitely bring it back to change."<br><br>Another commented: "That is 
                  something they do in the US already...And I think it is nice, actually. 
                  It is good for business also because in the end, people would end up 
                  buying more because they know they can always return them."<br><br>Others were concerned that some may abuse the law.<br><br>One
                   person said: "What the retailers can do is actually state the terms and
                   conditions clearly, and maybe state it on the cashier counter and on 
                  the receipts. Everything should be black and white, and have no grey 
                  areas, so that consumers can better know what is a defective product and
                   they can exchange the product."<br><br>Minister of State for Trade and 
                  Industry Teo Ser Luck said: "With the new lemon law, consumers and 
                  retailers now have more options of recourse for defective goods. <br><br>"I
                   encourage everyone to familiarise themselves with the provisions under 
                  the law. At the same time, we also want to ensure that businesses are 
                  not subject to frivolous claims and that limitations and safeguards are 
                  in place."<br><br>The government will monitor how smaller retailers adjust to the new law.<br><br>The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) will gather feedback for some three months and work towards closing gaps, if any.<br><br>Mr
                   Teo said: "For smaller retailers, sometimes, it is harder to implement 
                  some of the good, excellent measures of the major retailers because of 
                  cost issue, because of volume, because of the type of products.<br><br>"We
                   will be monitoring the smaller retailers, their responses and how they 
                  manage the process more carefully, because we want to make sure that it 
                  actually enhances the experience for them, it actually helps them in 
                  their business."<br><br>Mr Teo added : "It is important to let the law 
                  be implemented and accumulate enough experiences for the retailers as 
                  well as consumers. And then we monitor and see what is the outcome, how 
                  is it done, and then we can figure out what are the gaps to close, if 
                  there are any gaps, and figure out some of the measures or counter 
                  measures, and see how we can help the smaller retailers or even the 
                  consumers go through with the transactions."<br><br>To help reduce the 
                  impact on business, Mr Teo encouraged smaller retailers to focus on 
                  building personalised relationships with customers.<br><br>To make it 
                  easier for customers to track their purchases, customers of electronics,
                   furniture and IT retailer Courts, can now access their product purchase
                   information online, or 'e-receipts' - so they do not have to worry 
                  about losing receipts, which are usually required as proof of purchase.<br><br>These 'e-receipts' allow them to easily retrieve vital information such as product purchase dates.<br><br>The
                   MTI and the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) have organised 
                  some 40 seminars and roadshows to brief consumers and retailers on the 
                  new law. <br><br>MTI said 15 additional briefing sessions are expected to be held over the next two months.<br><br>MTI has also worked with CASE and various trade associations to develop lemon law consumer guides. <br><br>These
                   will explain the consumers' rights under the law, and the limitations 
                  and safeguards against frivolous claims. These guides will be available 
                  at supermarkets, and places like community centres and shopping centres.<br><br>- CNA/ac/ms</span></span></p>
