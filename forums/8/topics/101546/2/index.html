            <div class='col-md body'>I think Chinese people in general do alot of bitching about other Chinese whether they are talking about Chinese form China, ABC's, wealthy Chinese Singaporeans or girls who date white guys. For me I'm from a town of 6,000 people in Ireland so maybe it would be an eye opener for me to date a Chinese at home but you could excuse this. However they would not talk with the same venom about "SPG's" and the like. I think people in a big city like Singapore should be more open minded and not carry their small town mentalities with them when they set up shop here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think when we say, "people dont stare in US", i think thats from the angmoh perspective. who knows what the asian mamas in US is gossiping to her neighbors about that chinese girl dating the white guy down the street.<br><br>but hey, i think in the western world, many of the 2nd or 3rd generation asians have sort of integrated into the population and dont consider themselves asian, etc.<br><br>in singapore, asians are the majority of the population (obviously) and angmohs will always stand out, no matter what.<br><br>you can't say we are bringing our small town mentalities to set up shop here because we "set up shop" over a hundred years ago. this is not new.<br><br>i wish people can be more open but it IS true that there are a lot of asian women who DO fit the typical gold digger role - i.e. hooking up with a rich old expat. or some people just think that angmohs are more virile or sexy?!<br><br>i think the only time i would NEVER assume SPG is when i see a middle-aged couple (one angmoh and one asian) with grown kids who have been together forever. that's true love baby! hahaha<br><br>yeah i got 2 lecturers who are like that. it gives me hope haha</div>
