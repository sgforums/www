I also disagree about you saying that we look down on all colored as second class that is only in your imagination and maybe some kind of inferiority complex.<br>You know if you go to UK you will find the English the most tolerant people in the world maybe thats from their empire days and when they ruled they never treated people in such a racist way as the Japanese did in WWII. You only have to look closer to home to see the likes of Lee Kwan Yew's and his racists opinions on blacks when his daughter got engaged to one.

You just moved here? You may find conversation a bit above your head at times, but you soon get used to it, wot with all the "LARrrrrrr" and the "Aaaaaaaaarghhhh" and the "Whoa LAN EHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" etc etc But its cool its cool.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nove:</div><div class="quote_body">lol ooo i agree but let's not harp on it shall we?<br><br>i think because singapore is so small people dont think of the heartlands vs the "city people". i mean 99% of the "city people" ARE living in the "heartlands"<br><br>so technically we're ALL heartlanders except for the people who eat with golden spoons and have warm water coming out of their toiletbowl<br>hehehe<br><br>i said before, u just can't say things like "set up shop here".. dude we're set up been there done that long ago!<br><br>erm but excolony and provincial nothing related..just that ex colony means we've been under the whole western imperialism thing a lot longer</div></blockquote>I don't mean disrespect to my local friends here. I just mean i am sometimes a bit frustrated with people here who like.. shun me coz i am a foreigner, that is why i say people here are provincial. Understand that i am torn between both of my constituent bloods, to be SUPREMIST yet to be TOLERANT, esp when both peoples shun/embrace me.. though mostly its the white people who embrace me rather than local people. So.. errr just the BOOZE talking. pay no heed.<br><br></div>

I also disagree about you saying that we look down on all colored as second class that is only in your imagination and maybe some kind of inferiority complex.<br>You know if you go to UK you will find the English the most tolerant people in the world maybe thats from their empire days and when they ruled they never treated people in such a racist way as the Japanese did in WWII. You only have to look closer to home to see the likes of Lee Kwan Yew's and his racists opinions on blacks when his daughter got engaged to one.  Saying that the goverment here have a lot of good points when it comes to other races but from Lee Kwan Yew behaviour old attitudes maybe just below the surface.[/b]</blockquote>I beg to differ - my parents went to UK - scotland was pretty ok - scots are friendly to tourists - England - some of the brits were busy yelling at my parents " GO BACK U BLOODY CHINKS". Yup UK is pretty tolerant - wales , scotland ...just not good ol england.<br><br>The colonial british were as  racist as can be when they ruled Singapore - white only clubs, white only jobs , if a white complains against the asian - the white is in the right . You are not white - too bad.  My granddad lived under colonial rule and he was discriminated against . He told me stories of how bad it was. White worshipping was rampant until after the WW2 . <strong> Then the malaysians and singaporeans finally figured out the Great Britain wasn't so great since japanese could win the white man.  How did you think we wanted independence </strong><br><br>Empire days? Tolerant?  <strong> As I recalled they wiped out huge native american populations with small pox and warfare even before America declared independence. How about the aboriginals in australia? Largely wiped out when the british rule came in. The WW2 Japanese and colonial brits are just the same except one is not white. </strong><br><br>It is odd that you say you are irish and made the statement the english are the most tolerant people . My irish colleague says she despises the english because of what they did to ireland. Basically the irish , welsh and scots got screwed over by the old imperialistic england.  Have you heard of the song Bonny portmore? I suggest you listen to it .</div>
