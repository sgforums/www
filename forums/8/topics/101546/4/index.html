White got white treatment among whites. Us asians get second rate treatment - we have to work twice as hard as the common whites to get where we are on their turf.

What's considered normal and courteous to ourselves and race might be interpreted as rude and condescending. Sometimes I just throw my hands up and said, white people cannot understand the high context society that asians live in. Silence speaks volumns for us but the white folks would not understand our delibration and declare immediately that the asias are stupid and they will start bugging us for an answer or brand us a stupid.<br><br>Actually as singaporeans, we are told off by China Chinese that we are arrogant. We've gotten used to it that it does not seem so to the local context but it is regarded in their context. We cannot make everyone happy and personally, I don't care what China Chinese thinks.<br><br>So you see, there are blind spots and to be a global citizen... its not as easy as you said.<br><br>BTW, refrain from using the vuglar words you send to someone up there. I am sure if I translated it, you'd be insulted if I use it on you. Whites claim superior and civil and labelled all other races as inferior and uncivilized. So use a little of the civility that you guys like to boast about, unless its just another BS white folks like to perpetuate.<br><br>I find white folks always create such a branding and draw themselves up so wonderfully, as if they are perfect. While asians are humble and then to put their good points down and bring up some flaws. Then asians get sucked into the idea that white is good and follow white ideas, and such ... sometimes, its is heartening to find a white who actually appreciate asian. But its a minority and i reserve my judgement if it just for fun and only skin deep, just as everything else.<br><br></div>
