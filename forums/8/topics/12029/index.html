            <div class='col-md body'>I had to find something to do.. thus I shall type this out.. Don't think I'll reply though.. Don't expect any..<br><br>By Eric Mansfield.<br><br>A daughter complained to her father about her life and how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem was solved, a new one arose.<br><br>Her father, a chef, took her to the kitchen. He filled three pots with water and places each on a high fire. Soon the pots came to a boil. In one he placed carrots, in the second he placed eggs, and the last, he placed coffee beans. He let them sit and boil, without saying a word.<br><br>The daughter sucked her teeth and impatiently waited, wondering what he was doing. In about twenty minutes, he turned off the burners. He fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. Turning to her he asked. "darling, what do you see?" "carrots, eggs, and coffee," she replied.<br><br>He brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. He then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, he asked her to sip the coffee. She smiled as she tasted its rich aroma. She humbly asked, "what does this mean Father?"<br><br>He explained that each fo them had faced the same adversity, boiling water, but each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting. But after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior. But after sitting in through the boiling water, its inside became hardened. The ground coffee beans were unique however. After they were in the boiling water, they had changed the water. "which are you?" he asked his daughter. "When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, egg, or coffeebean?"<br><br>---------------------------------------<br><br>How about you?<br><br>Are you the carrot that seems hard, but with pain and adversity do you wilt and become soft and lose your strength?<br><br>Are you the egg, which starts off with a malleable heart? Were you a fluid spirit, but after death, a breakup or divorce or a layoff have you becomed hardened and stiff. Your shell looks the same, but are you bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and heart?<br><br>Or are you like the coffeebean? The bean changes the hot water, the thing that is bringing the pain, to its peak flavor reaches 212 degrees Fahrenheit. When the water gets the hottest, it just tastes better. If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and make things better around you.<br><br>The greatest part of our happiness or misery depends on our disposition and not our circumstances.<br><br>"It's now what happens to you but how you respond to what happens to you that determines the quality of your experience."<br><br>=--------------------------------------=<br><br>I think I was in the past, an egg, and now.. perhaps a carrot.<br><br>Replies? and perhaps some comments?<br><br>------------------<br>insanity..<br>loves io..<br>eternity..</div>
