My best mate's not Chinese, but he had a small poster of the word ren3 (endurance) on the wall next to his desk throughout his years of med school.<br><br>I have absolutely no problem with that.  Why?  Because he went out, discovered the word, learned and appreciated its meaning and significance, and then made a small calligraphy of it.  It held personal meaning to him while he spent six years plugging away to become a doctor.<br><br>If someone shows proper respect for a language and culture like that, more power to him/her.
