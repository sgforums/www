            <div class='col-md body'>it has never been my style, but i thought this blog entry of mine is worth sharing:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">happy mooncake festival<br><br>there's this young girl whom i've seen before in the rehabilation centre. i don't know what exactly she's down with, but apparently it's something to do with problems in muscle growth. her limbs are skinny with virtually no muscles, and she requires at least two persons' assistance to carry her on each side for her walking exercise. yes, she's immobile. and whenever i see her, her head is always laid back, which suggests that she also doesn't have strength in her neck to support her head. even making facial expressions is a problem for her.<br><br>i know what you're feeling now after reading the above. i have twice as much of this sentiment whenever i see her.<br><br>somehow today, this sentiment was particularly overwhelming.<br><br>when i saw her struggling in her walking exercise, my heart sank as usual. it was painful for anyone to see her in such apparent pain. but guess what i heard next from the physiotherapist's mouth. she was actually telling the girl to stop pushing herself and take a rest! to take a rest and enjoy this mooncake festival, although there was no mooncake nor lantern around. somehow suddenly, the festive mood felt real.<br><br>my face then was wet with perspiration from the footwook drills. if i were any bit more emotionally affected by this girl, i wouldn't bet against my face wet with tears also.<br><br>i took a good look at her face. she couldn't make proper facial expression like we can. but her face colour, it was filled with radiance and life. her eyes, they were filled with hope &amp; strength. i'm not bullshitting like i'm making an ad, but this was really what i saw, and felt first hand. doesn't seem to complement a body hampered by handicaps right? but for a moment, i thought she looked really beautiful. perhaps if she were healthy, she could have been the main attraction among guys.<br><br>i really wish you'll be well soon. my faith, love &amp; hope go to you. you have inspired me. wishing you a happy mooncake festival.</span><br><br>anyone from sgh rehab centre reading this, i guess you may have seen this girl before. let's give her our well wishes.</div>
