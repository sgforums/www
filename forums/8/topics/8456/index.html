            <div class='col-md body'>Do you know how the bible is written?<br>Forty different authors writing over a period of 1,600 years penned the 66 books of the Bible. Four hundred silent years separated the 39 books of the Old Testament from the 27 of the New Testament. Yet, from Genesis to Revelation, they tell one unfolding story. Together they give consistent answers to the most important questions we can ask: Why are we here? How can we come to terms with our fears? How can we get along? How can we rise above our circumstances and keep hope alive? How can we make peace with our Maker? The Bible's consistent answers to these questions show that the Scriptures are not many books but one. Imagine how can man alone right all these? Different people who lived at different times and have not met each other ever before during lifetime, yet write on the same account.<br><br>Down through the ages, many have doubted the historical and geographical accuracy of the Bible. Yet modern archeologists have repeatedly unearthed evidence of the people, places, and cultures described in the Scriptures. Time after time, the descriptions in the biblical record have been shown to be more reliable than the speculations of scholars. The modern visitor to the museums and lands of the Bible cannot help but come away impressed with the real geographical and historical backdrop of the biblical text. An example, where a ship is found on Mt. Ararat. When this thing is known, the Iraq government denied it and forbid anyone to go there for any expeditions. However, many passer-bys confirmed with photos that there is a ship-like object on Mt. Ararat. The question is what is that ship doing up high on a mountain? The bible explains it that when the flood subsided, the ship landed on Mt. Ararat.<br><br>You're not alone if you have questions about the reliability of the Bible. The Scriptures, like the world around us, are marked by elements of mystery. Yet if the Bible is what it claims to be, you don't have to try to sort out the evidence on your own. To be tested in such a setting is Jesus' promise of divine help to those who want to know the truth about Himself and His teachings. Jesus said, "If anyone chooses to do God's will, he will find out whether My teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own"<br><br>10 reasons for believing the bible. <a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/rbc/rtb/6rsn/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gospelcom.net/rbc/rtb/6rsn/</a><br><br>In the Finland newspaper, a group of Russian geological scientist drills a hole into earth for experiment to have a better knowledge of earth plate movements. The 1989 headline read, Â“Gates of hell openedÂ”. They drill 9 miles deep till they could not drill further, finding the earth hollow and measured the temperature to be 1001 deg Celsius. Listening to the earth plate movement with a sensitive microphone, they hear a high pitch sound from the earth interior. They confirmed they were the sounds of human voices, screaming in pain. The project leader said, Â“Hope that those down there will remain down there!Â” Many scientists quit and refuse to continue the research. The project leader concluded saying, Â“As a communist, I do not believe in hell and the Bible, but as a scientist, I now believe in hellÂ…..Â”<br><br>Science not only discovered heaven, where the telescope caught a glimpse of heaven in space, science also discovered hell. Even before the discovery by science, the Bible tells us the location of hell. It is in the core of hell with everlasting fire. When science does not know this and when people are wondering why volcanoes give out such things, the Bible clearly explain it to us with great details.<br><br>If you ask why would a lovely God create hell? Why? I tell you, hell is not created for you! It is originally created for Satan and his death angels. We DO NOT need to go there!<br><br>The subject of hell is extremely unpopular and to many, is very offensive. People do not like to talk about hell. The same Bible tells us both the glory of heaven and the horrors of hell. Yes, we prefer to hear the glories of heaven and I prefer that too! But hell should not trouble us, because we are not going to go there if we know Jesus.<br><br>For those who do not believe in the stories I have mentioned in my last posts or find it offensive, I tell you IÂ’m not the author. They are true-life stories of people who came to Singapore indoor Stadium a few weeks ago and tell us about it. Once again, I tell you IÂ’m not against any one here and I am not, will not condemn or judge any one. So, I will not argue with you with certain things and will not waste time replying unless you need help. I will continue in my next posts about the facts of hell, where may surprise you if you do not know about it. Blessed is that who is reading this now. For I strongly believe, you WILL know God and WILL be touched by his power! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>------------------<br><a href="http://www.yesweb.f2s.com/" rel="nofollow">Yes!Web - Pure Entertainment Hub </a><br><br><a href="http://www.yesweb.f2s.com/praise/truth.htm" rel="nofollow">The Truth </a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my last post, I told you about the group of Russian scientists who made that horror discovery. Well, you may think that it is not true. However, many who does not believe it wanted to prove it wrong went to Finland to find more evidence and found out that those mentioned scientist are actual people, there is that experiment at that time and was indeed published on the Finland newspaper in 1989. Those who added to the story saying a black light creature came out when they were drilling, are disproved very quickly. Why...because only the truth will stand.....<br>Well, whether they hear those sounds a not still cannot be confirmed or disproved.<br><br>The Bible clearly tells us that hell is in earthÂ’s core, where it is hollow and of very high temperature. It tells us this even before science proved it. I ask you, how can those people  who wrote the book without the instructions of God, know these even before man discover it? Do you think those writers are that wise? The Bible covers all the truth with everything of manÂ’s history to future. Can you spot a mistake in the Bible? A spelling mistake, geographical mistake or mistake of any kind? No! So why doubt it?<br><br>In this forum, I see people arguing and arguing, turning about the same old problem but come go back to the starting point again. There is no victory in your life! Yes, you may say you have no problem and nothing can stop you. You look strong outside, you know how to use words or debate strongly. Deep down in your heart and when you are alone, you kept on thinking of your problems, feeling hopeless and no victory in your life. You can hide your feelings from anyone including your very closed, loved ones. I assure you that you have this uneasiness in your heart, even though you write back against me. You cannot fool God! People may claimÂ…. Â“ yesÂ….I have been to church weekly without fail. It is just a place where I can make friends and spend my time there listening to some interesting preaching about so-called life. I do not feel God, cannot see God and do not think he is real and can help me when troubles rose.Â” Well, you may say I have taken your path which you have taken before. Oh, noÂ…..I tell you that you have taken my path instead. I was once like you, going to church and find it meaningless. I tell you, your heart is not changed. You are still the same old person.<br><br>Yes, you may be a Christian. You may be baptized. You may go to church weekly without fail. It is not wrong, but it is like going to a farm does not make you a cow. Even you are the pastor of the largest church in the city, a Sunday school teacher or group leader, it makes NO difference if you do not have Christ in your heart. You will still go to hell without Christ in your heart. Ask yourself. Do you wake up and go to bed with Christ? Do you breathe like Christ? Do you go to work or school with Christ. Do you have Christ in every moment of your life?<br><br>Do not be a hypocrite! You may look as if you very Christian outside. You kneel and sing praises of the Lord. But, when you are alone in your room, you have forgotten Christ. God is everywhere. He knows what you are doing every moment and knows what you are thinking about. You cannot hide anything from God. You must believe Christ in your heart and not just saying it in your mouth. Saying a sinnerÂ’s prayer does not make you a Christian, but saying it and crying out from your heart will save you from hell fire!<br><br>------------------<br><a href="http://www.yesweb.f2s.com/" rel="nofollow">Yes!Web - Pure Entertainment Hub </a><br><br><a href="http://www.yesweb.f2s.com/praise/truth.htm" rel="nofollow">The Truth </a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FACTS ABOUT HELL<br><br>There are 5 facts which I want you to knowÂ….<br><br>Fact 1. Hell is originally created for the devil and his death angels.<br><br>Jesus says he is the truth and the only way to heaven, but many people rejected it and prefer other alternative ways. That is human nature. On earth, often people want to break laws and live a different way. Now in certain western countries, people ask why must a home consist of a male, a female and children? Why cannot be a male and a male or a female and a female with adopted children? In some parts of USA, you can be sued for criticizing them. They say that a home does not necessarily consist of a male, female and children. Deep down in our hearts, we know itÂ’s wrong, itÂ’s weird. What will your children call you? Daddy and daddy? Mummy and mummy? They look for  the alternative ways.<br><br>Hell is not created for man. But because of sin, man has to suffer the same fate with the devil if he does not repent. So, we should not and must not be there! With Christ, we are that very certain we will not be there!<br><br>------------------<br><a href="http://www.yesweb.f2s.com/" rel="nofollow">Yes!Web - Pure Entertainment Hub </a><br><br><a href="http://www.yesweb.f2s.com/praise/truth.htm" rel="nofollow">The Truth </a></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Fact 2. Satan fights for every soul to be with him in hell.<br><br>You are included in his list! There is also this thing in human heart. When you are in deep trouble, you want everyone to be in the same hot soup. The Devil wants everyone if possible to go with him. There are AIDS patient who want everyone in the world to get infected. The devil is using all his tricks to lead you astray and away from the word of God. His angel is assigned to you and just beside you right now, taking every opportunity to overcome your thoughts. The devil knows you too well, from that day you were born. He does not have to appear before you to scare you to death. He just has to get you away from God and tempt you to sin. It is so very easy job for him, as well as so easy for man to get tricked. His aim is for your heart and soul, not for your physical body.<br><br>When things go wrong, you blame everybody except yourself. You can be a Sunday church teacher, a church leader or pastor, but when trouble comes, you lose control. You blame everybody except yourself! You do not trust Christ when real trouble arose.<br><br>Some Christians do not believe in hell even though Jesus tells about hell, because they do not like the idea of hell. I donÂ’t like it either but I cannot wish it away. Unbelief does not make hell vanish! The Bible tells you very clearly.<br><br>Temporal hell? No! The fact is ever lasting fire, eternal death! Please do not mistake me as condemning you to hell. God wants us to know about how terrible of hell is and does not want us to go there!<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Fact 3. Hell is an actual place. It is not somebodyÂ’s imagination.<br><br>Jesus died for our sins. He paid the price for us by going to hell to taste the fire. So whoever believes in Jesus will live.<br><br>When a person dies, his soul is lifted up from the broken down body. The spirit of a person is not like a cloud or something floating around. It is a real person. The only difference is he does not have to express himself through the physical body. He has both internal and external feelings; he has emotional and tangible pain. In fact, his senses are heightened. Therefore when a person die in his sins without Jesus Christ, his suffering will be greater in hell, where words cannot describe the torment. Therefore his enjoyment will be greater with God in heaven. There is this law of similar attraction. For example, normally those who like to gossip or complain gather together. ItÂ’s the same way. So, God DOES NOT sends a person to hell. This force of attraction like a magnet will pull you to where you belong, either to hell or heaven.<br><br>Meanwhile you choose where you want to be!<br><br>Now, many religions say the same thing in common. There is a heaven, there is a hell, but we do not know where we will be until we reach there. If you want to drive to Sim Lim Square and do not know the way. Someone tells you that you just drive, just drive on and if you see it, you are there. How much assurance do you have? Now, how stupid if you drive your car like that and without a road map. The Bible is the only way that tells you the way and assurance.<br><br>Some say that hopefully our good works will overtake our bad works. I ask you how do you keep track of the point system? If you donate to the charity, how many points is that?<br>If you help an old lady cross the road when she does not want to, how many points? 3 points or minus 5 points, because you want to get points but she does not want to cross?<br><br>Christ has given me the assurance! Believe and trust Christ just like a little child! A child trusts his father. Have you ever come across a small child that questions his father if he can afford to pay the monthÂ’s school fees?<br><br>The one that died for me, says, Â“Because I live, you will live also!Â” He did not say, Â“Because I live, you might live also. Let me tally the points and then tell you the final resultÂ….Â”<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Fact 4. Hell is a place of indescribable torment.<br><br>The torment basically comes from the 3 sources, worms, fire and the demons. Do you know scientists discovered worms under the earth? Yes, big huge worms that you never see on earth. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Have you seen a person who is so tormented that he no longer cries but wail and grind his teeth? There are huge worms crawling and torturing over the person. There is ever lasting fire burning over the person. Demons come and torture the person for fun, tearing and engulf him with greater heat of fire. Yet, the person never dies! The worms do not die, the body does not die and the fire is not quenched. Nothing on this world can be compared to the torment in hell.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Fact 5. Hell is everlasting.<br><br>There will be no day and night, no rest at all in hell.<br>Arguing against what I am talking here does not make hell go away.  Do not forget there is also such a place call heaven! Why do not you shut down hell by coming to Christ instead of arguing? Fight against it? Write books against it? They will not make hell vanish. Do not get near the Barbeque pit!<br><br>The saddest thing in life is that people thinks according to their own judgment and little mind. They fail to understand the only way is through Jesus Christ. They keep quarreling that if God is a good God, why is there hell? Why is that so much suffering in the world? They kept thinking about the negative side. Why? Why? There is always a why.<br><br>For example, if you got the AIDS virus through blood transfusion. However, there is this cure of the virus available made known to you. Will you say the following? Â“Why did this terrible thing happen to me? Why did they transfer this corrupted blood to me? I must understand before I apply the medication.Â”<br><br>Are you saying, Â“No, I must understand everything then I come to Christ.Â”? Even very simple things like a brown cow eats green grass can produce white milk and it can be made into yellow butter. Can you understand? If you look at a glass of water and say, Â“ Why is that the liquid can quench my thirst? I must understand before I drink it!Â” What do you think will happen?<br><br>We cannot understand everything! All we have is this little mind. All you have to know is there is a loving God, there is a hell but by repenting your sins and through Jesus, you will be saved.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have read the "hell in the middle of the earth" story back in 1993. Doubt the credibility of that article, considering the simple fact that it came from a tiny and insignificant tabloid. You can find the newspaper that published the "hell" story in your local mama store. Strangly, they are able to report shocking news all the time. Sure, it increases readership. Don't you think so.<br><br>Now the question is simple, the is big news. Why hasn't it been reported in CNN, or any other major tabloid? Then of course, is the fact that hasn't Science already shown us what's really beneath our grounds?<br><br>My suggestion is that if you wish to know your origins and where u will end up after death, read good scientific journals. Selective reading of materials that benefits only your stand as a Christian does no good.<br><br>Will also like to add that I read the actual newspaper cutting that looks exactly like the one from "The turth" website. And it didn't come from "Ammenusastia". It comes from a small tabloid the equalivence of our Sin Min Pao (probably even smaller, considering that its not even a daily publication)<br><br>[This message has been edited by Illegal Operation (edited 07 August 2000).]</div>
