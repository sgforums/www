            <div class='col-md body'>Of cos. Liverpool have the potential and ability to win the title next season. If they are able to be consistent like wat they are doing now towards the end of the season, I tink that they really can mount a serious championship challenge next season in the EPL and champions league.<br>Look at all the departments in their squad. All are getting stronger and stronger. Their def is good tis season, considering conceding the least goals. Westerveld is even better than Mark Bosnich. Their midfield have a lot of young potentials like steven gerrad and david thompson. Their strike force is stronger with Owen, Fowler and Heskey to choose from. Who dare to say that Liverpool cannot make it the next season.<br><br>Man U have their own problems at the back since the departure of Schmichael. They are buying a new keeper, trying to find the best replacement. Although all their departments in squad are very strong, unless they find a very good keeper, I feel that Liverpool will have their real chance the next season.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hetero5exual: I agree with you totally.  what makes the present ManUre team so hated is their arrogance.  In the 80s when Liverpool rules the pitch, there is no such display from the Liverpool players.  By the way, Liverpool is playing better than ManUre now.  If the season started 10 games later, Liverpool would be leading the league now.</div>

By the way, can u suggest to the english FA to let liverfOOl start playing , say 10 games later next season? Let them start later , just in case they need another reason to back their inadequancy.HAh, that is a lame one.

I too feel that ManUtd players tend to overreact sometimes to referees' decision. Regardless of how wrong or partisan the decisions are, I always feel that one should just shut up and get on with the game. They are paid to play soccer and should just keep to that. However, I don't think that kind of childish behaviour belongs to just MaNUtD players only. Alan Shearer and Dennis Wise are just 2 of the many more suckers who whine more than they entertain.No doubt, they might be the best in the current England squad, but this gives them no right to whine and whimper. Hmm, why don't u comment on that too ,HS?? HahaA of course, your LiverFoOL team is still the best. Needless to say.

Basically, i find it pretty disturbing to see fans throwing tantrums at each other about who is better and who is greater. Well, anyway, i am a Spurs fan.  But Real in real honesty deserved to win after showing good counter-attackts to throw off the man utd Defence. But Man utd were unlucky not to have scored after few brilliant saves by the Real Keeper.  Anyway, as fans of soccer clubs, we should not only support the clubs but for soccer as well.  I was a neutreul spectator and really loved the way the football was played. Fast and exciting..Cheerios everyone...and about Liverpool winning the title next season?? hmm.. who knows.. except that i secretly hope that Spurs do win it..haha..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HAHAHAHA...you want to know why we hate Man U?<br><br>It's not because of the club or anything but it's because they have players and fans with an ATTITUDE problem.<br><br>No it's not because we are jealous of their success coz they are still not the BIGGEST club in Europe yet and when they won the Champions' League once, they thought they rule the world. What a joke. There are clubs which won far more European Cup then ManUre.<br><br>As for the players, all of them are assholes just like the fans.<br><br>I was laughing when i saw that David Beckham was doing when he was only tripped by Campo and he made a meal out of the tackle, pretending to be injure. Wah C,mon lah, just because you are a loser who got sent off play Simone play acting in the world cup doesn't mean now you must use that tactic to get your opponent players into trouble. if you want to act, brush up your skills first lah. It's not the first time since he did it. Remember he got another player sent off for Bordeaux?<br><br>As for Keane the ass, he always think he is the BIGGEST player on the pitch. He always ARGUE with referee and not even THREATEN the referee. And he is the dirtiest player on the pitch. He always make blatant fouls and expect to get away scotch free and yet the IRONICAL thing is that he lose his temper when his opponents foul him. AHAHAHAH&gt; if you can foul people still expect people to be nice to you ar? Use your big bald head to Think lah.<br><br>For Gary Neville, don't be fooled by his innonence face, he is the one who cheats most on the field. He has all kind sof tricks up his sleeve when he take on attackers like pulling their shirt, tripping them, pushing them....ugh anything you can think of he will do. But too bad, there is nothing you can hide from the TV and we all saw that.<br><br>Well, there are thousand and one reasons for us to hate Man U and i dun think you Man U Suckers will want us to spell them out.<br><br>Bye bye.<br><br>i had a good laugh when i saw them bringing on shittyham and baby face to try to turn the match around like against Man U. C'mon lah. Everyday sunday ah? Lightning dun strike twice.</div>
