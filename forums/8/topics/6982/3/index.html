What a joke. There are clubs which won far more European Cup then ManUre.<br><br>As for the players, all of them are assholes just like the fans.<br><br>I was laughing when i saw that David Beckham was doing when he was only tripped by Campo and he made a meal out of the tackle, pretending to be injure. Wah C,mon lah, just because you are a loser who got sent off play Simone play acting in the world cup doesn't mean now you must use that tactic to get your opponent players into trouble. if you want to act, brush up your skills first lah. It's not the first time since he did it. Remember he got another player sent off for Bordeaux?<br><br>As for Keane the ass, he always think he is the BIGGEST player on the pitch. He always ARGUE with referee and not even THREATEN the referee. And he is the dirtiest player on the pitch. He always make blatant fouls and expect to get away scotch free and yet the IRONICAL thing is that he lose his temper when his opponents foul him. AHAHAHAH&gt; if you can foul people still expect people to be nice to you ar? Use your big bald head to Think lah.<br><br>For Gary Neville, don't be fooled by his innonence face, he is the one who cheats most on the field. He has all kind sof tricks up his sleeve when he take on attackers like pulling their shirt, tripping them, pushing them....ugh anything you can think of he will do. But too bad, there is nothing you can hide from the TV and we all saw that.<br><br>Well, there are thousand and one reasons for us to hate Man U and i dun think you Man U Suckers will want us to spell them out.<br><br>Bye bye.<br><br>i had a good laugh when i saw them bringing on shittyham and baby face to try to turn the match around like against Man U. C'mon lah. Everyday sunday ah? Lightning dun strike twice.</div></blockquote>Well said.<br><br>Comment on phunky as a kid, I gladly agree on that.<br>If he's not a kid, well I guess he's a real 'mature' man then.<br><br>Some people just watch soccer for the sake of his supported team to win. Don't you all think soccer should be appreciated in many other aspect? I do enjoy watching brilliant soccer goals and thrilling match rather than just the trashing matches.<br><br>I am not Anti-ManU but their fans, especially local nerdos really makes Man United looks bad.<br><br></div>

They play as a team, and dun have individual players...<br><br>I must say though that liverpool and Leeds will become the most threatening teams next season bcoz now everyone knows how MU plays hence they simply crowd the midfield and dun give giggs and beckham space to roam...<br><br>Anyway, i think the most imortant player that liverpool should groom is litmanen..he's the one creative spark that liverpool has been lacking, the zidane of juventus and bergkamp of arsenal...<br><br>at the same time, leeds is becoming a really exciting team to watch...heck i sill think lee bowyer and woodgate are guilty lah...c'mon with their unbelievable testamonials, i find find it impossible for bowyer to excuse himself from the bloodstain...<br></div>

But the emphatic declaration from Anfield yesterday cannot be ignored. The king is dead, long live the king.<br><br>And that king is Owen - idolised by England, feared by the rest of the world but, in a dwindling corner of Liverpool, still second fiddle in the interrupted rhapsody of Robbie.<br><br>With Fowler departed on an Â£11million secondment to the Leeds United championship cause, Owen laid a further irrefutable claim to the Anfield throne with his 25th goal in his last 22 games for Liverpool.<br><br>It is an astonishing return by any standards and the sheer magnificence of the strike, which fractured the stout resistance of Middlesbrough, might be the highlight of the remarkable collection.<br><br>A touch from Patrik Berger was sufficient to create the time and space for Owen to rifle, from 25 yards, an unstoppable effort far beyond the reach of replacement goalkeeper Marlon Beresford in the 27th minute.<br><br>For a moment, Boro manager Steve McClaren probably did not know whether to laugh or cry. With his England hat on he would have been as ecstatic as the rest of a huge Anfield crowd rejoicing at what Owen does best. But as architect of the recent Boro revival, McClaren must have been aware his best-laid plans were in tatters.<br><br>Boro, previously unbeaten in four games after a sticky beginning to McClaren's first stint as a manager, had clearly schemed to soak up the inevitable Anfield pressure before striking on the break.<br><br>Theory and practice can often be impossible to combine, especially against this reconstructed and rejuvenated Liverpool, who play the pressure game in all areas of the field.<br><br>Boro discovered it was impossible to break out of their own besieged backyard because Liverpool's midfield unit of Danny Murphy, Gary McAllister and Dietmar Hamann persisted in hustling and bustling at their gate.<br><br>Even after Owen blasted through, Liverpool remained hell-bent on exploiting further their advantage.<br><br>And, when Boro's Franck Queudrue carelessly dropped the latch three minutes into first-half stoppage-time, Liverpool came barging through again. Jari Litmanen sought out Berger, who finished as explosively as Owen.<br><br>It had been hardly to the advantage of Boro when goalkeeper Mark Crossley was carried off after brave resistance at the feet of McAllister. But even if Beresford had been able to join Crossley and regular first-choice goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, it is unlikely the entire trio could have denied Owen and Berger, such was the ferocity of their efforts.<br><br>McClaren made a couple of changes at the break, Hamilton Ricard and Mark Wilson replacing Szilard Nemeth and Allan Johnston, but the pattern remained the same.<br><br>Alen Boksic did provide an uplifting moment a couple of minutes into the second period with a biting shot, towards the Liverpool near post, which was excellently rebuffed by Jerzy Dudek.<br><br>There was even the unusual sight of Owen spooning high and wide an opportunity provided for him by the astute McAllister.<br><br>Bookings for Queudrue and Colin Cooper betrayed the need for more expert resistance from Boro.<br><br>The eventual result was never in doubt, however, providing care-taker-manager Phil Thompson with his 11th Premiership game unbeaten since being ushered into the front line following the incapacity of Gerard Houllier.<br><br>The Anfield roar in response to the information that Manchester United had tumbled again at Old Trafford was almost as deafening as the response to the latest strike from Owen.<br><br>Six points clear at the top is one thing, 11 points in front of United even more encouraging to Liverpool ambitions of a first championship success in 11 years.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bringing an old topic back to life?<br>Hmm, this should be the most interesting season yet! Liverpool, top of the table, but only 6 points seperating the top 8 teams!<br>True enough, MU season seems to be faltering with the gravest mistake in selling Stam, and i think Liverpool might have made a similar mistake in selling Fowler. With Fowler gone, Liverpool is left with just one out-an-out striker in Owen, and i believe that Liverpool is slightly over-reliant on Owen for goals. (Evident againts Chelsea).<br>Anyway, i do hope that this season will go to the wire. Pool, Man U, Arsenal, Newcastle Chelsea and Leeds all with a chance. Spurs and Villa dark horses? Well, with the way the season is going, it's really hard to predict eh?</div>
