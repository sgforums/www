              <p><strong>As Singapore reviews its education system, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday tried to put things in perspective.</strong></p>
              <p>His message: Singapore's education system is a good one that has delivered results over the years.</p>
              <p>   Mr Lee, who was the guest of honour at the anniversary celebration of Chong Boon Secondary School in his Teck Ghee ward, said the education system has been criticised for being too structured, pressured and competitive, The Straits Times reported.</p>
              <p>   He acknowledged that this has caused stress for some parents and students.</p>
              <p>   To address these concerns, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has taken steps to reduce pressure and unhealthy competition in the past year. For example, by not releasing the names of the top Primary School Leaving Examination performers and banding, instead of grading, students for co-curricular activities.</p>
              <p>   "But while we try to improve our education system further, we should not forget that we have a good system which delivers good results," he added.</p>
              <p>   This has been borne out by the consistently good performance of students in international competitions and rankings, said Mr Lee, with the most recent being the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa).</p>
              <p>   Singapore's 15-year-olds came out top in problem-solving in the global ranking of student skills conducted by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p>
              <p>   This was a test could not be studied for and which required common sense, creativity and judgement, noted Mr Lee.</p>
              <p>   The 14,00 students who took the test were randomly picked by Pisa and not the MOE, said Mr Lee, and had come from different schools and socio-economic backgrounds and were of different races.</p>
              <p>   "We can confidently say that our schools and our students are not faring too badly, compared to any other country," he said.</p>
              <p>   But more can be done to raise the quality of every education institution here, no matter who they cater to, he added.</p>

              <p>In Singapore, We complain about a stressful lifestyle and high standard of living. But there is always a trade off. This is a safe country to live in, you don't have to worry about going home late at 10 or 11 at night. You don't hear about murders, rapes etc in the news on a weekly basis. The political system is relatively transparent and non currupted. </p>

              <p>For your view on non-corrupted, it was true in the past (only 2 rare 'history' case involving from HDB and PUB board) until when our gahment decided to build 2 casinos here, and irony later, it is one of an civil servant from Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) officer who  misappropriated money for 'gambling' and charged.</p>
              <p>Also not to forget you can't even trust local 'charities' organisation nowadays cos you might never know where the money go to, just read the past NKF, Renci and the recent CHC news you will know what I mean . Do Taiwan had the same problem with charities organisation misappropriated of fund as well?</p>

              <p>I am not a PAP-supporter. In fact, i have never voted for them
              :)</p>
              <p>I am not brain-washed, I have studied enough to know the truth
              about Singapore's political system. (Think: the fact that Singapore
              government can pay themselves that kind of salaries openly, the
              fact that a certain family seems to be in control of Singapore
              etc). I do not think Singapore is a 100% free from corruption, that
              is why I said it was 'relative'. Then again, no country can be a
              100% free from corruption. There are alot of things I dislike about
              here. Like any Singaporean, I do not like that the country no
              longer belongs to true-blue Singaporeans (I know it's ironic as I
              have a Taiwanese mother). But I was born in Singapore and have
              studied its education from kindergarten all the way to a local
              university. There are many things that I do not agree with its
              system - the way that the school systems are taught to indirectly
              support PAP's works, the way that research/views that are
              political-sensitive will never get a chance to be published openly
              etc. I do not like that Singaporeans are not 'protected' in
              schools, universities, workplace - foreigners seem to be accepted
              before us. </p>
              <p>My view is that if you truly dislike living here, then leave
              this place for a few years. Go out there and experience for
              yourselves. Retain your Singaporean citizenship so that you can
              also return whenever. That is what I will be doing - moving to
              South Korea for good but retaining my citizenship.</p>

              <p>I am not a PAP-supporter. In fact, i have never voted for them
              :)</p>
              <p>I am not brain-washed, I have studied enough to know the truth
              about Singapore's political system. (Think: the fact that Singapore
              government can pay themselves that kind of salaries openly, the
              fact that a certain family seems to be in control of Singapore
              etc). I do not think Singapore is a 100% free from corruption, that
              is why I said it was 'relative'. Then again, no country can be a
              100% free from corruption. There are alot of things I dislike about
              here. Like any Singaporean, I do not like that the country no
              longer belongs to true-blue Singaporeans (I know it's ironic as I
              have a Taiwanese mother). But I was born in Singapore and have
              studied its education from kindergarten all the way to a local
              university. There are many things that I do not agree with its
              system - the way that the school systems are taught to indirectly
              support PAP's works, the way that research/views that are
              political-sensitive will never get a chance to be published openly
              etc. I do not like that Singaporeans are not 'protected' in
              schools, universities, workplace - foreigners seem to be accepted
              before us. </p>
              <p>My view is that if you truly dislike living here, then leave
              this place for a few years. Go out there and experience for
              yourselves. Retain your Singaporean citizenship so that you can
              also return whenever. That is what I will be doing - moving out for
              good but retaining my citizenship.</p>
