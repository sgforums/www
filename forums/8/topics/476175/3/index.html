                  Hey, this topic is about Singapore vs Taiwan.. Of course I pity the cat which is being abused, and the college student should be punished severely, but what I meant was that we are supposed to be discussing about Singapore and Taiwan environment etc, and 1 incident like this does not mean that ALL Taiwanese behave like this...

              Yes, for this I agree with you that the Taiwan government settled this issue poorly. He was supposed to be charged with 10 years in jail but it got reduced to 22 months because of his performance in Golden Melody Awards this year...

              <p>you really can't compare the entertainment industries between Singapore and HK, Taiwan or even China. HK and Taiwan movie industries started even before WW2, if I am not wrong. and they have millions of Chinese, speaking mandarin or cantonese, to choose from to act. Singapore had our own TV programs only in the 70s, when music was provided by ahmat jaffar and his orchestra, which was at best a band, and later they made the é›¾é”�å�—æ´‹, even then the actor é»„æ–‡æ°¸ï¼Œwas from malaysia.</p>
              <p>We have 70% of our population Chinese out of 3.5 million when we started, when more than half jia kangtang cannot speak mandarin, where to find actors actresses. until now they still can't make a proper drama in english. I don't see our english entertainment programs anywhere outside Singapore. I hope our malay programs are sold to Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
              <p>in Taiwan, guys like ä¹�å­” can survive just acting like a clown. We need another çŽ‹æ²™é‡Žå³°ã€‚</p>
              <p>The other problem we have is that we don't have ideas for good scripts. Singapore history too short. for variety shows we don't have sense of humour. no gossip no dirty jokes. We also cannot show much about our government or civil service. Their face skin so thin and if we have shows like å…¨æ°‘ä¹±è®²ï¼Œnext day sure kena called for coffee.for this I have great respect for jack neo.</p>
              <p>I think by and large we are alright when you see é›¾é”�å�—æ´‹,and å°�å¨˜æƒ¹shown in mainland china. we have å­™ç‡•å§¿ï¼Œè”¡å�¥é›…ï¼ŒJJï¼Œ é˜¿æ�œ very well known in China. For a little red dot with a small population speaking mandarin, we are not bad.</p>

              Yup, I agree with you. Singapore shows lack creativity and our local hosts have absolutely not skills in hosting as well. Even the recent cooking show ä¸‰è�œä¸€æ±¤ they have to hire æ›¾å›½åŸŽ to host... Singapore dramas are rather boring too, the actors cant act as well as Taiwanese actors... Taiwan's å�¶åƒ�å‰§ have way more standard

              <p><br>Yup, I agree with you. Singapore shows lack creativity and our local hosts have absolutely not skills in hosting as well. Even the recent cooking show ä¸‰è�œä¸€æ±¤ they have to hire æ›¾å›½åŸŽ to host... Singapore dramas are rather boring too, the actors cant act as well as Taiwanese actors... Taiwan's å�¶åƒ�å‰§ have way more standard</p>

              <p><br>Don't watch.   the only shows I watch are those Tuesday Special, their walk about to finding good food in Singapore.   That is all.  They are fine in these two shows.</p>

              Singapore can't even produce any ç»¼è‰ºèŠ‚ç›®(entertainment shows), and even if they really do, the hosts have no standard at all, their å�£æ‰� are nothing compared to å�´å®—å®ªï¼Œå°�é’Ÿ etc... making our shows boring. That's why I always have to turn to Taiwan channels to watch dramas and shows, Mediacorp is seriously full of crap. Even news reporters are not local talent...
