              <p>I lived in 3 countries in the past 8 years and Taiwan was one of them. </p>
              <p>Claims that some others have here might not be as accurate. If one has never lived aboard, i wonder how you can make claims like that. Visiting and living in another country is totally different.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Yes, Singapore govt has strong ties with their KMT party but President Ma has only his final term to run. After that, it will be another president that will take over. </span></p>
              <p>Food poison ? Every country has that, how about trying to defend the fact that Singapore has Dengue ? A first world nation but it can't control the spread of it. =) Mate, if you understand chinese culture at all, Taiwan has more of a traditional culture then China. Mao Tze Tung's party rulled for many years oppressing the people's culture and growth. </p>
              <p>Taiwan has it's pros. Citizens and work permit holders are entitled to universal health care and dental. High income taxes for forigen works, to control the influx of work permit holders.</p>
              <p>Natural beauty, landscape and people with great characters and culture. Yes, the fear of China taking over one day is there, and the fact that the UN does not recognize Taiwan's independence.

              <p>I agree with what you said.    Food prices can be as low as S$1.50 for noodle.   A great place for nature and beautiful landscape and beaches.    Generally , people are passionate and easygoing.   24 hour bookshop.</p>
              <p>Depends on what you place as important.   I deem food safety as priority.   Moreover, I don't want to be in a Chinese speaking environment for too long.</p>

              True, there are way too few places to visit in Singapore, and the scenery are not as beautiful as other countries, things are also cheaper while people are generally friendlier.. unlike our MRT where people always argue over trival matters. Although Singapore is free of natural disasters and is very safe...
