              <p><strong>Taiwan riot police yesterday unleashed water cannons to evict hundreds of demonstrators who had stormed government headquarters, dramatically escalating a protest against a trade pact with China.</strong></p>
              <p>After close to week-long occupation of Taiwan's parliament, the protesters also infilitrated the Executive Yuan where the cabinet offices are located. On Sunday night, they pulled down barbed-wire barricades outside and used ladders to break into offices on the second floor, reported AFP.</p>
              <p>   This came after President Ma Ying-jeou refused to back down on the trade pact.</p>
              <p>   Premier Jiang Yi-huah, whose office is in the Executive Yuan building, said at least 110 people were injured, included 52 police officers, while 61 arrests were made.</p>
              <p>   Some protesters damaged windows and doors of ministerial offices and tried to remove government documents before they were stopped, officials said.</p>
              <p>   They added that the premier's office was not breached.</p>
              <p>   Early on Monday, riot police dragged up people sitting on the ground, and used riot shields to push the crowds back while some of the demonstrators tried to grab their batons and pelted them with plastic bottles.</p>
              <p>   Two water cannon trucks were then deployed, eventually subduing the crowd and clearing the building.</p>
              <p>   "Suddenly water was spraying at us and it was very powerful. My glasses flew off and I was very dizzy," said Mr Frank Hsieh, a former premier from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #0070c0; font-size: 16pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">WATER CANNONS</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a statement, the presidential office said the dispersal was lawful and denounced the violence.</p>
              <p>   "We will not tolerate actions designed to paralyse the government," it added.</p>
              <p>   But the DPP, which historically has favoured formal independence for Taiwan, called on Mr Ma to respond to the protesters' demands and scarp the pact.</p>
              <p>   "Forcible dispersals will only cause more students and police to get hurt and are likely to trigger more outrage and protests," the party said.</p>
              <p>   The president has warned that trade-reliant Taiwan could be marginalised without the China agreement, which is designed to further open up trade in services.</p>
              <p>   During the news conference on Sunday, President Ma denounced the parliamentary sit-in before the protests spread to the Executive Yuan.</p>
              <p>   "Is this the democracy we want? Do we have to do it this way, risking the rule of law?" he asked.</p>
              <p>   The pact, signed last July, is a follow-up to a sweeping economic cooperation agreement signed in 2010 to reduce trade barriers between high-tech Taiwan and the world's second-largest economy.</p>
              <p>   Some 200 protesters - mainly college students - stormed the parliament last Tuesday and took over its main chamber to stop Mr Ma's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party from ratifying the agreement.</p>
              <p>   Following the unruly scenes at the Executive Yuan a short walk away, police showed no sign of intervening to retake control of the chamber, where the protesters remain holed up.</p>
              <p>   Parliamentary speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who is from the KMT party, has called for a peaceful resolution to the sit-in.</p>

              <p><strong>Taiwan riot police yesterday unleashed water cannons to
              evict hundreds of demonstrators who had stormed government
              headquarters, dramatically escalating a protest against a trade
              pact with China.</strong></p>
              <p>After close to week-long occupation of Taiwan's parliament, the
              protesters also infilitrated the Executive Yuan where the cabinet
              offices are located. On Sunday night, they pulled down barbed-wire
              barricades outside and used ladders to break into offices on the
              second floor, reported AFP.</p>
              <p>   This came after President Ma Ying-jeou refused to
              back down on the trade pact.</p>
              <p>   Premier Jiang Yi-huah, whose office is in the
              Executive Yuan building, said at least 110 people were injured,
              included 52 police officers, while 61 arrests were made.</p>
              <p>   Some protesters damaged windows and doors of
              ministerial offices and tried to remove government documents before
              they were stopped, officials said.</p>
              <p>   They added that the premier's office was not
              breached.</p>
              <p>   Early on Monday, riot police dragged up people
              sitting on the ground, and used riot shields to push the crowds
              back while some of the demonstrators tried to grab their batons and
              pelted them with plastic bottles.</p>
              <p>   Two water cannon trucks were then deployed,
              eventually subduing the crowd and clearing the building.</p>
              <p>   "Suddenly water was spraying at us and it was very
              powerful. My glasses flew off and I was very dizzy," said Mr Frank
              Hsieh, a former premier from the opposition Democratic Progressive
              Party (DPP).</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In a statement, the presidential office said the dispersal was
              lawful and denounced the violence.</p>
              <p>   "We will not tolerate actions designed to paralyse
              the government," it added.</p>
              <p>   But the DPP, which historically has favoured formal
              independence for Taiwan, called on Mr Ma to respond to the
              protesters' demands and scarp the pact.</p>
              <p>   "Forcible dispersals will only cause more students
              and police to get hurt and are likely to trigger more outrage and
              protests," the party said.</p>
              <p>   The president has warned that trade-reliant Taiwan
              could be marginalised without the China agreement, which is
              designed to further open up trade in services.</p>
              <p>   During the news conference on Sunday, President Ma
              denounced the parliamentary sit-in before the protests spread to
              the Executive Yuan.</p>
              <p>   "Is this the democracy we want? Do we have to do it
              this way, risking the rule of law?" he asked.</p>
              <p>   The pact, signed last July, is a follow-up to a
              sweeping economic cooperation agreement signed in 2010 to reduce
              trade barriers between high-tech Taiwan and the world's
              second-largest economy.</p>
              <p>   Some 200 protesters - mainly college students -
              stormed the parliament last Tuesday and took over its main chamber
              to stop Mr Ma's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party from ratifying the
              agreement.</p>
              <p>   Following the unruly scenes at the Executive Yuan a
              short walk away, police showed no sign of intervening to retake
              control of the chamber, where the protesters remain holed up.</p>
              <p>   Parliamentary speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who is from
              the KMT party, has called for a peaceful resolution to the
              sit-in.</p>
