              <p>I am not a PAP-supporter. In fact, i have never voted for them
              :)</p>
              <p>I am not brain-washed, I have studied enough to know the truth
              about Singapore's political system. (Think: the fact that Singapore
              government can pay themselves that kind of salaries openly, the
              fact that a certain family seems to be in control of Singapore
              etc). I do not think Singapore is a 100% free from corruption, that
              is why I said it was 'relative'. Then again, no country can be a
              100% free from corruption. There are alot of things I dislike about
              here. Like any Singaporean, I do not like that the country no
              longer belongs to true-blue Singaporeans (I know it's ironic as I
              have a Taiwanese mother). But I was born in Singapore and have
              studied its education from kindergarten all the way to a local
              university. There are many things that I do not agree with its
              system - the way that the school systems are taught to indirectly
              support PAP's works, the way that research/views that are
              political-sensitive will never get a chance to be published openly
              etc. I do not like that Singaporeans are not 'protected' in
              schools, universities, workplace - foreigners seem to be accepted
              before us. </p>
              <p>My view is that if you truly dislike living here, then leave
              this place for a few years. Go out there and experience for
              yourselves. Retain your Singaporean citizenship so that you can
              also return whenever. That is what I will be doing - moving out for
              good but retaining my citizenship.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>glad you have the courage to venture outside Singapore. pleased to know you have found a place of comfort for your life. good to know there are places where you can put your talents to fruitful use.</p>
              <p>But if you are keeping your citizenship, so you can call Singapore your country, then it would benefit all Singaporean if you can and come back, like Mr Chen Show Mao, with all your experience, to make changes to the systems and policies for a better Singapore. Otherwise, keeping Singapore citizenship would be just a fall back, in case you don't make it overseas.</p>

              <p>Thanks :)</p>
              <p>I'm actually not technically "venturing" overseas. Just likely to be marrying there. So maybe I'll keep my citizenship just incase I get a divorce? haha just kidding. I'm keeping my citizenship because I want to be able to visit my family easily, visa-free etc.</p>

              <p>Singlish originated from english, with lots of other languages and dialects, local expressions added in, and is becoming further and further away from the victoria english.</p>
              <p>but still when you are not sure and you ask and most Singaporeans would explain to you in simple english. in taiwan, if they don't know english, they still can't explain what the hokkien or mandarin means.</p>
