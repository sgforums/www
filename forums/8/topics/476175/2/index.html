              <p>ben1406 and coffeebreak, have not been following taiwan news.
                     Taiwan is not as great as ever.    The food
                  poison has gotten worst.   From fried chicken to soy sauce and
                  oil use at home contain poisonous products.   Frying oil used
                  for more than ten years.   Baby milk powder contain poison
                  product.</p>
              <p>Working class in Taiwan like most Singaporeans are complaining
                  that their salary does not allow them to cope with ever rising
                  living costs well.</p>
              <p>Security is not too good.</p>
              <p>BUT if you are only looking at beautiful landscape, nature and
                  friendly people Taiwan has it.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Honestly, the news / media hypes out everything. The news i watched before leaving Taipei for Singapore on Sg's dengue problem wasn't very comforting to know. Words likes epidemic were used, but when i came back it wasn't as bad as what the news reported.  </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Honestly, i have not experienced any food poisoning problems. Yeah, there were some issues about the pearls from the milk tea. Baby milk problem was from China. Fry oil problem ? LOL, dude even the US had problems like that last year. Singapore had it's fair share on food poisoning in major hotels like MBS and Intercontinental just this year eh. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If you lived overseas, try watching the news esp when they cover topics on Singapore. You will be surprise what your govt blocks out from you mate. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Working class people all over the world complain about inflation, ain't only Taiwan. AT LEAST the Taiwanese workers don't complain about everything under the sun every MIN of their time. =)</span></p>
              <p>Security i admit, no country beats Singapore in safety. But then again, if any govt takes away any rights of freedom or acts, I am sure those country would be PRETTY safe to be living in too. </p>

Mainly stating that there are pros &amp; cons living in either place and that ppl should immerse in the culture to  get an accurate idea of whats what.

              <p>I lived in 3 countries in the past 8 years and Taiwan was one of
              them. </p>
              <p>Claims that some others have here might not be as accurate. If
              one has never lived aboard, i wonder how you can make claims like
              that. Visiting and living in another country is totally
              different.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Yes, Singapore govt has strong
              ties with their KMT party but President Ma has only his final term
              to run. After that, it will be another president that will take
              over. </span></p>
              <p>Food poison ? Every country has that, how about trying to defend
              the fact that Singapore has Dengue ? A first world nation but it
              can't control the spread of it. =) Mate, if you understand chinese
              culture at all, Taiwan has more of a traditional culture then
              China. Mao Tze Tung's party rulled for many years oppressing the
              people's culture and growth. </p>
              <p>Taiwan has it's pros. Citizens and work permit holders are
              entitled to universal health care and dental. High income taxes for
              forigen works, to control the influx of work permit holders.</p>
              <p>Natural beauty, landscape and people with great characters and
              culture. Yes, the fear of China taking over one day is there, and
              the fact that the UN does not recognize Taiwan's independence. But
              maybe that might not be a bad thing after all should China decide
              to take em back like HK.  </p>
              <p>Everyone is entitled to their opinions but having the experience
              living there, i look forward to the day my company sends me back to
              manage there again. </p>

              <p>well, first of all, don't get involved in their politics if you live there, å¤–çœ�äººsaid Ma is good, æœ¬çœ�äººsaid Ma is no good. so when Ma's term ends, another é˜¿æ‰� take over, good? go to å�—æŠ• wearing a blue shirt and said you from from the north, and you don't speak å�°è¯­ï¼Œyou are not likely to be very welcome there.</p>
              <p>You can hardly compared dengue in Singapore with the poison food in Taiwan or China. Dengue comes from natural breading of mosquita in the hot and humid weather in Singapore, nobody intentionally bread mosquitoï¼Œand to say that it is out of control is to agree with their news that dengue is epidemic, and that is rubbish. the é»‘å¿ƒé£Ÿç‰© come from unscupulous businessmen trying to make more profit by mixing industrial chemicals with food products. That is to do is è‰¯å¿ƒï¼Œé�“å¾·ã€‚ </p>
              <p>Taiwan used to be the only strong pillar of Chinese Culture, but with the so called æœ¬åœŸåŒ–ï¼Œwe are seeing more and more of those çŒªå“¥äº® and è®¸çº¯ç¾Ž type of mandarin. You need to be in HK as well for better exposure to traditional chinese.</p>
              <p>It is nice to live in any countries with rural areas, and not so hot like Singapore, as long as there is stability, and as long as company is paying for your rent. and if you speak english and come from Singapore, and you speak a little Hokkien, the å�°å¦¹è¾£å¦¹ will all want crowd around you...enjoy yourself.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">TAIPEI - The head of a leading Taiwanese cooking oil company was sentenced to 16 years in prison after being convicted on fraud and mislabelling charges in one of the biggest food scandals to rock the island.</p>
              <p>   Kao Chen-li (right), chairman of the Changchi Foodstuff Factory in Changhua, central Taiwan, was meted out the punishment by the county district court yesterday after he was caught adulterating olive oil for illegal profit.</p>
              <p>   Television images showed Kao, who did not attend the court, being handcuffed and taken away by police as he reported to the authorities as part of the investigation into the scandal.</p>
              <p>   "The defendant had cheated consumers and reaped huge benefits by adulterating oil products," the Changhua district court said in a statement.</p>
              <p>   "Even worse, he had added copper chlorophyllin and cotton-seed oil, causing unrest among the public," it said.</p>
              <p>   Copper chlorophyllin is a banned colouring agent. Cotton-seed oil is a cheap ingredient that experts say could cause infertility and impotence.</p>
              <p>   Kao's company was also fined NT$50 million (S$2.1 million).</p>
              <p>   The Changchi food scandal surfaced in mid-October, after the company was found to have adulterated olive oil for years.</p>
              <p>   Prosecutors in Changhua in October indicted Kao on charges of violating food safety laws and making huge illegal profits through false labelling.</p>
              <p>   The local government also slapped a record fine of NT$1.85 billion on Kao.</p>
              <p>   Further investigation of the case by prosecutors found that the tainted oil products manufactured by Kao had also been supplied to other major cooking oil retailers in Taiwan.</p>
              <p>   Among them was Wei Chuan Foods Corp, the Taiwanese unit of Ting Hsin International Group, which owns the Master Kong instant noodle brand.</p>
              <p>   Wei Yin-chun, chairman of Wei Chuan, was released on bail last month following an overnight interrogation on suspicion of fraud and violating food safety laws.</p>
              <p>   But Wei insisted that his company was unaware when it purchased oil from Changchi that it contained the banned colouring agent.</p>
              <p>   Singapore's Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority said in late October that the tainted oil manufactured by Changchi was not imported to the island.</p>
              <p>   But a brand of sesame oil from Flavor Full, another Taiwanese firm embroiled in the food scandal, had reached local trade fairs in small number.</p>

              Food safety (due particularly to the oil) has been an issue in Taiwan for the past 1 year, as the free press and government in Taiwan is cracking hard on stamping out the problem. The main issue is the oil scandal which affects many food industry in Taiwan. 
              Taiwanese media has the capacity to sensationalize this issue, particularly as it is a growing concern. It will take a while for the issue to die down. Perhaps, it might affect tourism in Taiwan, but only for a short while.
              
              Yet, when I go back to Taiwan, I don't feel anything wrong with the food there.
              
              Quite frankly speaking, the Singapore vs Taiwan is a question of comparison. Personally, I feel Singapore beats Taiwan in terms of economy GDP, or in English standard, living standard. Singapore is a better place to do business due to its globalization.
              
              But Taiwan beats Singapore (in areas of people), in terms of friendliness, cultural refinement, äººæƒ…å‘³ .  Not to mention, many å�°ç�£æ­£å¦¹ are usually more gentle, prettier and softer than Singaporean girls. haha..
              
              j/s I'm a Taiwanese who have lived in Singapore for 30 years. But anyway, I like both places.

              Taiwan is not "officially" part of "China (PRC)". Taiwan is called Republic of China (R.O.C), although the R.O.C constitution includes both mainland China and Taiwan. R.O.C now controls the free-territory Taiwan, kinmen, Matsu and other islands.
              
              Anyway, Taiwan is considered a de-facto country and R.O.C used to represent China in UN from 1945-1972 before being ousted out of UN due to PRC.

              <p>aiyoo...I think I hit on your nerve. There are good things and bad 
                      things about every country, you talked all the good thing about taiwan, 
                      and when a not so good thing is mentioned, you defend it with the many 
                      bad things in Singapore. hmmm....</p>
              <p>try listen to æ–°é—»é¾™å�·é£Žï¼Œ å�°æ¹¾ä¸­å¤©äºšæ´²å�°ï¼Œ

                      to what was reported in some of their news.</p>
              <p>Last time when I visit

                      to continue to corrupt, just because there are also corruption everywhere.</p>

              <p>Honestly, the news / media hypes out everything. The news i
              watched before leaving Taipei for Singapore on Sg's dengue problem
              wasn't very comforting to know. Words likes epidemic were used, but
              when i came back it wasn't as bad as what the news reported.
               </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Honestly, i have not
              experienced any food poisoning problems. Yeah, there were some
              issues about the pearls from the milk tea. Baby milk problem was
              from China. Fry oil problem ? LOL, dude even the US had problems
              like that last year. Singapore had it's fair share on food
              poisoning in major hotels like MBS and Intercontinental just this
              year eh. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If you lived overseas, try
              watching the news esp when they cover topics on Singapore. You will
              be surprise what your govt blocks out from you mate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Working class people all over
              the world complain about inflation, ain't only Taiwan. AT LEAST the
              Taiwanese workers don't complain about everything under the sun
              every MIN of their time. =)</span></p>
              <p>Security i admit, no country beats Singapore in safety. But then
              again, if any govt takes away any rights of freedom or acts, I am
              sure those country would be PRETTY safe to be living in
              too. </p>

              <p>I don't condone disapproval of the need to voice out concern by Singaporeans.   Have a heart for the people who are struggling to make ends meet in Singapore.      To you, Singaporeans should just shut up and live with the problems created by the govt?</p>
              <p>You are not Taiwanese,  if you live there long term I will believe you.    </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In fact, I got to know the riot in Little India thru Taiwanese news.   They did not report inaccurately.</span></p>

              <p>You watched their current affair or news you will know the Taiwanese can be complaining much more than Singaporeans.   They are very explicit in their complaints.</p>
