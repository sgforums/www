The big red bell<br>gives a loud BEEEP! when pressed.There are colourful tickets for TIBS buses. The conductor will check for tickets by using a machine which punches a hole on the ticket.<br><br>9. Your favourite actor and actress is Huang Wenyong and Xiangyun.<br>Next is Lee Nanxing and Zoe Tay and the Aiyoyo woman.<br><br>10. You've probably read Young Generation magazine.

You watched TV2(also known as Channel 10) cartoons because Channel5 never had enough cartoons for you.<br><br>17.

Your form teacher taught you maths, science and english.<br><br>36. The worksheets were made of brown rough paper of poor quality.<br><br>37. You went to school in slippers and a raincoat when it rained, and you find a dry spot in the school to sit<br>down, dry your feet, and wear your dry and warm socks and shoes.<br><br>38.

The only computer lessons in school involved funny pixellised characters in 16 colours walking about trying to teach you maths. <strong>i did not touch any computer until tertiary ed</strong><br><br>26. Waterbottles were slinged around your neck and a must everywhere you go. <strong>i hated those sissies then, no water bottles for me</strong><br><br>27. Boys loved to play soccer with small tennis balls in the basketball court or play something that uses tennis ball to hit other players known as "HUM TAM BOLA" during recess /after school <strong>always kena "or chair"</strong><br><br>28. Hopskotch, five stones,chateh and zero point were all the rage with the girls and boys too... <strong>y no "go lee" and "spider fighting"</strong><br><br>29. Science was fun with the balsam and the angsana being the most important plants of our lives. <strong>and casurina</strong><br><br>30. Who can forget Ahmad, Bala, Sumei and John, eternalized in our minds from the textbooks. Even Mr Wally. <strong>i only remember xiao ming and xiao qiang <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </strong><br><br>31. You did stupid exercises like seal crawl and frog jumps. <strong>tats really stupid, i always played ball games during pe</strong><br><br>32. Every children's day and national day you either get pins or pens with 'Happy Children's Day 1993' or dumb files with Happy National Day 1994'. <strong>my fav is still the ice cream</strong><br><br>33. In Primary six you had to play buddy for the younger kids like big sister and brother. <strong>got meh</strong><br><br>34. Chinese teachers were always old, boring and damn fierce looking. <strong>no comment <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </strong><br><br>35. Your form teacher taught you maths, science and english. <strong>how lucky are the teachers now</strong><br><br>36. The worksheets were made of brown rough paper of poor quality.<br><br>37. You went to school in slippers and a raincoat when it rained, and you find a dry spot in the school to sit down, dry your feet, and wear your dry and warm socks and shoes.<br><br>38. Famous Chinese singers were only Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok and Leon Lai <strong>who are they then? those times the famous ones were alan tam, leslie cheung, sam hui and teresa teng</strong><br><br>39. School dismissal time was normally around 1 pm.<br><br>40. There would be spelling tests and mental sums to do almost everyday<br><br>41. Your friends considered you lucky and rich if your parents gave you $3 or more for pocket money everyday. <strong>my daily allowance was $0.50 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </strong><br><br>42. During class gatherings, parents always tag along in case someone gets lost at Orchard Road. <strong>please! people last time were more independent.</strong><br><br>43. You freak out when the teacher tells you to line up according to height and hold hands with the corresponding boy or girl. <strong>i relished those opportunities <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </strong><br><br>44. Handkerchiefs were a must for both genders <strong>sissy ... i used my sleeves</strong><br><br>45. Collecting notebooks and all kinds of stationery was a popular thing.<br><br>46. Autograph books were loaded with "Best Wishes", "Forget Me Not", and small poems like "Bird fly high, hard to catch. Friend like you, hard to forget". <strong>at the end still thrown away</strong><br><br>47. Class monitors and prefects loved to say "You talk somemore, I write your name ah!"<br><br>48. There were at least 40 people in one class.<br><br>49. Large, colourful schoolbags were carried.<br><br>50. You brought every single book to school, even though there was one thing called the timetable. <strong>who's tat stupid guy?</strong><br><br>[/b]</blockquote></div>
