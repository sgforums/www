            <div class='col-md body'>[edit] Skater style<br>Golf shirts became part of the new post-grunge style in 1995. Skater shoes became more popular, coinciding with a rise in skateboarding. Granny-style sunglasses were replaced by wraparound sunglasses, which remained more or less popular for the remainder of the 1990s. The bowl cut hairstyle went out of fashion. Teenaged and pre-teen boys adopted shorter hair, especially the buzz cut, but a few maintained the long straight hair of the grunge style. T-shirts became more form fitting, especially for women, with the advent of the baby doll t-shirt.<br><br>[edit] Sagging<br>Sagging remained popular in the late 1990s among some teenaged boys and young men. Sagging is a style worn by teenage and young men in which their shorts, jeans or pants are worn low, usually below their hips and sometimes under their butt as well depending on the sagger. Their underwear, however, is not worn lower and thus one can usually see the underwear of the sagger.Fancy boxer shorts became popular, and many guys showed them off by wearing their pants low so that people could see their boxers. Saggers wore baggy pants, in stark contrast to some of the more fitted styles from the late 1990s. Sagging pants can be found at any U.S. High School among the males.<br><br>[edit] Mod Revival<br>In late 1995, a full revival of Mod fashion followed the new trend of 1994. Bootcut jeans and Levis 501 style jeans superseded wide-leg jeans. Teenaged girls and women began wearing black boots with chunky high heels, began wearing colours such as pink, baby-blue, and plum. Short skirts returned, and Mod inspired suits became popular with men in 1996.<br><br>[edit] Seventies Revival<br>Starting at the tail-end of the 1980s in New York nightclubs, the '70s revival gathered steam as the 1990s approached with such entertainers as Jody Watley, Madonna and Paula Abdul suddenly sporting jackets with wide lapels, hippie-inspired jewelry and bellbottoms (usually made out of spandex and lycra-blend fabrics). Seventies-inspired daisy printed fabrics, peace signs, and tie-dyed t-shirts were fads around the turn of the decade.<br><br>In the year 1990, the movement gathered full steam when house band Deee-Lite emerged into the pop culture scene. The group's lead singer, Lady Miss Kier Kirby, helped popularize platform shoes (especially those by avante-garde shoe designer Fluvog) and Emilio Pucci-inspired tights in their "Groove Is In The Heart" music video.<br><br>By 1992, '70s luxe was in full swing on the world's top designer runways. Such popular designers as Karl Lagerfeld, Anna Sui and Todd Oldham all featured longer skirt lengths, tall and clunky platform boots,and '70s-inspired accessories in their collections. Hip-hugging jeans for women, long straight hair and brightly-colored tights gained in favor. The next year, hot pants and micro-mini skirts made a brief comeback, as did maxi-length skirts and coats, as well as granny boots. Numerous strands of faux pearls were a fad of the time, as were black velvet chokers, long necklaces with large elaborate crosses, and large hats with floppy brims.<br><br>By mid-decade, colours such as bright orange and yellow had become popular even with younger men. Afros and braided hair became popular in the African-American community, especially among younger men and women. Longer hairstyles similar to those worn by early '70s rock groups became popular with young men. Feathered hair, revived by young entertainers like Mary J. Blige and similar to the style worn by '70s icons like Farrah Fawcett, became hugely popular with young women of all ethnic backgrounds as the decade began to draw to a close. Sparkling and glittering cosmetics echoing the disco era also were in vogue for a time in the late '90s.<br><br>Corduroy fabric became popular for pants and overalls, sometimes abbreviated to "cords". Initially brown was the popular colour for "cords". In 1997, cords also became popular in colours such as black, tan, and grey. Corduroy continued as a trend through 2001.<br><br>[edit] Punk/Goth/Emo<br>Punk and alternative styles were common by 1996, including short, spiky hair, black t-shirts, black work pants, wraparound sunglasses, and skater shoes. Many punk and alternative teenagers dyed their hair colours like blue, green, and fuchsia. In 1997, the 1980s Goth trend resurged among teenagers, featuring black clothing, long or back-combed black hair, studded bracelets, and black boots. The Punk and goth styles survived into the 2000s in modified forms. The emo fashion slightly entered the mainstream in 1998-1999. It featured tight, black drain-pipe jeans, rock band t-shirts, and long hair in a form of a sidebang.<br><br>[edit] Nineties Preppy<br>The preppy look returned in 1997 among teenagers. Among teenaged males, the preppy look was at first closely associated with the Tommy Hilfiger clothing line, whose t-shirts and jeans were staples of this look in 1997. The jeans were usually still baggy and often were also sagging.Another staple of the preppy look was Short hair, often dyed blonde (or bleached blonde in the front and spiked). This haircut was called "Princeton" in the United States, and stayed in style there until 2002. Among teenaged females, the preppy look intially featured sweater vests over long sleeved white blouses, then long sleeved cable sweaters over white blouses.<br><br>[edit] Girls' Fashions<br>Spaghetti strap tank tops became a popular among females in 1997, allowing teenaged girls to show more skin, including cleavage. The Skort, a half skirt, half short, also became popular in 1997. It lost popularity in 1998 amid the rise of long wraparound skirts. Colours among teenaged girls in 1997 and 1998 included lemon yellow, lime green, olive green, violet, and grey.<br><br>[edit] Dockers and Cargo pants<br>In 1998, khaki pants became popular among teenaged boys, due to the popularity of golfer Tiger Woods. For the first time, cargo pants became mainstream, reaching suburbs across America. Camo pants also enjoyed a resurgence. Among girls, baby t-shirts and spaghetti strap tank tops were popular, and the low rise jean phenomenon began. In 1999, Aloha shirts (Hawaiian shirts), became a major fad. Capri pants, a tapered pant that ends mid calf, became popular with girls and women as well as boys and men. Pink became the dominant women's clothing colour.<br><br>[edit] Hairstyles<br>Hairstyles also moved away from the 1980s. The high, hair spray-heavy styles favoured by women in the 1980s were replaced by long, straight hair, often with bangs. The "Rachel" haircut became popular, named after the character played by Jennifer Aniston in the sitcom Friends.<br><br>The bowl cut became popular with teenage and pre-teen boys in 1991. The mullet survived in modified form as a male hairstyle until 1992.<br><br></div>
