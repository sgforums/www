            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Pontianak</strong><br>This is perhaps the most frightening of all ghosts and ghouls of South East Asia. It is said that the pontianak is the spirit of a woman who died of childbirth. Sometimes she can look very beautiful, but most of the time she has razor teeth and stalks the night in search for men or pregnant women (it is said she could not bear the thought of other women being able to enjoy motherhood)to suck blood from (sometimes eat the flesh of babies ripped out from their mothers). There are many stories of the pontianak, but perhaps the scariest is the one which happened on the Malaysian highway.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Pic taken at Malaysian highway</span><br><img src="http://www.sfogs.com/ghostpix/hantu1.jpg"><br><br><strong>How it begins</strong><br>The most common belief is that the Pontianak is usually the ghost of a woman who died during childbirth.<br>Another belief is that she was abused by a male individual.<br>But it's not like when a woman did died at childbirth or being abuse will make her return from the grave.<br>Further on,supposedly she will only return as a Pontianak<br>if she has the need to see her child or seeking vengeance upon those who has abused her.<br><br><strong>Appearance</strong><br>Hair which mostly able to cover it's shoulder.<br>Black fingernails which are almost two inches long.<br>It wears a white gown which normally covers it's feet.<br><br><strong>Shape Shifting</strong><br>A large white duck which was never once seen in the area.<br>Normally seen flying near a dark areas which has large trees or flying by a large canal.<br><br><strong>Changes Appearance</strong><br>A Pontianak change it's face into three different appearance<br>01. The face of whom she was when she was alive.<br>02. The face of an old woman.<br>03. The face of a corpse.<br><br><strong>Ward off</strong><br>01. Obviously for Malay ghost, it fear the holy book called The Quran.<br>02. She fears the a fire which will catch a flame on her white gown and burn together with her.<br>03. Making a woman strips naked herself in front of her, she will run away screaming.<br>Pontianak is a 'she' and she do not have what a normal girl has.<br>She'll run away not because she's afraid but because she is ashamed.<br><br><img src="http://www.sfogs.com/ghostpix/v_ghost1.jpg"><br>Here are various location in Singapore where are reported of the Pontianak sightings.<br>Please be clear that you should not go into the area in a couple or alone at around 1915hrs - 0715hrs.<br>If you still stubborn, you might be lucky enough to meet one.<br><br><strong>The White House at Clementi Woods<br>The tallest tower at Pasir Ris Park<br>The maze at Pasir Ris Park<br>The yellow lighthouse at East Cost Park<br>The banana trees plantation at the jogging track, Clementi Avenue 5.<br>Marsh Garden at West Coast Park<br>Among the trees at Labador Park<br>The lake at Kent Ridge Park<br>Among the trees at Kent Ridge Par</strong><br><br><strong>Contact</strong><br><strong>Warning -</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Do this at you own risk.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Some info abt the famous story which happened on the Malaysian Highway</strong><br><br>Nevertheless, there is an incident that happened on the highway that has caught the attention of a lot of people. This incident does not happen along any of those crosswind sections but, instead, near the tunnel on the northern section of the highway. Before approaching the tunnel, drivers will go through highly areas with the hill on one side and a sharp cliff on the other. The sharp bends caused the authorities to put the speed limit down to 80kmph (110kmph for most of the highway).<br><br>This story went public the first time when someone called in to the radio during a ghost story programme. What make this story even more interesting are the several calls later from witnesses and relatives to verify that the story is true.<br><br>The incident happened on a Malay couple with a small baby. They were driving along the expressway on a late night. It must have been past 2am then and there aren't many private cars at those hours. As they got near the tunnel, their car broke down. Perhaps it is the hilly road, which put a lot of stress on the car, that caused the car to broke down more than anything else.<br><br>The man stopped his car along the emergency lane and got off the car to see if there was anything he could do. His wife was sitting at the back of the car with their baby then. He got off the car, opened up the engine and apparently was doing something there. The wife just waited in the car with their baby since she is the type of people who has the slightest idea about cars.<br><br>As the engine cover was turned up, the lady could not see what her husband was doing in front. Then, there was no noise at all. She started to get worried. Perhaps more worried about not being able to get out of there than if there would be anything wrong with her husband. Then the baby started crying. She carried her up and tried to calm her down. However, the baby kept crying and crying.<br><br>Afterwards, she noticed two police cars drove by. They slowed down as they past her. As she thought they would stop, the police cars suddenly sped off. Then she heard a shrieking break of the police cars ahead. Apparently, the police stopped their cars under the lights of the tunnel about 100 metres ahead.<br><br>Then, she started hearing the policemen shouting at her. They shouted at her and asked her to get out of the car and run towards them. She got panic upon hearing that. Then, worry about her baby's and her own safety, she grabbed her baby, got out of the car and started running as fast as she could towards the policemen. As she was running, they kept shouting at her to hurry and asked her not to look back. As she almost got to where the policemen were, she suddenly thought of her husband. She turn her head back to take a look while continued running.<br><br>To her horror, she saw three 'pontianak' (see notes) with lots of blood on their mouth. She saw one of them holding her husband's head and licking off the dripping blood while two others were busy sucking the blood from the man's body.<br><br>Two policemen, fearing that she may stop running upon seeing that, rushed to her and dragged her into one of the police car. They shot off as fast as they could after that. Seven policemen witnessed this incident. When the police got there, the man was lying there headless and 'bloodless'. The police, after interviewing the widow and the seven policemen who witnessed the incident, decided to close the case.<br><br>In the radio programme, someone called up later to say that he was one of the policemen there at that time while another called up claiming to be the victim's uncle. He said he refused to believe the story and had applied for the case to be reopened for investigation. He believes it was a murder case. Another caller said his sister, the widow, was distressed after the incident and he appealed to all listeners to believe that the story is true and be more careful on the highway.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"the pontianak is not only found in malay folklore but thorouhout asia , here a few variations"<br><br>India<br>Churel: A woman, who has died unnaturally or in childbirth during the festival of Divali, may return with her feet on back to front. The Churel attempts to dry the blood of the men of the family. The Churel were generally extremely ugly vampires with sagging breasts, black tongues, thick, rough lips, wild hair and back-to-front feet. They were thought to be bitter and angry due to their untimely death and as a result attacked their families and attractive, young men. In western India the Churel was also known as a Jakhin, Jakhai, Mukai, Nagulai and Alvantin.<br><br>Rakshasa (Rakshasis feminine form): Also seen as Raksasa. These vampires would appear to men and lure them to their death but would also attack babies and pregnant women to drink their blood. There were many legends associated with the Rakshasa (trans. 'Injurer'): some believed that if a child were forced to eat human brains then it would become one, others believed that these vampires caused stomach sicknesses in people who had trespassed into their territory and that these fanged creatures dwelt in trees from which they could spy on those traveling underneath. Some were ogres or demons living in cemeteries having a human, humanoid or half-animal shape. They have fangs and attack infants and pregnant women. First described in Atharva Veda. Closely related to the Rakshasa were the 'yata-dhana' (or 'hatu-dhana'), who were sorcerers would seemed to follow the Rakshasa. Stories of the Rakshasa warned men against committing adultery and frightened children away from cannibalism. It is possible that this Indian tale is a source of the Irish myth of Leanhaum-shee, a fairy woman who enchanted men and drained their energy through lovemaking.<br><br>Phillipines<br>Mandurugo (possibly also seen as Mandurago): A Filipino vampire found in the region of Capiz, said to appear as a beautiful woman during the day and as a foul flying fiend at night. The Mandurugo ("bloodsucker") uses her beauty to attract and wed young men, thus providing her with a constant blood supply.<br><br>Thailand<br>One of countless spirits from Thai mythology the Phii Song Nang is basically identical to the pontianak of Indonesia and Malaysia - it attacks young men mostly. A seer or maw du should be called in to make spells and incantations to get rid of this phii. The phii krasue is similar to the pelagganan of Malaysia and krappa of Japan in that it consists of a head and entrails and has a tendency to feed with a long tongue up bottoms</div>
