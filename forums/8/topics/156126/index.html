            <div class='col-md body'>To all ARR fans:<br>There is a clone of the great composer AR Rahman in India. He is Harris Jayaraj, An  electronic music composer who made his debut in 2000 , 8 years after ARR. He makes soundtracks which looks uncannily like early/mid 1990s AR Rahman songs. He was a former sound assistant of AR Rahman and walked out solo later. People who  think his music is good are SHALLOW<br><br>For some reason this guy score a hit with his first a soundtrack  but it is not so much a sensational debut as with Rahman's first release in 1992. In the least he was procalaimed as an ARR clone and some said he will take the throne of ARR.  It will nerver happen. Why?<br><br>His music styler is very similar to AR Rahman. He retunes Rahman songs, borrows ARR styled synthesizer loops rhythms, sounds and modifies them . Rahman was the one who created a huge computerised sonic library in 90s through his excellency in sound engineering. Harris is just copying them with a clever disguise..He is not original as he brought anything new to the scene.unlike ARR.......Most of his songs the last few years were rehashes and the sound engineering he does slightly well than the other ARR clones out there who attempted and failed. But the sound still it is not original as it feels like variations of Rahman's effects which genious himself could have done himself.. Harris will  have been better off as a good Sound engineer but no necessarily classified as the best.<br><br>2nd he lacks one thing:<br><br>"Spiritualism".ARR had utter dedication for his work and love for god. Anyone who has a love of god is reflected in his work. He will touch  other spiritualists out there as well. There is spiritualism in ARR's work even in his pop and raegge songs. People who identify ARR music with emotions in their lives will throw the Harris  out of the window.<br><br>3rdly Lasting  quality:<br><br>A few years down the road, People may not talk about Harris songs as he does not make songs which touch the soul unlike ARR. Take a 10  year old ARR song and hear it again,  u will realise it still sounds fresh, new and rataining the original quality when u first listened. It is this which ARR scores very well . Harris makes songs which only last at most a few months...<br><br>The last word is that people who never listened to AR Rahman songs and people who wants songs which are not everlasting, people who dont catch spirtualism and identify with their lives and those who like songs which  only sounds good for a short time will like Harris.....<br><br></div>

Alas this style was good but he  slowly done away with it. The complex rhythm and many sound effects which will be noticed only on the repeated lstenings.Dont know where AR music will evolve to next..<br><br>Now  the teenagers like superficial songs.... They are dumb, hey dont know he's a clone when they were just born  when ARR made his debut..Those born in 80 and before will know.....They cant differentiate betwen songs which are made to lift the human soul and songs which are made to make bucks<br><br>AR was king for 13 years. Harris will fade away just like a passing fad....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Subject: Harris Jayaraj topples Rahman<br>Chennai, Oct 6 (IANS) Finally, the king has been overthrown. Harris<br>Jayaraj has toppled A.R. Rahman with the release of the<br>film "Ghajini".<br><br>The top five music albums of Tamil films are:<br><br>1. "Ghajini" (Harris Jayaraj): With the release of the film and its<br>success, the album by Harris Jayaraj is suddenly there everywhere.<br>Harris has managed to overtake A.R. Rahman after racing behind him<br>for several weeks.<br><br>2. "Ah..Aah" (A.R. Rahman): Rahman's album is still in the top five<br>and at the number two position.<br><br>3. "Thottijaya" (Harris Jayaraj): Hats off to Harris. One more album<br>by him is in the top five. Critics may say it does not have the<br>class of "Kaakha Kaakha", but who cares when it sells like hot cakes?<br><br>ARR was still first.<br></div>
