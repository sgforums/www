            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all,<br><br>It is a rare time for me to start complaining about things, but what happened today was extremely annoying and in short, irritating because the most unlikely thing could happen to you. Guess what is responsible : a new desktop computer and an old laptop computer I own.<br><br>First of all, let me ask the question : what is the probability of a new desktop  (tested and uploaded with good software) being shipped over by DHL from Singapore to UK being spolit? Well, consider the odds are small, I would say that it is very low. Then what is the probability of owning a laptop which would spolit on the same day? Well, take away the dependence of one to the other and consider them as independent cases, I would say that it is very very small.. For once, I can buy lottery and get struck, because it happened to me.<br><br>Well, perhaps, I have never appreciate my poor laptop which have accompanied me for the past two years, that is responsible for my Masters thesis and then being the glorified typewriter, arcade machine, CD player and juke box and netsurfing device, and stores all the files of my ICQ lists as well. Now that the system is broken down, recovering the ICQ would be an insane task, not to mention the draft to the new story which I am writing, which is near completion. Now that I have lost the technology, I would have to be a parasite and fight with the students for the use of a computer terminal again. The only facility that I am reduced to is email and netscape. Luckily, the forum is still accessible for me.<br><br>It is an irritation that how technology can sometimes backfire on you, rendering u helpless for a day without knowing u. Of course, I get my fair share of retribution by carrying a desktop from one end of the street to another and later with the laptop. If u think I was really in bad luck with my own computers, guess what, even my dept computer also cannot boot up when I tried turning it on just now.<br><br>What a day.<br><br>*scream mode on*<br>AAAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!<br>*scream mode off*<br><br>yours,<br>the unlucky guy with his two computers gone for repair<br><br>"I shall use my superpowers to annoy."<br>- Bart Simpson</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know the feeling man......<br><br>Well, how about this.... to cheer you up, I'll share the experiences that I had.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>It began one day where 3 of my home computers, died on me. My 386 took forever to start up when I wanted to play the Original Syndicate, my 486 laptop was accidentally dropped on the floor cause the bag wasn't closed properly, and the monitor cracked. My PI-133 had a windows protection error, and I can't use it without redoing EVERYTHING. So I was stuck with my other PI-100 PC.<br><br>Then the TV CR Tube died, and there was a general power failure in the entire damn block for over 3 hours. (So I can't use the computer)<br><br>Next, I had dead batteries in my CD player, and walkmen.... the torchlight couldn't work for some reason or the other, and as there wasn't enough candles to go around, we were stuck in the dark.<br><br>Plus, to top that up, my project on the computer that I was doing wasn't saved. Feel any better ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I was expecting no reply and I thought that the only person who would sit and gloat would be you, since I poked fun at u over ICQ.<br><br>*yawn* To be my gf/wife, u have to be younger than me. Requirement 1 failed. To be my gf/wife, according to my mom, must be a University graduate (that requirement is stated by her when I first dated my ex-gf). Requirement 2 failed. Well, to be my gf/wife, I must be interested in you the first place and frankly I never did. Requirement 3 failed. Lastly, I have this special instincts to feel for someone who might be a possible candidate, and normally, it works to a r/s and u are one that is not in my list because there is no such force drawing me to you. But so far, only one person who can drew me to her and she is not you ...<br><br>If you felt terribly insulted by the requirements, there is always Revey, Qwerty and Pacman for you to pick. U can say that I am picky and mean. For once, I decided to be really mean.<br><br>Well, since I have suffered inhuman bad luck for the last 2 days, it means that something lucky would be happening soon to me... *cross my fingers*<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br></div>

I think you are being so nice to my predicament, with a added tinge of sarcasm. Nevermind, you can read about what happened to the missing files in a email which I just sent you a minute ago.<br><br>Well, I miss my laptop too, since it is one of the last few things my ex-gf has left for me in Cambridge. Somehow, it is difficult to upkeep some things which are left behind by someone who was part of your life, because these things would eventually find a way to break it from you by their own self-destruction, be it a computer or a watch. The problem with me is that I still try to keep the things which she left behind for me just to remember her, but then ..... *sigh*<br><br>Perhaps, a signal to break free from the entanglements in the past and move on.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br>"I ask myself sometimes, why I have always walked back to the same cycle over and over again, each time becoming stronger and colder. Then when I look back again, and see myself again, realized that I have not managed to beat Fate at her own game and the battle continues."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Colette,<br><br>Noticed that I put gf/wife in my post. If u cannot qualify as my gf, don't bother about being qualified as my wife. It would cause u nothing but emotional damage and insults which would shatter your ego, because I am not willing to compromise anymore and would not care a damn even if u want to follow Hata-San's methods of committing suicide.<br><br>Well, maybe u are right, I am really very bad luck with computers and girls as well. Just as u ladies sometimes can lament about why the wrong guys fall in love with you all, I would now say the same too, the wrong gals kept falling in love with me... The right ones see the wrong things all the time, and I have to say that their eyes are really blind, really really blind.<br><br>By the way, I am going to complain to DHL and sue them for the damages caused to my CPU, since I paid to be insured.. Welcome to the wonderful world of Insurance and Customers service.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>prodigal,<br><br>did you not only lose your computers but your level of comprehension as well?<br><br>if you read my post carefully, i already understood the signifiance of not being able to qualify as a girlfriend, much less a wife. i may not have a degree but i ain't stupid. one of the reasons why i'm so full of myself and arrogant is that i know i'm good.<br><br>fyi, i was also a part-time lecturer at NAFA for 18 mths while being contracted to another company and i don't even have a degree, the only thing i possessed was my brains and skills and i did what i did not for a year or two but for 5 long years during which i've met my fair share of rank &amp; file staff and the top honchos, so kindly think twice before you think you can get away with insulting me, i don't get to where i'm today by being polite. and all these at the age of 24, i was given a title of Consultant by the time i was 23, do i sound arrogant? yes, i know i do but do you think i cared about titles? no, i don't for out of the 2 boxes of name cards first printed for me when i started work, it held at least 190 pcs at the end of 5 yrs, that's how much i value titles.<br><br>you see the thing about humiliation is this, i've no qualms humiliating myself or making myself look like a total lovesick idiot if i want to, just look at my shameless pursuit of pacman across the forums, i did that willingly but what you posted this morning in hope of putting me in my place and "humiliate" me, ironically instead of "humiliating" me, it has humilated yourself. i won't be who i'm now today if i don't have solid confidence in my own worth even if i fail at my endeavours, if i've nothing else, i'm one over-confident, arrogant gal.<br><br>sure, on two counts i don't qualify, that of age and a degree but is a degree that hard to attain? all it needs is study which i doubt will be beyond me, but why bother when i was able to grade others and hold their futures in my hands? arrogant sia? i've taught hundreds of workers on how to operate their machines better and effectively and all these without having to have a degree. i never understood the value of my signature on a certificate of attendance at all during my 5 years of work and yet that signature will signify that the worker has attained a certain level of computer proficiency and be on his/her way to a better paying job. if i ever get a degree, it'll be because i want it, not because i need it to earn a comfortable living, i've no ambition to earn a 7-figure salary, all i want is to be happy with what i've, not to be filthy rich. and fame i do not seek nor aspire to.<br><br>so sometimes do read between the lines, when you're given an easy way out, take it. don't compete with me, you should know by now, i'm deadly competitive and protective.<br><br>insult me once, it's fine, insult me twice? you're digging your own grave, insult me a third time, i'll bury you.<br><br>cool mean colette<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 01 September 2000).]</div>
