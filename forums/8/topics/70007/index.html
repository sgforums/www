            <div class='col-md body'>I think HIV patients should be quarantined on an island and given humane medical care until they die there. They shouldn't be allowed to mix with normal people. Just a few decades ago, lepers and TB sufferers were quarantined and lived by themselves isolated from the community. AIDS is also an infectious disease and like leprosy and TB last time, it is incurable and has now become a pandemic worldwide. Why do you think there is a pandemic? Bcos they weren't quarantined and caused the disease to spread quickly. We can't control morality but we can minimise physical contact. We should also legalise prostitution and regulate the sex industry. Only then will we have better control and stop illegal sex trade where poor young girls from rural countries are forced to perform unsafe sex, causing STDs and AIDS to spread. We should also educate the young about sex and sexual diseases. Another thing is drug abuse using infected needles. We should keep on enforcing the death sentence on drug traffickers. Again education is needed for the young about the dangers of drug abuse. I think photos of AIDS sufferers on their death beds should be shown publicly to deter sexual immorality and drug abuse.<br><br>Now on a personal note: what if you have a hair cut and the person before you is a HIV sufferer <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> What if the barber shaved his hair and happen to cut his skin and your skin <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> Don't you think you have high chance of catching HIV <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> What if the person you marry is an AIDS patient <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> And he didn't tell you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> We have read stories of this in newspapers.

Moreover, HIV transmission, even through unprotected sexual intercourse, is lower than you think it is.<br>i'm not saying be careless when dealing with HIV concerns, but what you said is just too extreme. besides, HIV patients are humans too, don't they have human rights?<br><br>geez. if you don't believe me visit www.cdc.gov</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO...<br><br>The article suggests putting HIV-infected persons to an island. That sounds more like "Condemnation" rather than "Quarantine". Unless there is a true cure for HIV, and should the idea is really implemented, "condemned" is a better word than "quarantine".<br><br>They are humans too. Condemning them like that is too much.<br><br>Just my 2Â¢.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>
