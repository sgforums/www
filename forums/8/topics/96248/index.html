            <div class='col-md body'>Saw the movie twice in the same week(not by choice).. what can i say, it met and even exceeded all expectations that a Jackie Chan fan have for the latest instalment of the police story series...<br><br>Throughout the movie, even on the second seating, I was constantly kept on the edge of my seat with the death defying action sequence and wildly entertained with the side splitting skits.<br><br>There were several moving scenes starring Jackie that threatened to coax the tears out of even the most hardened criminal.<br><br>The movie also featured generous use of the rope not only in variations of rapelling but also in holding hostages. It seems like Jackie's favourite prop in this movie that the title may well be:<br><br>New Police Story: The Bondage<br><br>MovieMistakes:<br><br>When Jackie and Nicholas was given the set of keys to their lockup, the 3rd jailbird just stayed in one corner without desire to escape.<br><br>In the scene when Jackie's whole team of nine policemen were tied up like dumplings during the fateful mission, you can see some of the ropes are actually slack and not taunt. The fire which was later set on the rope appears to be computer graphics.<br><br>The movie featured a cameo by rocker Wubai, who played young Nicholas's father. There is a realistic scene where he was run downed by a lorry.<br>In one scene, Jackie asked why Nicholas keeps wearing the same green jacket. This is the same jacket which Jackie used to cover Wu Bai after the accident. While Jackie is comforting the young Nicholas, he doesn't look a day younger although it is supposed to be like at least 15 years ago.<br><br>Even if Wang Jie's character did not betray the movements of the fateful mission, the baddies could easily anticipate them, as Jackie has proclaimed to capture them within 3 hours over national TV lor.<br><br>Jackie Chan's character has been changing girlfriends since the first police story. He ages throughout the police story series but his girlfriends stay around the same age. (Lucky guy)<br><br>Throughout the deranged bus ride, the bus is empty save for Jackie and suspected crew members. This is even more blatant when the bus roof was stripped by the overhead bridge. It also stripped the bus of all its upper deck passengers. By the way, I wonder why nobody attempted to take over the wheel to stop the rampage. (Maybe they don't have the required driving license or what.)<br><br></div>
