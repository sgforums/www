This case aside, because its cause seems to be BDD, I wouldn't sympathise with anyone who allows such misleading social misconceptions to rule and ruin their lives. 1stly, if hes someone who watches porn and gets this sort of insecurity about dick size, its his own fault entirely. 2ndly, someone who worries about a small dick size would probably be more sex-orientated in a r/s. I personally feel very strongly a r/s should be about emotions and sex should be something that comes and is considered much later. If the person is perv enough to put sex as a huge and foremost factor of his r/s, then its his own fault once again.<br><br>In the end, these people are the ones who gave themselves this problem of worrying about their own size. I wouldn't encourage helping them. They got themselves into this mess, they better get themselves out again. Sex sex sex, nowadays modern life seems to be about nothing but sex. Its discouraging.</div>

The preoccupation must cause significant impairment in the individual's life. The individual thinks about his or her defect for at least an hour per day.<br><br>"The individual's obsessive concern most often is concerned with facial features, hair or odor. The disorder often begins in adolescence, becomes chronic and leads to a great deal of internal suffering.<br><br>"The person may fear ridicule in social situations, and may consult many dermatologists or plastic surgeons and undergo painful or risky procedures to try to change the perceived defect. The medical procedures rarely produce relief. Indeed they often lead to a worsening of symptoms. BDD may limit friendships. Obsessive ruminations about appearance may make it difficult to concentrate on schoolwork.<br><br>Extracted from : <a href="http://www.ncpamd.com/body_dysmorphic_disorder.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncpamd.com/body_dysmorphic_disorder.htm</a></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think part of the reasons for his death is the society's implicit perception of the relationship between sexuality and sexual organs. What a man's sexual organs are to his perception of masculinity is different from what a woman's sexual organs are to her feminity. In a way, a man's penis is seen to be more defining of his masculinity than the way a woman's virgina is of her feminity. Suppose a man lost his penis by accident, is he still perceived male, in the world we are living in? On the other hand, suppose a women lost her virgina or breasts, or both, do people stop thinking that she is female? Think about it. Of course, the difference may not be categorical but rather it may be a matter of degree of perception of sexuality. But clearly there is a difference there.  Of course, I am talking about the patriachal society we are living in.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Research found that dick length isn't any matter because the the deep part of vagina is not sensitive anymore.<br><br>However, I agree that it's more because of social pressure. It's similar to handsome or ugly. There's no hard measure of handsome and ugly. But, it's the matter society perception. This society believes (don't know why) that longer dick can satisfy woman better. No wonder he was so stressed.<br><br>But, maybe he also had another problems.</div>
