From this, can we said that its time for parents or schools to teach them that not having big package does not mean the end of the world? Asians are not mean to have a big package, cos of our small build, only a small number of guys got big package, like the guy in the Tammy video.<br><br>But having a big package does not mean you will pleased the girl during sex. More often, girls are afraid on big package as it might hurt the girls during sex, cos it might be too painful or too big. Big package is not equal to great sex, its more of how to do it so that it will be enjoyable for both of you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read the article this morning and was shocked.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Most likely, he's under considerable stress over his schoolwork.  Different people have different coping abilities and it was reported that he's frequently stressed because of school.<br><br>There's a sort of psychological disorder classified under the DSM-IV : Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), which sounds like what he might have been suffering from.<br><br>"BDD is a preoccupation with an imagined physical defect in appearance or a vastly exaggerated concern about a minimal defect. The preoccupation must cause significant impairment in the individual's life. The individual thinks about his or her defect for at least an hour per day.<br><br>"The individual's obsessive concern most often is concerned with facial features, hair or odor. The disorder often begins in adolescence, becomes chronic and leads to a great deal of internal suffering.<br><br>"The person may fear ridicule in social situations, and may consult many dermatologists or plastic surgeons and undergo painful or risky procedures to try to change the perceived defect. The medical procedures rarely produce relief. Indeed they often lead to a worsening of symptoms. BDD may limit friendships. Obsessive ruminations about appearance may make it difficult to concentrate on schoolwork.<br><br>Extracted from : <a href="http://www.ncpamd.com/body_dysmorphic_disorder.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncpamd.com/body_dysmorphic_disorder.htm</a><br><br>It was reported that despite assurances from his GP, his girlfriend, and his mom, the boy continued to be obsessed with the idea that he's 'small'.<br><br>What a sad waste of life.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dragg:</div><div class="quote_body">i doubt it is just because of his size.<br><br>he is probably under other type of pressures.<br><br></div></blockquote>Maybe there were other stress factors as well. But ultimately, it was his self-perceived 'size problem' that pushed him over the edge.<br><br>Shucks man... his mother had already taken him to a clinic to address his concernes that his size may not be big enough. The doctor had already told him that his size was normal for Asians. It seems that either he thought the doctor was lying or the only 'correct' size for him is a non-Asian one....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I really want to sympathise with this fella, but truth be told, I find it hard to do so.</div>
