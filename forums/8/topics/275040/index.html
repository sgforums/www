            <div class='col-md body'>Pueraria Nano concentrate cream<br>and Ginseng<br><br>Active ingredients:<br>Pueraria mirifica extract 20% Ginseng extract 10%<br>Vitamin B3  4% Allontoin 3% Sodium hyaluronate 0.5% Fragrance free ,Alcohol free<br><br>Description<br><br>Pueraria mirifica extract (1 in 4 part of cream) : Pueraria mirifica extract can be formulated in cosmetic products such as cream , lotion , hair care and toiletry products. Firming, rejuvenating and breast enlargement action is based on strong estrogenic effect. The estrogenic activity of miroestrol and deoxymiroestrol is much more potent than that of isoflavones from soy bean.<br><br>Most clinical studies have shown that the herbal extract Pueraria mirifica firms, shapes, and beautifies by stimulating natural breast development resulting in gains of 1 to 3 inches in breast size and firmness.<br><br>Ginseng extract  : Ginseng Extract is beneficial in this toner for revitalizing and condition the skin. Used for thousands of years, and touted as a prolonger of life and multimillion dollar ginseng trade.<br><br>Vitamin B3 (Niacinamind)  :Niacinamide is a vitamin, but even when following a normal healthy diet, topical application of niacinamide will result in increased synthesis of collagen, keratin, involucrin and flaggrin. Topical application of niacinamide will decrease pruritus and inflammation, help acne affected skin, decrease oiliness, alleviate atopic dermatitis, decrease UV-induced skin cancers and help decrease facial pigmentation. For unknown reasons, niacinamide (2.5%) seems to lighten the color of Asian skin, brightening dull and sallow skin. These are just a few of the beneficial effects of topical application of niacinamide to the skin, and it would be suspicious that there are so many were it not for the crucial role of this chemical in human metabolism.<br><br>Sodium hyaluronate  :The job of this is to stabilize the intercellular (between cells) space, particularly in connective tissue. Unfortunately our dermis loses thickness as we age, in part because we lose hylauronic acid, so it is a good idea to stop this thinning of the dermis Because of its water holding capacity having this Sodium hyaluronate in your creams, lotions, gels or serums will help keep our skin moist.<br><br>Pueraria Nano concentrate cream stimulates the development of breast tissue and helps improve the cup size by lengthening and branching the ducts that connect to the nipple. It also increases the connectivity tissue and ligaments around the breast, which provide support and shape. As the milk ducts branch out from the nipple into the interior of the breast, resulting in fuller and firmer breast. Moreover, this cream helps maintain the collagen and stimulates development of new cells in skin, which improves breast skin and maintains a natural look.<br><br>An overwhelming majority of women, who used Pueraria Nano concentrate cream during three months of extensive testing, reported phenomenal results - a wonderfully toned, fuller, firmer, more youthful shape.<br><br>Many women saw noticeable improvements within 2 to 4 weeks of use.<br><br>Even though Pueraria Nano concentrate cream is truly a miracle cream, we hope you can understand that it is not a one time wonder. Some women can notice results within the first week whereas others may need 1-2 months or more to work. Please be patient because growth will come gradually and eventually within about 6 monthÂ’s usage, you will not be disappointed!<br><br>The response to our Pueraria Nano concentrate cream varies from person to person, due to factors such as physiological differences and genetic background. Generally there is a 95% efficacy rate of all those who try it. Some women have been known to show initial results in as little as 5 days, but this is rather rare and not the rule. Generally, women who already have a larger breasts size will show a more rapid response, and will reach their peak sooner; on the other hand women with smaller breasts will generally experience a slower initial response, and take more time to reach their personal peak, or limit.<br>How Pueraria Nano concentrate cream different from other products?<br>Pueraria Nano concentrate cream is a highly concentrated formula, contains 2 to sometimes 3 times more active ingredients as most creams on the market today and thus incomparable. It will react with estrogen receptors resulting in a balanced estrogenic activity. Consequently, unlike other creams which may only firm the breasts, this cream Enlarges and beautifies the breasts and making the skin become healthier and more youthful.<br><br>How to use: Place enough cream to cover one fingertip on each breast (except the nipple), and gently massage into the skin using circular motion for about 1-3 minutes. Use Breast cream twice daily, once in the morning and once before bedtime to archive maximum results. Once you are satisfied with your bust size and shape, you can decrease the usage of the cream to 1 time daily<br><br>Application twice a day for 3 months is recommended to achieve overall maximum benefit.<br>After 3 months application can be reduced to once a day<br><img src><img src="&lt;br%20/&gt;&lt;br%20/&gt;Sorry,%20don't%20know%20how%20to%20put%20pictures..%20(T.T)&lt;br%20/&gt;Each%20jar%20selling%20for%20%2440.."></div>
