            <div class='col-md body'>Actually my original meaning is not to deliberately test a guy, but to observe from everyday life if a guy loves a girl. I mean there is no need to deliberately give a guy stress in order to test him. In life there are bound to be external stress and pressure. When I say to give a guy lots of stress, its more of a hypothetical situation, don't really have to do it.<br><br>I mean a guy who is able to care for a girl under stress is definitely someone who really loves a girl. But I don't mean that if a guy is not able to care for a girl under stress, he does not love a girl. Its just that he is less able to handle stress.<br><br>That means...<br><br>A guy who cares for a girl under stress =&gt; love a girl (coz when feeling fails, commitment comes into place to compel him to care for the girl)<br><br>BUT<br><br>A guy who does not care for a girl under stress DOES NOT =&gt; does not love a girl (The amount of pressure just got over his head at that moment in time)<br><br>Agree?</div>
