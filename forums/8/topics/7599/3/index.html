            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm....... I stand with the people who say that the girl should get rid of the guy. Frankly, I'm disgusted with the people who are encouraging the couple to get back together. I'll elaborate on why, so don't flame me.<br><br><blockquote>Breaking up won't solve things, they must talk. If they are truely in love, I don't see why the guy wouldn't want to give up his bad habit for his present girlfriend and his future wife to be.</blockquote>That is very untrue. As a guy, from a cynical point of view, I would look at it this way. If I can have sex with my wife, AND another woman (even if its a prostitute), wouldn't that be a double bonus for me ? Like a friend of mine, he might have been keeping the girl sweet for just for sexual purposes. (even if he has to marry her. Yes, there ARE people like that out there.)<br><br><blockquote>he PROMISED me that he wun go there again..and he's sincerely wishing for a patch up... he told me tt is becos of sexual desires...</blockquote>Hahahahahahahahohohohohoho....... if he was really, truely interested in the gal, he would have stopped a long time ago, and not <strong>NOW</strong> when things have gone down the drain.<br><br>Frankly, as a sane person, why the heck would she even patch back with a person who visits prostitutes ? I mean, sure he might not have HIV/AIDS now, but the disease takes about 10 years of incubation before becoming full blown. Why the heck would she want to endanger her life, and her descendants ? Plus, how can she possibly live the rest of her life, knowing that her husband might have been cheating on her again. How can she possibly go on, knowing that she might contract AIDS at any time ?<br><br>Sure, 7 years of dedication, Car, House, whatever. All of these can be settled by selling them off, and dividing the cost between the 2 of them. I mean, come on, the guy has been cheating on her so darn close to the start of the relationship, what makes you think that the guy truely cares ?<br><br>Think people, Think !<br>Gods, I wondered what Terence or Wirie would have said....<br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</div>
