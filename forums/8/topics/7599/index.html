            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, very tough situation, any wrong move will definitely kill u...<br>but have u made this thing known to ur guy friend in the first place...maybe u should let the guy know, at least this is a reponsibilty of a good friend...<br>as for the gal, maybe u can beat around the bush to tell her the truth...like : he used to go there before she met u, whether he goes there often u're not very sure now, maybe he just said those words but never meant to materalise..<br>as a friend of both, u got to be neutral and prevent urself being stuck in the middle...maybe u should let the gal vent all her disappointment before giving rationale advices...then suggest her to talk to the guy, afterall 7yrs of relationship will just vanish if she does not give him a chance to explain...try to tell her this: even a murderer got a chance to defend himself in the court, she must be fair to him too, let see what he got to say...in this way, she will be able to understand the siutation and decide for herself...if not, she will regret later...<br>but remember as a friend, u can only give ur full support and best suggestions, u can't decide for them...even if they got to part, u got to be supportive on both sides...</div>

I mean..is forgiving that hard to do?? I think it will take a long long time for the ger to forget about this thing...but why not reminsince the scenes they had 7 yrs ago and put everything back..
