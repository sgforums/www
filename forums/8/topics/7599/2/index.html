Why should the gal look for u in the first place when she overheard abt the GEylang thingy? Either she wants u to tell your friend abt it ( indirectly tell u first) or she don;t like her bf anymore.<br><br>Why would a gal first thing when she heard tht thing is to break up with her BF? Shouldn't she talk with her BF first and understand the whole situation b4 saying breakup.. Com'mon.. as wht copperwing has said, when a gal decides to breakup , they will.. i agreed with it.. But don;t u see it, why would a gal wanna break off and make up her mind to do such a things ?? simply becoz the couple has already having problems between them and the gal don;teven want to talk with her bf and wanna a breakup..haha.( A way to find fault from her bf so as to break off.....)<br><br>Hope u understand wht i;m trying to say....I doubt your friend 's gf still love him as b4...or she is simply too immature in handling such thingy.  Even if they get marry one day, thing will not turn out good coz they are not talking to each other but instead telling their friend...My God..u should ask your gal fiend whther she loves her bf anymore first.. If u knoe, tht will solve alot of problem....Ask them to sit down and talk and make sure they STILL HAVE THE SAME DIRECTION IN LIFE. 7 years is a long time...it may get boring as time goes by....Love pledge mgiht changes as years go by...<br><br>2 cents worth of experience to share.<br><br></div>

You should never help by explaining for the guy as the guy should do the explaining himself, but what you should be doing now is just be a friend and accompany her and listen to what she has to say. She looking for you definitely would mean that she has something she wants the guy to know but she doesn't want to talk to her direct. Do not commit yourself to heavily in the conflict, and hope for the best for the couple. 7 years really is a long time...... and if you do succeed, do advise the guy on what to do next, that is, go Geylang only for makan   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote>Revelations:<br><br>yea..he now scared liaoz..and hey! he said the same thing to me oso..said the next time he go geylang is just for makan only...no more prostitution...heheheh now his side settled..jus tt the ger's side...<br>now he wans it to settle it himself..dun wan my interference...then I say ok lor..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> FnU  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>------------------<br>What we do in life, Echoes in eternity..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think, its time to let the gal cool down first, coz she isn't going to think straight in this kind of circumstances. Cool her down, then persuade her to talk to her bf. U shdn't be the one who is doin the talking and explaining job, its up to the guy's job to do so, its his gf, not yours, and he is the one at fault, not urs. I think that you shd point out to your friend's gf that, although you would very much like to help her, but this kind of misunderstanding is not up to you to clear as you are not sure abt the deal, talk sense into her, not pity or aggitation. Explain to her, I think she will understand your position.I got tell u hor, me also got such problem....what I did, was talk to the girl first, then to the guy, and get them to contact each other, and I guess they have met up for talk, but I dunno the outcome yet...haven't got time to call them...hope it turns out fine..<br><br>Sometimes, when its time for the relationship to end, there is nothing much for you to do...so, I guess, one has to always treasure the love that they are receiving...friendships, family, and lovers<br><br>FnU, hope you can settle this prob with more tactic, dun be rash and start babbling abt his things, its better to let them settle urself, coz if things turns out ugly...both might turn to hate u..sometimes, it doesn't pay to be kind, but of coz, at times, support is very impt, but the dispute must be settle among and by themselves, outsiders can sometimes be a meddle rather than a help...if they are destinated to separate, then blame urself too, coz you have done your best liao  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>If I had the letters HRT,I can add EA to get a HEART, or a U and get HURT.
