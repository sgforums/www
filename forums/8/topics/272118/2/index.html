(now abit old)...<br><br>I was sitting happily in the MRT......ok not happily lah...actually blank mind, as usual....<br><br>A young woman suddenly asked me....Can you give up your seat for this granny.....while pointing to an old woman....<br><br>I was surprised....then I stood up....reflex....<br><br>They said thanks to me.<br><br>The young woman is unrelated to the old woman I believe. Not family or friend.<br><br>But in my heart I was thinking....haiii....why me leh...so many people nearby but why arrow me......do I look too handsome or what...too strong or what...<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by forumer84:</div><div class="quote_body">I dont give up seats expecting them to bow or thank me as if im their saviour or wat.But thats not the problem. The problem is this is BASIC MANNERS.Imagine this: If there was no notice on the MRT telling pple to give up seats to pregnant women and yet pple do it, im sure they will appreciate the gesture. But because of this notice or "law" as they may see it, they take it for granted someone must give up their seat to them no matter what.<br><br>This is the wrong mentality that im trying to address.<br><br></div></blockquote>Well, welcome to singapore, that is the culture breeded by our society, like it or not, we are to be blame, but then, we take it as per normal, remember all this ladies are singaporean's wife, sister, daughter, mother, nieces and so forth or one of your relatives. It the way we live, you want gracious society, go japan or maybe some part of europe, but within those gracious society hide the most notorious crime, sins and discrimination.<br><br>The sign board is not the law, it just a sign  asking for appreciation and understanding, a law must consitute with a punishment, just like littering fine $500. So, if you dun give up that seat, are you going to be fine or jail??<br><br>Again if you want to give up the seat, it is up to you, whether the other person wanted to say thanks or not is not the issue. The issue is you have a kind heart and you know within yourself and others around there may have silently admired and appreciated your good deed.<br><br>So, if you find that most never said thank you to you, are you going to stop doing your good deed? It is not that i yet to met such incident, many a times i give seat to the less able ones and end up they dun even want to seat result in some other people taking the seat. Isn't that more frustrating, but i know that i have done my part, that's all.</div>
