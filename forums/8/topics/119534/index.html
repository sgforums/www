You're guilty of <strong>GREED</strong>. Do you always find yourself feeling unsatisfied and wanting more? Would you shove someone out of your way at a great department store sale just to get what you want? We thought so. When it comes to money and other worldly possessions, too much is never enough for you. It's okay to want things, but you might want to think back to those kindergarten lessons on sharing and try to understand what motivates your constant need to have more. Remember: The things you acquire may have value, but most of them won't endure. After all, you can't take it with you...<br><br>Why is greed so bad? Well, according to early religious scholars, greed is an offense against generosity. When we're preoccupied with getting more than our fair share, we show an inordinate concern for ourselves Â— at the expense of others. It's important to temper the desire to have "more" with a willingness to let others share the wealth. But it could be worse: Medieval Italian poet Dante Alighieri wrote that greed is the fifth deadliest of the seven sins, edging out lust and gluttony.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We don't want to make you mad, but...you're guilty of WRATH. Your answers reveal that you have a weakness for letting your temper loose a little too often. (Perhaps you're just in the wrong occupation Â— have you ever thought of becoming a postal worker? Managing a baseball team or being a professional wrestler are other possibilities for hot-tempered people like you.) Maybe you're suppressing some bitterness Â— if so, try to get to the bottom of it. There's definitely more to life than yelling at people and thinking of different ways to intimidate them. You might be able to release some of your pent-up anger by joining a gym. Or, go the other direction and buy some scented candles and give yoga a whirl. Next time you feel like exploding, fight to keep your temper under control and try to find a way to express yourself in a way that won't offend others.<br><br>Why is wrath so bad? Well, according to early religious scholars, wrath destroys kindness. They thought anger had to be regulated, lest it pervert the growth and well-being of the soul. Try to temper quick impatience with tolerance and compassion, especially since medieval Italian poet Dante Alighieri wrote that wrath, along with pride and envy, is one of the deadliest of the seven sins.<br><br></div>

And candy. Get the hint? You're guilty of GLUTTONY. Yep, it looks like you might be paying a little too much attention to your appetite. If you consider people like Ben and Jerry, Dr. Pepper, and Mrs. Fields close friends, it's time to change your ways and face down your desire. Look at your behavior in daily life Â— could food just be an outlet for your craving to feel better? Even if your waistline isn't suffering (yet), a little self-control could go a long way. Try it and see how much better you'll feel about yourself.<br><br>Why is gluttony so bad? Well, according to early religious scholars, gluttony destroys faith and temperance. The desire to consume as much as possible reflects a lack of belief that all of tomorrow's needs will be met. Temper the fear of not having enough with a trust that all your needs will be satisfied. But it could be worse: Medieval Italian poet Dante Alighieri considered gluttony one of the least deadly of the seven sins. (Maybe because he enjoyed a few too many pasta dinners? The world will never know...)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> Zzzzz... Wake up! You're guilty of SLOTH. Based on what your answers tell us, we're surprised you even managed to finish this test. Perhaps you only took it as a way to get out of other, more pressing tasks? We thought so. In fact, it looks like your life centers around avoiding work. Do your weekends consist of short excursions from the your warm, cozy bed? Do you think TV Guide qualifies as great literature? Remember, the remote control may very well be one of mankind's greatest achievements, but someone did have to do a little work to invent it. Why don't you try your luck and put a little effort into something, too? You might be surprised at what you can accomplish when you commit to something besides napping.<br><br>Why is sloth so bad? Well, according to early religious scholars, sloth destroys zeal. When we cut ourselves off from life's vitality, we'll eventually fall victim to complacency. We should fight the deadening of our spiritual senses by responding to the zeal and energy of our inner nature. It could be worse: Medieval Italian poet Dante Alighieri thought sloth was only the fourth deadliest of the seven sins, behind pride, envy, and wrath. (Of course, that ranking was based on Dante's own love of sleeping...)</strong><br><br>er.. i dun really like tv guides unless they have synopsis.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>i dun like to watch tv oso... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
