Mortgage is backed by my parents but they have no financial share in the apartment.  I have no credit cards , no car  - only just a shelter over my head. All I know my dad told me if by 30 , I don't own a house with a fully paid up mortgage , I will have difficulty later.<br><br>My advice - don't get credit cards, get a debit card. My bank is promoting credit cards in front of my face but I only have a simple visa debit - meaning I cannot spend more than what is in my account. POSB got mastercard I think - debit mastercard last time I was home. Credit cards are a hole and alot of young people go bankrupt with it.<br><br>Save at least 20% of the takehome pay .....depending on how much bills you have to pay. I save at least 35% and pump it back into paying my mortgage.<br><br>Use prepaid handphones - u don't owe the telephone company anything, they owe u credit time to talk<br><br>If you are itching to buy something , buy bank shares like HSBC , OCBC etc. Just the good banks ...not stocks in companies. Over 10 years , the value will rise.<br><br>Don't touch your cpf to buy stocks...not worth to gamble your future<br><br>That's the advice I can give you. Best is never borrow, just accrue assets.<br></div>
