It's easy to say something nice in a moment of bliss...i know that it also means it's just that: words.<br><br>U seem to wish he knows wat u're think half the time...u think all guys are potential mind-readers izzit? c'mon, we can only try to figure out that maze of thought and guess wat's on ur mind. It's just that...guess. In all likelihood, ur BF is unlikely to ever know exactly wat u want...but if he keeps trying, u've got a very faithful person   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Talk is cheap. Action always proves wat kind of person u r. It means more and is a better show of sincerity.<br><br>I've been through warzones and fire-fights and come out a better person bcoz both of us knew each other better after a regretful occasion. Making them know that u'll always be there in times of needs without saying it verbally is the biggest challange faced. (actually, i still haven't proven it myself)<br><br>it's not a pessimistic view, it's a reality check. Wake up from ur bed of roses and smell the real air...one day, to deepen ur relationship, u may have to make important sacrifices...some u might not have even forseen. It may be something u have to do so often it might become ur everyday life.<br><br>and one day, if u both decide that it's time to go ur separate ways, deal with it and move on...there should be no regrets.<br><br>In any case, i'm not painting a bleak picture...it does happen, u might have even seen it among ur frens...<br><br>this is just a wake up call...all tat blooms are not roses..<br><br></div></blockquote>BB,<br><br>Mmm... No Offence but the way u speak, it's like u're saying I've not had my share of failed r'ships  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Which is really Not True  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  And along the way I've learnt many lessons, which I'm thankful for......<br><br>Instead of labelling ALL emotions as Angry, I've learnt to differentiate between when I'm angry n when I'm not.  And as I really cannot bear to be angry wif My Guy, ur comment is a little Unjustified  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Perhaps wat u'd gone thru has made u even more Cynical than I was.  And believe me, I was v. v. Cynical once......<br><br>My Guy n I haf been thru our ups n downs.  Thru it all, NOT A SINGLE HURTFUL WORD has been uttered.  We've NEVER yelled @ each other.  And we DO go back a long way.<br><br>Not going to get personal nor nasty wif u, but perhaps cosh ur experiences has hardened ur view.  1 day u might be proven wrong, as I was  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  A r'ship isn't a bed of roses, n I only noe tt too well, having had a few really disastrous ones.  But we learn, we move on.  Bitterness will only make us even more Pessimistic n Life juz a little Darker  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I wish u all the best, God Bless  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>RP<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Princess: (damn..sounds like a title when i say it in this manner) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Guess i sound cynical huh? not really...it's the truth from where i stand. The main aim is not to get too cosy in ur relationship.<br><br>so sorrie if i was rather blunt, but the cold truth hits ppl more efficiently. It's always easy to promise things, but hard to keep them. I'm glad for u if u're extremely happy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>on a note, it's my experience that i'm sharing, not that i would want it the way i mentioned (indeed, if no fights or heated arguments took place, i would be more than happy)unfortunately, this seldom happens, unless both are equally forgiving and more willing to listen instead of standing their ground.<br><br>There are always ppl out there who might fit ur desirable profile (and i dun mean looks!) but u'll never know till u try. It's all about half choices and whether they work out or not.<br><br>btw, i think u misunderstood me regarding "angry". I said a person's anger is usually judged by others. Some might find a casual remark a scolding while the person herself might not realise it. It's about sensitivity, being tactful (which in some cases i admit i'm not) and choosing the right words coupled with the right tone. Hope u get the picture<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>In any case, this is a forum, take wat i say with a teaspoon of salt. It's not a verbal attack of any kind (if that's wat u interpret) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>One thing though...adding all those smiley faces in ur reply seems rather cynical to me huh? (just kidding!)<br><br>in any case, from ur response, i would say one thing:<br><br>ur bf is very lucky to have someone like u.<br><br>cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
