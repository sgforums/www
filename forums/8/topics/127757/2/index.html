How? should I get it off?<br><br>How often do you hear this sentence : &lt;"I prefer guys who DRIVE, its so convenient"&gt;<br><br>Whenever a female filth tells me this, I look her right in her beady little eye &amp; say, "Convenient? I see...so you just want a man for...convenience? Like a chauffeur?".<br><br>Then I watch her squirm , trying to find a response to that. After which, no matter what she says, I roll my eyes upwards and give her a "Yah,whatever" ; look..<br><br>Or if she says, " I prefer guys who DRIVE, its so convenient". you tell her "I prefer gals who COOK, its so convenient".<br><br>If these local female sexist pigs think they can treat local men like a chauffeur because they're too cheapskate to pay for taxi, then I dun see the point interacting with such women.<br><br>Such woman sponge on man and flee once a better man comes along.. they have shallow character but try to pass off as being sophisticated.. its truely a shame to all nice woman around..<br><br>April 17, 2005 | Permalink | Comments (0)<br><br>If we ask any woman what she's looking for in a man, she'll come out with a long list of ennobling qualities: a sense of humor; a guy who's nice to her and treats her well; good values; a strong moral character, interesting and intelligent, but monetary terms will never be in the picture.. Does that means she will go for the poor guys if he have the above qualities? ... NO...<br><br>Many women lie.. They are experts at self-deceit because if they ever admitted to themselves what they really want from men, then they'd be forced to acknowledge that they don't really want a "nice" guy.. They are equally contradicting as they always lament about the lack of "Nice" men arounds..<br><br>I always watch what a woman does, rather than what she says.. And what does she actually do? When it comes to choosing men, she heads straight for the cash.. What women want most from men -- and therefore the criterion most significant to them in selecting a mate -- is money or the assurance of thereof in the future.. ThatÂ’s probably why guys with a bigger house have an edge over the poor live-with-parents-kid.. And guys driving Lexus have an edge over SMRT riders...<br><br>You'll never catch a woman saying what she wants is a tall handsome man who drives a continental ...car, with lots of money and lives in a condo.. They got to have thick skin aka leather to do that (and we all know how lovingly soft the skins of sweet asian things are.)<br><br>Some women are blatant about their mercenary choices, openly choosing men with substantial material assets that they can exploit.. But most are subconscious hypocrites, screening out less successful men without admitting it to themselves.. They publicly announce that all they want is a nice guy, but privately disregard any men who don't meet their elevated standards for money, success, and status..<br><br>Let's be honest -- if women really chose men based on what they say they're looking for, then every nice, average guy out there would be besieged with females trying to go out with him..But nice, average looking guys generally stay at home on the weekends with a date from the PC/TV..<br><br>When a woman says all the good ones are taken, she means all the ones with money.. The man who changes her oil or checks her groceries might very well be a great guy capable of loving her dearly, but she wouldn't even consider him as a potential suitor because he doesn't have enough earning power..<br><br>In one breath they proclaim, "I don't care how much money a man makes.. I can make my own money," and in the next, "But whoever I date has to have a status (read: money) ...job." All other men without this "status ...job," no matter how nice, intelligent or funny, will be ignored..<br><br>The ...flagrant hypocrisy is brushed under the carpet.. The only reason a woman will choose a man without money is if he's on the fast track to a high-earning ...career -- she views this as an investment of her time and a payment plan for the use of her female goods..<br><br>Many women LIE.. They are experts at self-deceit because if they ever admitted to themselves what they really want from men, then they'd be forced to acknowledge that they really want a "RICH" guy..<br><br></div></blockquote>Yoz...<br><br>The gals dun reject U becoz of Ur blog...<br><br>They reject U becoz U r U...<br><br>Lolx...<br><br>Cheers...<br><br></div>
