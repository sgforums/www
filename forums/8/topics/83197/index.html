I don't want to die. I don't want to die," Kim said in English on the video footage seen here.<br><br>One of the hostage-takers was shown delivering the ultimatum in Arabic.<br><br>"Do not send any more troops to Iraq or we will send you the head of this Korean and it will be followed, God willing, by the heads of your soldiers," said the man, flanked by two other hostage takers, all wearing scarves to hide their faces.<br><br>"We give you 24 hours starting from Sunday June 20, 2004" to agree to the demand, he said. It was unclear when the deadline would expire, officials said here.<br><br>The militants said they belonged to the Tawhid wa al-Jihad (Unification and Holy War), a group led by Al-Qaeda operative Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi, whom Washington blames for a long list of attacks in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein.<br><br>The footage was released two days after an American hostage was beheaded by Al-Qaeda extremists in Saudi Arabia when a 72-hour deadline ran out for the release of hundreds of militants detained in the oil-rich kingdom.<br><br>Kim was abducted Thursday near Fallujah along with several other people, according to Kim Choon-Ho, president of the South Korean company for which Kim works as a translator.<br><br>Those abducted with him included employees of US company KBR, a part of the Halliburton group, Kim's employer said in an interview with Yonhap news agency.<br><br>He was being held along with about 10 others, including a European journalist, Kim was quoted as saying.<br><br>South Korea is to start deploying some 3,000 troops to the north of Iraq in August on a relief and rehabilitation mission, making Seoul the largest US coalition partner in Iraq after Britain.<br><br>The new troops are in addition to 660 army engineers and medics already operating in the southern Iraq.<br><br>South Korean doctors posted in southern Iraq refused Monday to treat Iraqi patients to protest the death threat.<br><br>They are "refusing to receive Iraqi patients to show their displeasure with the kidnapping and have decided to await his fate before deciding whether to continue providing care," their interpreter Mohammed Mudawar told AFP.<br><br>The government said it would work to win Kim's freedom but refused to back down on the decision to send troops.<br><br>"My government's decision to dispatch our troops for the purpose of helping the Iraqi people to rehabilitate their economy remains unchanged," said Foreign Minister Ban Ki-Moon.<br><br>Ban is expected to return to Seoul Tuesday from Qingdao, China, cutting short a three-day meeting of regional foreign ministers that opened Monday.<br><br>Ban spoke with US Secretary of State Colin Powell and his counterparts in several Arab countries to discuss the incident, Yonhap reported as Seoul sent a six-member official delegation to Jordan to coordinate rescue efforts.<br><br>Both the South Korean embassy and the US-led coalition said they were doing everything they could to try and free Kim.<br><br>"We view, obviously as a very high priority, any hostage taken," said senior coalition spokesman Dan Senor.<br><br>"We will put all the necessary resources, both intelligence and military resources, behind the safe rescue of any hostage including this gentleman from Korea," he told a news conference.<br><br>The video footage of a distraught Kim begging for his life stunned South Koreans and gave new ammunition to opponents of the troop deployment that has sharply polarized the South Korean people.<br><br>Some 50 activists rallied outside the presidential Blue House here, chanting "no to the troop deployment" and "release the hostage."<br><br>Around 20 liberal lawmakers of South Korea's ruling Uri Party, who led a campaign to introduce a resolution to parliament seeking to have the troop dispatch scrapped, also appealed to the militants to release Kim.<br><br>Under deployment orders, South Korean soldiers, mainly non-combatants, are to engage in relief work only and steer clear of conflict.<br><br>President Roh Moo-Hyun called the kidnapping "very disturbing".<br><br>Kim's mother, from the port city of Busan, begged the government to scrap the troop dispatch and bring her son home alive.<br><br>"He is my only son. Please bring him back to us," said 63-year-old Shin Young-Ja<br><br>Source: CNA</div>
