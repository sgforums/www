Nerds making more money.. n singapore trend is women go for men making money. Clicks ? yes.. its a simple fact governed by women.

Hence women prefer these guys for flings, as they are biologically wired to do so.. for the sake of reproduction of the human race.<br><br>However when women want to settle down, they tend to do so with men with more feminine features.. since feminine features suggest lower testosterone levels, which means less aggression, lower tendency to stray, and a higher likelihood of staying behind to take care of the child faithfully.<br><br>They also quoted some informal study that suggested that women during their ovulation phase of their menstrual cycle (the fertile period) tend to prefer the masculine looks if given a choice. But these same women show a preference for the more feminine features during their non-fertile menstrual phase.<br><br>I thought that offered an interesting biological/evolutionary perspective.<br><span style="color: blue;">It seem to suggest that women prefer getting impregnated by the masculine males, and prefer the feminine males to take care of the offsprings. </span></div>
