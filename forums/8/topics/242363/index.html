You work hard, you deserve the variety of choices. You don't work hard or just enough, then your choices are limited. To those who really work hard but still aren't able to make it, then its down to your luck then. There are other things that you can shine in.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
