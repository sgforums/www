Other felicitation was done by guests of honor and vote of thanks by nellamai ramanathan. The welcome address was done by abirami ramanathan.<br><br>About the QUBE XP Hi – definition server:<br><br>The Qube Cinema server, completely conceptualized and developed by Real Image Media Technologies, is highly versatile in handling picture and sound. Designed to be format independent and future proof, it is upgradeable to support new formats that might emerge across the world. Each theater equipped with the Qube Cinema Server has the capability to offer audiences high quality, high definition digital cinema with rock steady picture, even illumination, unsurpassed 6-track digital sound and the absence of any scratches, even on the 100th day of screening, making it the ultimate experience in movie evening.<br><img src="http://www.behindwoods.com/images_new/Real%20Image%20Logo%20copy.jpg"><br>Digital cinema is the projection of features using a digital projector in the theater. The original negative of the film is converted to Hi-Def digital using a HD Telecine. During this stage, the film can be color corrected perfectly in a manner that is impossible when printing on film. This digital copy of the film is then compressed to a format such a s MPEG-2 or Windows Media 9 in order to make it a manageable size to transport to the theater. Finally, the compressed film is encrypted using virtually unbreakable digital methods so that the film cannot be pirated.<br><br>The compressed, encrypted digital version of the film can then be transported to the cinema theater. This can be done using a small hard disc pack, using a fiber optic network or using a satellite system. In the theater, the film is loaded into the Qube Hi-Def Digital Cinema Player and projected onto the screen using a high quality 3-chip DLP projector from companies such as Panasonic, Barco, Christie and Digital Projection.<br><br>The Qube Hi-Def Digital Cinema Player, conceived and developed by Real Image, is highly versatile in handling picture and sound. Designed to be format independent and future proof, the Qube Hi-Def Digital Cinema Player is upgradeable to support new formats that might emerge across the world.<br><br>A digital movie can mean a much wider release enabling screening of the movie in hundreds of theaters across the state on the very first day. More theaters releasing a new film on Day 1 means more audiences flocking to the halls in the first few weeks, increasing collections dramatically. The costs of film prints, which are currently 20 % of a film’s production cost, are reduced to a minimum so there is little additional risk for a distributor to plan a large release. Producers and distributors can reap the rewards of their investments when the film’s publicity is at its peak and thus draw larger crowd.<br><br>The possibilities of video piracy is zeroed in, since there will be no physical prints to copy from.<br><br>The Qube network will be stationed in the following locations..<br><img src="http://www.behindwoods.com/images_new/map.jpg"><br><br></div>
