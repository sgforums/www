            <div class='col-md body'>from a blog i read...<br><br>Sex is something that is tied down with all guys for good. For a guy, sexual compatibility can make or break the relationship. No i'm not saying every relationship needs to have sex involved, neither am i saying if the girl sucks on bed the guy's gonna dump her. I'm simply emphasizing how important sex is for a guy. The chemistry has to be there first of all, especially in the beginning. Bad, lousy or lukewarm sex, espcially in a new relationship will only spell incompatiability. Good sex gone bad will also sometimes mean the relationship is on the skids.<br><br>Not only is sex important to a guy, his sense of himself as a man is also tied to his sexual performance and the girl's satisfaction. Manhood is all about performance and ego. When these 2 are at stake, guys don't like taking too many risks. Put it simply, a real man will prefer not to have sex when he know he can't perform rather than risk not performing well. Its kind of awkward and hurting to our ego and manhood if we fail miserably on the bed and fail to satisfy the girl. A guy in an establised relationship will also not want to have sex all the time due to tiredness, watching sports or having a problem. This tells u the difference between the disgusting fuckers who go for sex all the time and the real guys. Not all guys are as desperate as u girls out there think!<br><br>Performance on the bed requires alot of effort from the guy, thats because sex is so fucking physically demanding and requires so much energy. Most of u think the guy is simply enjoying while fucking a girl but thats not true sometimes. The guy is always the one who does most of the 'work'. He must become hard, stay hard, perform the act, not ejaculate too quickly (or the girl will not attain orgasm), but make sure he ejaculates eventually. These are just the basics amongst the many more.<br><br>So what do guys want sexually? This is the big question. To summarise it up, guys want a girl with sexual power. By this, i mean that she attracts him, she is his type, and there is a chemical reaction. This is the girl who makes his heart start pumping as soon as she enters the room. Yes being able to perform on bed is one thing but there's more than this. A real girl with sexual power is a girl with her own worth, a girl with confidence, with spirit and happy happy in her own body. She doesn't have to be have a hot body like Jessica Simpson or a pettie face like Jolin Tsai. A girl with sexual power is not ashamed of her body and she oozes confidence such as after sex she's not afraid to walk across the room naked. Confidence can also be conveyed through the way she kisses and moves, as well as the way she knows hhow to please and be pleased. She's not afraid to tell him what she prefers and is willing to do what he wants to do and knows how to accentuate the experience. Guys want good sexual partners, thats a girl who knows how to allow the guy to take the lead while she follows but also know when is her turn to take the lead.<br><br>Every guy has a favourite position in sex somehow. And its vital to a guy that his partner is pleased and pleases him in this favoured position. For him, it spells compatibility and if a girl rejects, there is no way he will be satisfied. Its like telling a pizza lover he will never be able to eat pizza again! Although sexual preferences can be adjusted, its hard to change because somehow its in the blood. Guys dislike awkward issues or siutations during sex. They prefer a spirit of openness such as knowing how to communicate - physically and verbally.<br><br>In general, guys love vocal girls who enjoy having sex. Seriously i believe there isn't a guy in this world who is not excited when he hears a girl telling him she likes what he's doing. "You feel so good inside me", "Harder baby,harder!" Such talks are erotic and guys like it and although these are things that are taboo under normal circumstances, they are perfectly ok in bed. Guys will always look at shy girls as boring girls, except for of course the perverts who just wanna fuck all day. Girls should not overdo it though, don't act like u're trying to win an oscar or something we hate it and may think u're trying to be some porn star.<br><br>Guys also love sexy lingerie. Some girls understand this, some don't. The whole point of wearing beautiful underwears is to show that u have a sexy quality that u yourself recognize and enjoy. It shows u exude a certain confidence that, in turn excites your guy. Guys often ask this question: Why does she wear that big, grandma-style underwear?! To guys, girls are supposed to have a sexy quality so what they wear accomplishes this. In fact most guys have their own preference of girl's lingerie, from half-cup bras to those diamond studdes ones, to push-ups, thongs, g-strings, brazilians and the colors as well.<br><br>Lastly, guys just like to sleep after sex mainly because its physically exhausting and tiring. We're not being ignorant we're just doing what our body wants us to do. So the final rule is : Hands off after ejaculation!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Browning Automatic Rifle<br><br>The Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) was family of automatic rifles (or machine rifles) and light machine guns used primarily by the United States and other countries during the 1900s. It was designed in 1917 by the weapons designer John Browning primarily as a replacement for, and improvement on, the French-made Chauchat and Hotchkiss M1909. It was originally intended as a light automatic rifle, but spent much of its career in various guises used as a LMG with a bipod. The first version was, and remains the lightest service machine gun to fire .30-06 Springfield, but its 20 round magazine tended to hamper its use as a light machine gun.<br><br><img src="http://www.rt66.com/~korteng/SmallArms/images/barnom.jpg"><br><br></div>
