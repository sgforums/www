The intellectual rights Disney has isn't on Pocahontas but rather on the character they created and related works.<br><br>You can draw your own Pocahontas and not infringe on their rights so long you do not ride on what they did.<br><br>How you decide whether you ride on what Disney did is very vague, best is you make enough measures to avoid any infringments.

            <div class='col-md body'>things like pocahontas etc, the original story isnt copyright cos its a legend...  but say someone had written that story 25 years ago.. then it would be copyright and disney would have to pay for the rights to make animation. old old stories, (eg that crazy old monkey tv series which was based on monkey king legend) arent copyright so no one owns the rights so ppl can do what they like with it.<br><br>disney is bad with copyright tho... copy right used to expire 25 years after the creator died. mickey mouse copyright was due to expire a few years ago so disney lobbied us government and now copyright is 75 years after creators death and covers even more uses... just so they could protect investment but made life harder for lots of ppl who do works that may come close to crossing the line like pl using parody of things to make political statements etc</div>
