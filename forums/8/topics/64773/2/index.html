Glamorous events dress up to be glamorous and stylish, not like KTV hostess in Geylang.  In photoshoots, she should wear more decently, in order to prevent slipping moral standards if people believe it's OK to flash more flesh to show off their body before it sags, where is the morality?  Impressionable young children may ask their parents next time "Can I wear like Zoe Tay, only scarf around neh neh can go out already?"<br><br>And also, she's the Queen, not any ah soh in the wet market, that means that she must have good skin, the body of a devil and firm breasts, otherwise why call her the Queen, she might as well strip off the title if she cannot live up to expectations.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lao Teh super 'heow', even the married actresses in MCS like Huang Biren, Pan Lingling, Xiang Yun etc dress decently and dignifiedly, never pose like a half nude German model with scarf around neh neh or men's briefs.  This is what we call indecency.  Even MCS unmarried actresses never dare to pose so revealingly, how come Lao Teh want to show off so much, the only reason is to pump up her career before she pump up her belly.</div>
