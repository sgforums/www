            <div class='col-md body'>Nikar.. when selecting a project or product, you must choose something hard but not difficult.. as what u have say.. Nokia Handphone is too common.. teacher and friends reading ur report sure got alot of comments.. and will even make ur presentation of ur work even harder.. As a result, ur marks will be affected..<br><br>My Suggestions:<br><br>Choose a<br><br>- Service Industry (Hotels, Fashion Retails, Delivery)<br>- Products like Massage chairs, comestic is a NONO.. (Girls sure got alot to say, dun ever try that..)<br><br>- Electronic equipments may work<br><br>Tis are above following examples u might choose, where ppl hav little or no knowledge what is gng on.? by den you can interest both ur classmates and lectures grading ur performance..ur idea should outstanding and u urself are able to show that the product/service that u are offering and wat u are driving at..<br><br>the above are Some tips to score well in marketing.. jus like writing a english composition to ur form teacher..you always write and describe about the topic "Accident' to him/her.. he read like also sianz...! write something different ! something OUTSIDE THE BOX ! Marketing is all about bringing out the "IDEA" out..<br><br></div>

MY way to remember how to do a marketing plan is actually doing a sample marketing plan for myself to remember.<br><br>What i do is reading and analysis marketing plan of Toyota. And slowly i'll remember what are the things that should be included in a marketing plan.<br>*Well... bascially, remember it by heart lol*<br><br>Hope this helps^^<br></div>

And of coz i dun wan it to go to waste since i've already done it~ So after i went through the net and do more readings, i so alot of changes to it and make it a "My Perfect Marketing Plan" for myself.<br><br>If you wanna try out my way... you shld find a company that u're really interested and and try out one urself~ try to update and upgrade it by reading the latest news and asking your lecturers to mark ur marketing plan seriously. Once a few of different lecturers read and say it's almost perfect... then u can stick to it~ from there, u'll slowly remember what are marketing plans and even if u dunno, u can juz refer to it~ I can be kept for lifetime  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>*All of the above are my personal comment, if might not works on everyone, so pls dun flame me if it doesn't works on u*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
