Different audience different strategy.. if the audience is btw 18- 25, they see certain advertisement on certain time of day.. devised a plan delegate to tat type of ppl.. 35% profits? marketing has a fading effect on its customers.. soo if u don't remind them to buy, they will tend to forget u.. u hav to develop a plan, when they hav a need to use.. they straight away know where to get it from..! and Tats the Trick! The company itself plays another part into the project, the funds make available.. IS the company able to undertake to go for long-term advertisement..?   [/quote]</div>

Just remember all the major pointers lor.<br>And give examples. They are more concern if u know how to apply.<br><br>My exams are on next thurs..haven't read yet.<br><br>The way I intend to study mine is:<br>- Know what marketing concepts are available (application)<br>Such as:<br>(a) Pdt concept<br>(b) Production Concept<br>(c) Sales Oriented Concept<br>(d) Customer Oriented concept<br>(e) Societal Marketing concept (I think)<br><br>- How u apply marketing to a marketing plan? (Cos marketing plan u must know marketing) Such as:<br>(a) Internal Environment<br>(b) External Environment (Macro environment)<br>(c) Core Capabilities<br>(d) Market Trends/Market Research (such as primary research/secondary research)<br>(e) SWOT analysis<br>(f) Segmentation<br>(g) Marketing Strategy<br>(h) Marketing tactics/mix (4 Ps or services 7Ps)<br>- Then read up on the rest such as relationship marketing<br>- Buyers and Sellers behaviours?<br>- Understand how to apply the marketing mix<br>(i.e. (i) Pricing strategy will depend how u wanna price ur items. As luxury item/Affordable/Cheap to enter the market place. (ii) Product strategy - is it a niche product/differeniated product. Or you just wish to product more for economies of scales sake. (iii) Promotion strategy - thru media/advertising/newspapers/direct marketing, etc (iv) Place strategy - where u wish to place ur product or sell your product. Convinence? etc?)<br><br>This helpful enough? I haven't studied much for my paper yet...so this is the only thing think of "off-hand"<br><br></div></blockquote>Woah nice! that was wat i was thinking to write when i 1st read the topic starter post. Hmm... basically u have already listed the mail things that can score~ which means that with all these remember in mind, the topic start can sure pass liao. It's only the additional facts that his syllabus has that got to be read on addition.<br><br>Hmm... apart from that. I juz finished my test also using a method i created for myself. And i've got a Distinction the last time i've done my Marketing paper.<br>Hmm... wanna know the way? hehe, PM me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
