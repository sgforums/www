            <div class='col-md body'>i tot this topic come out b4?<br>anyway, i think zeraph mistaken by the 3 day thing. wat it means is dat s'pore due to limited resources cannot fight sustained war hence must achieve victory within 3 days b4 we run out of resources to fight. and this not necessarily mean we are weak despite wat it implies, some more not many among us fully understand war strategies myself included i will admit.<br>no offence to anyone, but i think this topic not much point tokking coz after reading other forums i find ppl who lack faith in spore military capabilities will never be convinced we can win despite wat the faithful will claim and vice versa.<br>i will say though that taking example of US and all the wars it has won, many US soldiers do kao pei kao bu about being in the army and having to fight war but deep down inside, they know they have no choice not for fear of detention but for love of country and family and i believe it will be the same for us if touch wood the time comes.<br>dats why i am not bothered about ppl who dont believe coz i have faith in them even if they dont have faith in themselves.<br><br>------------------<br>RockerZ!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If sg do go to war, 1stly 20% of sg population would be on the 1st flight out from singapore, they are the foreigners. Next would be the rich pple (maybe &lt; 15% inclusive of those pple in white)grabbing up their valuable and flee. Next would be those PR (maybe 25%) who have no NS commitment. Finally would those (maybe 10%) sg deserter who prefer to stay out of trouble and flee to other country. Wat is left??? Guess around 30% of the population stay in sg. Of these, we have the greater percentage being the age, the weak and the young who cannot fight the war. So what would be the result?? Any comments?</div>

Firstly, the subject of "he aint fighting" most probably refer to those foreigner, PR etc etc. The subject of "Why should i fight" refer to local male citizens.<br>Firstly, due to NS Commitment, there's no choice of "why should i fight" for local male citizens. Secondly, most of the 30% who stayed are most probably those who have no other place to flee to. So they should fight anyway.<br><br>The problem lies mainly because, sg population is slowly being replaced largely by foreign immigration and not by natural replacement due to our competent government. And i could safely say most of these pple have no attachment or commitment to fight for singapore. Why should they fight when they can flee back from where they came from? When the foreign expatz flee from singapore, most probably the local wife and the children would be following.<br><br>If sg goes to war, first impact would be a drastic decrease in sg population.

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is defintely technically superior to most of our neighbours in the military aspect. But we would have to ask ourselves whether we are mentally superior.<br><br>I do not agree on the belief that Singapore will not fight on our own land will achieve victory within 3 days.
