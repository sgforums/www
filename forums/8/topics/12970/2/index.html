If latter is the case, aren't you wasting your time acting blur online? Go get some life.<br><br>First of all, your reply is not answering to the question at all by targeting me as a individual. Is the question asking you "man enuff to defend singapore"? So let me ask you a stupid question in return, are you bluff enuff so that you can have excuse not to defend singapore?<br><br>Will we still have 300,000 active ns and regular troops when our local male population is diminishing? That's the main problem. How trained are you if you are an active ns men? As trained as the full time regular troops? I think most guy will be worrying that they might be retrenched from their regular job anytime at this moment rather than concentrating in their NS training.<br><br>So you are hoping that the foreigner's properties, factories, bussiness etc etc will deter others from making any attack?? Are you?</div></blockquote>first of all, blur asked an innocent question that every able bodied singaporean male will be proud to answer.<br><br>are u man enough to defend singapore? not only did you not answer for reasons you know best and we cud only guess at, instead you launched a personal attack on him.<br><br>that to me is an admission that you felt your manhood being questioned and instead of being able to answer a simple question, u , like a guilty person cot red handed, attacked first. that is a cheap shot, especially in the cover of anonymity.<br><br>so what if only the weak and old being left behind?  at least they will stay and instead of the able bodied ones that do not even dare to state whether they will stay thus abandoning the rest, daring only to attack people behind their pc.<br><br>SHEESH!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So i recognised that this is getting personal as in Rebecca a newly registered nick maybe registered specially for purpose of personal retaliation. How mature she or he sound. I shan't argue further with Rebecca or maybe blurblop on personal ground. Carry on with your constructive post regarding man enough to defend singapore. My stand point would be doing all those that's necessary instead of defending for show.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well<br>waht i meant was that if singapore fought a war on home soil, it would probably be a 3-day war.<br>sorry if i didn't make myslef clear.<br>anyway, you may think i'm some naive ilttl boy who hasn't seen combat and death, but i wouldn't mind saying now that if need be, i would stay back and fight for Singapore instead of running.<br>you guys are right in saying singapore's defence is more of a deterrent, however i do feel that its just that we have too small a plot of land to defend.<br>Even if we were to strike first, that would leave us open on the defensive end. Not only that, we could at most make more tactical strikes than anything, because with an army of 300,000 i think it would be difficult to launch an all-out invasion of our enemies, as well as to occupy lands acquired through battle.<br><br>well that's what i think anyway...</div>
