            <div class='col-md body'>No worries, mate.  Always glad to help.  The drum mags can't be loaded by hand.  Well... almost.  You'll probably be only be able to load up to 20 rounds and that's it.  It requires a machine to load all 100 rounds.  Both the clip and drum mags are issued to SAW gunners.<br><br>I don't think the carbines will be replaced 'cause I reckon our armour and recon boys still prefer them.  The M-16/M-203 combi shouldn't be replaced 'cause the 40mm is a good addition in terms of firepower (though I really wish it could fire cannister rounds).  The Aussie army has tried fitting the M-203 to their Styrs.  Looks ugly if you ask me.  The carbine with a M-203 will be sweet.  Perfect for the jungle and urban ops.<br><br>I don't think M-16 mags will be good for the SAR-21 even though it may fit in it.  One of the reasons for a bullpup config is for a soldier to be able to see his mag to check his ammo count without having to move the rifle too much.  So I reckon the SAR-21 rifle will have clear mags.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep, the SAR21 does have clear mags.<br><br>As an armour guy, I can safely say I'd prefer a P90. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>But, alas, it's a tad too expensive. The SAR21 is actually quite compact, and might be a good replacement for the carbine, except that the SAR21 might not fit into the sidearm storage brackets, and AFV crew sidearms aren't really a priority for upgrading...<br><br>BTW, "normal" M203s can't be mounted on a carbine, because the barrel (and foregrip) are quite abit shorter than the M16's. I'm sure it's possible to mount a UBGL on the carbine, but that version of the M203 isn't standard in SAF armouries.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How's it going, y'all?<br><br>The GL is certainly a very useful weapon for all ops.  But one that shoots a cannister round would be most useful in jungle ops.  Imagine a 40mm shotgun.  Mmmmm...  The only handheld GL I know that can shoot such a round is the M-79.  The Aussie army still uses it even though it's a Vietnam war relic.<br><br>The standard pistol we have is the Sig P226 indeed.  Not a bad auto pistol.  9mm, 13 (I think... or was it 15) round mag plus 1 in the chamber.  Officers used to receive training for this weapon but it was taken off the training schedule in the early 90s or late 80s.  Apparently, the auto pistol is meant for self defence and, believe it or not, execution (i.e a bullet behind the head).<br><br>Armskote is a British term, I think.  The Aussies use it too.  Amoury is a US term.  Considering Singapore's background, it's not surprising we've adopted that term from the Poms.  Chuckle...<br><br>Here's a question.  Why doesn't the SAF teach its infantry (other than the Spec Ops people) to use the AK?  I heard it could cause confusion in the ranks and result in friendly fire.  Also, I reckon we should change from using that damned 84mm RR and covert to the RPG-7.  A grenadier is able to carry both the launcher and a couple of grenades rather than depend on other guys carry his ordnance.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

But you realise that guns, missiles and bombs weren't made to blow trees up, right?  True, war is dumb, insane and stupid.  But it's also the last resort.  The question is whether we're killing in defence.  That's subjective of course pending on which side you're on.  Evetrything's justifiable.  Take Japan in WW2 for example.<br><br>And unfortunately, it is every man for himself.  Look at our society today.

But no one ever said progress didn't have a price, right?<br><br>What about the laws of nature?  It is also in man's nature to destroy himself.  And if life is so precious, man himself should not be allowed to eat meat, would it?  Or is the reason of survival that overwhelming that it can be overlooked?<br><br>Don't think we should discuss such issues here, mate.  Maybe you'd like to start another thread and leave this thread for eople to talk about guns and ammo.  Chuckle...<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

Have a tear...  Stick to the topic , will you, instead of picking on people's words?  Duh...  If YOU had read my postings as carefully as you claimed to have, you'd realise I'm agreeing with you.  But I offer considerations that you must allow or be shut up in your one sided view, no?  Just for you, I did say that war is stupid, but it's a last resort.

For food, or in other words, for survival. The ultimate justification is SURVIVAL.<br><br>Ergo, if the animal that happens to threaten your survival is a human being, there is justification for killing other humans.<br><br>War may be stupid, but it is inevitable. Contention for resources is part of nature. Just because you advocate peace doesn't mean the next guy will do you that honour.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>shinjiono: i too feel that war is very ugly and should be avoided at all cost, but war is here to stay as long as people remain the way they are. unless you have a better idea, like a realistic alternative to war, stop criticising it. just because we're talking about guns and whatever here, doesn't mean we're all a bunch of army-crazed war mongers. i personally don't like NS, however i enjoy target shooting a lot.<br><br>anyway back to the original topic:<br>does anyone know when the SAR21 is going to completely phase out the M16s?</div>
