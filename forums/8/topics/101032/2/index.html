            <div class='col-md body'>I remember I dream I kenna  killed by flower pot when walking outside HDB, then I become a spirit I think then just wondering around forgot what I do though.It was quite vivid and I felt kinda peaceful and I dun feel sad or any hatred that I died....<br><br>about dream within a dream i think I had once or twice before but cant remember liao.<br><br>on nightmares I dun have much now , the only ones I remember some how happened the last few years and in it I was brave and fought off  those ghosts or demons.once I even  called out a ghost to show herself when I sense it in my house,I was still afraid but more brave than scared.Unfortunately in real life it was the opposite, sometimes I imagine too much and get scared for no reason and if things goes bump in the night I would run like hell  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
