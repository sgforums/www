One logical reason I have regards Mother Mary virgin birth to Jesus.<br><br>It has to be a virgin birth and not conceived via normal ways cuz if it were to be so, Jesus would have been born a sinful person as the blood from the father flow to the child. So by hook or by crook, Jesus muz be born of a virgin.<br><br>The stumbling block is how it is possible to have a virgin birth? Christain will say it's a miracle!!! Others will say test tube babies maybe available during those times. Then the question again, how to get the white stuff from God huh?<br><br>To fully understand their religion, you cannot have too much logic inside your head else you overstep your authority to God realms which is strictly forbidden as God creates everything. To question the faith is to question God. That's why faith this word is invented so that Christain can use this to counter all arguments from disbelievers.<br><br>Hmmm.... food for though today? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

One logical reason I have regards Mother Mary virgin birth to Jesus.<br><br>I am afraid that i cannot agree when you say that we christians use the word Faith to counter the unbelievers. All religions in the world are based on faith. Whatever God you worship cannot be seen, and idols that people pray to (again i must stress that i am not here to go against any other religion) are factory or hand crafted by human hands.<br><br>The reason why Jesus was born from Mary was because he was God personified on earth. God didn't have to make love to mary to make her pregnant. According to the bible, it states:<br><br>Matthew 1: 20 - "..... an angel of the Lord appeared to him (Joseph) in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is concieved in her is from the Holy Spirit. "<br><br>Matthew 1: 21 - "She (Mary) will give birth to a son and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."<br><br>A lot of people do not know that in fact Christianity is not an "Ang Moh" or westerner's religion. It began right in Asia! Another fact is that since the beginning of the Book of Genesis, Jesus was right there with God and the Holy Spirit, as found in Genesis 1:26<br><br>"Let <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>us</strong></span> make man in our image....."<br><br>I just don't want anyone to condemn anyone's religion and if anyone needs more biblical facts, you can alays post me a message. I will be more than willing to answer them.<br><br></blockquote></div>
