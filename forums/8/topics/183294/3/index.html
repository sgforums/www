He does many good deeds and promotes buddhism and seeks forgiveness from the Triple Gems (Buddha, Sangha, Dharma ), will he still be cast into Hell?<br><br>Or will his Good Deeds make up for his sins and he shall be sent to the Western Paradise when he dies?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> </div></blockquote>Hi, I am not yet a vegetarian.

Thai Buddhism only has Theravada Buddhism, Mahayana Buddhism is absolutely absent from Thailand. However, Brahmanist influence is very strong in Thailand, because of its history.<br><br>Whether it is Mahayana or Theravada or Vajrayana Buddhism, the Buddhist teachings remain PURE and distinct from Hinduism. Buddha can be seen as a reformist of the society and religion in India, as Jesus Christ was seen as reformist of the Old Testament.<br><br><blockquote>The Hindu Gods become the Mahayana Buddhism' Buddhas.</blockquote>Brahma, in Mahayana Buddhism, is exactly as seen in Theravadin Buddhism. Brahma is a Celestial Deity from the 1st Jhana plane. In fact these kinds of things cannot be changed, because it is written down in the scriptures. All Pali Scriptures (Theravadins) are also in the Chinese/Tibetan Canon without changes.<br><br><blockquote>So the Hindu God became the 4 face Buddha.</blockquote>It is not because of tradition difference, it is because of plain ignorance. Inability to differentiate Deities from Buddha, due to lack of knowledge.<br><br><blockquote>When it comes to beliefs, it is up to you to believe anything you want since it actually makes no difference. For me, it is better to make life's deisions based on reality and logic rather than on beliefs.</blockquote>Belief or not is not important. By cultivating the dharma, we are living in reality rather in illusion, and will be enlightened to reality.</div>

But it's a sign of trouble ahead for the entire country.<br><br>The upper part of the statue was smashed, leaving just the base intact. --AFP<br>That's what astrologers in Thailand are warning after a mentally-ill man destroyed a four-faced Brahma statue at the famous Erawan shrine in Bangkok with a hammer yesterday.<br><br>The man, Thanakorn Pakdeepol, 27, was immediately beaten to death by enraged passers-by in the upmarket shopping district around the Grand Hyatt Erawan Hotel.<br><br>Thousands of worshippers of many religions from across Thailand and around the world flock to the statue every day to seek good fortune.<br><br>Astrologers interpreted the incident as an omen that tragedy would befall Thailand if the current political turmoil was not defused quickly.<br><br>'The incident portends that something bad will happen. If the upcoming general election goes ahead on 2 Apr, bad things will happen,' well-respected astrologer Surattaphong Suwannarat told The Nation newspaper.<br><br>Astrologer Pinyo Pongcharoen agreed with his assessment.<br><br>'The Brahma has four faces and now there are apparently four sides in the country: The government, the opposition parties, the People's Alliance For Democracy and poor-people demonstrators,' he told the paper.<br><br>He said that if these four groups would turn towards other, the country would be at peace again.<br><br>The vice-chairman of the Astrological Association of Thailand (ATT), Mr Wiwat Jareogsiri, said the statue had been linked to the country's horoscope.<br><br>'When the country's horoscope is not good, this affects many things. Now that the sacred Brahma statue is destroyed, the country's economy may suffer,' he said.<br><br>Another astrologer, Mr Samrit Klomkliang, said the fact that the destruction was carried out by a mentally-ill man who was then lynched to death was ominous.<br><br>'This is blood sacrifice,' he said.<br><br>He said it was a sign that Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra should step down to avert bloodshed.<br><br>But AAT chairman Thanakorn Sinkasem dismissed talk of an omen, saying that the current turmoil was instead the result of the country's bad horoscope.<br><br>'If you notice, you will see that many monks have come out to join protests this year,' he said.<br><br>Mr Thanakorn believes the country will become embroiled in crisis as it marks its 224th year on 21 Apr, then improve after that.<br><br>Police major Thanit Ratanopas said the mentally-ill man was probably not fully aware of what he was doing.<br><br>'Based on his medical records, he was in and out of many hospitals with mental illness,' he said.<br><br>Two garbage collectors have been charged over his murder and more arrests are expected.<br><br>The shrine was built in 1956 to ward off bad luck during the construction of a hotel that has since been torn down.<br><br>It has long been a prime tourist destination and is also immensely popular with Thais - drivers take their hands off their steering wheels as they pass by to pay their respects.<br><br>Thailand's deputy prime minister Surakiart Sathirathai ordered the statue be rebuilt within two months using as many fragments of the original as possible. - Wire services.<br><br></div>

Because Chinese Folks Practitioners can worship anyone they see as 'divine'. Although Buddha did not claim to be a divine being or a higher power, it is gradually seen by the ignorant that Buddha is some kind of god, that is why they worship him. So because of their utmost respect of Buddha, they think just by worshipping Buddha, they become Buddhist. In reality, they have not taken refuge in Three Treasures, and do not know the dharma.<br><br>Markzz asked: <span style="font-style: italic;">And what about Datok Gong Shrine of Kusu Island?<br><br>Is he Taoist? If so, why are there Islamic symbols in his shrine?<br>If he's Islamic, why are devotees praying to him via joss sticks?</span><br><br>I replied: <span style="font-style: italic;">Because Chinese folks practitioners (usually known as Taoists) can basically worship anything... they can also worship Jesus, etc.</span></div></blockquote>the Chinese folks ususally taoists that you mentioned; basically worship anything... in fact they respect every religions and by their way of praying. The Ying and Yang theory. Black and White. Cause and Effect. There is a balance in everything and creating harmony.<br><br>In San Zhi Jing, the first line something like "human in the beginning, they have good nature..." It is because of our secular world and the lack of basic understanding, tolerance and quest for progress that we create another facet of life, the good way or the bad way.</div>

It depends.<br><br>Phra Phom (4 face Buddha) "Phra" is used like "Mr"  for Buddha or monk or King<br><br>There is a Thai army or police Maj Gen who said that Phra Phom had taken on the evil. That Phra Phom suffered the evil that was to befall Thailand and so the evil was avoided.<br><br>So if nothing happened, then everybody agrees with the maj Gen, If something bad happened, the astrologers become "famous."<br><br>You see, it has nothing to do with the predictions. You can simply make a guess and if you guess is correct, you become famous. If it is wrong, nobody remembers.</div>
