            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly I would like to respond in regards to Kuan Yin Temple.<br><br>I have, in fact, answered casino_king the same thing in another topic.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">btw, kuan im temple is not really a Buddhist temple, but a Chinese Folks practise temple.</span><br><br>He said: <span style="font-style: italic;">That is just your opinion. They told me themselves that they are Buddhists. There is also a thread to tell Buddhists to celebrate Kuam Im birthday tommorrow in this forum.</span><br><br>I replied: <span style="font-style: italic;">I tell what you what it means to be a Buddhist in the first place.<br><br>To be a Buddhist, you have to refuge in the Three Treasures, which is the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha.<br><br>Kuan Im Temple was probably created by some folks practitioners, and I dont think they took refuge, and the temple doesnt offer people to take refuge either. I dont see monks and nuns staying in Kuan Im temple, so there is no Sangha there, and I dont think they offer dharma there.<br><br>Anyone who goes Kuan Im temple can correct me here if im wrong.</span><br><br>And to answer your other questions now:<br><br><blockquote>Do u guys know of the famous Temple at Toa Payoh called Shuang Ling Shi?</blockquote>Haven't really visited.<br><br><blockquote>Temples are usually Buddhist or Taoist right?</blockquote>Temples usually refer to Chinese folks temples or Taoist temples.<br><br>For Buddhists, we call them Monasteries. Usually where Monks and Nuns reside too.<br><br><blockquote>eg: Buddhist temple = 4 Horse Road(say this in Hokkien ) Guan Yin Temple</blockquote>See above.<br><br>Monasteries and dharma centres are usually where monastic community stay and teach or lay community of dharma practitioners teach and propagate the Buddhadharma.<br><br><blockquote>Taoist Temple = that famous "Tang kee" temple at Tanjong Pajar</blockquote>There are more Taoist Temples or Chinese folks temples than you know..<br><br><blockquote>But Shuang Ling Shi??</blockquote>It's a Buddhist monastery.<br><br><blockquote>It has statues of Taoist Deities</blockquote>You talking about cheng huang miao next door?<br><br>Buddhist monasteries also got show deities, but they are not Taoist deities, the deities are the Dharma Protectors of Buddhism. And they may have colourful faces. We dont worship them but we do pay our respects to them.<br><br><blockquote>and a 4 Face Buddha under the same roof!</blockquote>4 Face Buddha is actually Brahma, but nevertheless it has become incorporated in Thai Buddhist tradition. Perhaps somehow enter into shuang ling shi.<br><br><blockquote>And what about Datok Gong Shrine of Kusu Island?<br><br>Is he Taoist? If so, why are there Islamic symbols in his shrine?<br>If he's Islamic, why are devotees praying to him via joss sticks?</blockquote>Because Chinese folks practitioners (usually known as Taoists) can basically worship anything... they can also worship Jesus, etc.<br><br>Actually Taoism isnt just about this chinese folks tradition... it has very rich texts from many sages including Lao Tzu. I particularly like the Tao Te Ching. But after Zhang Tianshi came into Taoist scene and made it a religion, I think it has already become quite different. It has even incorporated spirit mediumship, etc. That is why with all these worshipping and spirit mediumship it is really different from Buddhism.<br><br><blockquote>Rojak?<br><br>(no offence intended towards devotees of the mentioned temples )</blockquote>Up to you to decide.<br></div>

Buddhism is not a religion because we do not worship higher powers. Our goal is to attain whatever that the Buddha has attained, and what the Buddha has attained (i.e Enlightenment) transcends all worldly powers - including that of the Brahma. Each of us, our Buddha Nature is already wholly complete and has been with us for beginningless time, but we have yet realise it.<br><br>Secondly, 'philosophy' has many kinds, the truths Buddha comprehended is not logically deduced nor academically studied. In other words, enlightenment does not come from thinking (it is not derived from intellect and logic) nor studying but cultivating the dharma. Experience yourself, seeing the truths yourself.. Enlightenment is intuitive and direct, reality becomes pristine clear to you. Which is why Buddha said,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Perfect One is free from any theory, for the Perfect One has understood what the body is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what feeling is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what perception is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what the mental formations are, and how they arise, and pass away. He has understood what consciousness is, and how it arises, and passes away.<br><br>Therefore, I say, the Perfect One has won complete deliverance through the extinction, fading away, disappearance, rejection, and getting rid of all opinions and conjectures, of all inclination to the vainglory of I and mine.<br><br>- Majjhima Nikaya, 72</span><br><br>----<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ven. Jue-Hsing<br><br>A scholar once asked, "Buddhism seems a great theory, and I find it useful. Is Buddhism a Philosophy?"<br><br>"Master Shen-Kai once said 'Buddhism is not Philosophy but beyond Philosophy,'" I replied.<br><br>"Why so?" The scholar asked.<br><br>"Philosophy is a system of thoughts based upon logical reasoning." I answered. "However, Buddhism is about realizing truths while detaching from thoughts."</span><br><br>Buddhism can be known as an education, a way of life.... or even the way of Bliss, the way of Liberation, Enlightenment.</div>

In Chinese known as Xuan Zhang Da Shi.<br><br>I think you are refering to Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva. Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva is the Bodhisattva (not a Buddha) who made a Great vow "if the hells are not empty, I shall not attain Buddhahood". (di4 yu4 bu4 kong1, shi4 bu4 cheng2 fo2, zhong4 sheng1 du4 jing4, fang1 zheng4 pu2 ti2) In Chinese he is known as Di Zhang Wang Pu Sa, yes. And due to his Great Vow, he is known as "Da Yuan Di Zhang Wang Pu Sa".<br><br>And yes, although these Bodhisattvas are Buddhist bodhisattvas, but even Buddhist bodhisattvas like Guan Yin, Di Zhang Wang, are also honoured and worshipped in Chinese Folks temples.<br><br>However it is untrue that Monk Tripitaka went to hell and become Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva. That happened long before Xuan Zhang Da Shi was borned, it happened during Shakyamuni Buddha's era.<br><br>I think the show Xi Yu Ji has given a lot of false ideas about Buddhism to public. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> All the things about Sun Wu Kung, Zhu Ba Jie, Sha Seng, all false. Pls remember that Xi Yu Ji is a fictional story written in some centuries ago. Even if Ven. Xuan Zang used to have dharma protectors, they are spiritual beings, not physical.<br><br>And like you said, the 7th month hell gates open is really just a myth. I shall post in my next post just on that.</div>

In order to appease them, animals are slaughtered and offered to these 'hungry ghosts', together with other food. Big feasts and other festivities are held during this month and the most 'auspicious day' is the 15th day of the month. It is so widespread that this yearly affair is dubbed the Month or Festival of the Hungry Ghosts. What is this all about?</span><br><br>Among the chief disciples of the Buddha was one named Maudgalyayana. He had immense supernatural powers: Deva-foot ubiquity which made it possible for him to appear at any place at will, the divine sight of Deva-eye to have unlimited vision of all things, large and small, near and distant; Deva-ear to hear all sounds regardless of the distance. Furthermore, he had the ability to read and understand whatever was in a person's mind. He also had the ability to see clearly the events that occurred in a person's many past lives aeons ago. Thus, Maudgalyayana is considered to be a Maha-Bodhisattva who is foremost in supernatural powers.<br><br>One day, his Deva-eye saw that his deceased mother had transmigrated to the realm of the hungry ghost. Her stomach was enlarged and she had tiny limbs. Her throat was as small as the eye of a needle, and as a result, it was impossible for her to eat any food or even to swallow a drop of water. Maudgalyayana could not bear the sight of his mother in such an extreme state of suffering. He immediately filled his alms bowl with food and with the immense power that he possessed, he sent it to his mother. However, she could not have the food because each time it turned into charcoal before she could put it in her mouth. It hurt Maudgalyayana to see what was happening and because of his strong emotion for his mother, it hindered his ability to see the karma that she had committed in her past lives. He went to Buddha for advice. The Buddha closed his eyes and entered into pure contemplation. With great compassion and gentleness, he said: "Maudgalyayana, your mother did not believe in the retributions arising from the law of cause and effect. She committed many evil deeds. She dishonoured the Buddha and insulted the Sangha [1], had no respect for the Three Treasures (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha), was greedy, filled with hatred, ignorant and arrogant. She was a wicked person who committed many evils, and she teased others giving them no peace. Therefore, she is suffering such a bitter consequence. Even though you are her son and your filial piety touches the heavens, these are still not able to save a person who had committed such serious evil karma." On hearing this, Maudgalyayana wept in pain.<br>Notes<br>1. 	Sangha<br>The corporate assembly of at least 3 monks; in general the term has come to mean a monk, or monks.<br>2. 	Bodhi<br>From budh; knowledge, understanding; perfect wisdom; the illuminated or enlightened mind.<br><br>The Buddha continued to console him, "It is impossible to rely solely on your own effort to save your mother from the realm of the hungry ghost. The only way is to use the combined merits of the Sangha. The 15th day of the 7th month of each year is designated "Buddha's Joy Day". This is the last day of the Sangha's summer retreat, and because of the purity with which the Sangha observed the precepts and practised cultivation, many attain the Bodhi [2]. The merits that they accumulate are immense beyond imagination, and the Buddha is most delighted. If you make an offering to these Sangha during this time, you can liberate your deceased parents and relatives from the suffering of the three evil realms (realms of animal, hungry ghost and hell) through their immense merits. If the parents are still living, then they shall be blessed with good health, happiness and a life of abundance. This is the truly marvellous method of giving salvation to the deceased." Maudgalyayana was delighted to hear this, and carried out the Buddha's advice accordingly. Thus, on the 15th of the 7th month after the offering to the Sangha, Maudgalyayana's mother was liberated from the suffering of the realm of the hungry ghost.<br><br>To give offering to the Sangha in this way is called the 'Ullambana' method. After Maudgalyayana received the benefits from this Dharma, he was very grateful to the Buddha and praised the merits of the Three Treasures. He advised people to promote the 'Ullambana Dharma'. This day, the 15th of the 7th month, can also be considered an occasion to express our gratitude and filial piety to our parents and ancestors. Unfortunately, the passage of time saw a gradual erosion in its understanding and purpose, so much so that this special occasion is not performed in accordance to the Dharma. Today, this auspicious celebration has become a day of widespread slaughter of animals to be used as offering to the hungry ghosts. The original act of performing offerings to the Sangha has become a day for feasting and making offerings to the hungry ghosts, often referred to as 'to invite the good brothers to a feast'. These practices are not only against the compassion of the Buddha, but also a let down to Maudgalyayana who had advised the world to be filial and to perform good deeds.<br><br>When we refrain from killing and protect all lives, we actually accumulate the merit of longevity and good health. It is meaningless to kill other living beings and offer them to the ghost, because they cannot benefit from these at all. Instead, those who kill shall have to repay for their action by suffering endlessly in hell. Unless we put an end to all forms of killing, the world forever shall not have peace. If the tradition of offering to the ghosts and the deceased on this day cannot be changed, the least we could do is to replace the slaughter and offer of meat with vegetarian food, flowers or fruits. It does not matter if we are not able to make offerings to the Sangha on this day, but at least we could invite them to chant the sutra for the purpose of liberating the deceased. In this way, it benefits both the living and the deceased.</div>
