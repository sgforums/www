            <div class='col-md body'>It is actually the Hindu Brahma deity, but also known as Four Face Buddha out of ignorance.<br><br>Thailand has a long culture of practising Brahmanism, actually denounced by Buddha, which is rather comparable to our local folks traditions. Although Thais mostly call themselves Buddhists, a large part of them probably dont have much knowledge of Buddhism.. just as seen in Singapore.. lots of people claim to be Buddhists, but how many true buddhists out there?<br><br>The usual worshippers of Brahma probably got v angry and attacked the guy who destroy their deity statue. Shows alot of intolerance on some of the three man/four man's part which is quite sad.</div>

Yes. Remember the Afghan Buddha destroyed by the Taliban extremists years back? It just proves that all forms are impermanent and empty.<br><br>A Buddhist should never be concerned about this for the Tathagatha (Thus Come One - the Buddha) is not found in forms. For it is said by Buddha in Diamond Sutra, "If one sees me in form, If one seeks me in sound, He practices a deviant way, And cannot see the Tathagata." "All forms are but illusions; in seeing that all forms are illusory, then one sees the Tathagata."</div>

Brahma is the most superior entity in the universe.<br><br>Brahma is the creator of the universe who was born from Hiranyagarbha (the golden nucleus). When he took form, Brahma placed the Hiranyagarbha back in the waters and inspired the creation of the universe. Every living being in the universe originates from him and is an aspect of Brahma.<br><br>While Brahma expresses himself in the abundant forms of life in the natural world, he is rarely seen himself. Understood as a divine abstract, Brahma seldom appears in places of worship.<br><br>A day in the life of Brahma is a kalpa, which encompasses a span of evolution. Each kalpa measures 4 billion human years. As Prajapati (Creator), while he is awake the world forms, while he sleeps all shrinks to a dormant nucleus. When Brahma awakes a new universe begins.<br><br>At the end of the first kalpa, there was a great deluge, (also recorded in the Bible). At the dawn of this age, god appeared as "Om" Brahma prayed to him for the knowledge to create the universe.<br><br>Late Vedic literature describes Brahma as creator of Soma and Surya (the Sun and the Moon), he gives them their place in the sky. He brings Agni (fire) into being and sets Vayu (the wind) free to roam the world and Varuna (water) springs to life on earth.<br><br>Brahma's consort is Saraswati (The goddesses of learning and music). When Saraswati and Brahma embrace they create the world.<br><br>In art and mythology we see Brahma as a four headed human form. His heads face the four directions of the universe. The heads also symbolise the four Vedas (books of sacred hymns).<br><br>Brahma holds the Vedas, a "kalamandulu" (a jug of water) and a string of meditative beads in his hands. The lotus flower on which he is seated represents the earth. He travels on a chariot drawn by seven swans who represent the seven "lokas" (continents). He is also seen riding a single swan (Hansa).</div>

The Trinity in Hinduism, including the Creator BRAHMA is manifestation of the Brahman.

Most important is to cultivate the Buddhadharma. All that is said by Buddha will be realised yourself eventually.<br><br>If you wish to practise the dharma and become a Buddhist and you're new, do pick up on some beginner guidebook on Buddhism, go to a monastery/dharma centre where they teach dharma. Find a dharma teacher and take refuge in the three treasures.</div>

See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phra_phom" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phra_phom</a><br><br>The monks knew all too well it was Maha Brahma but I speculate it has become such a tradition to worship Maha Brahma, that sometimes they place Phra Phom statues in their premises. For Wat Palelai, they never put it inside the monastery, but outside it, at the carpark area. Many Thais also regularly go to Thai monasteries to pray and take part in services and talks.<br><br>But I believe, the main one in the monastery is always the Shakyamuni Buddha (one face, not four face) - standing beside him are two of his disciples, Ananda and Sariputra. This is what is usually found in Thai and other Theravadin monasteries.<br><br>Brahma is also recognised in Buddhism, but the difference is we do not recognise him as Creator of the universe.</div>
