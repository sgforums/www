              <p>The match <a title="Association football (ball)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football_%28ball%29">ball</a> for the 2010 World Cup, 
              manufactured by <a title="Adidas" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas">Adidas</a>, is named the <em>Jabulani</em>, which means 
              "bringing joy to everyone" in <a class="mw-redirect" title="IsiZulu" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IsiZulu">isiZulu</a>. The number eleven plays a prominent 
              role in the new technologically advanced ball: it is the eleventh World 
              Cup match ball made by the German sports equipment maker; it features 
              eleven colours, one for each player on the pitch; and there are eleven

              <p>The ball is constructed using a new design, consisting of eight 
              thermally bonded, three-dimensional panels. These are spherically 
              moulded from <a title="Ethylene-vinyl acetate" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene-vinyl_acetate">ethylene-vinyl acetate</a> (EVA) and <a title="Thermoplastic polyurethanes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoplastic_polyurethanes">thermoplastic polyurethanes</a> (TPU). The surface of the ball is textured with grooves, a technology 
              developed by Adidas called GripnGroove<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-55"><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup> that is intended to improve the ball's aerodynamics. The design has 
              received considerable academic input, being developed in partnership 
              with researchers from <a title="Loughborough University" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughborough_University">Loughborough University</a>, United

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Love @ 130kmh</span></p>
              <p>He started the engine and we got going.</p>
              <p>I didn't dare look up. It was hard to, anyway. The helmet was clamped tight on my face. My cheeks were bunched up like a chipmunk's. I didn't feel particularly attractive.</p>
              <p>He went a bit faster.</p>
              <p>I squeezed my eyes shut and kept my head low. I could feel the cold eating into my legs. I should have worn thicker tights, I thought.</p>
              <p>It was early spring in Wales and still very chilly. The wind forced its way into the sliver of space I'd left open in my helmet. I couldn't breathe otherwise. I'd never realised how claustrophobic it'd feel under a helmet.</p>
              <p>I wrapped my arms more tightly around his waist but my fingers - clumsy in thick gloves - couldn't grab him properly.</p>
              <p>The minutes passed.</p>
              <p>I opened first one eye, then the other, and lifted my head a bit. I peeped to my left and right.</p>
              <p>A quarter of an hour went by. I was now sitting straight up on the motorbike and turning my head coolly.</p>
              <p>Cars were whizzing past us on the right. Hedges and stone walls loomed dangerously close on the left. But I wasn't scared, not really.</p>
              <p>When we reached a bend, our bodies swayed with the machine and dipped low near the tarmac.</p>
              <p>I looked at the speedometer. It was inching past 100kmh to 110, 120. I pressed my body closer to his and wrapped my thighs more tightly around him.</p>
              <p>Then I noticed something happening. Whenever we went downhill, he would have to adjust himself and would slide down the seat. I could feel the gap between his body and mine - an emptiness, almost, a sort of loss - and I'd make a desperate grab for his waist.</p>
              <p>Then when the road levelled up, he would inch himself back up the seat and I could feel his body again. I felt safe once more.</p>
              <p>And it was at that point that I realised that, yes, if I could trust my life to him as we zipped up and down the motorways and country roads of Wales on his scary-looking 1,000cc bike, I could trust my life to him.</p>
              <p>And so, dear reader, I am doing it at last. Getting, er, married. At the grand old age of 46. Next month. To Hurricane, my crush from junior college with whom I reconnected after 29 years.</p>
              <p>I called him Hurricane because he looked like the actor (an unknown Hawaiian called Dayton Ka'ne) in the cheesy 1970s disaster flick, Hurricane, starring Mia Farrow.</p>
              <p>We went on one bad date in 1980 when we were both at Anglo-Chinese Junior College. We watched a movie at Capitol and had a milkshake. We were both so shy we were almost mute. We couldn't wait to go home. I took the bus and he cycled back.</p>
              <p>That was my memory of what happened.</p>
              <p>His version is a little different. 'You broke my heart - twice,' he said when he looked me up last July.</p>
              <p>'You're crazy,' I said. 'You're imagining it. We had just that one awful date and never saw each other again.'</p>
              <p>No, he said, you broke my heart first in JC and then again a few years later. He said he'd phoned me when he returned from university in Canada. I'd been curt and that was that.</p>
              <p>'You're wrong,' I said. 'I have no memory of that.'</p>
              <p>But he was probably right. While going through my old things last year after we'd re-connected, I discovered that he had actually sent me a birthday card, a Valentine's Day card and a love letter (all without dates, unfortunately) after we'd left JC.</p>
              <p>In any case, we went our separate ways. I became a journalist and worked in the same newspaper for 25 years.</p>
              <p>Among other things, I wrote many (too many - sorry) columns lamenting and celebrating love and singlehood.</p>
              <p>He, meanwhile, worked at the Singapore Sports Council for a few years. In the early 1990s, he met a Welsh woman while they were both playing in a chess tournament in Kuala Lumpur. They got married.</p>
              <p>She lived here for a while but the mosquitoes gave her hell, so they packed up for Britain. He taught in a primary school for a while and played in lots of chess tournaments.</p>
              <p>They lived in a few cities before settling in Wales. He became an electrician and taught chess in a few schools. They had a daughter five years ago but the marriage was already breaking up.</p>
              <p>There was no communication, he said, and communication, he's since realised, is critical to a good marriage.</p>
              <p>His divorce was finalised early last year. In July, he came to Singapore to visit his family.</p>
              <p>There were actually two former girl friends he thought of calling, he told me later. He couldn't get the number of the first girl but he knew where I worked.</p>
              <p>Thanks, I told him, I'm so flattered to have been your second choice.</p>
              <p>I wasn't at my desk when he called and we kept missing each other's calls thereafter. But we finally got in touch.</p>
              <p>We met up for lunch and we weren't shy anymore. It felt nice resuming our friendship. It felt comfortable.</p>
              <p>When he went back, we kept in touch via e-mail and Skype. I made it clear that I was not looking to be in a relationship. We're like siblings, okay, former JC mates. I felt for him like I would a brother, and I really did.</p>
              <p>We talked a lot, about nothing and everything. We argued and quarrelled a bit too. But mostly, he listened to my endless woes and buoyed me whenever I felt depressed.</p>
              <p>Don't ever do anything stupid, okay, he said. Come visit me first.</p>
              <p>He was open about his feelings for me and was nice. He got a birthday cake sent to my house. He kept me company over Skype on Christmas and New Year's Eve when I was feeling desperately lonely.</p>
              <p>He badgered me to visit him. Ya, I said, I will. In 2010. End 2010. Maybe. See how.</p>
              <p>In March this year, I was feeling particularly down and in need of a friend. I decided on the spur of the moment to visit him.</p>
              <p>Guess what, I told him, I'll see you in two weeks' time, okay? But, please, we're just friends. I merely want a change of scenery.</p>
              <p>Sure, he said, we'll have a great time, as friends. I'll show you around, I'll make you happy.</p>
              <p>I nearly didn't go because we got into a silly tiff over whether he'd drive me back to Heathrow from Swansea. He'd casually mentioned that should he be really tired, there was a bus I could take to the airport. I flipped at that. Some kind of friend you are, I said. I'm not going.</p>
              <p>We didn't talk for two days. Then he gave in. He sent me a bunch of roses and the note read: 'I'll drive you to the end of the world and back. Love, Hurricane.'</p>
              <p>There you go, I scolded him, always speaking so extravagantly. But I couldn't help smiling.</p>
              <p>So he picked me up at Heathrow. He had bought tickets to a Liverpool v Portsmouth EPL match and we drove to Anfield. It was fun.</p>
              <p>We made our way down to his house in Wales and spent the rest of the week there. We did the usual touristy things. He cooked for me with Don McLean playing in the background. ('We've very different music taste, you know,' I remarked. I prefer Usher and Sean Kingston. I don't think he's heard of them.)</p>
              <p>It rains a lot in Wales, I discovered. But on the Sunday before I left, the weather was bright and sunny.</p>
              <p>Let's take the bike out, he said. We'll go to the Gower peninsula.</p>
              <p>I told him I wasn't sure about that. I'd told my mum that I wouldn't go on his bike.</p>
              <p>Oh come on, he said, it'll be fun. I'll take care of you. I'll be careful. We'll have a great time.</p>
              <p>He fitted me with a biker jacket and biker gloves (his ex-wife's actually, she'd worn them only once) and I was in tights and boots. I felt like a biker chick.</p>
              <p>And he was right. It was great.</p>
              <p>That night, he asked: Will you be my girl?</p>
              <p>It wasn't the first time he'd asked me that. He'd been doing it from last July after we'd met.</p>
              <p>Aiyah, I said, you and your girl girl girl. If you mean girlfriend, say girlfriend.</p>
              <p>But maybe it was the bike ride, the romantic rainy weather, Don McLean even, or maybe I was just sleepy.</p>
              <p>I thought, oh, what the heck, you live only once. Grab the chance. Be bold. Take the plunge.</p>
              <p>Ya okay, I added.</p>
              <p>Okay? He did a double take.</p>
              <p>Ya okay, I said. I'll be your 'girl'.</p>
              <p>He looked at me, shocked. Then grinned. A really big and silly grin.</p>
              <p>You'll be my girl, he said, in wonder.</p>
              <p>Ya, okay, stop saying it, will you?</p>
              <p>We might as well get engaged then, he said. Why wait?</p>
              <p>What? You mad?</p>
              <p>No, let's get engaged. I'll buy you a ring.</p>
              <p>He was very happy.</p>
              <p>So was I.</p>
              <p>And so, that's how I finally did it. At such an old age. Giving up my singlehood after so many years of wondering if I'd ever find the right one - or if there was a right one in the first place. And there he was, right under my nose when I was 16 and in school.</p>
              <p>He'll be moving back here and the wedding's set for the end of next month.</p>
              <p>What happens if it doesn't work out, I asked him at the bus station before leaving for Heathrow (in the end I decided to spare him and I took the bus back to the airport myself.)</p>
              <p>It will work out, he said. Marriage is forever.</p>
              <p>Well, it wasn't forever for you the first time round, was it, I retorted.</p>
              <p>This time it will be, he promised. We can communicate.</p>
              <p>I looked into his eyes gazing at me and at the lines that have appeared on his face in those 30 years I hadn't seen him, and I said: 'Okay, Hurricane. I trust you.</p>
              <p>'We'll get married.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it's actually quite sweet. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><br>but it seems she has succumbed to her loneliness  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
