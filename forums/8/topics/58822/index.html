            <div class='col-md body'>This may not be as far-fetched as you think.<br><br>McDonaldÂ’s Singapore, in a bid to provide more services to its customers, is toying with the idea of selling the budget airlineÂ’s tickets through its network of 126 restaurants here.<br><br>It is also thinking of offering bill payment services for phone and utility bills.<br><br>McDonaldÂ’s Singapore managing director Tim Tighe told Streats that the AirAsia idea came from the Malaysian low-fare airlineÂ’s recent tie-up with SingPost.<br><br>He said: "It was just one of the ideas from one of our marketing people... (We) wanted to see whether we could work something out.<br><br>"Who knows? I think what weÂ’re definitely looking to do is to offer our customers more services. And it could be different things for different people."<br><br>Asked if this meant accepting payments for phone and utilities bills, Mr Tighe said those were areas being looked into.<br><br>"If it benefits our customers, weÂ’re not going to discount it."<br><br>McDonaldÂ’s was serious enough about the airline venture to give the Kuala Lumpur-based carrier a call.<br><br>AirAsia chief communications officer Joyce Lai confirmed that McDonaldÂ’s had been in touch with the airline about a possible collaboration, and that both parties would meet for discussions in the near future.<br><br>AirAsia, which starts flying twice daily between Johor Baru and Kuala Lumpur from Oct 22, recently signed a distribution deal with SingPost to sell its tickets through five of its 62 post offices in a non-exclusive tie-up.<br><br>SingPostÂ’s other post offices and self-service machines will accept payment for tickets reserved through AirAsiaÂ’s call centre.<br><br>Said AirAsiaÂ’s Ms Lai of a possible tie-up with the fast-food chain: "We havenÂ’t gotten into any details but it could work. The deal with SingPost only covers five post offices where people can book and pay for tickets. So thereÂ’s room for more."<br><br>Streats understands that AirAsia is also working on a distribution deal with bill payment company AXS Infocomm, which has 190 machines dotting the island.<br><br>Tie-ups between retailers and service providers are not new.<br><br>In Singapore, convenience store chain 7-Eleven accepts StarHub and M1 bill payments. Two years ago, Nets tied up with supermarket chain NTUC FairPrice to offer cashback services at its supermarkets. Customers can get cash with their ATM card at the checkout if they spend a minimum amount. Delifrance and BP petrol stations also participated in that scheme.<br><br>But such collaborations do not always spell profits.<br><br>Ms Titien Ahmad, research manager at The Asian Banker, pointed out that "not all financial services carried out by retailers are profitable, even if upfront fees are paid."<br><br>"Also, very few retailers can generate the kind of volume to justify going into the business.<br><br>But McDonaldÂ’s could be using these added services to draw more people to their restaurants," she said.<br><br>Of course, McDonaldÂ’s is no stranger to drawing in crowds to boost its food sales.<br><br>Its highly successful Hello Kitty campaign back in 1999 led to 300,000 Singaporeans queuing overnight for the soft toys, many dumping the food that came with the toys.<br><br>But one business McDonaldÂ’s wonÂ’t go into, even though it seems a natural fit, is mobile food kiosks.<br><br>"WeÂ’ve had a look at it, but we havenÂ’t spent a lot of time on it at the moment. It is not high on our priority list right now," said Mr Tighe.<br><br>"WeÂ’ll concentrate on getting the most out of our existing outlets. We already have good distribution."<br><br>In 2001, McDonaldÂ’s Singapore posted a net profit of $47 million, of which $27 million came from the sale of a property. Net profit in 2000 was $28.5 million.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
