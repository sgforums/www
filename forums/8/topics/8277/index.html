            <div class='col-md body'>I think what you're trying to say is that democracy should be controlled. I agree with that.<br><br>What I do not agree are some of those rules proposed.<br><br>Internet allows the freedom of speech. You do not tell people what you should say and what you should not. I would very much prefer that this be practised at one's discretion. If one should decide to be childish and post some lame notes, we should just simply ignore that person, coz' the ultimate weapon is the silent treatment.<br><br>Another thing is that, your friend is more of threatening people to obey the rules. It may be effetive, but I just don't like the idea of using threats.<br><br>Just observe net etiquette, show respect for others, be tolerant, and I'm sure things will work out just fine.<br><br>If you obey all the rules, you'll miss all the fun.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the information highway of today has indeed grown to be popular. And well, like all stuff, with all the uses, there are definitely going to be abuses. No questions about it. The net has become almost a necessity in every households, and but of course, there is no age limits to who uses the net. That is why for forums like can be accessed by people from all ages and all walks of life, from people who make sense, to adoloscents who don't make sense, flame or even try so hard to mimic their idols that they look, well, let's just say not too great.<br><br>Well, Mr. Hata-san, Mr. Myrod has definitely come up with some interesting rules and regulations which he will enforce as a moderator. But somehow, an iron fist on a free medium simply doesn't make much sense. It is just like a communist America. Hehehe, not many Americans will be impressed with that analogy.<br><br>Anyhow, there is no utopia as Mr. Hatasan has said, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. There is no choice. Scumbags must exist. Just like there are the good, there must always be the decadent. Nothing can be done about it, so we just have to live with it, take it in a positive light. For example, instead of looking at how annoying some people can be, be amused by how pathetic they portray themeselves, and that, I am sure, will brighten your day. Well, enough crap from me today, wonder what motivated me to write so much crap today, sheesh......cheerios.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>
