            <div class='col-md body'>Can someone enlighten me please?<br>I've been to Japan and Taiwan recently and the girls there are all stumbling around on their 20cm platforms. In singapore, I see girls everywhere wearing platforms too.<br>Even my own gf insists on wearing her 12cm platforms even when she stumbles here and falls there. Dun they know platforms are health hazards?<br>Why do they want to torture themselves?<br>issit to make them look taller and hopefully make their short legs longer? Come on! There;s nothing sexy about looking at legs and seeing that they are on chunky shoes.<br>If you've got bad legs, wearing platforms only makes them more noticeable.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha!<br>I dun wear platforms.Firstly I think they are not really that formal and classy.Secondly, I noticed most Ah lians wear it. Thirdly, there is a higher tendency to sprain ur ankle for ppl who walk fast like me.Fourthly, they really make ur legs look shorterif u have short legs.But i supposed it is the ego of woman that increase the norm and popularity of platforms which I think will die out soon.(Wah!I hate those "Ah Mei" kind of High heels...look so chunky and yuckky but i still like her powerful vocals, not to mention my fav, Faye Wong)<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm..... I never really wear platforms as well. I feel as though I'm going to fall down the stairs ANY moment, or when I'm walking down Orchard Road... so unglam. I'm quite short, and I only wear platforms (wedges?) when neccessary. eg. wearing skirt, formal wear, work clothes. But with jeans, not really. I still prefer my Nike or Adidas, or just a pair of chunky black shoes, which is not too high, that would cause me to fall.<br><br>I think it's true abt it(platforms, heel, anything that's too high) being a health hazard. I was working at an office and I wore mostly pants and high heels, and I had backache everyday. I had to walk all the way across the overhead bridge to take a bus to work, and from work, another bridge to cross to get to my work place... Damn shit..Went to doctor for painkillers, and he scolded me for wearing heels. From that day onwards, it was casual, and flats for me already.<br><br>New work place, gotta climb hill... but if I really have to wear heels for a meeting or something, and can't wear my usual gear, then I'll take a cab to work... 'ma fan', and waste of money.<br><br>Are there really nice platforms around anyway? they are all so common, and I guess, I prefer the chunky types, that are easier to walk in. Dunno, different taste from some girls I guess. They are all around the streets, and all look the same to me.<br><br>I have a question, since we're on the topic of shoes. Is wearing knee-high boots considered 'ah lian'?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm... a distinction should be made here.  there are bascially 2 kinds of platforms , the ones favoured by the ahlians are those with ridiculously high heels and slightly raised fronts.  this type is more harmful coz the arch causes more strain.<br><br>the other kind has flat soles and the whole shoe is raised, not just the heel.  think tat is called wedges (is this wat u meant blur?).  not a very vivid description, unfortunately.  ;Ãž<br><br>blur: i guess knee-high boots aren't common in singapore, and the only few people who i've seen wearing them ard are the ahlians.  a pity though, coz they spoil the image of the boots.  however, i'm sure if one can carry off the boots well, she won't be condemned to be an ahlian.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>shame isn't it, all those nice stuff after being worn by ahlians carry the "ahlian" stigma.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>
