            <div class='col-md body'>I was just thinking... what are the qualities that actually attract a person. The true type of qualities.. those that are not measured by normal material and physically acheivable terms.. not those extrinisc one...<br><br>Intrinsic values that cannot be bought or taught... but that which is caught and brought up through a person's lifetime.<br><br>Things like Degrees... or type of job... or even how buffed or well endowed a person is..are extrinsic... can be measured by worldy terms... cars.... these things can be arranged...<br><br>There was someone who's signature line was the person that we love in the end will be a contradiction to what we have set for our criteria... or something like that..<br><br>Why do I say that...<br>Looking at the course of the threads that are posted here regarding what is attractive to the other person... what we can do to change or buy just to have the attention of the one we like.. or love....<br><br>We all talk about personality and character.. but what is it in that person that is intrinsic that cannot be faked that attracts you? Personality? that can be arranged.. People have got different personalities for different occasions..so that one is questionable...<br>Character... now that one is up for debate... I don't have an answer for that... but the character is also formed from the habits that are cultivated throughout a person's lifetime...so what habits that you have now... is something that has been built over the years that you have lived... most of it cannot be changed.. but beliefs can be analysed and refined... then the character can be polished to be "better"(depending one who's opinion of what better is)<br><br>Things like honesty and humility...<br>submissive and God-fearing<br>Disciplined<br>Health as a lifestyle... not as a discipline<br>clear-headed<br>childlike, not childish<br>Patience... not tolerance...<br>to be quiet and listen... not just quiet....(or obstinate)<br>leadership qualities...<br>forgiving...<br>filal<br>to be UN-paranoid<br>To correct with compassion.. and to be corrected with humility...<br><br>This is just an example of what I feel are intrinisic qualities.. somethings that cannot be faked... for long...<br><br>How we would love a person of high designation in a company.. or in the eyes of the public.. but all that can be bought.. or earned...<br><br>The cars.. and cards.. given time and desire... these can be gotten...<br><br>even education.. degrees.. and Phd's.<br><br>Looks... hmmmm... can be bought nowadays...or bluffed.. but for how long?<br><br>In the end... what are you really looking for? What will make you really happy? That you can see your unborn children in her eyes... and your love in her heart.<br><br>To look into his eyes and see a responsible man who will give his life for you..... that will mean so much that he will live for only you... to know that he is human and that he will accept correction....<br><br>So all these talks about qualities and characters and material possesions...<br><br>weigh them... are they intrinsic or extrinsic...<br>and last but not least.. look inside yourself.. and see if that which you portray to others... is it intrinsic... or extrinsic....<br><br>Real people will know...<br><br>[This message has been edited by Derek Nature (edited 06 May 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When u love someone wholeheartedly, qualities of a person becomes blurred and obselete. How many times we say we want someone of a particular criteria but it is love that leads and perserve. at the end of the day, it is only the person and u that is accountable. Qualities? Are they just boundaries we set to deceive ourselves? Or just an excuse that the right one has not come along?Dun look and the one for u will come into ur life when u least expect it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>When love and hate collides...chemistry is formed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We all have a dream: that happy-ever-after state of things after marriage... after an intense scrutinization of the other party, as if he or she were a pig up for sale... (no offence...)<br><br>I think it's very much a matter of give and take... there are some devestating situations such as:<br><br>1. even if the other person were to fit the entire list that you have created for your future spouse, and yet there is a hint of doubt that you'd want to be with him or her for an entire lifetime... it could be disappointing for the prospective one as he or she has been misled that THAT relationship is THE ONE... don't be a heart-breaker.<br><br>or...<br><br>2. "Hmm... you qualify for almost everything, except for such and such a quality (which I would most likely cultivate in you- if you are worth the time)... so it's SAYONARA!" You lose that person simply becoz he or she ain't good enough, because there might be that perfect one/ or someone better out there.<br><br>Perhaps I have painted a rather bleak picture, however, I have come to understand that it is very much a give-&amp;-take situation. For every single quality that one dares to put on pen &amp; paper, that person must be honest and humble to admit that the quality is either present or lacking in the author.<br><br>One thing I take comfort in: that we do not have to perform up to a certain standard to be approved by the Lord. If not, no one would ever qualify to be His bride.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that when you love someone truely,even if he or she doesn't fit your qualities that you have mapped out earlier,it is ok as what attracts 2 persons can be that special chemistry that is not included in the list of qualities someone has mapped out eg long hair,earn &gt; $2000 etc etc as once you met that someone special.Even if she doesn't fit any of the qualities,you will still not mind as you have found the one you truly loved  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm.....<br><br>I think boundies that one set for oneself will only limit one...<br><br>Say...I told myself that I won't fall in love with a guy until I fully know him and that will take 4-5 mths...but when i met that person, you can't control yourself...my lust came out and i wanted to have that person.  Lust can easily become Love, it's just a very fine line...things happen very unexpectedly...and even if we were to set smth for ourselves it might not turn out the same way...sometimes it not within our control...<br><br>Qualities...sound we be bother so much abt that qualities a person have? shld we set a goal and say that our partner must have this and that quality?!  Yes, you can, but it will only limit yourself to a lot of things.  I think being able to feel confortable towards that person, trusting him/her, and all those kinda stuff...<br><br>But, you must realize that you have to be true to yourself, and true to the other person...<br><br>"Real ppl will know"  who is to say who is real and who is fake?  even if you where to judge yourself...can you? do you know when you are real and when you are fake?!<br><br>*NaiveGirl looks in the mirror*<br>"Am I real? Am I fake?  I am real.  Am I thinking with my heart?  Am I thinking with my mind?"  Who is to say?!  Your close friends? yourself?  Even if one of your close friend said that you are real, will the other friend find you fake?!  *ponders*<br><br>hmmm....kekekee..feel like i am just yakking away.. =P  hope you ppl understand!  =P<br><br>[This message has been edited by NaiveGirl (edited 17 May 2000).]</div>
