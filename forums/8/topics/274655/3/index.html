            <div class='col-md body'>Just a side note (but a big side note) that they would tell you it is a free listing directory on the phone, as there were victims reporting the case here. Speaking of group suing the scammer, I think it depends on the size of the victim group and possibly it costs more for each to sue them than to pay the cancellation fee. The scammer knew about it too and that's why they are so cheeky to steal our money under the sun.</div>

Just rescind the license already issued to them and they have no choice but to refund whatever $$$ they have collected! For without the license they cannot publish their directory and they cannot fulfil the terms of the contract they had conned people to sign.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree. But the government is no victim in the case. And I am sure the scam is carefully designed to con the public over the gray area of the law. The government may intervenue if 5% or more population is affected, just like the MLM scam =(</div>
