            <div class='col-md body'>If you guys want good marketing people to build your online presence, please let me know... Some of my profile including being interview by singapore news reporter within 2 weeks from marketing launch and my campaigns are quite successful in the sense that it's usually pretty profitable. Please take note of the word usually, cannot guarantee anything, but if you guys need good presence by consumers, let me know. I usually deal with expensive products, not those low cost products (mouse pad, pens, printers, etc) coz it's harder to turn over a profit.</div>
