But don't quite totally agree with you on the new guy part though....? Based on the fact that you've mentioned about 'how stable' Yoohoo's relationship with his gf should be... &lt;- Consider this FACT... This NEW GUY who have only intruded for a 'short period' of time which is also worth her consideration is really 'something' afterall..?? Or perhaps Yoohoo should look at what happened in the 1st place OR it's NOT really that pretty obvious ("Nothing happened between us ley..?" situation) perhaps LOOK more DEEPLY into your OWN GENERALISED behaviours...??? STILL nothing wrong...? Okay... Then a final piece of advice.... Start removing the ROSES and DECORATIONs on your gf and look at her at a MORE REALISTIC point of view.... Sometimes both parties are NOT to be blamed too... Things just happen this way... And this is what I'll call FATE.... &lt;- UNEXPLANABLE PHENOMENOM.... "Why my gf don't want me...?" &lt;- FATE LAH..... "Why my EX bf hurt me SO BADLY...? Why MUST I have met him in the 1st place...?" &lt;- FATE LAH.... "Where my PIKACHU soft toy go...?" &lt;- FATE LAH....  :p :p :p :p :p<br><br>------------------<br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....

Sometimes, its the the 3rd party fault.  It could be the girl's fault.  Before u jump and kill me... let me explain.<br><br>I had this experience when a married woman wanted to seduce(?) me.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Ahem... don't laugh lah.  Anyway, i know her husband too and although she's very insistent.  I refused to do such a thing.  I'm not into adultery, u know.  Till now, I'm still wondering what happened to her.  Hahaha... not that it matters though.<br><br>What I'm trying to say is even if the relationship is in a mess... bringing a 3rd party in the picture will be HOrriBLE!!!  Imagine many many balloons filled with shit and than all of them exploding on top of your head.  Yup, that messy.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
