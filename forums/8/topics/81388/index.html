            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Arrrgh ... can't you appreicate the joke and irony from the chinese saying? Don't have a sense of humor issit? </blockquote>Humours over. Can u tell me the answer whether is there justice served when<br><br><strong>Someone who sin thoroughly get to enjoy himself in heaven while another work as well as Mother Teresa and suffer in hell. Is tat fair ? </strong><br><br><blockquote>Yup. Clever huh ... steal the word but change the content. </blockquote>As acknowledge by u yourself, the entertainment circle just ike to use these religious mumbo jumbo to facinate the audience. Evagelion using some of the terms in christainity doesn;t mean a thing<br><br><blockquote>Do it here is just dui4 niu2 tan2 qin2. And it is rather sensitive here. See, even the mod wants to close THIS topic liao. </blockquote>Actually I am quite dissapointed with the mod tat she want to close down all religious threads. If we can't even discuss such issues in a forums, where can we get to do it ? Does cutting off communication aids in religious harmony ?<br><br><blockquote>Shit la, you got read my reply or not? I agreed it is too extreme for someone to run inside a temple and proclaim all believers inside go to hell mah. So why your example above? </blockquote>Okie, then lets not do it inside a church. One of your friend tell tat to u, how do u feel ?<br><br><blockquote>A cross is not a statue. </blockquote>Why is a cross not a statue ? To me it is as same as a statue from buddhism or taoist. Wat is the diff ? Why condemn buddhism and taoist for having a statue when christainity has one in the shape of a cross too ? I believe some cross have Jesus crucified on it too. They even hang it on their neck. Why is cross not a statue ?<br><br><blockquote>I suppose they're not mainstream. How do you pray to a book? Put it on the altar and pray? </blockquote>Never see any christians hold the bible and pray before ? Some even carry rosary beads and pray too.<br><br><blockquote>I'm agitated but you guessed the wrong reason. I just hope non-believers see the love behind the so-called condemnation. </blockquote>Then probably u should see the love I have for christians when I start to convince them to be free thinkers.<br><br><blockquote>I never imply that. Instead I wrote if you think christianity is crap, then why do you feel so insulted? Does God mean anything to you? If not, why care a damn if he sent you to hell or not? </blockquote>As I said, it is a curse. Whether it turn out to be true or not it is still a curse. Certainly u do not want such things to happen to u isn't it ? Your fairy god mother can be false but U r here. The christians r not condemning your fairy god mother but they r condemning U. As said before people curse u to go to hell, do u have to believe in it to know they r hostile to u ? Isn't it the same as if someone curse your son has no @sshole ?</div>
