              smart, knowledgeable and wise are 3 very different concepts. wise ppls know abt their weakness n worked on it, they made mistakes but reflect n correct on it, thus its more appropriate to say tat a wise person is always wise but they r not always right.</p>

              I afraid u don't get wat I trying to say...im not micro discussing,  , Im making a general statement here.  eg. a wise person when given total freedom by his parent, he study hard, keen to learn, get a job, contribute back to the society n take care of his parent well.   on the other hand, another person picked up vices, commit crimes, go to jail n broke his parents heart. so u c, when given complete freedom, the outcomes are very different. 
              to those who r wise enough to choose the right path...gd to them,  if not, then too bad. I not here to teach how to spot a wise person nor here to judge who is wiser, y do u like to compare?its meaningless, the life is theirs n they need to answer to themsell.
              perhaps u can try research on the upbringing of a kid to young adulthood in US then u can appreciate my earlier statement a bit more.
              all living things value freedom but we have freedom only on a very superficial level only...
              
              is it a "commodity" or a "right". for this I don't know, depends how u view it.

              @jlowbog thx fer explaining. so to summarise yer saying that freedom is a privilege and the individual has to prove he's wise enough to have it.
              
              I believe that everyone should have freedom and it is not a privilege. only when a persons actions infringe on anothers freedom should freedom be restricted for that individual.
              
              thats the difference. to answer my own question i view freedom as a right not a commodity.
              
              as fer the comparisons over who is wiser.thats bcos u said only the wise should have freedom. who is to say if the person is wise enuff?
              
              i believe in innocent until proven guilty

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Report by RONALD LOH</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>A video purportedly by computer hacker group Anonymous has threatened the Singapore Government with "an aggressive cyber intrusion" if it did not remove its internet licensing framework.</strong></p>
              <p>The 3-minute 42-second video was uploaded on The Real Singaporean website.</p>
              <p>   It was first posted on Youtube on Oct 29, but has since been removed by the user. As of 8.45pm yesterday, the video had garnered over 700 comments, 2,400 likes and over 4,800 people had shared it.</p>
              <p>   The video is still available on The Real Singapore website and Facebook page.</p>
              <p>   It showed an unidentified person - dressed in black and a Guy Fawkes mask - claiming to represent Anonymous.</p>
              <p>   The video is narrated with what is believed to be a computerised voiceover, protesting against the Government's new licensing rules imposed on news websites.</p>
              <p>   The new framework, introduced in June, states that websites with more than 50,000 Singapore visitors a month and carrying more than one news story per week must obtain an individual licence. This entails putting up a $50,000 performance bond.</p>
              <p>   "We demand you reconsider the regulations of your framework or we will be forced to go to war with you," says the person in the video.</p>
              <p>   While it remains to be seen how genuine the video is, cybersecurity experts The New Paper spoke to said it was a very serious matter.</p>
              <p>   Network security company Fortinet's regional director for South-east Asia and Hong Kong, Mr Eric Chan, said: "We can't tell if it's real or not, but we should not ignore it.</p>
              <p>   "In principle, it is possible to break through as system depending on the time, effort and resources you have.</p>
              <p>   "At the same, anyone can claim link to Anonymous since the group is very fragmented... and there are no fixed patterns between members."</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Alex Nian, manager of SecurityIT-NET, said: "Normally when (hackers) do this sort of thing, they are going through an open proxy server. It will be hard to track if they are overseas.</p>
              <p>   "But if they're doing it from Singapore, it would be easy for the authorities to find them."</p>
              <p>   Criminal lawyer Foo Cheow Ming said: "Such videos proclaiming war against the Government actually contravene the penal code, and the possible penalty is death."</p>
              <p>   The Infocomm Development Authority Singapore said it is aware of the video and that the people are investigating the matter, Today reported.</p>

              <p>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: red; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The unavailability of several government websites for a few hours set off a flurry of speculation.</span></span></p>
              <p>   The websites, including those of the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Parliament of Singapore failed to load yesterday afternoon.</p>
              <p>   Website messages said the sites were down or too busy.</p>
              <p>   At around 4pm, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) sent out a message on its Facebook and Twitter pages, saying the government websites were under planned maintenance. A spokesman also said in an official statement that such planned maintenance was usually done during weekends and public holidays, when low traffic is expected on the websites.</p>
              <p>   "The maintenance took longer than expected, due to technical difficulties. Maintenance of the websites is progressively being completed," the spokesman said. And the websites were progressively restored.</p>
              <p>   Despite the assurance, Netizens remained sceptical, with many posting comments on IDA's Facebook update about the maintenance.</p>
              <p>   One worry that emerged was whether the outrage was the work of The Anonymous collective, which last week threatened to bring down Singapore's cyberinfrastructure as a response to the Government's Internet licensing framework.</p>
              <p>   Under new rules imposed on June 1, websites which publish at least one local news article a week over a period of two months, and which have at least 50,000 unique visitors every month must obtain an annual licence.</p>
              <p>   <span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: red; font-size: 14pt;">Licensed websites are required to remove "prohibited content" within 24 hours of being notified by the Media Development Authority.</span></span><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"></span></p>
              <p>
              </p><p>   Among others, a part of The Straits Times' website was hacked into recently by a person who identified himself as "The Messiah" and who claimed to be part of The Anonymous collective.</p>
              <p>   Web developer Mohamed Saiful Mohamed Najaib, 27, told The New Paper on Sunday that it was not clear if the outrage was entirely the result of planned maintenance.</p>
              <p>   "I wouldn't be surprised if they were doing maintenance because in the current climate (of the threats to bring down infrastructure), it's what they should be engaged in," he said.</p>
              <p>   But he was puzzled about why IDA did not inform users in advance about the maintenance.</p>
              <p>   "Typically, websites, including Facebook, display a notice stating that they are undergoing maintenance, which informs people that not all the features will be functioning.</p>
              <p>   "In this case, there wasn't. I'm not quite sure of the reason." he said.</p>

              again, I am making a general statement.
              assuming some1 said...car is only 4 those who can drive...
              does tat means those who don't know driving cant drive...of course not, s/he can drive as long as they manage to get a car n they wont be any1 evaluating whether can they drive or not but when they get killed or hospitalized they have to face the consequence themsell... 
              this is the simplest analog I can put forth n I will rest my case as this is getting nowhere.

              <p>   Offline, it's a different story. When Jemaah Islamiah's plans to attack infrastructure here were exposed in 2001, you reacted with disgust and concern.</p>
              <p>   But you are dismissive of online criminality. When a hacker, named "The Messiah", loudly proclaimed his intention to launch a cyberattack against the Government, you said little.</p>
              <p>   The few, including former journalist Bertha Henson on website Breakfast Network, and a writer on The Real Singapore portal, criticised the hacker's proclamations.</p>
              <p>   Others either distanced themselves from him without condemning his intentions and worse, on socio-political website TR Emeritus, egged him on and even thanked him for having the gumption to do it.</p>
              <p>   You, the silent majority, think it's not your business.</p>
              <p>   You might even believe "The Messiah" and criminals like him should play judge, jury and executioner because the Government has failed to meet your needs.</p>
              <p>   You might be tempted to believe he's attacking the Singapore Government, not Singapore. That's naive.</p>
              <p>   This is him attacking you.</p>
              <p>   Last month, software company Adobe Systems was hacked and information relating to millions of customers, including encrypted credit or debit card numbers, were stolen.</p>
              <p>   Your credit card details.</p>
              <p>   A month earlier, in Israel, criminals launched a cyberattack and immobilised a major road network, disabling key operations for two days, resulting in hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage.</p>
              <p>   That's you, in a traffic jam.</p>
              <p>   An attack on infrastructure here slows down services and shakes confidence. More than 90 per cent of government-related services are available online and computer ownership and smartphone penetration are close to 100 per cent.</p>
              <p>   You live online. A cyberattack on the Government infrastructure is an attack on your way of life.</p>
              <p>   So what can you do? The first step is easy - don't encourage criminality.</p>
              <p>   When netizens launch personal attacks, don't "Live" or forward the postings. Criminal defamation is a real crime.</p>
              <p>   When vitriol dominates and online vigilantes turn into a mob that targets individuals, be the voice of calm.</p>
              <p>   In September, two US teenagers tormented a 12 year-old online until she jumped to her death. Both have since been arrested and charged.</p>
              <p>   Next, support tough action against criminality. Crime taking place online is still crime, not anti-social behaviour.</p>
              <p>   But others need to voice their disapproval too. Law enforcement agencies must also send a signal loud and clear.</p>
              <p>   The self-claimed "Messiah" had hacked into the City Harvest Church website in September. A police report was made, but there was no word on the action taken.</p>
              <p>   Subsequent police reports were made when he continued his attacks on other sites. It is unclear if any action has been taken.</p>
              <p>   Subsequent police reports were made when he continued his attacks on other sites. It is unclear if any action has been taken.</p>
              <p>  In the past, police action was swift and tough. In 2005, the Sedition Act was used against two young bloggers who were subsequently jailed for comments they made about Muslims.</p>
              <p>   In 2008, blogger and former Singaporean Gopalan Nair was jailed for "threatening, abusing or insulting a public servant".</p>
              <p>   Now it's largely police warnings, with one exception last year. In a first, a former engineer was jailed two months for an online posting inciting violence on National Day.</p>
              <p>   If you mollycoddle online criminality, people like "The Messiah" will grow bolder and more defiant.</p>
              <p>   Show him, if he hacks, he will get whacked.</p>

              hi M the name, thanks for the article above by Melvin Singh.
              
              First off Mr Singh is generalising (believe me i've had practice dealing with 'general statements' of late).
              he is assuming that bcos there are hackers that hack yer credit card details and that anonymous are hackers then he goes to put 1 + 1 = 2 and voila Mr Singh assumes that they are after your credit card details.
              
              it is equally possible that they are just doing what they claim to be doing. which is to drive a message. 
              
              Anyway if its credit card details they are after they would be hacking private banks not the government.
              
              And anyway they have already hacked the Straits Times and Church of Kong Hee and seriously i dun think the general sg public has lost any credit card details.
              
              On the contrary it does enforce my belief that all they are after is to drive a message home to Sg albeit being a nuisance to the govt whilst doing it.

              <p><span>T</span>his is addressed to You, the silent
              majority online who do little when netizens break laws.</p>
              <p>   Offline, it's a different story. When Jemaah
              Islamiah's plans to attack infrastructure here were exposed in
              2001, you reacted with disgust and concern.</p>
              <p>   But you are dismissive of online criminality. When
              a hacker, named "The Messiah", loudly proclaimed his intention to
              launch a cyberattack against the Government, you said little.</p>
              <p>   The few, including former journalist Bertha Henson
              on website Breakfast Network, and a writer on The Real Singapore
              portal, criticised the hacker's proclamations.</p>
              <p>   Others either distanced themselves from him without
              condemning his intentions and worse, on socio-political website TR
              Emeritus, egged him on and even thanked him for having the gumption
              to do it.</p>
              <p>   You, the silent majority, think it's not your
              business.</p>
              <p>   You might even believe "The Messiah" and criminals
              like him should play judge, jury and executioner because the
              Government has failed to meet your needs.</p>
              <p>   You might be tempted to believe he's attacking the
              Singapore Government, not Singapore. That's naive.</p>
              <p>   This is him attacking you.</p>
              <p>   Last month, software company Adobe Systems was
              hacked and information relating to millions of customers, including
              encrypted credit or debit card numbers, were stolen.</p>
              <p>   Your credit card details.</p>
              <p>   A month earlier, in Israel, criminals launched a
              cyberattack and immobilised a major road network, disabling key
              operations for two days, resulting in hundreds of thousands of
              dollars in damage.</p>
              <p>   That's you, in a traffic jam.</p>
              <p>   An attack on infrastructure here slows down
              services and shakes confidence. More than 90 per cent of
              government-related services are available online and computer
              ownership and smartphone penetration are close to 100 per cent.</p>
              <p>   You live online. A cyberattack on the Government
              infrastructure is an attack on your way of life.</p>
              <p>   So what can you do? The first step is easy - don't
              encourage criminality.</p>
              <p>   When netizens launch personal attacks, don't "Live"
              or forward the postings. Criminal defamation is a real crime.</p>
              <p>   When vitriol dominates and online vigilantes turn
              into a mob that targets individuals, be the voice of calm.</p>
              <p>   In September, two US teenagers tormented a 12
              year-old online until she jumped to her death. Both have since been
              arrested and charged.</p>
              <p>   Next, support tough action against criminality.
              Crime taking place online is still crime, not anti-social
              behaviour.</p>
              <p>   But others need to voice their disapproval too. Law
              enforcement agencies must also send a signal loud and clear.</p>
              <p>   The self-claimed "Messiah" had hacked into the City
              Harvest Church website in September. A police report was made, but
              there was no word on the action taken.</p>
              <p>   Subsequent police reports were made when he
              continued his attacks on other sites. It is unclear if any action
              has been taken.</p>
              <p>   Subsequent police reports were made when he
              continued his attacks on other sites. It is unclear if any action
              has been taken.</p>
              <p>  In the past, police action was swift and tough. In 2005,
              the Sedition Act was used against two young bloggers who were
              subsequently jailed for comments they made about Muslims.</p>
              <p>   In 2008, blogger and former Singaporean Gopalan
              Nair was jailed for "threatening, abusing or insulting a public
              servant".</p>
              <p>   Now it's largely police warnings, with one
              exception last year. In a first, a former engineer was jailed two
              months for an online posting inciting violence on National Day.</p>
              <p>   If you mollycoddle online criminality, people like
              "The Messiah" will grow bolder and more defiant.</p>
              <p>   Show him, if he hacks, he will get whacked.</p>
