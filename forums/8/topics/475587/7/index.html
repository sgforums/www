              <p><strong>Hackers usually hide behind the cloak of anonymity to do their dirty deeds.</strong></p>
              <p>A notorious group of hacktivists even call themselves Anonymous and use a Guy Fawkes mask as their symbol.</p>
              <p>   Someone who styled himself as "The Messiah" has claimed credit for hacking several websites in Singapore since September.</p>
              <p>   This person, who also claimed to be linked to Anonymous, is believed to be responsible for defacing websites belonging to The Straits Times, pop singer Ho Yeow Sun and the People's Action Party Community Foundation.</p>
              <p>   But his attempt at using anonymity to cover his tracks seem to have failed to stop the law from catching up with him.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Last week, the man suspected of being "The Messiah" behind the hacking incidents was arrested in Malaysia.</p>
              <p>   James Raj Arokiasamy, a 35-year-old Singaporean, was believed to have been on the run from drug offences in Singapore since 2011.</p>
              <p>   A police statement yesterday said he was arrested in a Kuala Lumpur apartment last Monday and brought back to Singapore. (See report on right.)</p>
              <p>   Yesterday, James Raj was charged in court with compromising the website of the Ang Mo Kio Town Council website last month.</p>
              <p>   He also faces three other charges for drug use in 2011, for which he had been on the run from the Central Narcotics Bureau.</p>
              <p>   The police said it took extensive investigations and enquiries to establish him as a suspect and tracked him down in Malaysia.</p>
              <p>   "The arrest was made with the close co-operation and support from the Royal Malaysian Police,"  a spokesman said.</p>
              <p>   Five men were also charged yesterday with vandalism after allegedly spray-painting messages linked to Anonymous. Other are helping with police investigations into other hacking incidents. (See reports on facing page.)</p>
              <p>   A Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) spokesman said: "Much effort and resources have been required to track down the persons responsible."</p>
              <p>   "Such persons only serve to disrupt the lives of other law-abiding citizens and cause unnecessary alarm. We should not allow the actions of a few to affect our sense of safety and security in Singapore."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #0070c0; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">ACTED ALONE</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>James Raj is believed to have acted alone in altering the Ang Mo Kio Town Council website by breaking into its content management system (CMS), according to the police, and court documents.</p>
              <p>   Mr Paul Ducklin, senior security adviser of security software firm Sophos, said the CMS could be used to track a website hacker.</p>
              <p>   "A CMS is to your website as Microsoft Word is to your documents. It is a user interface, backend database, website creator, etc - exactly what its name suggests," he said.</p>
              <p>   Mr Ducklin was talking to The New Paper in an e-mail interview from Sydney, where he is based.</p>
              <p>   He said that a crook might be able to get into the CMS through simple exploits, which grants him the ability to change the website's content.</p>
              <p>   "The silver lining might be that since a CMS is designed to keep track of changes, such as who edited the file or who uploaded that image, you may be able to track down the perpetrator."</p>
              <p>   More skilful hackers would access the management interface of the CMS to better cover their tracks, he said.</p>
              <p>   Manager of Local IT firm SecureIT-Net Alex Nian said hackers could also hide behind several proxy servers to hamper police investigations.</p>
              <p>   These are international servers that conceal a user's original location and assign him a new Internet address.</p>
              <p>   Use of multiple proxy servers in various countries can make it difficult to track hackers, making their intrusions virtually anonymous.</p>
              <p>   To peel away the layers, the authorities can requests Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to share information about a hacker's web trail, Mr Nian said.</p>
              <p>   "It is a lengthy process that involves a lot of documentation," he added.</p>
              <p>   The method allegedly used by James Raj to alter the town council website is a top vulnerability for websites, said Trend Micro Singapore country manager David Siah.</p>
              <p>   He said: "Hackers are counting on the possibility that the website is not coded securely and as we can see, there are still a lot of websites that will benefit from a review."</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">15 caught for mask march</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They responded to calls in support of a movement called the "Million Mask March", held on Nov 5 to commemorate Guy Fawkes Day.</p>
              <p>   The 15 Singaporean protesters - aged between 16 and 27 years old - disobeyed a police advisory reminding the public that organising or participating in a public assembly without a permit is illegal and may constitute an offence under the Public Order Act.</p>
              <p>   In an email to the media yesterday, the police said a group of 12 men gathered near City Hall MRT station at around 7pm that day.</p>
              <p>   The group were dressed in red or black clothes and three were wearing Guy Fawkes masks. Officers found a total of 14 masks in their possession.</p>
              <p>   About three hours later, two other men and a woman were seen with masks on Orchard Road.</p>
              <p>   All 15 are now assisting with police investigations into possible offences of organising and/or taking part in a public assembly without a permit.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>James Raj Arokiasamy, 35, is believed to have fled to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to escape his alleged drug offences in Singapore in 2011.</strong></p>
              <p>The Singaporean is now not only facing charges for the drug offences but also a charge for allegedly hacking the Ang Mo Kio Town Council website on Oct 28.</p>
              <p>   He is believed to have committed the hacking offence from Dorchester Apartment, a private serviced apartment block at Jalan Sri Hartamas, near upmarket Mont Kiara and Desa Sri Hartamas with its chic cafes and pubs.</p>
              <p>   Malaysian property agent Max Tan, 33, who is familiar with the area, said the apartments are popular with expatriates and those staying long-term in KL.</p>
              <p>   A studio apartment measuring 400 to 500 sq ft carries a monthly rental of RM1,600 (S$620) to Rm1,800, depending on the furnishings, he said.</p>
              <p>   He told The New Paper over the phone: "The rental is high, so usually expatriates rent there. A lot of expatriates use bicycles to travel to the nearby areas, although some of them do own cars."</p>
              <p>   Taylor's College is also within walking distance - which make the apartments popular among foreign students, including those from Iran, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Europe and the Middle-East, other property agents said.</p>
              <p>   James Raj, who is represented by lawyer M.Ravi, was arrested on Nov 4 in Malaysia.</p>
              <p>   He was charged here with three counts of drug consumption the next day.</p>
              <p>   The slim, balding man yesterday faced a new charge - an offence under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act for allegedly modifying the contents of the Ang Mo Kio Town Council website.</p>
              <p>   He will be remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric evaluation and will be back on the court on Nov 26.</p>
              <p>   If convicted of drug consumption, he can be jailed up to 10 years and fined up to $20,000 on each count.</p>
              <p>   If found guilty under the Computer Misuse Act, first-time offenders can be jailed up to three years and fined up to $10,000.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Five suspects believed to be involved in the "hacking" of the Istana and Prime Minister's Office (PMO) websites are assisting in police investigations.</strong></p>
              <p>The New Paper understands that two suspects in the PMO case are brothers in their 20s. TNP also understands the Istana incident involves a 17-year-old student and a 45-year-old IT executive who are not related to each other.</p>
              <p>   The police believe that both cases are not connected to the other cases of hacking and vandalism.</p>
              <p>   The Istana an PMO websites were compromised on Nov 7 and 8, with the search bars of the sites manipulated to direct users to certain images.</p>
              <p>   These images were also believed to be shared on forums.</p>
              <p>   For a brief period, the PMO site displayed the headline "it's Great to be Singaporean today".</p>
              <p>   The Istana site was believed to have displayed a picture of an old woman pointing her middle finger, along with offensive Hokkien words.</p>
              <p>   Both subpages were taken down within 15 minutes. said the lnfocomm Development Authority.</p>
              <p>   The attacks on both websites are separate incidents. the police said.</p>

              <p><strong>For allegedly defacing public property on Nov 5, five men ended up in court yesterday on vandalism charges.</strong></p>
              <p>Four of them - Mohamad Fadzly Aziz, 21, Muhammad Qamarul Arifin Sa'adon, 22, Muhantmad Fitri Abu Kasim, 24, and Danial Ryan Salleh, 25 - allegedly spray-painted "WE ARE ONE WE ARE LEGION EXPECT US!!", followed by a logo-styled "TSK" on a pavement outside Sunshine Plaza at Prinsep Link at around 4am that day.</p>
              <p>   About four minutes later, they allegedly spray-painted another message on a pillar at the shopping mall.</p>
              <p>   At 4.20am that day, they allegedly vandalised the pavement at a taxi stand on Waterloo Street.</p>
              <p>   Forty minutes later, Mohamad Fadzly and the fifth accused, Muhantmad Redzwan Baskin, 26, went to *Scape at Orchard Link and continued their alleged vandalism. Muhammad Redzwan is accused of defacing the wall of a ramp while Mohamad Fadzly allegedly spray-painted "WE ARE ANONYMOUS - TSK" on the pavement of the ramp.</p>
              <p>   The police arrested four of the men on Nov 7 and Muhammad Fitri the next day. All five were skateboarding friends.</p>
              <p>   They appeared calm as they stood on the dock yesterday.</p>
              <p>   Only Danial Ryan told District Judge Kessler Soh that he wanted to engage a lawyer.</p>
              <p>   They were each offered $15,000 bail and will be back in court on Dec 10. If convicted of vandalism, they can be fined up to $2,000 or jailed up to three years and given three to eight strokes of the cane for each charge</p>

              Lols true. Well, even the Chinese in The People Republic Of China can protest though they are living under Communists rule, the Malaysians in Malaysia can protest without the permit, the Thais can protest, the Filipinos in the Philippines can  protest, the Arabs in Middle East can protest etcs, and yet in Singapore its a crime to have a peaceful protest without a permit. Conclusion, fear factors and plus a tiny island is easier to control. If give them a big country like Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Taiwan, Japan, China etcs..I doubt they can even rule and govern the country and people efficiently.
