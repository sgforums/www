            <div class='col-md body'>Source: NP<br><br>HK man confesses this to police, but pleads not guilty to murder in court<br><br>MADDENED by his wife's proposal to cut his monthly allowance by 50 per cent, a 70-year-old Hong Kong man stabbed her to death over breakfast.<br><br>Tam Shu-kin, his wife and three daughters were living on public assistance of nearly HK$12,000 ($2,600) when the incident took place, reported Hong Kong's Apple Daily.<br><br>Although the money was drawn under Tam's name and deposited into his bank account, his wife, Madam Chan Mui-chai, 46, managed the money.<br><br>Tam and his family were first put on government welfare in May 1998. At first, Madam Chan would give him HK$1,600 each month.<br><br>Then, last year, she cut that to HK$1,000.<br><br>When she told him she was cutting his allowance again on Sep 16 last year, Tam got so mad he went to the kitchen and got a knife.<br><br>Madam Chan was having breakfast in their flat in Wah Oi House in Wah Kwai Estate, and had her back to her enraged husband.<br><br>Tam hid the knife in his pocket, then crept up behind her and stabbed her in the neck.<br><br>The force was so great, he completely severed the woman's windpipe.<br><br>Yesterday, Tam pleaded not guilty to murder in the Court of First Instance, saying he was provoked into the attack.<br><br>After the killing, Tam telephoned his sister-in-law and told her what he had done. He then telephoned the police.<br><br>When the police arrived, Tam, who was still drenched in blood, was agitated. He said that he had killed his wife by mistake.<br><br>In a video-recorded interview with the police, Tam admitted to killing his wife by 'poking' her neck once 'on an impulse' with a fruit knife, reported The South China Morning Post.<br><br>In the interview, which was played in court yesterday, he said he stabbed his wife from behind through the neck in a fit of anger.<br><br>'I flared up, on an impulse, (I) took a knife, poked her, she fell down,' Tam said, his voice trembling.<br><br>Prosecutor Stephen Pallaras QC told the court the force of the attack was sufficient to sever Chan's trachea, leaving a 7cm deep laceration on the left side of her neck.<br><br>The prosecution said that by the time Madam Chan arrived at Queen Mary Hospital, she was dead.<br><br>Mr Pallaras told the jury that Tam claimed he was provoked into killing his wife, but this argument was not accepted by the prosecution.<br><br>The trial continues.</div>
