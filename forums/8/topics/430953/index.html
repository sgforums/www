              <p><strong>Is Singapore boring? CNN list sparks debate <br><br></strong></p>
              <p>FAVOURITE pastimes - going to the shopping mall or watching a movie - have 
              been declared among 'the top 10 most boring things to do in Singapore'.</p>
              <p>The list, published last month on website CNNGo, a lifestyle and travel 
              companion to CNN, is compiled by one Ms Elaine Ee, described as a writer and 
              editor of 15 years. Social observers and veterans of the entertainment industry 
              such as nightspot Stereolab owner Michael Lu, say that entertainment options are 
              available but people just have to be open to seeking them out.</p>

              <p>must everything be political?</p>
              <p>anyway, most people say "Singapore is boring" because they are
              pretty much cynical and jaded...</p>
              <p>they would go to other countries and do whatever they can
              actually do here.. the difference being they're "on vacation"</p>
              <p>it's a mindset thing..</p>
              <p>i see most of the people in my office go to HK and they don't do
              anything other than eat and go shopping.. they've not seen The Peak
              and wandered around the place, they've not been to Ngong Ping and
              climbed the giant Buddha, they've not done much other than to go to
              various shopping places and bought a lot of shit...</p>
              <p>and this was "fun and exciting" to them...</p>
              <p>they could have done the same at home...</p>
              <p>the same went for people who travelled to the UK, Bangkok..
              wherever.. they just went and did the same things we would be able
              to do here without taking in the local sights during their
              travels...</p>
              <p>so... it is really "boring"?</p>
              <p>or are they just tied to a job where they cannot take a week off
              to explore and find out the really cool places and do really cool
              things?</p>
              <p>i've not seen enough of Singapore to be bored and i've lived
              here most of my life!</p>

              <p>Nong Ping is seriously nice. Alot of HK people are stuck to their job, like us. Average Singaporean works 9.5 hours a day, where got time or energy to do other things?</p>

              <p>Actually depends on you.</p>
              <p>If you are the type that just expect the surrounding to be exciting to you, then in a matter of time, the surrounding gets boring and you want more excitement.</p>
              <p>But if you are the initiative type, you take the trouble to go out and create your own entertainment, then you'll find any place exciting.</p>
              <p>So it you find Singapore boring, it just means that you are a boring person.</p>
