            <div class='col-md body'>Dun understand the long speech rite? Well, it can easily be explained by the sensitive dependence of the dynamic, non-linear system of the matrix on the initial conditions, in this case, the non-acceptance of the 0.01 percent will be a variable that will seriously affect the outcome, as a matter of speaking, chaos.<br><br>An interesting question arises from many skeptics concerning why chaos has just recently been noticed. If chaotic systems are so mandatory to our every day life, how come mathematicians have not studied chaos theory earlier? The answer can be given in one word: computers. The calculations involved in studying chaos are repetitive, boring and number in the millions. No human is stupid enough to endure the boredom; however, a computer is always up to the challenge. Computers have always been known for their excellence at mindless repetition; hence, the computer is our telescope when studying chaos. For, without a doubt, one cannot really explore chaos without a computer.<br><br>Before advancing into the more precocious and advanced areas of chaos, it is necessary to touch on the basic principle that adequately describes chaos theory, the Butterfly Effect. The Butterfly Effect was vaguely understood centuries ago and is still satisfactorily portrayed in folklore:<br><br>"For want of a nail, the shoe was lost;<br>For want of a shoe, the horse was lost;<br>For want of a horse, the rider was lost;<br>For want of a rider, a message was lost;<br>For want of a message the battle was lost;<br>For want of a battle, the kingdom was lost!"<br><br>Small variations in initial conditions result in huge, dynamic transformations in concluding events. That is to say that there was no nail, and, therefore, the kingdom was lost. The graphs of what seem to be identical, dynamic systems appear to diverge as time goes on until all resemblance disappears.<br><br>Perhaps the most identifiable symbol linked with the Butterfly Effect is the famed Lorenz Attractor. Edward Lorenz, a curious meteorologist, was looking for a way to model the action of the chaotic behavior of a gaseous system. Hence, he took a few equations from the physics field of fluid dynamics, simplified them, and got the following three-dimensional system:<br><br>dx/dt=delta*(y-x)<br>dy/dt=r*x-y-x*z<br>dz/dt=x*y-b*z<br><br>Delta represents the "Prandtl number," the ratio of the fluid viscosity of a substance to its thermal conductivity; however, one does not have to know the exact value of this constant; hence, Lorenz simply used 10. The variable "r" represents the difference in temperature between the top and bottom of the gaseous system. The variable "b" is the width to height ratio of the box which is being used to hold the gas in the gaseous system. Lorenz used 8/3 for this variable. The resultant x of the equation represents the rate of rotation of the cylinder, "y" represents the difference in temperature at opposite sides of the cylinder, and the variable "z" represents the deviation of the system from a linear, vertical graphed line representing temperature. If one were to plot the three differential equations on a three-dimensional plane, using the help of a computer of course, no geometric structure or even complex curve would appear; instead, a weaving object known as the Lorenz Attractor appears. Because the system never exactly repeats itself, the trajectory never intersects itself. Instead it loops around forever. I have included a computer animated Lorenz Attractor which is quite similar to the production of Lorenz himself. The following Lorenz Attractor was generated by running data through a 4th-order Runge-Kutta fixed-timestep integrator with a step of .0001, printing every 100th data point. It ran for 100 seconds, and only took the last 4096 points. The original parameters were a =16, r =45, and b = 4 for the following equations (similar to the original Lorenz equations):<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The attractor will continue weaving back and forth between the two wings, its motion seemingly random, its very action mirroring the chaos which drives the process. Lorenz had obviously made an immense breakthrough in not only chaos theory, but life. Lorenz had proved that complex, dynamical systems show order, but they never repeat. Since our world is classified as a dynamical, complex system, our lives, our weather, and our experiences will never repeat; however, they should form patterns.<br><br>Lorenz, not quite convinced with his results, did a follow-up experiment in order to support his previous conclusions. Lorenz established an experiment that was quite simple; it is known today as the Lorenzian Waterwheel. Lorenz took a waterwheel; it had about eight buckets spaced evenly around its rim with a small hole at the bottom of each . The buckets were mounted on swivels, similar to Ferris-wheel seats, so that the buckets would always point upwards. The entire system was placed under a waterspout. A slow, constant stream of water was propelled from the waterspout; hence, the waterwheel began to spin at a fairly constant rate. Lorenz decided to increase the flow of water, and, as predicted in his Lorenz Attractor, an interesting phenomena arose. The increased velocity of the water resulted in a chaotic motion for the waterwheel. The waterwheel would revolve in one direction as before, but then it would suddenly jerk about and revolve in the opposite direction. The filling and emptying of the buckets was no longer synchronized; the system was now chaotic. Lorenz observed his mysterious waterwheel for hours, and, no matter how long he recorded the positions and contents of the buckets, there was never and instance where the waterwheel was in the same position twice. The waterwheel would continue on in chaotic behavior without ever repeating any of its previous conditions. A graph of the waterwheel would resemble the Lorenz Attractor.<br><br>Now it may be accepted from Lorenz and his comrades that our world is indeed linked with an eery form of chaos. Chaos and randomness are no longer ideas of a hypothetical world; they are quite realistic here in the status quo. A basis for chaos is established in the Butterfly Effect, the Lorenz Attractor, and the Lorenz Waterwheel; therefore, there must be an immense world of chaos beyond the rudimentary fundamentals. This new form mentioned is highly complex, repetitive, and replete with intrigue.The extending and folding of chaotic systems give strange attractors, such as the Lorenz Attractor, the distinguishing characteristic of a nonintegral dimension. This nonintegral dimension is most commonly referred to as a fractal dimension. Fractals appear to be more popular in the status quo for their aesthetic nature than they are for their mathematics. Everyone who has seen a fractal has admired the beauty of a colorful, fascinating image, but what is the formula that makes up this glitzy image? The classical Euclidean geometry that one learns in school is quite different than the fractal geometry mainly because fractal geometry concerns nonlinear, nonintegral systems while Euclidean geometry is mainly oriented around linear, integral systems. Hence, Euclidean geometry is a description of lines, ellipses, circles, etc. However, fractal geometry is a description of algorithms. There are two basic properties that constitute a fractal. First, is self-similarity, which is to say that most magnified images of fractals are essentially indistinguishable from the unmagnified version. A fractal shape will look almost, or even exactly, the same no matter what size it is viewed at. This repetitive pattern gives fractals their aesthetic nature. Second, as mentioned earlier, fractals have non-integer dimensions. This means that they are entirely different from the graphs of lines and conic sections that we have learned about in fundamental Euclidean geometry classes. By taking the midpoints of each side of an equilateral triangle and connecting them together, one gets an interesting fractal known as the Sierpenski Triangle. The iterations are repeated an infinite number or times and eventually a very simple fractal arises.<br><br>Hence, the increasing uncertainty of the martix, while undetermined in the short run, if allowed to run unchecked, will lead to a raising probablity to render a fractal which will indicate disaster.<br><br>Hence Neo is needed, to refine and reset the system before it becomes too chaotic.<br><br></div>
