            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>found it on the net<br><br><strong>I met Lin, a thai at pattaya disco (golden mile). I was 19 then and an awolist. I worked part-time at the disco to earn some money for everyday needs. She was there working as Fl. get to know her after seeing her days for a few days, we get click on pretty well &amp; soon we are together. Lin did not want to do overnight bookings just bcos she wanted to wait for me to finish work &amp; go back together.(i was staying in her rented room at Gl). One time, i honestly told her my situation, i was on awol and could be arrested anytime &amp; i cant work full time &amp; dun earn enough to feed 2 of us. She said she wouldn't care all these, she just want to be with me, will share all hardship together. Lin was so young dat time, but her maturity really impressed me, should i say touched me.......<br><br>One day, she was caught by the anti-vice. she will be deported back in a week. So both of us did not go to work, we spend the remaining hours with each other, we talked about our everythings and the more i understand her, the more i get to love her. On the night b4, she asked me wat did i planned to do. She did advised me to surrender to the army &amp; she will wait for me to finish my national service. If not, she tell me to follow her back to Hatyai to stay wif her. I was in a dilemma and told her let me think about it. She left me her address then.<br><br>I sent her to the taxi as i am not able to see her off cos there will be officers around. We hugged so close to each other b4 i bid her goodbye. We both cried.<br><br>Move back home after dat. Got no mood to work anymore so told my boss i'll stopped for awhile to settle some matters. Weeks past, think of her day &amp; night and yet cant contact her(no phone). Also mentally i'm very stressed as worried the military police might come for house arrest. Therefore i made up my mind to flee the country, knowing is risky as the checkpoint might hv my awol records. But i decided to take the chance, so without my family knowledge(except my younger sis), i packed some clothings, took my passport and gathered as much money and i booked a bus ticket to Hatyai. I went through dat day............................<br><br>18 hours of travel, reached Hatyai in the early morning. Got a tut-tut to take me to the address Lin gave me. A lady answered the door, i show her the paper &amp; she confirmed is the right place. I asked:"Lin Yu Mai?". She told me to wait for awhile she'll go and call Lin down. She came, she saw me, we were like lovers again................. In order to save cost, Lin suggested i stay in her room with her 3 room mates. I was worried her friends might not be happy but to my surprise they are all very understanding and kind person. I hv really changed my views on these working ladies then. The money i brought over was not much and soon drained up. I told Lin about it &amp; she just told me not to worry on dat. She will take care of it. Lin &amp; her mates are working as FLs daytime like the cat40 at Gl. Every morning, after taking breakfast, she will send me to her uncle's fish farm to kill my time fishing there. Around evening time, they will come and pick me back home for dinner. During night, i will follow them to the disco and the girls will continue to work. As usual, Lin wont take overnight bookings when i'm around, so if she does not has any short-time customers, she will join me till the disco ends, it was a routine everyday. then i started to wonder, am i going to spend my life doing nothing and just live on Lin? never return to home again? wat can i do in Hatyai if i intended to stay on? I started to worry again and evantually i fell sick...........very sick.............Lin tot i'm not used to the living condition of the room(is not good), so without my knowledge she booked a hotel room and i moved in with her. She has been paying for my lodging, foods, in fact everything since i was there, I was thinking i need to do something, so i rang up my childhood friend and asked him to look for my dad that i need cash here. My dad called me the following night and i explained to him my situation and he agreed to get the money to my friend and he will see me in Hatyai. I told Lin about it as i could see she started to worried bout the expenses too, but she just kept to herself. Two days later, someone knocked on my room, Lin reached for the door and to my greatest shock i saw my mum and sis there! Once inside, my mum started to leture on Lin, she tot i was cheated by her and she's the reason i awol and keft home. Lin did not uttered a word, she swallowed everythings theown at her, she did not even defended for herself. I was so TL &amp; i retailated. Told my mum off saying she's being too unreasonable, telling her dat her precious son me would hv dead on the street of Hatyai if not of this lady, we cool off gradually and i took the chance to tell her more wat Lin has done for me..........My mum was touched too after hearing it, she told me honestly she never expect a working lady would hv done these, tot she was cheating me dat's why i called home to ask for the few grand. Finally, all mis-understanding cleared but then their turn to gang-up against me. After discussion on my matters, i agreed to my mum to go back &amp; surrendered to the army and complete my NS. But i requested my mum to let me stay for few more days and she agreed.<br><br>Lin get along well too with my mum &amp; sis, we visited many interesting places. We are so happy everyday. No worries finally. Night b4 we returned home, my mum took out 3k(Sin) and passed to Lin. As a appreciation for Lin for taking care of my needs during my 3 months stay there. She insisted she dun want the money and tell my mum to use it to but me wat i like. I persuaded her but she just to sturbon on this. I then write Lin my house no. and tell her to call my mum or sis if she needs anything when i'm not around. She onli tell me one request:"I just want u to come back &amp; look for me". My heart sanked......We cried to sleep dat night.<br><br>The day to leave, dat morning her mates joined us for breakfast together. We then waited at the hotel lobby for our airport taxi. Then Lin came to me, she hold my hand tightly and tell me she cant send me off at the airport. She got a very important matters to attend to. She give me a kiss and bid my family goodbye &amp; she left. I was wondering wat the hell was dat? Is there anything much important? I was sad...... One of her mates send us to the departure hall, we xchange well wishes and i beg her to take good care of Lin. Then her friend told me this:"Lin got nothing on at all, she just could not take it to leave u &amp; see u off, and she's afraid i might changed my mind to go back if i see her broke-down. And she has promised my mum something. My eyes turned red as i board the plane............................................. ......<br><br>I was sentenced for 11mths to detention barracks. To live in a closed-up cell is not as bad as i've thought, but to think of Lin everyday is very torturing, i hv countless sleepless nights. First time i always asked my mum during parent's visiting day is did Lin called? But my mum say she did not and asked me to forget about her. I was wondering why...........till date. After my released, we hv shifted house too, i continue to serve my NS for another year till ROD. I keep asking my mum did she say anything to Lin but she insisted she never. I planned to go Hatyai look for her, my friend who i called last ime accompany there. We went, but the room we used to stay in was emptied. we went around places i used to go but all to no available.............I never get to see Lin again since.................<br><br>Well, it's been over 10yrs now and at times i still think of her. Not hoping to be back with her honestly as i'm married now. Just want to know she is living well now, just want to know she's safe &amp; sound, just want to tell her:<br><br>Lin, thank U</strong></div>
