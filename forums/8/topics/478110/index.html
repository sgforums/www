              <p>I am sharing my experiences with California fitness from 2013, referring to the branch at Ngee Ann City on Orchard Road. </p>
              <p>I am not a member of this gym. But the story is about when I wanted to become a member. I took my housemate to look at gyms and with my help he registered with California Fitness. As he was intending to sign up that day the sales person was not pushy and very polite. He signed up. Then they tried to sign me up. I was not ready as I know I am not ready to visit the gym frequently so I didn't want to waste money. They pushed me pushed me pushed. But I was strong and survived and left without any signing. They captured all my details and had my IC details on their system. (Be warned this is the foundation of many of their low grade tactics). </p>
              <p>Over a month later my housemate tried to convince me to join California fitness gym as I needed help with my overweight problem. He showed me a free visit card which he could use for non members. I though. Okay I just need to get my step onto the treadmill and I will get more motivated. I went there. We gave the card. Gave my IC. They didn't let me use the gym but this lovely sweet young lady tried to get me sign up. She was so sweet and I knew I will not sign up so I entertained her thinking once its done I can have a workout. Instead I got a workout on their chair. 1hour I was tormented by this sweet lady first then her gorrilla of a manager for 2nd half. I told them many times I am not ready to sign up but I want to get a feel for getting back into a real gym. </p>
              <p>The manager tried to psycho analyse me (yes they have those skills) and in a creative way accused me of being a liar and that my kind of people are not liars. I had no idea what he was gassing about. He knew my job role. He used that to accuse me of not having integrity in my work and to my staff. I was oblivious to his words as I was mostly irritated the destroyed my visit. I said I've never used the gym before and he accused me of lying. What a down grade human being he was. He should have just come out and say what was the problem but instead he tried to belittle me and crush me. What. Into signing with him. Such an idiot. </p>
              <p>Onky at the extreme end the sweet young lady (evil number 2) told me I did visit the gym and showed me their access records. I explained to her that their recorded visit was not me. It was a friend who visited singapore and the gym staff let him enter with my housemate using my records (which they illegally recorded on their systems). In fact. That friend paid $50 to visit the gym even though there was also a free entry card. Whether she understood or not didn't worry me. What concerned me was that gorilla manager had assaulted me verbally with his bullshit and accused me of being a lair. I was so heated after this 1hr torture. I grabbed my housemate and we left. I was so red with anger that I forgot my IC at their reception. </p>
              <p>They didn't even call me the next day to say I left my IC there. I figured it out and picked up my IC. I work in same building. I live near the gym. My housemate is a member. All the signals were there that I am a prime candidate to join the California fitness Ngee Ann city gym. Idiots lost out one membership. Infact I'm a firm promoter of my favorite things that I could have gotten others to visit. Lucky I didn't as those friend would be verbally assaulted by the staff of California fitness. </p>
              <p>Im sure the gym equipment is nice. Good for all the members. My housemate tells me that since he joined the staff do not treat him with smiles he got on his first day. They lady who signed him up ignores him. Strange. I am so put off from joining any gym. I just stick to the condo gym sometimes. </p>
              <p>I am pleased to share this so others who have terrible experiences can let out their suffering and find closure. Also for newbies to be careful. Even if you're a strong character, just be careful. Ask to visit the toilet, grab your IC and leave immediately. </p>
              <p>Good luck to all. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>To add: if you do get forced to sign up and cannot survive the assault, at least make sure that you get a good deal of $50 or $70 per month contract. You would have to pay all upfront and stand to loose if you try to cancel. I think you can sell remainder of contract to someone else. At least they do not have to go through your ordeal. </p></div>
