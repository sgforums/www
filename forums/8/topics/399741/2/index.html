              <p>Hello to all forum members, i'm the real-life cousin of As Romanista2001. Just to inform you people that he passed away from a heart attack on Monday morning on 17th May. As per his instructions, there'll be no funeral wake and he'll be cremated with his ashes scattered at sea.</p>
              <p>I may or may not keep posting here using his user name as he was active in several other online forums as well but i may post occasionally if i have some free time.</p>

              <p><br>Don't be stupid ok?</p>
              <p>How he know he's going to have an heart attack? It's not going to be called heart attack if people knows when he is going to have one. It would be called Heart Disease.</p>
              <p>If you real-life cousin As Romanista2001 had just died, would visiting all his frequented online forums and reporting his death be the first thing on your mind?</p>
              <p>Do you really think he's Elvis or Michael Jackson that reporting his death on his frequented forums is so important that you need to report it on the next day when he had passed away?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would believe you if you were to tell me it has been a week since he had passed away.</p>
              <p>Sigh....I really hate bad liars.....how come you couldn't even do a simple task and create a believable lie?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nobody cares if you may or may not post here in the future, I suggest you should go join and follow your real-life cousin in death since you are so close to him...to the extend of even knowing his forum passwords and his WILL and even know how he is going to be settled down in death.</p>
              <p>Don't bother posting again, you  stupid liar. If you got time, you should use the time to think of a better LIE because not everyone in here is stupid enough to believe you.</p>

              <p>come on , how many forumers here let their family members or friends know that they post in forums. i don't tell anybody. even if you tell, you also won't tell them your name and password.</p>
              <p>i didn't know a romanista was so serious in posting in forum to the extent that he informed his cousin to post his last words. LOL</p>

              <p>How he know he's going to have an heart attack? It's not going to be called heart attack if people knows when he is going to have one. It would be called Heart Disease.</p>
              <p>If you real-life cousin As Romanista2001 had just died, would visiting all his frequented online forums and reporting his death be the first thing on your mind?</p>
              <p>Do you really think he's Elvis or Michael Jackson that reporting his death on his frequented forums is so important that you need to report it on the next day when he had passed away?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would believe you if you were to tell me it has been a week since he had passed away.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Nobody cares if you may or may not post here in the future, I suggest you should go join and follow your real-life cousin in death since you are so close to him...to the extend of even knowing his forum passwords and his WILL and even know how he is going to be settled down in death.</p>
              <p>Don't bother posting again, you  stupid liar. If you got time, you should use the time to think of a better LIE because not everyone in here is stupid enough to believe you.</p>
