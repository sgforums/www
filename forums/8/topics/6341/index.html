            <div class='col-md body'>Its good to plan now. Start early and get things on track fast.<br><br>I read some advice about planning. Seems that one of the best ways is to look into long term investing in terms of managed funds. There was something about putting in about $100 dollars everyweek into the fund, and you will get your million by the time you retire in your late fifties. But, of course it depends on how early you start.<br><br>That is only the basic level of planning. Sometimes there will be more gains, and sometimes you might have things happen that require you to use the money. The basic framework is there at least.<br><br>Having said that, I still can't wait to be able to earn some money and blow my first paycheck on some big boys' toys, even though I dread the thought of having to work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's never too early to start planning for the future (financially). A dollar now is worth nothing in the future. So if u want to retire in comfort without having to depend on others (e.g. children) in maybe 30-40 years time, you'll need quite a huge sum of money. One simple rule is to never spend more than you earn, so that you can invest the excess and make the money work for u.<br><br>i'm definitely no expert, but if u pple would like to know more about managing your personal assets, maybe can try reading this book by Dr. Koh Seng Kee, the title is something like "Personal Financial Planning" or something to the extent. Talks about financial planning in the local context, and also talks about investing thru unit trusts/insurance/shares/property etc.<br><br>or the easiest way out is to go to Citibank..isn't there much hype about their new retirement planning program now?<br><br>[This message has been edited by sparkle (edited 01 April 2000).]</div>

I wanted to take that module by him, "Managing personal assets" but didn't have the chance.<br><br>I believe that the problem with people not planning is because they fail to appreciate that bit by bit, it can add up to a lot. most Singaporeans are shortsighted and not willing to commit regularly on a long term basis of 20-40 years. The traditional generation belives in just putting money in banks which to them is the safest and are willing to forgo the additional perks that comes with calculated risk taking. However it is good that Singapore is having more services that helps people plan. It definitely raise the awareness among the public.</div>

So if people just keep their savings under the pillow, they'll realise that it won't be worth much by the time they retire. so wat we got to do is to make good use of that dollar thru investment, like what u said.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>light:<br>yup, i took that module a few semesters back. interesting module.

            <div class='col-md body'>Planning for retirement? *laffs* Well, if anyone did read my thread on <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/ubb/Forum50/HTML/000004.html" rel="nofollow">Career Vs relatioship</a> in the void deck, you all would have know me to be the ambitious one who wants to earn $20 mil by the time he is 35.<br><br>Well, I plan far, and very far in fact, and like I said earlier I would want to retire by 35 yrs old, rather unrealistic, many feels, but I believe that it can be done if there is careful planning and I work hard enough. Well, to be frank I started planning at a very early age, I started to plan what I want to achieve by the time I retire at the young age of 17. I will not share the intimate plans details, of how I am going to make it. But from now, I have my planning done till I am 40yrs old.<br><br>But there are a few inspirational books that I would like to introduce to you guys/gals if you are interested. One of my favourite authors so far on this topic is still Robert T Kyosaki. His first book strike quite a big controversial in Singapore and is eventually not encourage as a good book to read in Singapore due to the polictically incorrect title call, <strong>"If you want to be rich and famous, do not go to school."</strong>, that was the first book, then the second is titled <strong>"Rich Dad, Poor Dad"</strong>, it's contents are rather thought provoking to those who are not so financially intelligence trained. And would be a good starter for those who are interested, these are pretty light reading that most people would survive through*laffs* but if you want to go more indepth, than you can try his 3rd book titled <strong>"The Cashflow Quadrant"</strong>.<br><br>But do allow me to share some of my own thoughts on financial planning with you all... if you all do not find me a bore.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Part 1</span><br><strong>Why have fianancial Planning?</strong><br><br>How many of you out there are going to bank on your CPF savings after you retire? If most of you are raising your hands, I can't help but think that you should give it second thoughts. Well, look at it this way, how much are you going to have in your CPF account when you retire at the age of 55?<br><br>Some simple calculations, say through out your life you earn a average of $3000/mth. And you start working seriously at the age of say 22 No share or stocks options, no insurance, etc.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Your personal CPF contribution(22%) =</span> <strong>$660 per month</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Your employer CPF Contribution(20%) =</span> <strong>$600 per month</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Total CPF contribution =</span> <strong>$1260 per month</strong><br><br>The figures for CPF contribution might flacuate but I kept it simple for calculation purposes.<br><br>55 - 22 = 33 yrs<br><br>33 X 12 = 396 months<br><br>Total CPF Contributions when you retire = 396 X $1260 = $498 960.00<br><br>Now that would be quite a sizeable sum of money you think, but now some more calculations. Say at 28 you got married and you brought a 4 rm flat in say Queenstown, the valuation of the flat is say, $300,000 all deducted from your CPF. But that would not be the figure to deduct of your CPF, for you still need to calculate interest.<br><br>A loan of 25 yrs, at the discounted interest rate of 2.5% per Annum would = 62.5% of interest. You would need to pay the 20% depsotie from your CPF first, and that would be, $60,000 of your account first, the loan would then be for $240,000.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Interest for load = ($240,000/100) X 62.5 </span><strong>= $150,000</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Thus totla required to pay back to CPF = $240,000 + $150,000 =</span><strong> $390,000</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">So the total cost of the flat would be = $60,000(20% initial payment) + $390,000(Loan + interest) =</span><strong> $450,000.</strong><br><br>So just after the housing loan how much do you have left?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">$498,960(total in CPF at 55) - $450,000(housing) =</span><strong> $48,960</strong><br><br>I have to remind you that I have yet taken any money out for the medi-save, medi-save++ and such.<br><br>Now say you live until the ripe age of 70. That would be 15 years after retirement.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">15 X 12 =</span><strong> 180 months</strong><br><br>$48,960/180 = <strong>$272 per month</strong><br><br>Now tell me ladies and gentleman, I am doing a very raw calculation with a lot of other expenses not included and at high CPF contribution from employers, and yet, you can only have <strong>$272</strong> per month to get by if you lived till 70, tell me if it would be enough? Now you know why people still work after retirement? Not so much that they want to pass time, but seriously they might not have enough. And those who go out and blow their CPF on some new car once they retire would be the stupidest of the lot, for most probably there would not have the money for the fuel left.<br><br>Till the next part.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Callan (edited 01 April 2000).]</div>

That's why we need planning. We have to decide where we can park our hard earned money so that we can get the best returns with a managable risk.<br><br>Sometimes situation changes. For example, you park your money in XXX company. After 2 years, that company's outlook begin to look dim and there are better choices, so you withdraw your money and park somewhere else.<br><br>Don't expect to have a plan that can benefit you for decades. Who expected the economic crisis in 1997/8 ?<br><br>It is always better to have a plan but change/modify it constantly to fit into the changing world than to have no plans at all. If you think that planning is so unnecessary cos we have to constantly change it, why do you think we have fund *managers* in financial institutions ? They are the ones who will plan the investment and change the plan when necessary to reap the best profit.</div>

Fund managers are employed to manage investors'(corporations or individuals alike) money. For some funds (unit trusts), u can invest for as little as $1000, and if u want, subsequently invest $100 per month. All investors have to pay is some sort of management fees, which is around 5% of your investment.<br><br></div>

This has nothing to do with whether we listen to wat they say or not. It is all about "should government plan despite the uncertain future"? And your answer is YES !!!

Don't keep comparing your small money with those company who employ fund manager to handle large amount of money.<br></strong></blockquote>Please let me clarify the job of a fund manager. I am a certified life insurance agent. I work in the financial industry. Hence i believe i can give you a good description of a fund manager's responsibilities.<br><br>Fund Managers manage funds. These funds may come from a company or the public. Or a combination of both. The fund managers will decide how the fund is to be invested, abiding all the guidelines set by MAS of course. When you place your money in your savings account, you are already employing the fund manager who generates the interest for you. Same goes for Unit Trusts and Bonds. But in the case of Share and Commodities, your fund is managed by yourself. This is way the government is encourging us to put our money in Unit Trusts and Bonds instead of Shares/Commodities cos in the former, your money (no matter how little) is managed by experienced fund managers thus the risk is lower.<br><br>So you simply decide where you want to park your money and then let the fund managers invest the money for you. (in the case of Unit Trusts, bonds and investment-linked insurance)<br><br>This thread is about "do you plan for your future?" and not "YOU MUST PLAN FOR YOUR FUTURE!!" So you are most welcomed to tell us why you think it is unnecessary to plan and how do you ensure that you'll have money to survive (not only for yourself, but wife and kids etc etc). I am not forcing you to plan your finance, so please dun get too personal ok ? Cool down !    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Btw, who says a few hundreds cannot be considered a "fund" ? If this few hundreds are managed properly, you'll get hundreds of thousands in decades.<br><br>The idea of investment is "<strong>every cent counts</strong>".<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I don't think FunD manager is fun, they are boring people.<br></strong></blockquote>oh ! you actually know some of them !<br><br>[This message has been edited by LittleMan (edited 02 April 2000).]</div>

And these investors can be either individuals like u and me (who maybe can only afford to invest a few thousand dollars) or corporate investors as well. So in this sense, if individuals invest thru the unit trusts, they are actually letting the fund managers manage their money. We're not saying that we individuals employ the fund managers ourselves to manage that few thousand of dollars we have. However, for the very rich individuals, they may have their own private bankers to help them plan their finances.<br><br></div>
