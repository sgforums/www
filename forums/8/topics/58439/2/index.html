But there are some of the unlucky ones like my uncle. From what my cousin told me, it seems that they'll give the goods to the first few customers of their new recruits, just so to gain their confidence of the company. Once the new guy thought that there's nothing wrong, they'll continue to sell to their relatives and friends. The problem will then start to come after a few sales. Maybe they do not have enough finance to buy the goods. They'd say things like there's a long queue of customers waiting for the products and it's not your turn yet. Or there's been a small delay in shipping of the goods due to the strong demand of the product.<br>Those of you who're approached by them to go for an interview had better forget about joining them. They can't even afford the rent and phone bills, so how can they pay you??</div>

As in it may only be a $1 pen marked up to $5000<br>- A person will tell you you buy the pen for 5000, recommend 2/3 frens and you will get back $100000 or somewhere along this line. That means there is no need for any sale to be made. As long as you bring in 3 frens u make money.<br>- You can only bring in a set number of frens. No more no less. Thus forcing the group organisation to become a pyramid.<br><br>MLM has the following traits :<br>- goods have certain value<br>- you can bring in any number of frens to help you sell the goods.<br>- money is only earned when there is a sale. No sale = no money.<br>- Your UPLINE (person who brought you in) will earn money no matter you are under, same level as him or even a higher level than him.<br>- no restriction as to how many people you want to bring under you.<br>This scheme requires no effort after you have brought in your partners. Just have to sit back and watch them work for you.<br><br>Single-Level Marketing<br>- Products have certain values<br>- money earned only when there is a sale<br>- your UPLINE will no longer earn commission from your sales if you are on par level with him or higher level than him.<br>- no restriction as to how many people you can bring under you.<br><br>This scheme requires your UPLINE to put in effort to be always at a higher level than you in order to earn money from your sales. Thus everyone in the scheme needs to work hard.<br>This scheme requires effort from all parties in order for money to be earned. This is the scheme that the government is trying to encourage when it made changes to distinguish MLM from Pyramid.<br><br>And for your info,Asayo is a single level marketing company...It is neither MLM nor pyramid selling.I'll gladly answer any doubts if you have any....Cheers..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys guys, just my 2 cents<br><br>I believe you should approach CASE,CAD and MTI for help. These are the authorities, whether or not someone complains or sue, its up to these people to decide whats legal and what gone wrong.<br><br>Reading WJPG points on MLM,SLM and pyramid, I gotta disagree.<br><br>Altho SLM seems to be more ethical, in reality I have not seen very successful SLM company in sg, (successful not just on company profitting, but also on distributors welfare and income right down to lowest level). Cases like DW Group and Asayo have been happening in sg. In any case, I would have recommended people to join decent companies under DSAS like Lux and Tupperware. Even then, these companies do not boast high success rate for its distributors. If companies are not going to be succcessful in long term, chances are its gonna collapse and waste distributors time and effort. But luckily Tupperware and Lux are well known brand.<br><br>As for the point MLMers can watch their money go on autorun mode after their initial hard work, is also a misleading point. Remember, MLM is a business which lies between investment and traditional business in its features. And always is. How so?<br><br>Its true MLMers' ends are to work as well as having freer lifestyle than corporate world. But remember, legal MLM network does not allow one to earn till the bottom level, so they mainly earn from own network, but there are always changes in the network. Death, new prospects, immigration, people losing interest etc etc which makes one 'having to repair the holes' so as to speak. Btw, these are the very reasons the industry never did 'saturate the market'.Whether there are postive or negative changes, the uplines still has to maintain his network, training them, motivating them etc etc, so the work never ends. Its just that it wouldnt be 50% or 60% of their network gonna siam, thats why those of earlier batches dont have to work so hard as before to recruit new members. They do still work, but in a more leisurely fashion. Thats what most people coming into the industry hopes for, isnt it?<br><br>Seen many pioneers in many companies which does not emphasise on maintaining network properly, which lead to pioneers leaving the companies, or the collapse of those companies.Happening all the time, hence the volatility of the industry.<br><br>And yah, you gotta produce evidence the gahmen is supporting SLM. Coz from what I know, the gahmen and police would not endorse any company or business. CAD even declared it on their website. Coz sg is a free market, and i rather better companies eliminate the weaker ones thru quality biz management, than having support from the gahmen.<br><br></div>

As in it may only be a $1 pen marked up to $5000<br>- A person will tell you you buy the pen for 5000, recommend 2/3 frens and you will get back $100000 or somewhere along this line. That means there is no need for any sale to be made. As long as you bring in 3 frens u make money.<br>- You can only bring in a set number of frens. No more no less. Thus forcing the group organisation to become a pyramid.<br><br>MLM has the following traits :<br>- goods have certain value<br>- you can bring in any number of frens to help you sell the goods.<br>- money is only earned when there is a sale. No sale = no money.<br>- Your UPLINE (person who brought you in) will earn money no matter you are under, same level as him or even a higher level than him.<br>- no restriction as to how many people you want to bring under you.<br>This scheme requires no effort after you have brought in your partners. Just have to sit back and watch them work for you.<br><br>Single-Level Marketing<br>- Products have certain values<br>- money earned only when there is a sale<br>- your UPLINE will no longer earn commission from your sales if you are on par level with him or higher level than him.<br>- no restriction as to how many people you can bring under you.<br><br>This scheme requires your UPLINE to put in effort to be always at a higher level than you in order to earn money from your sales. Thus everyone in the scheme needs to work hard.<br>This scheme requires effort from all parties in order for money to be earned. This is the scheme that the government is trying to encourage when it made changes to distinguish MLM from Pyramid.<br><br>And for your info,Asayo is a single level marketing company...It is neither MLM nor pyramid selling.I'll gladly answer any doubts if you have any....Cheers..</div></blockquote>he's a recruit of asayo.. if not hw the fuck will he noe this kinda shit.. how tings work inside...
