            <div class='col-md body'>Isnt there any association u can approach to find out de credibility and reputation of dis Asayo company? If it's a registered company i tink it shouldnt be too difficult getting more details of it.<br><br>Actually, it's not uncommon for a company to have 'so many problems' and yet still be operating for so many yrs. Fr wat i know of some mlm/pyramid companies, many of their clients/customers r relatives/frens of de employees of those companies. So perhaps sometimes even when the products arrive late, or de customer service isnt so up 2 standard, de relatives 'close one eye' cos they r <strong>relatives</strong>. Perhaps they giv chance out of 'pity'( i understand some of these fellas have a purely comission-based salary). Or perhaps the customers simply cant be bothered 2 go thru de legal processes in filing de complaint or suing, bla bla bla.<br><br>Personally for me, if i order sumtin fr a company, and they take so long to deliver it to me, but i do still get de product in de end, i wont say de company has 'deceived' me. I just consider it bad quality control or bad service. The 1st time it's late, maybe i close once eye. But if it happens repeatedly, it's really bad service and deserve complains.[/b]</div>
