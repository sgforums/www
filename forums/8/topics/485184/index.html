            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I have been thinking about this recently: <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Ten years after 31 December 2004, I guess there will once again be another television station in Singapore. </span></p>
                  <p>Well, I know there was an attempt ten years ago when SPH was given license to run television services, and it subsequently flopped due to the financial losses it suffered. Nonetheless, I think there will be another attempt soon, and it should be more financially viable this time. </p>
                  <p>Well, it is regarding the <a title="Mediapolis@one-north" href="http://www.mda.gov.sg/IndustryDevelopment/Mediapolis/Pages/Overview.aspx">Mediapolis@one-north</a>, which Mediacorp will relocate to from Caldecott Hill by year 2015 (next year). <span style="line-height: 1.231;">When the <strong>Mediapolis@one-north</strong> is ready, Mediacorp will be the anchor tenant of the development, rather than the sole user of it. </span></p>
                  <p>I guess with the <strong>Mediapolis@one-north</strong>, the government may once again open the television industry for another Free-To-Air television to set up.</p>
                  <p>This time, it may use a model similar to how it opened the telecommunications industry for M1 and Starhub to set up, where Mediacorp occupies a majority of the <strong>Mediapolis@one-north</strong>, while the other spaces at the <strong>Mediapolis@one-north</strong> are leased to new television stations that are given license to run FTA television services.</p>
                  <p>For the transmission of content, the new television stations could use the same set of transmission facilities owned by Mediacorp, similar to M1 and Starhub using the same set of transmission facilities owned by Singtel.</p>
                  <p>This would no doubt reduce costs, since many of the operating infrastructure are shared (new television stations would not have to spend money to set up their own and can instead rent them, which is cheaper.) and there can be some extent of Economies of Scale (leading to costs savings) enjoyed.</p>
                  <p>If new television stations are set up this way, it could prevent them from suffering financial losses like what SPH experienced ten years ago.</p>
                  <p>Personally, I feel that during that four years when there was competition in the free-to-air television industry, there was a significant improvement in the content of FTA television programmes. It was a pity that the competition back then was not financially viable and SPH had to close down its television business to stop making losses.</p>
                  <p>It would be good if there can once again be competition in Singapore's Free-To-Air television industry, when the <strong>Mediapolis@one-north</strong> is ready. Hopefully, if there is another round of competition, the competition can be financially viable and can go on for as long as there is Free-To-Air television in Singapore, rather than close down after a few years due to financial losses incurred.</p>

SPH nearly get killed for it. maybe starhub can open up another free channel for local viewers like the free sport channel now which is support by government. another free channel from starthub can show locally produce theather works and movies not so latest one but back dated time ones.</p></div>

              <p>sorry la. all these copyrights and licenses protecting the film industry and respecting the producers are very expensive. not really wise to provide a free movies channel, unless the channel shows only movies from 10-20 years ago.</p>
              <p>then again, it's not healthy for one to keep watching movies from the past. we all have to move on and not always look back.</p>
              <p>unless it's an arts channel, a full-fledged one unlike Arts Central/Okto (A-Ok). Our government has recently been emphasising on promoting arts in Singapore. I think there will be another "Super Sports Arena" FTA channel that's on arts.</p>
