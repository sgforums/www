            <div class='col-md body'>It seems that gleneagles' policy of "payment in full upfront or no deal" has cost the life of a liver patient. This isn't the first time gleneagles has been in the papers for the wrong reasons.<br><br>How sad when we all think that a hospital is synonomous with saving lives rather then losing them.<br><br>Under the circumstances, surely they could have accepted a defered payment, seeing as they had coughed up with the amount over such short notice? The mercenary attitude of the policy (and most likely the board of directors who came up with it) seems to stem from money-minded burecrats rather than live-saving surgeons and doctors.<br><br>I wonder how gleneagles is going to justify this case to the public: placing their policy b4 a life.<br><br>It seems only likely that their reputation is in for a serious slap in the face.</div>
