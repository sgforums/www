              <p>I am currently having a dilemma between 2 university courses and I would appreciate if anyone of you, especially university graduates/current students, could render me the appropriate advice. Thanks!</p>
              <p>I am currently holding a law offer. In Singa-pragmatic-pore, a law degree is perceived as "lucrative" because it is professional in nature, ensuring job stability and good career prospects. I never fail to elicit approving nods or even raise a few impressed eyebrows whenever I tell people [who ask] that I will be reading law in the near future.</p>
              <p>However, while serving NS, I struggled quite abit internally. Deep down, I have always been interested in the study of economics. Academic-wise, I have always performed well in mathematics and economics. However, everyone has been telling me that a social science degree is too "general" and doesnt provide solid career prospects unlike law. So far, very few, if any at all, have provided me with an alternate view.</p>
              <p>I really don't know whether to pursue my passion or be more pragmatic. I guess the reason why I'm skeptical about going to law school is <strong>not so much the lack of interest as the intense competition amongst law students.  </strong>Ultimately, law school admits students who are academically strong [I'm not one of them though, just got lucky I guess] and the cohort size is small. After talking to students and law graduates, I have come to the conclusion that law school is tough and the competition is cutthroat.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, mathematics is to me what cooking is to chefs or what aeroplanes is to aerospace engineers. It comes just so naturally without the need to put myself through pain and misery. When I was studying mathematics or economics at school, I find myself enjoying the process without finding it laborious at all. In fact, without the need for external "push", I actually took the initiative to consult my tutors and source for information myself. Independent studying became so easy, and may I add, natural, when I was so interested in what I was studying. And ultimately, I did consistently well in both subjects and even topped my class in these subjects during the prelims.</p>
              <p>But doing well, or having interest, in any particular subject doesnt translate into a good career. I noticed that in the financial sector, there is a disproportionate amount of people with finance, law and accounting backgrounds. It's pretty undeniable that an arts degree plays second fiddle to professional degree when it comes to job search.</p>
              <p>Law does seemed interestng but the thing is I would never know if it would turn out to be something I hate tremendously. It sucks to see myself dragging my feet through 4 years of school reading something I dread. 4 years is alot of time and I need to make sure that what I'm studying is at least of marginal interest to me so I can be motivated to study. Once studying becomes a chore, I would tend to do badly in physics, as was the case during my physics A levels [Physics was my hated subject in JC].</p>
              <p>I'm really in a quandary and would appreciate if anyone could provide me with some wisdom, perspective or insight that have somehow eluded me one way or another.</p>

              <p>anyway, unless the job(s) you want in the future requires you to have a degree in law, what you get does not matter all that much. esp if it's just a bachelors degree...</p>

              <p>if it interests you, it is also no uncommon for economics grads to later take up a law degree and they usually perform well because of the rigorous training in analysis gained from an economics major. there is an emerging branch of economics that apply economic theory to law as well</p>

              <p>there's a reason y law onli take in the best candidates, that's because law concepts are very difficult to digest and highly philosophical, juz a simple contract law regarding promise for promise (consideration) can take weeks to understand, so pls don't touch it if u don't hav the passion, u can't last with just pragmatism.</p>
              <p>i hav frens who had exactly the same mindset as u, came into law fac, quit school after 2 wks and went overseas to study econs or biz, dat's becos law is a totally new realm of academic study, and u won't want to waste 4 yrs of yr life studying something u ar not interested in. Moreover u ar a guy, and already given 2 yrs to the army, u can't afford to waste anymore time.</p>
              <p>law is a very specific subject, if u think u can learn management skill, communication skills, finance, economics etc etc yada yada 'soft skills', then be prepared to be disappointed, cos most of the ppl who come in ar already excellent and confident speakers + writers(but not all make sense, lol), that's y there's no need to develop these skills</p>
              <p>it's juz law law law and nothing else, and u'll hardly get to apply the legal concepts unless u are a laywer. dat's y the legal profession has such a high attrition rate, cos ppl become disillusioned.dun make the same mistake, choose wisely, wif yr brain, not wif the wallet.

              never fail to elicit approving nods or even raise a few impressed
              eyebrows whenever I tell people [who ask] that I will be reading
              law in the near future.</p>
              <p>However, while serving NS, I struggled quite abit
              internally. Deep down, I have always been interested in the study
              of economics. Academic-wise, I have always performed well in
              mathematics and economics. However, everyone has been telling me
              that a social science degree is too "general" and doesnt provide
              solid career prospects unlike law. So far, very few, if any at all,
              have provided me with an alternate view.</p>
              <p>I really don't know whether to pursue my passion or be more
              pragmatic. I guess the reason why I'm skeptical about going to law
              school is <strong>not so much the lack of interest as the intense
              competition amongst law students. </strong> Ultimately, law
              school admits students who are academically strong [I'm not one of
              them though, just got lucky I guess] and the cohort size is small.
              After talking to students and law graduates, I have come to the
              conclusion that law school is tough and the competition is
              cutthroat.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, mathematics is to me what cooking is to chefs
              or what aeroplanes is to aerospace engineers. It comes just so
              naturally without the need to put myself through pain and misery.
              When I was studying mathematics or economics at school, I find
              myself enjoying the process without finding it laborious at
              all. In fact, without the need for external "push", I
              actually took the initiative to consult my tutors and
              source for information myself. Independent studying
              became so easy, and may I add, natural, when I was so
              interested in what I was studying. And ultimately, I did
              consistently well in both subjects and even topped my class in
              these subjects during the prelims.</p>
              <p>But doing well, or having interest, in any particular
              subject doesnt translate into a good career. I noticed that in
              the financial sector, there is a disproportionate amount of people
              with finance, law and accounting backgrounds. It's pretty
              undeniable that an arts degree plays second fiddle to professional
              degree when it comes to job search.</p>
              <p>Law does seemed interestng but the thing is I would never know
              if it would turn out to be something I hate tremendously. It sucks
              to see myself dragging my feet through 4 years of school reading
              something I dread. 4 years is alot of time and I need to make sure
              that what I'm studying is at least of marginal interest to me so I
              can be motivated to study. Once studying becomes a chore, I would
              tend to do badly in physics, as was the case during my physics A
              levels [Physics was my hated subject in JC].</p>
              <p>I'm really in a quandary and would appreciate if anyone could
              provide me with some wisdom, perspective or insight that have
              somehow eluded me one way or another.</p>

              <p>Law school is tough alrite.. lol.. trust no one. Well..unless u are up there with the pros that hang together, its pretty much a solo effort.</p>
              <p>Since u are good at mathematics , good at what u do. Why not ? at least u love what u do. Unless u really REALLY need a law degree for like a big plan or something. If u got no plan, just do what u like to do. Do it well. N when u come out, with ur good results n ur passion for ur subjects, i am sure there will be big companies that will hire you. Hire u for ur attitude too. ;p .</p>
              <p>There are good high earning economists out there la. U can even double major.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>
              <p>U do what u like first , then if u really wanna take up law later u still can and should be 'easier' in terms of concepts n stuff.If u are really as passionate, i think u wil have very good grades. Law school looknig at law subjects, they will also look at ur non-law subjects n see how u fare as well. So yeah.. Never too old to study man.. but then again, ;p Its up to you,.</p>

              <p>Hi all!</p>
              <p>Thanks for all your replies, very much appreciated!!</p>
              <p>The thing about studying economics is this. My future prospects is contingent upon securing good honours in economics, and it is a no guarantee. And if I end up like the 80-85% of NUS econs major who ends up with a normal degree/2nd lower/3rd class, my future is quite screwed, in every sense of the word. NUS is really very stingy when it comes to dishing out good honours.</p>
              <p>All things equal, a 2nd lower law degree is still better than a 2nd lower econs degree. Of course, I have confidence that I will excel in economics, barring any unforeseen circumstances. This is because of my strength in mathematics, and economics at university level is pretty much hardcore mathematics and nothing esle. But life <strong>is</strong> unpredictable and the past 20 years or so of my life has taught me this. I can't go into an economics major thinking for certain that I will get a 2nd uppers for sure. It's foolhardy and starry-eyed thinking.</p>
              <p>I totally agree that this country is covered in a malaise of pragmatism. I have seen too many of my friends giving up their interest [in the sciences and arts] to pursue practical degrees such as accountancy. Not that I have the right to criticize though, since I'm almost like one of them. I just don't know whether happiness is really a good barometer of success. Does happiness come about due to enjoying what one is doing, or due to having the financial ability i.e to be able to afford all the life's indulgences? I'm so scared that by the time I graduate as an economics major I will regret that I chose happiness over something that could put rice onto my table.</p>
              <p>I'm so vexed. Someone please knock some sense into me.</p>

              <p><br>It's ok, I'm more concern about you giving TS your biased advice than your any other posts/comments to me.</p>
              <p>I'm glad that TS has more options to consider before making his decision for his future. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Ohh...and passion is something that can be cultivated. Only people who have experienced/exposed in any field of work can confidently say they have developed a passion for that particular field of work.</p>
              <p>So your imaginative passion are just plain dreams borned out of minor kids. No wonder you say your passion isn't going to assure the achieving of greatness in any particular field of work.</p>
              <p>I can't blame you for things that you don't know right? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I do not like law .</p>
              <p>From my limited exposure to this subject . It has too many words and it works a lot on the law of precedence . So you got to read into lots of historical cases as references .</p>
