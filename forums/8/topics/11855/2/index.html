He says that firemen do have the authority to do anything to that car, but he does wonder, why didn't they just snake the hose around the car instead. However, let's assume you are right in deducing that car windows are hard. From studies of all materials, the harder the material, the stronger it is but more brittle. Let's say you string a screen of hard plastic across a window gap, and a screen of glass across a similar gap, break both with a hard swinging axe, does the chewing gum fly further or does the glass fly further?<br><br>As for the glass being inside and outside at the same time, when you hit a glass ball with a bat towards the south pole and it breaks into many pieces, do any of the fragments fly behind you or they generally still fly to the southward direction?<br><br>Just a few harmless and polite questions.<br><br>------------------<br>Honesty is the Worst policy when taking an exam in CME</div>
