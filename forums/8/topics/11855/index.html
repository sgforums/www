            <div class='col-md body'>punish??? hahah..please lah, firemen are not so childish lah. and its against the law to vandalise a private property esp since firemen are also legal authorities they shld know that!! the most they can do is to issue a summon or ticket to the car owner. just like if you see an ambulance and dont give way, they will simply take down your number plate and fine you for obstructing an emergency vehicle. the ambulance driver wont becos of that and purposely ram into your car just to "punish" you for blocking their way right??<br><br>also consider these...<br><br>1. its troublesome and waste time to smash the car's windows<br><br>2. its also dangerous as the shattered glass can hurt people<br><br>3. its foolish to pass run the hose along a layer of broken glass along the smashed windows since the glass might cut and damage the hose and cut off the water supply!<br></div>
