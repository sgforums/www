            <div class='col-md body'>Recently, i've heard of an interesting speculation that TT Durai was initially the PAP's candidate for the presidential election, but after the NKF scandal the PAP no choice, gotta axe him and allow nathan to run for re-election instead. That would explain the following phenomenon:<br><br>1) PAP protected TT Durai during the scandal<br>2) Nathan initially refused to say if he was running for the presidency, saying so only after this NKF scandal -&gt; He received the PAP endorsement only after the NKF affair?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway, Durai definitely qualifies to run, cos his NKF has more than $200 milllion.<br><br>Just imagine if his NKF crap hadn't come to light, people will all vote for him for being the 'saviour' of kidney failure and cancer patients, the greatest philanthropist in Singapore.<br></div>
