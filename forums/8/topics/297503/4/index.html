            <div class='col-md body'>Nikar2, let's get one thing right here.<br><br>No man is my god. This itself is a wild and baseless accusation borne out of your own assumption.<br><br>Secondly, while I believe that if you commit a crime here, you should do the time here, there is something called legislation.<br><br>Have you ever trained in Thailand and Taiwan? Have you ever gotten out of trouble during R&amp;R while training as a soldier? There are many stories and instances of our own fellows being "rescued".<br><br>It's a similar thing, except we may not have a public method of getting our boys out of a scrap. In any case, if you've already read the news for the past year, apparently assault in public without the use of a weapon is a non-seizable offence under our own Penal Code.<br><br>Thirdly, American servicemen are covered by a Status of Forces Agreement, which gives their military police priority in prosecution of any crime committed by the servicemember.<br><br>If you would go back to page 2, and look at Jetta's post about what this sailor could face back in his own ship, the punishment is far greater than if a Singaporean punches another man and <strong>will/may</strong> get away with it if the victim doesn't want to press charges in court under a Magistrate's complaint, and because he's got no money to find a lawyer, which is likely to happen.<br><br>Furthermore, if the victim wants to press charges, the sailor can be remanded for further investigation because these are issues covered under any treaty signed for military cooperation and training.<br><br>Read properly before you launch into a wild attack, because frankly, it does not help at all, and it has offended many people.<br><br>If you think fighting for your space in a queue is right, then you're no better than that sailor who punched a man because he cannot control himself. Don't get influenced by stereotypes that foreigners see us as compliant. Do you even personally know or have friends who are not Singaporean? It helps if you actually interact and think with a global mind, and not adopt a siege mentality.<br><br>Sure, we all have irritating habits, who the hell doesn't? It takes a real man to work around these and know when to call the common ground friendly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>US Navy says sorry to motorist punched by sailor<br><br>By David Boey and Carolyn Quek<br><br>THE United States Navy has apologised verbally to the motorist who was punched in the face and thrown against two cars in the Orchard Road shopping belt last Friday by an American sailor.<br><br>The American Embassy has also pledged that the US Navy sailor will have to face the music from his ship's commanding officer. If he is found "guilty", the sailor could have his pay, rank and other privileges docked.<br><br>'Under US military law, the Commanding Officer of the ship can impose any combination of any of the following: confinement, hard labour, restriction, loss of wages, loss of rank, and discharge - punitive or administrative. The disposition depends on the investigation,'' the spokesman told The Straits Times on Monday.<br><br>'Generally, these types of incidents result in punitive action with the member's career, liberty, and pay affected.'<br><br>Mr K.M. Ho, the motorist who was assaulted, said his lawyers are taking up his case with investigators from the US Navy's Naval Criminal Investigative Service.<br><br>If the matter goes to court, it will be at Mr Ho's expense and could amount to several thousand dollars.<br><br>The 36-year-old communications manager said he was looking for a parking lot for his Sports Utility Vehicle at the open carpark near Wheelock Place when someone knocked on his vehicle.<br><br>He said that when he got out of the driver's seat to check, a 1.8-metre tall black American confronted him with fists raised and yelled 'don't mess with me''.<br><br>Mr Ho said the man punched him so hard he needed four stiches to close the wound. He found out later the man is a US Navy sailor,<br><br>'I did not provoke him and did not retailiate. I asked him what was going on and was slugged in the face,'' said Mr Ho.<br><br>He received cuts on his nose and eyesight in his left eye remains slightly blurred, possibly due to internal bleeding. Mr Ho's SUV was also dented.<br><br>An eyewitness claimed the sailor, who was arrested by police after the incident, had caused a disturbance at the car park earlier and had locked himself in a woman's car.<br><br>Responding to The Straits Times queries, an American Embassy spokesman reaffirmed the US Navy's 'great appreciation for the laws and customs of Singapore'' and pledged that the sailor will have to answer charges under US military law.<br><br>The sailor cannot be named as investigations are on-going.<br><br>The US Embassy spokesman said the sailor is from the USS Tarawa, a 250-m long warship that carries helicopters, warplanes as well as armoured vehicles and landing craft.<br><br>The embassy added that sailors are briefed on Singapore's laws before they come ashore.<br><br>Among other things, they are briefed on 'social and cultural information, local laws and customs, recreational opportunities, and security and safety issues''<br><br>.<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/STIStory_187748.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/STIStory_187748.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Comment on the ST Article above.<br><br>As a retired US Navy officer I expect from my experience that this sailor will be certainly fined, be reduced a grade or two in rank, and because of the embarrassment he caused to both the Navy and an important US ally (Singapore) the next time he will get to leave the ship is when it pulls into port in San Diego...<br><br>Posted by: ChinaSailor at Tue Dec 18 00:43:30 SGT 2007</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Looks like he is a Mike Tyson beating up an unmatchable opponent (victim).  If the opponent was Lenox Lewis I wonder what the assailant will do considering that Lenox Lewis gave a complete &amp; total thrashing of Mike Tyson in a heavyweight title fight some time ago.<br><br>On a more serious note - I believe that after the investigations are completed, the victim will be compensated adequately, the sailor will be punished to a certain degree of severity &amp; there will be some media hype by the US authorities regarding their respect of the law, justice &amp; fairness &amp;  their sense of humanity to the whole world.
