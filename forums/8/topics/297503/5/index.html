Well then if that's the case it's perfectly fine to fight dirty but if say you get into a fistfight with someone then you gotta keep it clean.

If you decide to cross the line, it becomes a matter of getting in there, doing what it takes to get the job done and getting out.  A rule of fighting is that neither side will gain from a protracted battle, regardless of the scale of the fight - stretching it out or sticking around after it's over is simply a bad idea.</div>

The point of the fight is not to try to kill each other, when you say getting the job done you're making it sound like an assassination attempt. If everyone decided to use weapons then well it would just be gang fighting where people just pull out knives and guns and proceed to maim and kill each other. The whole point of a fistfight is to get the opposing person to back off. If I wanted to hurt someone then I'd use a weapon but that's not my intention, like the scenario above, I merely wanted to get him to back off without causing unecessary and potentially serious injury. What you're thinking of is the intentional harming of someone and sure if I wanted to do that then I'd use a weapon but I don't.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well u might be true, im just expanding it. Honestly i think fistfights only belong in the ring or before fists start flying both parties parley first and both agree on the terms of conditions of the fight like of days gone by when i was in school. When it comes to situations where its fluid and spontaneous, i think the main objective of the fight will decide how the fight is to be conducted in. And no i dont hate angmohs, i have some of them in my family and they are not representative of the white trash and i love them very much. But im espousing the golden rule of 'When in Rome, do like what the Romans do'.</div>
