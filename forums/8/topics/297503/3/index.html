            <div class='col-md body'>Can you stop behaving like an imbecile for once? Do you remember the guy who got his face bashed in by another S'porean and lost a few teeth? Or the woman who was attacked by a shopkeeper while attending to a cat? They were told to file a complaint too.<br><br>I think it's a silly concession to the culture of litigation but they've been consistent (except when Seng Thong Han was attacked). As for how he'll be dealt with, refer to Jetta's posts.<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Nikar2:</div><div class="quote_body">what really piss*ed me off is not the beating. it's the way our wimpy cops behave.<br><br>the local cops ask Ho to file a "Magistrate's Complaint" if he wish to pursue the case, as the local cops can't do much as this offence is considered "Voluntarily causing hurt" and is not a seizable offence.<br><br>KNN!!!!!!! beat people means beat people, some more the victim's S$500 specs and car was damaged, and the cops never do anything to arrest?<br><br>so that means, I, a 23-year old SG-Chinese citizen, can go into any mall and cause public unrest, push people down from escalators, pour acid onto people, use glass bottles from 7-11 to whack the staff's heads, and when local cops come to catch me, they'll release me 10 mins later and ask the victims to file "Magistrate's Complaint"??!!<br><br>so good sia! we all must try liao! maybe if we bleach our skin become white and do crazy acts in SG, we'll get away scot-free!!!!!!<br><br>WTH???!! is this opening favoring foreign talents, expats and colonial masters???!!! trash whores!!!!!!!!<br><br>u DO NOT ****ing come into our country to beat up someone randomly even if you're drunk.<br><br>13 years ago, US white trash Michael Fay got several strokes of the rotan for vandalism.<br>13 years later, some crazy US white crap sailor slam a guy 2 times onto the car making a big dent, and what's gonna happen to him??!!<br><br>will our gahmen shower him with apologies and kowtow to Bush and Condi Rice, and hang the portraits of Bush in the Istana and Parliament House???!!<br><br>and for those of you who think this ill-bred rascal will get justice, dream on.<br>there's been spates of rape cases in Okinawa / Japan and Phillipines where US  military guys are based. what happened to them? serve a darn short period of time in jail and enjoy life afterwards.<br><br>it's a total joke.<br>and guess what? the US gahmen have signed a treaty of Immunity with these countries, meaning that their soldiers, if they committ any offence, will AT THE VERY MOST, be charged under US laws, and local laws are no-effect against them.<br><br>if SG really got sign this kind of immunity contract or similar with these sailors, good luck, Mr. Ho.<br>the US navy will probably just say "Sorry that this has happened. We express utmost regret" and end of story.<br><br>meanwhile, 4 years down the road, some SG chick will probably get raped by some foreign personnel based in our ports.<br>local cops will come and say "Mr. USA Whiteman, this girl offered herself to you , right?" and the trash guy will say "oh yes, she offered herself to me".<br><br>END OF STORY.<br><br>(meanwhile, local cops continue to surf web and MSN in their cosy offices while the local SG gahmen continues to crackdown and sue it's own citizens, while at the same time, pampering anything which is white, foreign, expat....)<br><br>some tourism slogans for our gahmen and Tourism board to consider in their next year's marketing campaigns:<br><br>WELCOME TO SINGAPORE!!!!!!!<br>As long as you're white, anything goes!!!!!<br><br>SINGAPORE - The place where you abuse and rape - and get away scot-free! (provided you are not a local)<br><br>SINGAPORE 2008! Local laws doesn't apply!<br><br>i feel better now. if i were at the scene and i see this, i will grab the nearest fatal object and assault this guy form behind.<br>i'll blow up the whole thing into the US news, local news and internationally.<br>and those Okinawan, Korean, Phillipine and anti-American / anti-Bush folks will be sure to support me.</div></blockquote></div>

A similar thing happened to my friend and I.<br><br>We were walking back to his house from Clarke Quay when some locals started harrassing us, they wouldn't back off or stop after we told them nicely many times and when we started raising our voices one of them threw the first punch at my friend. Him being a fairly big guy completely turned it around on them and totally smashed him. Some locals who happened to be walking by saw what was happening and they just thought "ang moh beating up local, we must help!" and started attacking us.<br><br>Needless to say they ended up getting their dumb arses kicked for getting involved.
