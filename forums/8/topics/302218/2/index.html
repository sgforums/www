            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by the.owl:</div><div class="quote_body">u sure?</div></blockquote>Yep Romance of the 3 kingdoms is a novel written by Luo Guan Zhong and actually some of the incident in the novel did not happen in history. Luo Guan Zhong added a lot of details and highly dramatized it. If you are looking for the actual history, should refer to Chen Shou's Record of the 3 kingdoms.</div>
