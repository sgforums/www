            <div class='col-md body'>in singapore, things are such that as a couple, you will be better married than staying together / cohabitating. firstly , without marriage, you cant get a HDB flat...unless you are wealthy enough to get private properties or you dont mind staying with parents. secondly, if you ever think of having kids, you better get married rather than cohabit cos there will be a lot of problems in future, with registration of birth cert, society stigmatisation, etc.<br><br>In anyway, you dont have to have a lot of money to get married......in fact all you need is to pay for the registration cert which is less than $100. whether you hold a lavish wedding ceremony  or dinner is solely up to your own discretion / affordability.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When we meet the right person to love when we're at the right place, at the right time. That's chance.<br><br>When you meet someone you're attracted to, that's not a choice. That's chance. Being caught up in a spur of a moment (and there's a lot of couples who get together because of this) is not a choice, that's also chance.<br><br>The difference is, what happens afterward? When will you take that<br>infatuation, that crush, that mind-blowing attraction to the next level?<br><br>That's when all sanity goes back, you sit down and then contemplate whether you want to make this into a concrete relationship or just a fling or an affair......<br><br>If you decide to love the person, even with his faults, that's not chance. That's choice. When you choose to be with a person no matter what, that's choice. Even if you know there are many people out there who are more attractive, smarter, and richer than your mate, and yet, you decide to love your mate just the same, that's choice.<br><br>Infatuation, crushes, attraction comes to us by chance. But true love that last is truly a choice. A choice that we make.<br><br>Regarding soulmates, there's a beautiful movie quote that I believe is so true about this--"Fate brings you together, but it's still up to you to make it happen."<br><br>I do believe that soulmates do exist. That there is truly someone out there for you. But it's still up to you to make the choice if you're going to do something about it or not. We may meet our soulmates by chance, but loving and staying with our soulmate is still a choice we have to make.<br><br>Some people stay together (like our parents) and stick onto their choices no matter what happens and move on....<br><br>Some people (like our generation) call it quits once they make the wrong choice and also, they move on...........<br><br>At the end of the day, the path you are walking on today is a choice you made. There is no wrong or right...... To err is humane. Never look back and let the past choices made, bring you down to the pits. Leave them behind with your foot prints......<br><br>Lift your head high, face the world and walk with dignity as the path you are walking on today, is the choice you have made.<br><br></div>

The probability of a lasting r'ship may be greater.  They're willing to fight for wat they haf...  I'm generalising here, there're still exceptions.<br><br>Marriage, to me, is partly when u're prepared to fight &amp; stand up for ur r'ship, for the person u love, for both of u.  U go in without thinking tt divorce is an option; u take tt final commitment prepared to make it last happily for a lifetime.<br><br>If u're Not prepared, dun get married.  It's abt thinking for 2 (or more once children come into the pic).  It's No longer abt thinking for urself &amp; urself only : )<br><br>RP<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Inzaghi:</div><div class="quote_body">y not just sat as bf n gf can liao...y wanna get married n end up doing so many things to break up??..</div></blockquote></div>
