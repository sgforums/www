            <div class='col-md body'>I didn't think much of marriage actually. I still don't think I do. Reasons; marriage cannot and will not be a guarantee of commitment coz you can always file of a divorce. However I will want to get married for the obvious or not so obvious reasons. We live in a asian culture and as far as chinese are concern. You have to get at least ROM in order to live together. I believe in love and I believe that a loving couple should be living together and doing things together and enjoying each other's company. Therefore, getting married is the solution to this.<br><br>Another reason of course is to be able to have kids legally lah. This is rather obvious lor being in Singapore you can't just have kids without getting married. Anyway I don't think its a bad idea to get married lor but just have to remind yourself that marriage is not to tied you down with the piece of paper u have signed on but rather a way to opening declare your love for your partner and being able to live and share life together.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
