One has to work based on knowledge and experience to achieve something that's not done before.<br><br>What I mean is.....<br>An undergraduate degree holder may be fresh out and do not have experience. But he'll be able to catch up on that sooner or later.<br><br>A graduate degree holder will have clocked his experience while doing research. He has to work with/for the industry within the confines of limited funds and time and with minimal guidance.<br><br>I do not think degrees are overrated. But with so many MM degree courses springing all over and training less rigourous as the mainstream courses, it's little wonder that the course do not train compentant workers these days.</div></blockquote>I would love to include a third guy with what you mentioned, but when I am comparing between A and B, I am taking out the most obvious pros and cons of A and B. It's to prove a point rather than putting down either of them. When you ask someone if they prefer apple or orange, the person will likely consider why they want apple or why they prefer orange, of course the person can always say they prefer pineapple, but that's not the point of the question. That's why I did not include the third guy.

The reason what prompts me to wrote what I did, is after my experiences with working with different levels of people. I have the priviledge of working with really smart people with really high education and some really stupid people with even higher paper qualifications. I'm not talking about degrees here, I'm also talking about Masters (can you believe it!!), occassionally me and my friends from the same company will go dinner together and we talk about if these people bought their certificates. For example, I was asking this lady to create a database for the company, she had just graduated from her Masters programme and recently joined my company, guess what, the database ended up named "Example". So imagine the horror when the programmers go to code the files and put things like, "Connection.Open Example", or during a meeting, the programmers say, "You need to connect to example, then retrieve the records from Example...". Fortunately, some guy informed us and we managed to put things back in order. In my post, I was merely comparing hands on experience with paper qualifications, and because I have experienced lots of horror stories before that's what prompts me to think differently now. When someone tells me they have a high education, I'm no longer taking for granted that he is more capable than anybody else.<br><br>Another example, one day the company's website was hacked. And of course, the boss is extremely frantic about it. Fortunately, the hacker was a security administrator, employed by a third party client to test the security of the system, so not much damage was done but because the hacker was not employed by us, they refuse to reveal on the system loophole. In any case, the boss got all the programmers to check on the problem. There were about 8 programmers, out of whom, 5 had degrees, 1 Masters student and 2 were diploma qualified. In the end, the diploma guy saved the day and emerged the hero. When asked how he knew how to resolve the hacking issue, he just casually mentioned he has experience this before. By right, everyone expect the degree programmers to lead by example, but in this case, reality has proven the common sense may not be so common afterall.<br><br>Of course if you ask me, to choose between a Ph.D student or a PSLE student, assuming both had nil experience, I would likely go for the Ph.D student, it would have been a better bet, but that's not my question if you read my post carefully. My question is comparing abilities and paper qualifications, that's my point mainly. Once again, I wrote what I did, not because I did it for fun, but it's partly due to the comedies that happened before, and I still laugh about it today.</div>

But the thing is in the gahmen sector it is a totally different story. To get entry, you basically need a certificate! Once you are in, you lead and co-ordinate with vendors outside to do the job.

But the thing is in the gahmen sector it is a totally different story. To get entry, you basically need a certificate! Once you are in, you lead and co-ordinate with vendors outside to do the job. Your job is to ensure they do the job properly. It does not mean you know how to do the job cuz that is not valued after. They want your management skills as they value this as more important than hands on skills. They put management skills one cut above technical skills.<br><br>So you can't really fault ppl from taking degree or higher education cuz they want to move to such arena which IMO is money more easier to earn in the comfort of air con and you get to order ppl to do work. You get a sense of being a boss. Not to mention the excellent welfare and benefits who will not be shaken?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>PS... there was once I heard a saying private firm ppl not that willing to employ a former gahmen sector employees for certain job scope as their dealings with them told them they are more of NATO character ppl. </div></blockquote>Thats why geh meh people died died dun wan to go work in private sector once they are in geh meh jobs, cause they may have the knowledge but they dun have the skill.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

You perform jobs same as vendor outside. You gotta showcast your strong points. NATO not really a favored strong point in private sector unless you are applying for middle to high level management post  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
