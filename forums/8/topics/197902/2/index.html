But if you are a scholar u are so much better off in the public sector cuz basically your career path are planned for you and unless you break law and drop into police case, you are virtually guaranteed an almost life-time of job stability and MONEY!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Can you imagine a 30+ years old guy assuming some SUPER high position management position without even battling for it?

Of cuz for some discipline you need qualification but at least for IT there is no professional body to get certified so if you tink you can do programming, you are very much welcomed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
