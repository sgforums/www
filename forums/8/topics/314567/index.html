              <p>PHISHING, trolling and web bugs may sound like fishing trip experiences but, if you come across them, they signal trouble - online, that is.</p>
              <p>The Internet has definitely changed the way we do things; it has improved our lives. However, nothing is without its pitfalls, and cyberspace is no exception.</p>
              <p>Phishing refers to Internet scams whereby e-mails are sent purportedly from banks or other companies, asking users for sensitive personal information, which are then used in identity thefts.</p>
              <p>
              
              Trolling is when someone uses specific phrases in a chat group to "bait" and target people who respond in a certain way.</p>
              <p>Web bugs are tiny image files that contain programmes that install themselves undetected on your computer and transfer information back to the source.</p>
              <p>Other dangers include cyber-stalking, extortion and harassment.</p>
              <p>It appears that women tend to face more of such threats. This was disclosed during a recent Safety Bytes Coffee Session hosted by software solution provider Symantec Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Women go online to engage in a host of activities - obtain information, do research, chat, blog, e-mail or shop. They are also more likely than men to start and maintain personal blogs as forums of self-expression or to highlight specific causes.</p>
              <p>Social networking and online dating are also popular with women, activities which also easily expose them to sexual harassment and other forms of threat.</p>
              <p>According to the US Department of Justice, one in 12 women will be victims of cyber stalking in their lifetime.</p>
              <p>A 2006 University of Maryland study on chat rooms found that female participants received 25 times as many sexually explicit and malicious messages as males.</p>
              <p>In March 2007, software and game developer Kathy Sierra received derogatory remarks and death threats on her technology blog, Creating Passionate Users, which she co-authors.</p>
              <p>The final straw came when a photo-shopped image of Sierra next to a noose was published on another website. She suspended her blog after that.</p>
              <p>Sierra told BBC that she believed the campaign against her was more likely because she was a woman in the male-dominated technology world.</p>
              <p>Many women use pseudonyms in their blogs as a way of protecting themselves. However, as long as a name is female-sounding, women bloggers are still easy targets.</p>
              <p>With photo-sharing and picture uploads being another popular online practice these days, women are also open to sexist remarks or other forms of abuse or misrepresentation.</p>
              <p>In Malaysia last month, it was reported that a woman who had posted her photograph in Friendster two years ago found that another woman used that picture to introduce herself to a man online and later extort him.</p>
              <p>Effendy Ibrahim, Norton Business Lead, Asia South Region from Symantec, said the Internet seems to be more popular with women worldwide.</p>
              <p>"The Internet provides an avenue to exchange concerns, opinions and perceptions using new technology. Also, women have longer attention spans," said Effendy, who moderated the Safety Bytes session.</p>
              <p>Guest speaker at the session, Datin Paduka Marina Mahathir, admitted to being one of those "mad Internet users" who is constantly on e-mail, Skype or Facebook.</p>
              <p>Marina also maintains a blog (rantingsbymm.blogspot.com), performs online banking and chats or e-mails using her Blackberry.</p>
              <p>"I guess I'm very much into the online world, which really suits me and what I do very well," said Marina, who has been blogging for 16 months.</p>
              <p>However, being a public figure by virtue of what she does and who she is, she shared that she tends to receive unpleasant messages online.</p>
              <p>"People have sent nasty comments directed at me as an indirect target. (In the past) I also became collateral damage depending on the political climate out there," said Marina.</p>
              <p>Once, she had a cyber stalker who sent her weird, nonsensical e-mail.</p>
              <p>"I chose not to respond to the e-mail messages," she said, adding that responding was a form of engaging the sender.</p>
              <p>"My e-mail does not have my name so they cannot really confirm that it is me," she said.</p>
              <p>Later, the stalker also got hold of her office telephone and fax number.</p>
              <p>"Fortunately, I didn't pick up the calls directly. However, I never really felt threatened because I knew he was harmless," she said.</p>
              <p>Marina is also on Facebook, one of the latest social networking sites.</p>
              <p>"Facebook is a really interesting phenomenon. Among other things, it creates communities around particular causes," she said.</p>
              <p>However, to protect herself from being a target of hate mail or other threats, she sets her Facebook account on very high privacy levels. Marina added that her daughter also has a blog; to protect her privacy, people can only view it by invitation only.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes, users post up profiles, which may contain very private information, without realising that it goes out to all their friends," said Marina, who has about 200 friends in Facebook.</p>
              <p>Effendy said, "Privacy settings are probably the last thing that people think of on Facebook."</p>
              <p>He also cautioned people against carrying out online transactions in Wifi settings as users would be susceptible to info theft.</p>
              <p>"And if you have very important and private data, save them on external hard discs or CDs, not on your PC's main (C) drive."</p>
              <p><strong>Online safeguards</strong></p>
              <p>ACCORDING to the Malaysian Household Use of The Internet Survey 2006 conducted by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), women comprise 47% of home Internet users.</p>
              <p>The survey found that as of September 2006, there were 13.5mil Internet users in the country. The top five activities on the Internet were getting information (84.5%), communication by text (e-mail, chat room, instant messaging: 80.7%), leisure in the form of music, video or games (52.6%), formal or informal education (45.9%), and financial activities such as e-banking (23.6%).</p>
              <p>From the study, it was found that 86.6% expressed varying degrees of concern about online security, including concerns like identity thefts, spam, viruses, worms and trojans.</p>
              <p>Here are some safety tips:</p>
              <p>1. Set security features on your browser.</p>
              <p>2. Protect your password.</p>
              <p>3. Secure your wireless network.</p>
              <p>4. Protect your own data.</p>
              <p>5. Watch out for social engineering (non-technical methods of getting personal information from someone).</p>
              <p>6. Update your tech knowledge.</p>
              <p>7. Use common sense in safe Internet practices at all times.</p>
