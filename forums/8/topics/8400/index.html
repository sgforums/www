            <div class='col-md body'>I have always been fascinated by those fantasy novels, like Dragon Lance, whereby there is this guy who writes history as it happens. It must have been cool being a guy like that, being in the beginning of time, all the way to the end, witnessing every single moment happen, viewing every single fights and battles, listening to every drop of tears.<br><br>And also those older Chinese movies, whereby there is this Book Of Life in heaven, and everything that is going to happen is written in this Book of Life. Just like everything that will happen has already been written into the Book of Life since the beginning of time.<br><br>Well, significance of the question??? It also boils down to this. Do you believe in fate??? Do you believe that everything in life is predestined??? You do, if you believe that history is ordered. However, if you believe that history is random, well, you refuse to succumb to fate. You believe that you can change history, you can make history.<br><br>Regarding learning from history, well, history will always repeat itself in the most unfashionable way. I don't know why. I don't have an explanation for that. So I guess hitting the history books would be a good start for all right??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Better not say too much yet.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Revey,<br><br>I don't know whether that history do existed. In the Hegelian sense, there are two kinds of history, the objective history where the exact events are narrated and subjective history where the events are romanticised or even biased towards a certain nation.<br><br>In the spirit of Oscar Wilde, I would quote him on his view about history, "Anyone can make history. Only a great man can write it.... The one duty we owe to history is to rewrite it." In many instances, we glorified many conquerors who are actually murderers who started the bloodshed. The rise and fall of civilizations has given us the narrative history of what happened, but the justifications of what really happened, that should be read in a pinch of salt.<br><br>A historian once told me in the college, that the first day of his undergraduate lecture, his History professor started the first lecture by saying,"There is no such thing as history."

            <div class='col-md body'>ah proddy,<br><br>coming from the post-structuralist school myself i'm not too sure about objective history. hegel is great but wasn't he the one who said govts and institutions were the evolved highest order of civic man? a quick glance around the world today will prove him wrong. ok ok, he was writing to please the Prussian govet at that time but still....<br><br>revy,<br><br>in foucauldian theory, the dialectic between 'will to power' and effect is deeply unstable. within every discourse or event in themselves are little struggles of power which play out according to no affixed pattern whatsoever. the 'will to power' may be in place, i.e. there may some intention for particular effect of event, but agents involved in discourse demonstrate autonomy from time to time.<br><br>at the end, it is true only the victors write history, but it is very important to realise History (with a capital H) is not some teleological trail that can always explain contemporary circumstance and events. when it does this too often, it is time we get suspicious.<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday was history. Today is the present. Tomorrow will be the future.<br><br>What happens today depends on what happened yesterday and what will happen tomorrow will depend on what happens today. So, they are all dependent events.<br><br>In a certain sense, these events can be controlled by a person. On the other hand, they are sometimes "beyond our control". Sounds contradictory? Seems to be, but I don't know how else to put it across.<br><br>It might be ordered, may be random. I guess it depends on your perspective.</div>
