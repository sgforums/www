            <div class='col-md body'>Was from RSAF. Is really a good place to grow up. But be sure what you want in life. Is a ten year contract and many things can change. Many have left the RSAF because many servicemen contracts were not renewed.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually,it is good to work now to get some experience since it is something money cant buy.<br>But you dont really have to work,you can take this opportunity to read more books,surf net for more information,widen your general knowledge etc.....They are just as fruitful as working.It might not be now but it might in the future.Best is to read up something which you think u will be doing in the future.<br>And of course,take it as a holiday before your real working life start.<br><br></div>
