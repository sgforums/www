            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Our famous journalist Cherry N. George interviews an Ah Beng on the true motivations of their carrying a handphone and refusing to put it to silent mode despite having such a facility available.<br><br>Hello talkcockers!! This is your favourite journalist Cherry N. George! This week I have with me Mr. Beng, your typical handphone carrying Ah Beng to talk to us about the reasons why they carry such mobile equipment when they rarely need it. We'll look into the motivations and psychological reasoning behind this phenomena. </strong><br><br><strong>Cherry N</strong>: A warm welcome to Talkingcock.com, Mr. Beng. I'll try to speak in Singlish so that I can get my point across and please feel free to speak in whatever way that makes you feel comfortable. No need to speak Queen's English, lah! Okay or not?<br><br><strong>Mr. Beng</strong>: Okay lor! You want to ask question, I no scared one, ah! Cheem question I orso can answer one, ah! Ask lah!<br><br><strong>Cherry N</strong>: I was wondering, why is it that Bengs carry handphones when you people don't really need it?<br><br><strong>Mr. Beng</strong>: Well, Cherry N, that is a si beh smart observation. Actually we don't really need the handphones. If you see us Bengs, our conversations don'ch last more than 20 seconds. This is to take advantage of the free incoming calls provided by our mobile phone company. When we answer our calls in the MRT, we just pick up the phone and say "Wei? I at Bishan MRT Station. OK. Bye bye". We don'ch really talk about anything other than where we are located at the moment. The purpose of our handphone is just to let our friends know where we are at any time of the day. We never speak about more serious issues like business, stock market, etc. over the handphone.<br><br><strong>Cherry N</strong>: Isn't that a little absurd? Getting a handphone and then the topic of conversation is always where your location is?<br><br><strong>Mr. Beng</strong>: Yes, but there is a deeper psychologicur reasoning as to why we carry handphones and it is because we are suffering from very low self-esteem. Carrying a handphone makes us feel important. I mean if some one calls you over your handphone, people will think that you must be some big shot. That is why our handphone is set to ring very loudly so that other people will notice that we are receiving a call even though we have the vibration alert mode. Also we never buy the small handphone that can fit in our pocket. Then people will think we don't have a handphone at all. We always buy the kind where we have to carry it in our hand and show to the world that we got a handphone.<br><br><strong>Cherry N</strong>: I also notice that particularly the Bengs, your handphone always has some special features, like the antenna will flicker with light or the dial face has strobe lights like a Las Vegas casino! Why is that?<br><br><strong>Mr. Beng</strong>: Yes, correck! We Bengs put additional features into our handphone just to attract attention. As I said before, we are people of low self-esteem and we need high-tech gadgets to make us feel less inferior. In fact my handphone lights up like an airport runway when I switch it on and when I receive a call. <span style="color: red;">In fact an RSAF Skyhawk fighter plane almost crashed last night when it mistook my handphone for the Paya Lebar Airport runway</span> <span style="color: blue;">(kopi's comment : HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!). </span>Luckily, the pilot used his afterburners and was able escape the crash. And my friend retrofitted his handphone antenna to light up like a police car siren. And guess what? One lady approached him and said she wanted to know how to lodge a Police Report.<br><br><strong>Cherry N</strong>: I see!! So the root cause of all this is the low self-esteem of the Bengs!!! I get it. But, I was wondering why do you people now switch off your handphones in the theatres? Why the sudden change?<br><br><strong>Mr. Beng</strong>: Well, again, we want the world to know that we are important people so we refuse to put our handphone to silent mode. But ever since that chao lawyer kena whack up-side down in the theater and our Ah Beng brothers kenna rotan, we all lan lan lor. Have to switch off the handphone.<br><br><strong>Cherry N</strong>: So you Bengs will continue to let your handphones ring loudly to make people think you are important?<br><br><strong>Mr. Beng</strong>: Wah lau eh! Nothing wrong, what! You and your Bangladeshi people also use handphone like that, what! But your people use it for a different purpose: So that Singaporeans don't think they are illegal workers without a work permit. I mean have you ever seen a Bangladeshi worker's handphone ring? Ever or not? Never mah!!! That's because their handphone got no SIM Card! They buy the phone from Serangoon Road for $9.00 wan! So we Bengs are not the only people who use handphones for the ulterior motive of elevating our social status!<br><br><strong>Cherry N</strong>: Er, this is the second time I'm being mistaken for a Bangladeshi! For the record I'm of Sikh-Tamil parentage. Opposition party member Mr. Ling How Doong made that same mistake in a previous interview, but I guess all Bengs make that mistake about me. We've just plain run out of time, I'd like to thank Mr. Beng for being so candid in this interview. I'm Cherry N. George, for Talkingcock.com, signing off. And remember, never be economical with the truth!!!</div>
