            <div class='col-md body'><strong> How To Avoid Being an Asshole</strong><br><br><strong>Face your past.</strong><br><br>The past is a very good predictor of future behavior. For example, were you a bully in school? If your parents and siblings were assholes, you may have caught the disease. Knowing that youÂ’re an asshole is first step towards change.<br><br><strong>Do not make people feel oppressed, humiliated, de-energized, or belittled.</strong><br><br>If you find yourself having these effects, itÂ’s time to change your behavior no matter what you think of yourself.<br><br><strong>Do not mistreat people who are less powerful than you.</strong><br><br>One of the sure signs of an asshole is treating people like clerks, flight attendants, and waiters in a degrading manner.<br><br><strong>[b]Resist assholeholics from the start.</strong><br><br>The easiest time to avoid becoming an asshole is at the very beginning. DonÂ’t think that you can do Â“what you have toÂ” to fit in and can change later. It wonÂ’t happen.<br><br><strong>Walk away and stay away.</strong><br><br>DonÂ’t be afraid to leave a bad situation. ItÂ’s unlikely youÂ’ll change the assholes into good people; itÂ’s much more likely that youÂ’ll descend to their level.<br><br><strong>View acting like an asshole as a communicable disease.</strong><br><br>If you have any sense of decency, when youÂ’re sick, you avoid contact to prevent spreading the disease. So if you act like an asshole, youÂ’re not just impacting yourself; youÂ’re also teaching other people that itÂ’s okay to be an asshole.<br><br><strong>Focus on win-win.</strong><br><br>Children (young and old) think that the world is a zero-sum game. If another kid is playing with the fire truck, you canÂ’t. As people get older they should realize that life doesnÂ’t have to be a win-lose proposition--unless, that is, youÂ’re an asshole.<br><br><strong>Focus on ways you are no better or even worse than others.</strong><br><br>Thinking that youÂ’re smarter, faster, better looking, funnier, whatever than others turns people into assholes. Thinking that youÂ’re no better or even worse keeps you humble.<br><br><strong>Focus on ways you are similar to people, not different.</strong><br><br>If you concentrate on how you and others have similar goals, desires, and passions, youÂ’re bound to be less of an asshole. How can you treat people that are similar to you with disdain?<br><br><strong>Tell yourself, Â“I have enough stuff (money, toys, friends, cars, whatever).Â”</strong><br><br>Discontentment and envy is a major factor in becoming an asshole. If youÂ’re happy, thereÂ’s no reason to stomp on others.<br><br><strong>How to Deal With Assholes</strong><br><br><strong>Hope for the best, but expect the worst.</strong><br><br>One of the most frustrating aspects of dealing with assholes is that they disappoint you--making you wonder the very value of humans. Lowering your expectations can help reduce disappointment. DonÂ’t solely lower your expectations, though, or you will slip into cynicism (and possibly turn into an asshole too.) Continue to hope for the best.<br><br><strong>Develop indifference and emotional detachment.</strong><br><br>Sutton may be the only author who has the insight and courage to recommend that being indifferent and detached may be a good thing in work environments. If it permits you to survive, then it is. In other words, donÂ’t let the jerks get to you.<br><br><strong>Look for small wins.</strong><br><br>Small victories can keep you going. Most assholes pride themselves in total control and absolute domination. Any victory, no matter how small, can keep you going. Rest assured that small victories can lead to winning the war.<br><br><strong>Limit your exposure.</strong><br><br>You can do what you can to avoid meetings and interactions with assholes. This involves finding or building pockets of Â“safety, support, and sanity,Â” to use SuttonÂ’s words. He cites an example of a nurseÂ’s lounge as a refuge from an asshole doctor.<br><br><strong>Expose them.</strong><br><br>In SuttonÂ’s blog he mentions MargeÂ’s Asshole Management Metric. This refers to four-point system from 0 to 3. Marge, the boss, would point to people who were behaving like assholes and hold up one, two, or three fingers according to this code:<br>*<br><br>1 = You are a normal person who can occasionally assert yourself on an issue you are passionate about, but you handle yourself in a non-confrontational way in nearly all occasions.<br>*<br><br>2 = You can consistently assert yourself in a non-confrontational way and are occasionally an asshole, but you feel horrible about it afterwards, and you may or may not apologize (but you probably will have to confess your remorse to someone).<br>*<br><br>3 = You can consistently be an asshole and you either do not recognize this or you simply enjoy it.<br><br>By the way, 0 in her system means this:<br><br>You are a very nice person, and very passive. No one can say a word against you and would never think to call you an asshole.<br><br>If you are safe in your position, then calling assholes out is a good way to deal with them.<br><br><strong>De-escalate and re-educate.</strong><br><br>This strategy requires that the asshole youÂ’re dealing with isnÂ’t a Â“chronic,Â” Â“certified,Â” and Â“flagrantÂ” asshole. It means meeting asshole behavior with calmness (instead of either similar behavior or fear) and trying to re-educate the person about how heÂ’s behaving.<br><br><strong>Stand up to them.</strong><br><br>Funny thing about assholes: Standing up to them shouldnÂ’t necessarily scare you. While I was an Apple employee, I was in a meeting with a highly placed Apple exec and AppleÂ’s ad agency. The ad agency person showed the new television spots and said heÂ’d give a copy to the Apple exec and me. The Apple exec told the agency person not to give one to me. I spoke up: Â“Are you saying you donÂ’t trust me?Â” The Apple exec answered: Â“Yes.Â” To which I replied, Â“ThatÂ’s okay because I donÂ’t trust you either.Â” You know what? The sun rose the next day, and my family still loved me.<br></div>
