            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all. My uncle, the young owner of a pet shop, has passed away due to stroke and kidney problems. He has left behind a pet shop that specialises in Husky. His mum has decided to let go of the shop. However, there are two husky which fate is ???? One of them is my uncle's own and precious pet, a champion in many competitions. Do help out to look for buyers of these two dogs. They are 'husband and wife' so must be sold together. My uncle's husky has not been eating well since the day my uncle was in coma. Also, if you know of any pet shop which we can put our products on consignments , let me know<br><br>Many Many thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br><img src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g239/crystalll_photos/Image009.jpg"></div>
