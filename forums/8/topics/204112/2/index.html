Singapore traffic condition and behaviour is consider far,far,far better than what i mention....</div></blockquote>I dun know much about the western countries, but when i was in bangkok, this is what i noticed: the traffic conditions and layout of the roads were expectedly worse than S'pore, but the drivers seemed much more patient (or perhaps resigned haha) &amp; courteous. When the driver (private car) dropped us off somewhere in the middle of the road, the cars behind just waited patiently... apparently the culture is such that many others also alight at various junctions etc... if it was S'pore, u could bet the horns would be blasting off  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Trust me.. I have stayed there for more then 10 years.. =) You would have only seen for a few days.. I have seen it for years. Courteousness is way better in India then compared to Singapore. In fact the point of comparison doesn't arise. Period.</div>
