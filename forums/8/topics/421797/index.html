              <p>LOL,  I dropped my pant when I was keeping my laundry and it landed on the 13th floor ( I live on the fifteen).  I look down and saw an old indian woman taking the pant in.  I thought since it is raining, she might be keeping it from the rain.  30 mins later, I send my son down to collect it.  No one answer the call.   In the evening I went down again and knock on the door and still no one answer.  Later in the night I went down again and still no one answer so I left a note asking that they leave my pant outside their house and I will collect it the next day. </p>
              <p>The next day, there were no pant so I knock.  I heard the TV was on so I know harder.  Still no one answer the door.  I returned the next day and still no pant outside the house except a note to say there is nothing in the house and their windows is always closed.  I replied and told them that I saw an indian woman took the pant.  I further asked if they are Indian if not I am sorry, other wise please return the pant.  Still no answer.</p>
              <p>Till this day they had not returned my pant, wonder if it is Indian culture to keep people pant or they are too poor to return. </p>

              <p>Did you drop your pants or panty?What color if its a panty? Anyways you stupid twat, Just because someone doesnt want to return your pants, You want to be critical to the whole community.. Stup the fark up and go back to the hole you crawl out from. Stereotype, arrongant and extremly narrow minded person you are. So let me guess you are yellow colored?</p>

              <p>Even though TS sound racist and I do not support racism, but when posts relating to other forms of "-ism" do you (referring to above 2nd floor and 3rd floor posters) react as enthusiastically?</p>
              <p>It seems Singaporeans are very quick to point out racism or religionism,  but when it comes to social biasedness, do we react as emotionally or as fast?  (example: if someone criticise the whole army or any certain industry out there because of someone's mistake, do u rise up as fast to defend?)</p>

              <p>There was no racism intended and I just relate what I experience, why are you people so quick to jump to conculdtion&gt;?  If is was a Chinese who bring in the pant, I would say so and will I be branded racism or traitor? </p>
              <p>I am just wondering why someone would want to keep the pant which is old?  The fact is that I had just altered the pants and a lot of time spent on doing it as I am not a tailor.  It's all the effort that went down the drain.</p>
              <p>I am no angmoh and see no reason to write ang moh standard of English.  As long as fellow Singaporean understand that is ok. </p>
              <p>That gUms can go start finding his or her own hole first before critising people.   I am wondering which hole he comes out in the first place.</p>

              <p>When I say, I wonder if it is a Indian Culture, I really do not know their culture.  Could be if something that come into my boundry it is mine?  Then again, it could be greed that make them keep it or that they are too poor and tried to keep whatever they can get, like the garung guni man.    Maybe I did not make myself clear or I had failed to do.  My apology then.</p>
              <p>PS.  I don't want to say this but I find you very arrognant,  How you know you come from your mum CB?  Have you check with her?  Don't be surprised it may be the other hole you come from and thus behave like this..</p>
