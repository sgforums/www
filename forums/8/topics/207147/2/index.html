But my guess is that she is trying to make the point that <strong>it is not explicitly written in the law that it is illegal to rape your own wife even though the penal code should be interpretated so</strong> So maybe she wants an additional section that specifically says that it is considered a rape even if it is done on your own wife.<br>I'm not a legal expert, but if there's a legal worker viewing this, could you tell us if there's any precedent of convicted wife rape in Singapore?</div>

Marriage is definitely not license for sex. The license for sex is mutual consent, with or without marriage. The license is a one off thingy and therefore consent(either explicit or subtle) must be sorted every time b4 sex.<br><br>Rape is also not just about sex, it is about dominance over the victim.
