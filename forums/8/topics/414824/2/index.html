              <p>The media can impact on anyone no matter the gender or race.</p>
              <p>It might be senseless to put the blame on it. At the same time would it look senseless at all if everyone can in one way or another be manipulated by it be it in a good way or bad?</p>
              <p>The thing I wouldn't blame the media on is gangsterism.<br>Gangsterism is like MLM. They do not advertise their organisations publicly on posters. They do so discretely. They're more like a pandemic.</p>

              <p>Personally, from my experience as their nos 3, I do not think Movies and TV affect our action, its is much more of parenthood in concern.

So, somehow, i grew up not knowing what was right or wrong, kick men and wallop them who mistreated our sisters, we also get paid for helping girls who are being bullied by husbands or bfs. Everytime we whack or chop a guy who do bad to his gfs or wifeys, we felt very happy, like Goddness and heroine being worshipped.</p>
