            <div class='col-md body'>ok, me wanna correct one mistake, it is called either IN the money or OUT the money, no AT the money!!!!<br>Call Option: right but not the obligation to buy..exercise this if strike price is below market value (IN money), don't exercise in opp direction (OUT money) but lose out on option premium paid<br>Put Option: right but not the obligation to sell..exercise when strike price is higher than market value (IN money), don't exercise in opp direction (OUT money) but gain on option premium received...<br>warrant are usually attached with issue of bonds to make the bond look more attractive to investors... u can detached the warrant and sell it to the market or hold it..usually warrant got an expiry date and give u an option to buy the company shares at a certain price...of course u will exercise the option if the market value of the company share is higher than what u can buy from the warrant contract...if this happen, then IN the money cos u buy at lower price and sell to the market at higher price...<br>Right issue usually give to existing shareholders at a discount...so u can sell it to the market and earn the profit, so is called IN the money<br>Note: if u're interested in this derivatives, read books like Advance Financial Accounting, or accounting for financial instruments...or give me a mail</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks Alex.<br>I'm aware of the different definitions. According to my understanding, "At the money" refers to the stage whereby the spot price is equals to the  exercise price.<br>My main query lies in "Why are rights offerings offered IN the money when options are usually offered OUT or In the money?" The only reason I can think of is that when companies do that, they are trying to raise funds. So to make the offering attractive, they have to issue it IN the money else nobody will demand it. Are there any other reasons?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi light,<br><br>would really like to help, but my grasp of options is quite bad..won't be answering your qn directly, but to raise one more point.<br><br>i think u r rite in saying that by offering the rights in-the-money, it's to make it attractive so that there will be demand. but i think whether in/at/out-of-money, this value is actually captured in the premium, that is the price you have to pay for the rights, so actually it does not really matter.<br><br>hope this is correct..quite bad at this.<br><br>sparkle.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks sparkle.<br>My knowledge of options is terrible as well.<br>This qn was posed to us by a tutor and we have got reasons to believe that it might be related to the exams. However none of us so far has been able to come up with a satisfactory answer. Tried looking in Finance books as well but not much results  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>Thanks anyway  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It depends on the warrant rite? If it is an European style warrant, then issuing it a discount i.e in the money will not be a problem. 1. The warrant cannot be exercised yet, so the earnings per share will not be grossly diluted. 2. The premium will act as a plus to draw investors to subscribe for their shares.<br><br>On the other side on the coin, I don't think an American Style warrrant would be issued a t a discount. A very good example would be the recently issued Pacific Century warrant by Merrill Lynch. The exercise price for the warrant is $24.90 when the parent stock is $29.00. Looks like 'in the money' rite? On closer look, you need 10 warrants to convert to the parent stock and 1,000 warrants cost you abt $1,100. This means that, in fact, to be 'at the money', the share price needs to appreciate to $34++, which means that foolhardy investors like myself pays a hefty premium for this out of money warrant!<br><br>Worse thing is that I forgot to EPS for it, tomorrow broker going to force sell for me. $&amp;^%&amp;##%^!!<br><br>BTW, light, u happen to be in NTU as well?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok, u pple got a serious misunderstanding about what is option!!!! it is NOT a instruments to raise $$$$ for the company...Option is one among 4 derivatives (ie, forwards, futures, options &amp; swaps). it is a tool used for risk management...to used it to hedge ur position that are exposed to market fluctuation!!!! so when the option are bought or sold, there is no way to know is it IN the money or OUT the money....<br>whereas bonds, sharrs or the so called right issue are used to raise funds...<br>hope my explanation make it very clear to u ppl, esp options...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alex, I do agree that we do not know the price at expiry. But as Sparkle has pointed out, my qn is aimed at comparing the present market price vs the strike price on the rights issue at time of issue. To be more exact, the qn is "why is the strike px on the rights offering lower than the current mkt price?" What are the reasons behind that move?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok, u wanna know where right issue price is always lower than market price: basically two answers:<br>1) to reward the existing shareholders without paying out dividends or issue bonus shares to the existiing shareholders and at the same time able to generate more cash.<br>2) as it is offered to the existing shareholders, right  issue will not dilute the group of shareholders..u must know that if there are more new shareholders, their expection from the board may be different...<br>so, have i answered ur questions?????</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After a brief email discussion with a postgrad in my college, this is one of the conclusions.<br><br>Rights are a form of cash call (i.e. the company is asking shareholders for additional cash) - In order to avoid<br>undersubscription (i.e. the coy not getting the full amoung of cash it is asking for from shareholders), the company has to issue it in the money.<br>Warrants are not normally used for cash calls. Rather, they are issued as a sweetener to a new bond issue (borrowing from bondholders). Therefore, the company does not need to issue it in the money as<br>full subscription is guaranteed by the attractiveness of the bond+warrant<br>issue and not the exercise price of the warrant.<br><br>A reply to this though:<br>You are right to say that warrants are just another type of option, but Rights issues are NOT call warrants and can only be issued to existing shareholders.<br><br>It does not give you the right to buy or sell shares in the future. This is the main reason why Rights issue can be issued In the money. Why rights issues are not options:    It must be issued only to the existing sharholders (all have equal rights or     entitlement of this rights)Options or warrants can be issued to anyone<br>(including non-shareholders)Rights issue will dilute the value per share immediately, but not the Warrants.<br><br>Why warrants can be issued to everyone?<br>Why warrants donot dilute the mother shares?<br><br>Because warrants are issued At the money or Out of the money. Therefore, it can be issued to everyone who is willing to bet for the gearing effect of the warrants insteads of holding the mother shares.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br></div>

Are they issued FOC to existing shareholders (eg every 10 shares you own entities you to 1 right) or is there a small cost attached to it which means you need to purchase the rights?</div>
