              <p>the school is so small that it's a miracle to find a place to have food. moreover, the food is so damn disgusting. the female vendors (mainly western food and cai fan) are so sexist. girls have a super small portion while guys have a bigger one. and teachers haf mountain proportions.</p>

              <p>i really hope the school will buy insurance for us to ensure that we get subsidise or compensated when something really happens.</p>
              <p>and i agree with wei kiat's blog that those from very neighbourhood schools (not trying to discrimnate or what) love aj just because they squeezed in one of the top jcs, which is a glory in their schools. but to ppl like us, it's quite of an insult when others laugh at you not because of your o level results, but because you got no choice but to enter a somewhat-world-war-2-building school.</p>
              <p>when i first entered, the school boasted that we have a fountain, when it is really so mini that you can place it in your hdb balcony.</p>

              <p>I don't really consider ourselves slow pace when the lectures seem to be on a no-speed-limit highway?</p>
              <p>You make no sense, small compound, shouldn't it be easier to find the canteen?</p>
              <p>And the canteen vendors, the previous batches feedbacked that the guys should get more food than the girls because they have tougher PEs/higher metabolism rate/more active, and the vendors agreed. AND if the girls feel that their portions are too small, they CAN ask for more for free, of course not more than the guys la. Although I understand that the western food stall is a different issue *thinks of heart-shaped eggs* <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>And the toilets above council room are used mainly by students. Who are the ones trying to choke the toiletbowls with wet toilet paper or undies?</p>
              <p>Oh, feel free to build fountains of the same size at yr HDB balcony. Don't make ridiculous comparisons. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>Oh, jesus christ, shut your ****ing flap. Why the **** did you get into a JC? *Gasp* Can it be because you want to score well in your A levels and hopefully get a university and degree of your choice, thereby becoming a successful member of the society?</p>
              <p>A JC is a school. It's where you learn, study and understand. You want to party? You do that outside the JC. And once you're outside, why the hell would which JC you're attending matters? What, because other people are laughing at you? Honestly, what the hell would you care what they think? Especially when their opinions are so shallow, stupid and conceited.</p>
