Animals have a more wider wave range than that humans.<br><br>As for making a pact with the ghost i'm not so sure about that. Maybe we can take those 4D craze people as an example.</div>

Wat I mean that maybe e.g. the pontianak 'exist' only in the minds of Singaporeans &amp; Malaysians. I think that if an extremely large number of people believe that pontianak 'exists', e.g. people in Singapore &amp; Malaysia, the power of their minds maybe can cause it to so-called 'exist', make it so real that it 'exist'.<br><br>But if a foreigner goes near a banana tree, maybe he/she will see nothing at all, because the pontianak doesn't exist in their culture. Maybe for Brazilian culture, banana plantations are just any other workplace. He/she will maybe say that u're crazy or "out of your mind", because they don't have any ghosts related to banana trees, but I'm not sure about that.<br><br>Or maybe they've their own monsters/ghosts related to banana trees. But 'exist' only in their own minds, already in their mindset, confined only to their culture. And I'm not sure about that either.<br><br><strong>Basically it's all about the people's mindset. Wat I want to say that, we're basically getting afraid for no reason at all. For our case, if we can get rid of the mindset about 'pontianak'</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok I want your expert opinions on this photo. It was taken by a friend I was with at WOMAD at Fort Canning Park about 2 years ago, but I only just found it on my old computer after I had looked for it for ages. A group of us were sitting on the grassy hill looking down the hill towards the stage and my friend decided to take a picture, and when we looked at the image on the camera display we noticed that white shape of a figure, but the display was quite small so we decided to forget about it and check it out at home later.<br><br>So when we checked it out on the comp, we were shocked to see what came out. You can clearly see some type of figure in a white dress/gown just floating there. I mean floating, because you can see underneath is an woman in an indian dress, and you can also make out the heads of other people sitting down on the grass and therefore make out the ground level.  This photo was taken looking down the hill, and there was definitely no white figure there in the way when the photo was taken, and it is clearly just there in mid-air. Notice how thin the neck seems to be, and how its hard to distinguish any arms. What do you people think?<br><br>* This is not a photoshop or doctored picture, I can swear on my own life that there was nothin there in front of us when the picture was taken, and the thing appeared on the digital camera display right after the picture was taken<br><br><img src="http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/3537/picture188yb5.jpg"></div>

It was taken by a friend I was with at WOMAD at Fort Canning Park about 2 years ago, but I only just found it on my old computer after I had looked for it for ages. A group of us were sitting on the grassy hill looking down the hill towards the stage and my friend decided to take a picture, and when we looked at the image on the camera display we noticed that white shape of a figure, but the display was quite small so we decided to forget about it and check it out at home later.<br><br>So when we checked it out on the comp, we were shocked to see what came out. You can clearly see some type of figure in a white dress/gown just floating there. I mean floating, because you can see underneath is an woman in an indian dress, and you can also make out the heads of other people sitting down on the grass and therefore make out the ground level.  This photo was taken looking down the hill, and there was definitely no white figure there in the way when the photo was taken, and it is clearly just there in mid-air. Notice how thin the neck seems to be, and how its hard to distinguish any arms. What do you people think?<br><br>* This is not a photoshop or doctored picture, I can swear on my own life that there was nothin there in front of us when the picture was taken, and the thing appeared on the digital camera display right after the picture was taken<br><br><img src="http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/3537/picture188yb5.jpg"></div></blockquote>God hates such wild parties where women get raped and molested so easily.
