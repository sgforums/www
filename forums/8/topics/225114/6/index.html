There has been a lot of encounters within the nearby villages. Nowadays, two hotels have been constructed for increasing influx of tourists, and it so happens that the villages are no longer occupied these days, for reasons logically known and explained above...<br><br>My aunt (true story) loves to gamble, and would go up there once or twice every week to gamble. She always wins and was said to have a very good luck (in Chinese, there is a particular word which I don't know)... The very last time she went up there to gamble, about 2 years back, she started off the evening by winning, but then started to lose all her current savings she would keep with her whenever she go gamble.<br><br>Tired and depressed from the loss, she ventured outside and walked around until she came to the place near the village, where she heard her name being called...<br><br>RULE #1 : Never turn back when you hear someone call you, unfamiliar voices especially<br><br>RULE #2: When you lose, you are more prone to the dark and you will often hear such things...<br><br>My aunt turned around not knowing what was going on and thought that it was her friend who was there with her at that time. What she saw made her trip to GH the final, and as she relate the incident to me, she was still in a state of shock and fear. She trembled and was icy cold as she was admitted to the ICU for life support.<br><br>As she was recovering, she said that there was a young lady, beautiful who was dressed in red looking at her at first with kind eyes. My aunt, still in a sad mood that time, ignored her and turned away. The lady called out to her again and as she was about to shoo her off, the lady's eyes turned red with anger and told her that she has been neglected since she was born, and now when she is dead, she deserve a little respect and wanted company. My aunt thought that the lady was drunk and shouted at the lady in Hokkien to shoo her off.<br><br>The lady in red then took off her scarf and blouse and levitated. Her face at first which was flushed turned snowy pale and her hair which was not seen at first, was disshevelled. Her guts was seen hanging from her neck and blood was dripping out towards the very end of her gut. The figure sped towards my aunt. She was stiff and shocked at that time, that my aunt did not know what to do but to scream her lungs out She then fainted and woke up in the ICU... She was fortunate to only have a broken hip from that fall. She never wanted to go there again</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TITLE: WHEN YOU GO TO TOILET!!<br><br>This happened recently in a place called Tanjong Mambok. I am not sure where this place is, but I am sure it is in Malaysia   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>In one of the villages, there was a house where this incident happened. In that house, there were 7 people. Mr H owns the house and is married to a beautiful wife who is recently pregnant. They have 3 kids and the other two members of the family who lived in with them are Mr H's parents.<br><br>One night, one of the children wanted to go to the toilet, and it was already 1 am. Since this kid is closer to his mother, he waked her mother up to take him to the toilet. The toilet setting in the kampongs are located several meters away from the house. She then lit a candle and took her child by the arm and accompanied him towards the toilet.<br><br>As he was doing his business in the toilet, his mother waited patiently under a tree while humming a small tune. It did not take her long enough when she began to hear an accompaniment who is humming along with her. At first, she thought that it was her son, so she called out to him. He answered as usual, but the humming sound kept on coming. She looked around her and could find nothing. Senses came to her to look up tree when she saw a head floating upwards humming the tune. It had sharp teeth and blood dripping out from the mouth. The eyes were nearly popping out and was red with anger. It was about to attack the lady when she freaked out and yelled...<br><br>She screamed for her son and her husband, who then came to her aid but they did not see anything. Her father in law who is a well known bomoh, took her back into the house, and blessed her, telling the family that she has seen a spirit which attacks after pregnant women. Those not pregnant can never see the spirit.<br><br>The lady's shock caused her a miscarriage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TOPIC: HOTEL ROOM HAUNTED<br><br>This one occurred several years back whereby I heard from my uncle. He as most of you recalled from the previous posting works as a tourist guide. One day, when taking a group of tourist to the Genting Resort, he decided, out of reluctance to book the old hotel which was primely noted to be haunted.<br><br>The tourists, after being told about the story wanted to experience for themselves as they never believed in the supernatural. They thought that it was just based on superstition, the believe of the Malaysians.<br><br>Henceforth, came the first night, I shall relate the story on one couple who experienced the phenomenon. They were sleeping (a guy and a girl of course) in a small room (the old hotels) occupied with a one-man fitting bathroom.<br><br>After a whole day of gambling and outdoor theme park activities, they retired to bed, both of them really tired. The girl immediately fell asleep while the guy decided to read a book he bought earlier from the Genting Souvenir and Book Shop. While reading halfway, he fell asleep leaving his bedside lamp on.<br><br>About 3 am, the girl was awokened by a harsh voice calling out to her. She opened her eyes and freaked out because this voice was not of his husbands. It was deep and coarse. The voice then stopped and she could hear someone vomiting severely with fluids hitting onto the floor as though this man was drunk. The vomiting action continued and with each gasp and throw, the girl had goosebumps. She decided to pretend to fall asleep and felt a pressure over her chest. The pressure became harder and harder on her, and she was nearly out of breath.<br><br>The voice came back again and ask her to leave the next day for this was his room. And he was angry particularly for she was sleeping on her bed. The pressure became deeper and deeper and nearly choking her to death, she pleaded and cried out verses and scriptures from the Bible. The figure was reluctant to let go and instead push her towards the other side and she fell with a thump, hitting her head on the wall. As she opened her eyes, she could see a silhouette of a dark man, with no eyes and unshaved beard. The right chin was pierced with shards of beer bottles and his nostrils were stuffed with cigarette butts. His mouth was filled with black spots and there was a slash mark on the upper region of his neck. There were more glass shards on his chest piercing through his body. The figure had no fingers and one of his arm was cut off. She promised the ghost that she would leave immediately and would not make a fuss out of it anymore.<br><br>The ghost disappeared and she woke her husband up and they both left the place hurriedly.</div>
