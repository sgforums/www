            <div class='col-md body'>This happened to me just this morning......<br><br>I had stayed over at my bf's house last night. And this morning, I woke up earlier to prepare breakfast for us before going to work. It was around 8:15 in the morning. While waiting for the hotdogs to defrost in the kitchen, I sat at the dining table (near the kitchen door) reading the papers. My bf was still asleep upstairs. His dad had left for work and his mum had gone back to sleep so I was alone. I never liked being alone in his house no matter what time of the day cuz I find the yin in his house very strong. But I got no choice cuz no point to wake him up so early ma.<br><br>When I was reading the papers, from the corner of my eyes, I saw a black figure walking by, behind me and into the room besides the kitchen. For those who had followed the thread, that room was that of his late sister who committed suicide. I turned around to confirm but there was no one. I was so freaked out, praying and uttering under my breath that whether it's jie jie or who, PLEASE DO NOT SCARE ME!<br><br>I am very certain I saw the figure, and not due to being tired or what. Come to think of it, I can' believed after that I got up and went to the kitchen, put the hotdogs into the microwave to heat up then went upstairs to find my bf, all these while praying away.<br><br>I was so scared I turn around and see his sister. Think I will faint there lor.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This happened slightly more then a year ago 1 week before i was due to move house. My friends say that its hallucination and i am still unsure what it really is.<br><br>Was staying in AMK and mum bought a bigger house and was due to move in a week's time.<br><br>That night i was sleeping on the bed and it was pretty late into the night already. I was half asleep when i heard some sound. The sound is the type from soft then slowly become very loud. At first i thought nothing about the sound then continue to sleep, then as it gets louder and louder, i bth and open my eyes. That's when i saw a lady with face right in front of me, like maybe 10 cm away only. due to my position, i think that its floating horizontally in front of me. Damn scared ah but dun dare to do anything. Then i quickly close my eyes and listen to the ticking of the clock. After a few mins, i open my eyes and its gone. Still very scared so run to my mum's room to pee, then go sleep beside my brother. (sounds so gay but i am damn fcking shocked and scared)<br><br>I told my mum about it and she says its my imagination.<br><br>The next night, i went to sleep really early coz i still abit scared but cannot get to sleep. The after very very long, i start to hear the sound again, but this time, in addition, the sound sounds like somebody talking, but in a language i dunno to me.Before it gets loud (compare to the sound level of the previous night) i quickly open my eyes and go sleep in the living room where the corridoor's light is pretty bright.

My friends say that its hallucination and i am still unsure what it really is.<br><br>Was staying in AMK and mum bought a bigger house and was due to move in a week's time.<br><br>That night i was sleeping on the bed and it was pretty late into the night already. I was half asleep when i heard some sound. The sound is the type from soft then slowly become very loud. At first i thought nothing about the sound then continue to sleep, then as it gets louder and louder, i bth and open my eyes. That's when i saw a lady with face right in front of me, like maybe 10 cm away only. due to my position, i think that its floating horizontally in front of me. Damn scared ah but dun dare to do anything. Then i quickly close my eyes and listen to the ticking of the clock. After a few mins, i open my eyes and its gone. Still very scared so run to my mum's room to pee, then go sleep beside my brother. (sounds so gay but i am damn fcking shocked and scared)<br><br>I told my mum about it and she says its my imagination.<br><br>The next night, i went to sleep really early coz i still abit scared but cannot get to sleep. The after very very long, i start to hear the sound again, but this time, in addition, the sound sounds like somebody talking, but in a language i dunno to me.Before it gets loud (compare to the sound level of the previous night) i quickly open my eyes and go sleep in the living room where the corridoor's light is pretty bright. After that nothing happens anymore. Heng agh,</div></blockquote>What kind of sound?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
