Women need to take care of the caves and the household, so we need to havea  wider vision.<br><br>Maybe is imagination lor....But I dun reli get scared by them...More of curious of what was it that I saw from the corner of my eyes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps it's just a floater in your eyes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>What Are Floaters?<br><br>The "flying flies" or "dots" that you may sometimes see moving in your field of vision are called floaters. They are frequently visible when looking at a plain background, such as a blue sky. Floaters are actually tiny clumps of gel or cellular debris inside the vitreous, the jelly-like fluid that fills the inside cavity of the eye.<br><br>Although the floaters appear to be in front of the eye, they are actually floating in the vitreous fluid inside the eye and cast their shadows on the retina, the light sensing inner layer of the eye. Moving our eyes up and down creates current within the vitreous capable of moving the floaters away from your direct line of vision.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well this one is a personnel experience!!! I was in uniform group in my sec sch and my sec 3 camp is the most scary of them all. Although we camped at sch, it was pretty dark and quiet at night. During the camp nite where we were suppose to sing songs and put up short performance, me wif the other seniors couldnt think of any funny performance. Then one of us suggested that maybe we can put up a show about a fatal car accident wif jokers-like 1st aiders doing all kind of stupid things on the poor victim. We even went around collecting white flower petals as props. The show ended wif the man dying and the clownish 1st aiders conducting the funeral for him, throwing the white petals in the air while chanting funeral songs....The performance was a success as many cadets laugh like mad....but later that nite......something happened. The group of fellow seniors wif miself were resting in a class room just beside the parade square while the cadets were at the other block. I dunno abt the others, it was ard 1 am when I suddenly felt very cold and creepy. Then I heard marching noises with a timer shouting out in a language i do not understand. I immediately cork up and saw several of mi frens faces as white as sheets. I knew they must have heard it too...The noise remain like for 5 mins b4 it ended. After that ,those who perform in the show all claim to see white shadows darting ard in toilet when they were having shower. As for miself, I only help them to collect white petals and nothing else, that could be the reason my encounter stop at the hearing of sounds. After this incident, we pass it down to the next batch of juniors never to joke wif the dead and my uniform group still have this rule even till today.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh ya I remembered one story told by my secondary school classmate many years ago.<br>He was like the typical Ah Beng and was always sneaking back in the school at night to make use of the basketball court (it is hidden in a corner and very quiet there)<br>He said he used to do that till one Sunday evening around 7pm he was shooting some hoops when he heard a girlish giggle behind him. He turned around and saw no one till he looked up and saw a girl sitting on the fence looking at him (Fence is about 2m high). No girl is going to scale up a fence, sit on it in a white dress. He freaked out.<br><br>I said what did you do?<br><br>He said he just ran away as fast as he could without looking back<br></div>

He captured them with the night mode and all the lights off...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Remember my story regarding the encounter of the black hands at Camp X? Well the second story took place in a deserted island when my unit went there for an exercise. I think most of you have heard about this island before, it is located at SW of Singapore, and it was a penal island remembered for a revolt in 1963 in which the superintendent and others were brutally murdered. I am talking about Palau Senang.<br><br>My unit was stationed there for a few days as part of our exercise and I was actually quite excited about it. At the point IÂ’ve never heard of Palau Senang or its violent history. Before the exercise, my sergeant merely told us we were going to a deserted island far away from the main island.<br><br>To cut the story short, on the very first night when I was asleep after my patrol, the condition known as sleeping paralysis struck again. Just like my previous encounter with the pair of black hands, this time it was also different. Instead of the usual bombardment of unintelligent noises what I heard were people crying Â“Tolong, tolongÂ”, screaming, shouting, etc. The language was a mixture of Malay, English and Mandarin. Although it was really chaotic however one message was very clear, whoever they were, they were begging me for food; they were hungry, very hungry.<br><br>Back home for some reasons I couldnÂ’t get this encounter out of my mind. So I went to the library and did some readings on Palau Senang and when I read about the revolt I was shocked. Maybe what IÂ’ve heard on that night were the unrest spirits of the murdered men or maybe some dead fishermen from the distant past. I donÂ’t know. What I do know is there is nothing I can do about it and the memory of this encounter will stay with me for the rest of my life.<br><br>Hope they can rest in peace.<br></div>
