            <div class='col-md body'>My friend told me this story which was said to her by her mum. I'll try to repeat as close to the story I heard before but this story was narrated to me about 14 years ago so I may not get the details right.<br><br>Her mum grew up in a village here and said that time they were building the Benjamin Sheares bridge  but the bridge kept collapsing. The villagers kept their kids closed to them coz they heard stories from other villages of children going missing and later found beheaded. The rumours were flying around that the heads were used to be buried under the bridge so that it will stop collapsing.<br><br>Anyway, there was this little boy from his village who went missing after his mum sent him out for some errands. They called a huge search party but they couldn't find him. The next morning, they found his headless body on the village dirt road.<br><br>The parents were extremely upset and the father swore to find the murderer for justice. Apparently they did the rituals which was supposed to summon the spirit back to tell them who the murderer was. Everyone in the village was supposed to attend the funeral and walk past the body which was not in the coffin.<br><br>Accordingly to my friend's mum, this guy from the village when he walked past the body, the corpse actually grabbed him because he was the murderer.<br><br>Anyway I'm not sure if she told this story to my friend to scare her or what and I think it sounds abit farfetch but it was scary hearing it when we were kids  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
