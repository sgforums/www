            <div class='col-md body'>Oooo interesting Fatum! Keep them coming!<br><br>I shall repost a story of mine which took place in New Zealand<br><br>My story took place in 1998, during my student exchange program in Poly in New Zealand....Yes....I had to go overseas for a spooky experience<br><br>Basically we were in South New Zealand and please don't ask me for the town's name because I have a really awful memory with numbers and names and I can't remember.<br><br>Anyhow, we stayed in this century old hostel, which used to be a hospital back then. So we students checked in and there were like 5 peeps to a room. Ok so we walked into the room and I almost suffocated by what I call an over-whelming stench of disinfectant. I thought the house-keeping crew was over zealous with their cleaning so I didn't think too much about it. Just left the windows open before heading out for dinner.<br><br>However, when we came back later in the evening, I felt the smell was worst and I had this eerie feeling and that the hairs behind my neck were standing up. Being agnostic, I prayed to God for courage and protection. Well, I felt calm after that and figured it was my imagination playing tricks on me afterall we had been on the road all day and I was dead tired. After that I knocked out. I did wake up in the night because I felt so darn freaking cold and realised that the heater had gone off on it's own  . Thought I felt someone looking at me but I was too darn tired to care really. Just turned on the heater and knocked out till about 6am in the morning when we were awaken by frantic knocks on the door.<br><br>"Did you guys see anything last night?" Was the first question the friend who barged in asked. We said we slept through the whole thing and apparently, some kaypohs were reading through the guest book and found out that the room we were sleeping in used to be an operating theather and there were lots of sightings in the room, including one which was dated a month ago, with this guy seen walking through the wall<br><br>It turned out that we were the only people who caught any sleep that night along with the lecturers as the rest were too scared to sleep as apparently, the fire escape door outside our room kept opening on it's own though it was bolted shut<br><br>I got the chills when I thought about it back then but it's funny that when you're tired, you just don't give a damn? That's why I say, it's a spooky but not so spooky experience<br></div>
