According to her it happened over a year ago.<br><br>Her friend went to Australia with a few friends and they rented this house to stay. It was a big house with a nice garden.<br><br>However, at night when they were sitting around in the living room and chatting, they realised that they can hear voices of others talking too. They fell silent and the voices continued.  They didn't sleep that night.<br><br>The next night, her friend slept and dreamt that she was along and walking in the garden outside. She knew that it was the house they were staying in. She walked around in her dream and saw 3 women sitting at a table in the garden. She couldn't see their faces as their hair covered their faces. She tried asking them questions but no reply till she asked," Is this house haunted?" then she suddenly woke up from her dream.<br><br>They quickly left the place by cutting the trip short. She fell very ill when back in Singapore and was not herself. She was an excellent baker and cook but when she is back she couldn't even cook and she also developed photosensitivity. She was lethergic and had no energy during the day but wide awake at night. She tried getting help from doctors but to no avail. Mediums didn't work either.<br><br>Anyway she is alright now. She converted to Christianity.<br><br>Basically the suspicion now is that the ghost possessed her and tried to slowly take over her body.</div>
