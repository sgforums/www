            <div class='col-md body'>This was told to me by my father....My father used to stay at ipoh when he is young before he move to JB and get married(yeah yeah I am a johorian). He had this neighbor, an old stubborn  man who forced his son to marry a woman that the son has no feeling for. ( This is in the 60s so could be common lah). A year later, the son suddenly fall ill and have a high running temperature. Being a stubborn old mule, this old ahpek refuses to let his son to have western treatment and instead forced his son to drink some kind of water with tailsman burn in it. The poor son died and the whole family was devastated. Right after the funeral, the neighbors(including my father) could hear wailing sound of the poor son outside his house. No one dare to step near their house for months. Eventually, the village head consulted some taoist priests and they said the poor guy died unwillingly. His yan(4) qi(4) is very heavy and they conducted rituals to remove his yan(4) qi(4) . Strange enough, my father and the others never hear the wailing sounds anymore. Of course the ah pek went crazy because his precious son died before he do and no one really bother abt him after that incident.</div>
