            <div class='col-md body'>haha... everyone so enthu. I also share ba... =)<br><br>this happened when i was much younger, about 5 i think.<br><br>My Mum and I was in thailand, bangkok having a holiday.<br><br>We stayed in a certain 4 star hotel and there was once my mum was bathing, was very young then thus she never lock the door.<br><br>Then it happen.<br><br>I saw an "ant" or rather an unkown creature that was about the size of your average middle finger, red in colour. I saw it flew towards the toilet. Being the good little boy I was, I ran into the toilet and wanted to warn my mum about it.<br><br>But the thing is, my mum cant see it. Thus began my frantic waves of actions to point it to her. I climb on the toilet bowl and tried to show my mum the "bug".<br><br>And the bug disappeared. What happened next was out of this world. The washing basin detached itself from the wall, flew and dropped on the floor and broke into pieces. My mum was stunned, so was I. (Most prob I just didn't know what was happening then).<br><br>Next, the toilet bowl I was standing on shifted as well. It shifted towards the broken basin, tilted and I flew on top of the pile. I had serveral cuts on the bottom of my leg. My mum reacted fast on this thou, carried me out of the toilet and got me to a hospital after she got dressed. I was still trying to warn my mum about the bug if I wasnt wrong.<br><br>We came back to Singapore the next day.<br><br>*shrugs*<br><br>had my other fair share of encounters too... lol...<br><br></div>

One night. they all gathered into one room and started talking about their day. What they did and gossip here and there.<br><br>After like talking for some time. They suddenly heard a 'thump' sound.<br>All of them all suddenly stop talking and glance around the room to see where the sound came from. Cause they could not detect anything, they continues their conversation but in a lower volume.<br><br>Suddenly, they heard 'thump'. Then. one of the grp got one girl started crying.<br>The guys in the room also dono what to do. Then again, they heard thump. Even louder now. Soon, the 'thumping' sound started to thump continously without stopping. My friend say like ppl hitting very hard on the lion dabce tt kind of drum.<br><br>Every thump, the sound got louder and louder, it also got nearer and nearer to them.<br><br>Suddenly, the cupboard at the front door there started to shook and move. The movement of the cupboard got more and more loud and also more vibrant. They all still sat on the bed all praying hard that whatever in there does not come out. They also dont dare to rush out cause they have to pass the cupboard.<br><br>So, the whole grp pretended to slp on the bed the whole night. The nxt day, they change room and slept before 10 pm.</div>
