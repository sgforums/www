            <div class='col-md body'>This is a story by my grandmother. Last time, she stayed in Malaysia, Terrenganu. Got once, her mother-in-law, my great grandmother went into coma.<br><br>She was unconscious for like 10 days, and during that period, she was only put on drip but was not dependent on any breathing machines. The reason for falling asleep for a long time was unknown as my grandma must have forgotten to tell me.<br><br>Anyway, the hospital where my great grandmother (Ggrandmother) was staying in, have a lot of dogs around the building. That night when my grandmother woke up, a lot of dogs started howling into the night, it sounded as though they were frightened or crying.<br><br>A few days later, my Ggrandmother called my ahma to her bedside and told her. She said that during the days when she was unconscious, she saw her husband (passed away already). She was walking in a kind of hole or passage way where there is a light at the end. On the way, her husband came up to her and called her. He ask her to go back to where she belong and that her time is not up yet. He than led her to another passage where there is no light and is darker and scarier. He than let go of her and said that he cant continue or he will cross the border. My Ggrandfather than told her to keep walking and not to look back.<br><br>On the way she walk back, she heard a lot of howlings and screamings. She was very frightened but determined to get back. Finally, after walking for a long time, she reached the back door of the hospital which she recognised. Over there, she saw the dogs gritting their teeths at her and barking at her very loudly making her tremble.<br><br>Finally, she saw the nurses and doctors in her ward, soon, she woke up and, thereafter, my ahma was told of this story,<br><br>But exactly 1 year later, on the same date she woke, my Ggrandmother passed away.</div>

He was a friendly guy who's quite old..and the reason he's well-known is because he could see ghosts. Every time we passed by his room (yes! he got a room of his own!), we'd hear him chanting..den playing around with his beads... sometimes in the morning, i could see him walking his bicycle to school from the side gate while talking to himself. Spooky eh?<br>and one day, (saturday) he died mysteriously. what happened? the police said he died of heart attack but it was impossible. He was a fit guy! we couldnt buy the story. some said he was attacked by ghosts of the school(heh..we do have a lot you know), others said it was jus his time to go. Also, a week or so before his death, he actually requested to take a group photo with the staff of the school. that's why there was still his picture in our school magazine last year. it was as though he knew he was gonna die.<br>he passed away in the canteen, near to the bookshop. any ex-tk people would know him ba..=)</div></blockquote>Sounds like death note  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This happen to me in school last yr, dono whether considered ghost story or not.<br><br>Last yr during band camp, i wanted to go down to the canteen to grab a bite cause cannot slp. Then we used the classroom as dormitries and we had to walk pass a lot of rooms and down the stairs before reaching the canteen.<br><br>Since no one wanted to accompany me, i went down by myself. I was walking down the corridoor, and the coridoor lights are on alternately, so one part is got light, one part is pitch black. Than, i walk pass the computer lab, my sch computer lab window is can see through clearly one, no need to cover your hand on the window to see through.<br><br>So i turned my head as i walk pass, and that happened to be a dark area where got no light. When i turn inside, i saw tt some computers are on, the screens are all white and flicking very fast. All except for one, this one is a normal one. But the strange thing is that no one is using the computer except that the screen showed the google search engine, and next the search result, like as though someone is using it.<br><br>Scare the sh-it out of me and i quickly rush down to the canteen where my teacher in charge munching on the cookies.</div>
