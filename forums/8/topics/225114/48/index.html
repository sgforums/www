            <div class='col-md body'>The Hong Kong story is @@<br>Kinda like my hotel story where the room is vacant but the food is taken <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>Actually this is a very old story from Hong Kong<br>ItÂ’s been told so many times IÂ’m not even sure if it is true or made up but itÂ’s a living urban legend now I guess. ItÂ’s supposed to happen along a certain street in Hong Kong<br><br>This story was supposed to happen during the 50Â’s or 60Â’s in Hong Kong. (Forgive my bad story telling)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>There was this family who is very poor but happy. There were 3 of them. Father, Daughter &amp; Brother. One day, the father fell very ill. They were at their wits end for survival and to get money for medicine.<br><br>The daughter made a decision and decided to sell her virginity for money. She went to the brothel without letting her family know.<br><br>However that night, some gang triad boss decide to patronize the brothel. She was basically gang raped that night.<br><br>In shock, she left the brothel in the wee mornings with the money she has earned. It was raining heavily and being upset, she crossed the road without looking and was knocked down by a car.<br><br>In the morning when her brother woke up, he couldnÂ’t find his sister around but found money on the table.<br><br>This continued for a few weeks but he never saw his sis. One night he waited for her and saw her come in to leave money. The brother asked his sis where she had been but she only smiled at him sadly and told him that due to some reasons she canÂ’t come home but she will take care of them. Saying that, she left the house.<br><br>Back to the triad boss. He had this huge tattoo of the Goddess Of Mercy on his back which he believes will protect him from harm. One night as he was walking along streets he heard a female voice saying,Â”Sir, would you like to have some funÂ” coming from the side ally. He couldnÂ’t see the face of the lady but could tell she had a good figure. He walked to her and saw that she was actually very beautiful.<br><br>He said,Â”How much? ItÂ’s a surprise to find a gem like you plying the streets.Â” They negotiated a price and walked further down the alley into the darkness.<br><br>The girl turned back and said,Â” You donÂ’t remember me do you? IÂ’m here to take my revenge.Â”<br><br>The triad boss was unfazed . He said I have the Goddess of Mercy on my back to protect me from the likes of you.<br><br>The girl just laughed and told him that the Goddess of Mercy will not protect an evil guy like him with that the tattoo seemed to melt off his back and she ripped him to pieces.<br><br>The stories always tell even during this modern time a girl in a red cheongsam (yeah that was what she was wearing the night she died) would call up to a guy passing by the street at night for Â‘some funÂ’<br></div>
