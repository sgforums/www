But pple will always claimed to have seen a lady in white inside the auditorium. The main hall of the auditorium is a hall that has got a big stage, seats (downstair and upstair), much like the theater, where u would ahve circus seats.<br><br>And behind the stage, there would be numerous changing rooms, which have been converted to storeroom and locked away for a very very long time. IF u are in the luck, u will be able to open oen of them..and if u are daring enough, u are always "invited" to explore the room at ur own risk.<br><br>.....to be continued.....</div>
