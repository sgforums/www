            <div class='col-md body'>You will never really know for sure if you are alone in the house or if someone or something is watching you while you are asleep.<br><br>A good friend told me this story a few years ago during one of our coffee sessions.  For the past few weeks she felt very depressed and suicidal for no reasons. This was very unlikely of her because she is a very outgoing and cheerful person. The scary part was she had this strange feeling that someone or something was watching her in her own house. As days went by, she got more depressed and would break into tears for no reasons.<br><br>Eventually she decided to visit a famous monk, whom was highly recommended by her relatives. The monk asked her some questions, sorry I donÂ’t have the details, but what the monk told her scared her out of her wit. Apparently my friend attended a BBQ at East Coast Park recently. While she was at the beach, a male spirit became attracted to her and decided to follow her home. I am not surprise because she is quite pretty. It seemed that for the past few weeks he had been trying to influence her into committing suicide so that they could be together.<br><br>The monk then accompanied my friend to her house and conducted a ritual straight away. Well believe it or not, it worked and now my friend is back to her old joyful self again.  So if you have been feeling depressed for no reasons recently, perhaps some praying might help.<br><br>By the way whoÂ’s that behind you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br></div>
