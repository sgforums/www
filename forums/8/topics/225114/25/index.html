"do you pray to any gods in your house?"<br><br>Immediately, E, G and me sensed something amiss.<br><br>My Friend B told me that he only rent the unit, and use one room where he got a guan_gong in his room.

            <div class='col-md body'>talking about younger ghost. My auntie living in the east suffered a miscarriage before. If the unborn child is still alive, he would be of the smae age as me.<br><br>Just recently, the flats in the east are undergoing construction where they are drilling holes into the floor to redo the cement. So that time, the construction have reached my aunts corridoor.<br><br>The worker than told my aunt tt if anybody want to go out, go out now, if not have to wait 5hrs later than can go. Cause the cement takes time to dry. So my aunt agreed as most of the family members are at school and work.<br><br>Than the drilling started. After 5 hrs, my younger cousin wanted to go out, so my aunt accompanied her.<br><br>My younger cousin than sat at the gate there to wear her shoe, my aunt was standing outside facing the house. When she look down to see my cousin wearing her shoes, she saw a very tiny feet imprint. Its the size of a newborn.<br><br>Then, she recalled a few days ago, she dreamnt of her mother-in-law holding a boy to visit her. The boy was around my age. So she felt that the boy was her son and the tiny imprint also belong to him.<br><br>She did not alert her family members as she did not want to frightened them off when she herself is trembling with fear.<br><br>So she phoned my mother in the middle of the night and told her about it. As they talked over the phone, my aunt eventually realised that she did not give her son a proper burial as my mother generation did not want my generation to know about it. So she allowed to doctors to dispose it off.<br><br>She did not even gave the child a name. Up till now, she still dono what the dream meant, and the foot print is still there.</div>

Work busy mah..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Lamp posts wont switch on and off by itself right.. so it seems funny that they can switch on and off by itself when people walked by.<br><br>There was once i walked pass three trees with white flowers at pasir ris park, suddenly all the lights behind me all went out making the whole place dark. i was not afraid then i walk on.. when i turn back to look, the lamp posts off one by one as i walk pass.. woah.. scared liao.. i control my fear then i walk till i saw some people at some pits then i not scared liao. People said Pasir Ris Park have alot of spirits around, in the maze or central park of the park between the two bridges, i met this incident at between the two bridges early in the morning.<br><br>Then last time i was working in the old SMU complex at Bukit timah, it was around midnight, i walk out to take a cab, i walk pass a lamp post, it switch off.. making the whole place dark, i run to the main road then i look back, the lamp post is on again. Then i saw a guy behind me walking down also... the lamppost went off again, after the guy walked past, it went on. Seems to me that the lamp post is purposely switch off making the area darker than usual.<br><br>Now my work place is deserted at night, there is two lampposts also having this problem, switch off when people on bike or walking pass by, cars have no effect on the lamp posts.<br><br>And i notice trees usually shroud the lamp posts, making the area dim.. if the lamp posts is switch off, the area have no lights around.. so eerie. As people know dark places have spirits, my conclusion is they lives in the trees around.<br>I met alot of such lamp posts, any one met before?<br><br></div></blockquote> comprain to pub</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno how true this is<br>My mum used to live in a village near the sea at Port Dickson<br>However, they started doing heavy reclaimation many years ago to develop the place. I heard this story when I was only around 14 years old so might be a bit in accurate.<br><br>Anyway, I used to go to the beach to play alot as a kid. The water was nice and clean and you had so many rock pools to play in.<br><br>After they reclaimed the sea, this part of the beach was turned into a giant lagoon. It's now closed to public because there have been apparently alot of strange drownings near the shore<br><br>Apparently they victims were near the beach and they all drowned because they got sucked in by a whirlpool (accordingly to some people who claim to be eye witnesses)<br><br>The thing is that the water isn't very deep. Maybe about 1.5metres.<br><br>The people from the village (when this happened the gov had already relocated them into nice houses near the beach, but the culture is still very kampung) said that it's caused by water spirits because they are angry that there are no more fishermen going out to see to catch fish and giving them offerings at the end of the day.<br><br>No one knows for sure but that stretch of beach is now closed to public and that was like many years ago.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I have not been to Port Dickson for many many years but I'm sad at the destruction of the beach. I had been there as a child till my secondary school days. We used to have to cross a mangrove swamp before reaching the beach and the beach was filled with see hum and white clams, and those edible seasnails with those conelike shells. I could even catch squid and large tiger prawns from the rock pools.<br><br>However, when I was in my teens the mangrove swamp was gone and the sea was already getting polluted. Don't think I wanna see the degeneration of the beach itself. I don't even think you can find a see hum on the beach now. *sigh*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This was one story i have heard....not sure if it ti true...<br><br>tis about the spirit in the banana tree...<br><br>actually the spirit resides in the flower...not the tree itself...<br><br>I once heard, a long time ago...when Singapore still have kampungs..there was a man...he wanted very much to strike lottery. But he just din have the luck...he tried many avenues..but of no avail.<br><br>until one day, a friend of his told him to try out the banana spirit. And so he did.<br><br>He tied a red string at the banana flower and laid the string all the way to his room. He was told that a spirit would appear before him and he could ask anything from the spirit.<br><br>Midnight arrived, and indeed, a pretty lady appeared before his window. He let the lady in and went straight to bed...  , etc...<br><br>Second day, when he met his friend, his friends were shocked to find him pale and weak. But he din think so, he thot he was fine and that the lad have gave him some numbers to place his bet on.<br><br>Days passed, and he was visited every night by the lady. He got weaker and weaker...tho he did strike lottery, but money was soon spent...<br><br>to be continued<br></div>
