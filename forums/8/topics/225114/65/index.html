            <div class='col-md body'>I also remembered when in pri school, I was having a stomachache and I was sitting in a toilet cubicle. There were two cubicles side by side, and only separated by a partition which has a space a the bottom.<br><br>Suddenly, something that looks like a chicken claw scuttled out and touched my shoe, before scuttling back. At that time, I was too young to understand that this is not possible. I was only curious. Quickly, I got out of the toilet, and and saw that the other cubicle was locked. I didn't dare to look under to see if there were a pair of legs, so I quickly went off. I told my friends about it, but one told me there was something sold that when thrown in water (in the toilet bowl), it would become like that. However, now that I know more things, I believe he was just bullshitting at that time.<br><br>Btw, the cubicle was locked for the next few days that I saw it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking of butterflies... this reminds me...<br><br>Once I had to stay back and finish some work at the office. I had a colleague working together with me and no one else was around. As we worked late into the night, we suddenly heard the automatic doors outside opening and shutting. We tried to ignore it, but it kept opening and shutting. This was not someone coming back late at night to work. At first we were afraid to go check. Then we braved ourselves and went to check together.<br><br>No one around... but there was this big butterfly resting on the unmoving part of the door. Needless to say, this kinda freaked us out. I told my colleague to go home first and I stayed to finish off the work. I was scared inside, but the work had to be done. I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole time and ready to run if I started hearing voices or anything like that. Anyway, nothing bad happened, and the door was fine the next day.<br><br></div>
