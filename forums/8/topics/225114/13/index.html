I had these b4!<br><br>My JC was planning for its opening so they are having a performance... practices end late all the time as usual...<br><br>I was in my JC for 1 year plus becoming quitting to go to poly to pursue my interest. Was a councillor in JC so was roped in to help even thou I left the school already... Then one day, I got a phone call from the production team saying that they feel spooky. So I went down at night with them to check it out. They knew I can sense stuff so they called me.<br><br>So when we was there, nothing happened. So I was telling them everything is fine... But then the curtains on the stage started to sway when there was no wind. They told me that was what that spook them out.<br><br>My first reaction was to look up the second level of the hall where there is windows for people to look down. Not surprisingly, I saw this girl in white (not sure girl or not actually), hair covering face looking down.<br><br>But I lied to them saying that there was nothing and I assured them that I would be with them for every practise. Sometimes him/her would be there, sometimes nothing at all...<br><br>It wasnt my first time seeing him/her but I didn't think it was hin/her causing the disturbance in the hall. It was ten I realise the 2 got a connection.<br><br>The performance went fine in the end. Success! =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember when i was in primary school, i always run errands for my parents ma.. buy small things from provision shop. Once i was at my lift one storey below my flat, it was around 9pm.. i press the lift button and while waiting for the lift. I heard a lady calling my name in a sing-song voice.. i wonder who was it and look around.. all the while the voice come closer.. then stop beside me suddenly. I was shocked.. then i run back up my flat and tell my parents then my parents go down with me and buy.<br><br>THe other time was in Secondary school, as my school shoes is near my house main door. My mom was at the kitchen making breakfast for me. The kitchen was lit but the living room was dark. It was around 6.30 in the morning. I changed liao.. go and take my shoes to wear.. when i heard the same voice again.. calling my name.. sing song voice.. wah liao.. really freak me out.. i still can remember how it called me.. i run back to the lit kitchen and tell my mom.. forgotten what she said or do.. remembered only just my brother company me to school that morning. After that i have no more sing-song voice encounter.<br><br>When they call yr name.. what do they want?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

However, for no reason, suddenly a gaggle of geese appeared from no where and attacked her, pecking and biting that she ran and they chased her towards the cemetary. She didn't know where she was running but all she knew was she stepped on alot of graves that night. She reached the kampung and looked back and saw that at the cemetary there were alot of wipsy vertical white stuff floating above the graves she stepped on.<br><br>Anyway she said after that she started seeing things and some even tried attacking her till she became a stauch Catholic. She said that she don't dare to go out alone now and even shopping she has to go with someone because she told me that she can walk into a shop and suddenly the landscape will change and she is somewhere else and she will see a light <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> she needs someone to call her back if not she will be gone she thinks.<br><br>She said that right now all she does is put her life in the hands of god. She says she thinks that they will continue to seek her till the day she dies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was a post about hotel room in thailand. This reminds me of a story of my ex-colleague.<br><br>He said he was at P..... Princess hotel (bangkok) with his family. They got 2 rooms. So, after checking in.. they all gathered in 1 room to play cards.. and watched TV. But the TV kept changing channels by itself. It'll change from Channel 1, to channel 2 and so on until it reach the end, then repeats from Channel 1. And the volume went from low to very high to very low and very high again.<br><br>My ex-colleague thot the TV was spoilt. Asked the technician to come and check. As soon as the technician stepped into their room, the TV was back to normal. The technician could not find anything wrong with the TV. As soon as the technician went away, the TV started its antics again. My ex-colleague and family were a little spooked. Decided to turn the TV off and not touch it.<br><br>That night.. they were all asleep. My ex-colleague's wife woke up in the middle of the night and found my ex-colleague in a daze.. and then he got up to walk out of the room.. like he was sleep walking. His wife was a little worried and called out to him. Then he "woke" up. He said he did not know anything at all. And he did not have any sleep-walking before, ever..<br><br>The whole family checked out immediately the next day..</div>
