            <div class='col-md body'>stolen story<br><br>Have you ever wonder why at times, you will see a breakdown car on any road without anyone inside (is it that the driver/rider went back? went somewhere, on the phone?) This is why...<br><br>Time: 3am--5am<br>Steven<br><br>It was just a normal night when Steven received a call saying that there's an urgent customer who wants to toll his car as his car breakdown inside CTE tunnel. So he took down the car number and drove his toll truck from home to CTE.<br><br>It was a hazy night. Maybe there's some forest burning activities somewhere outside the country. Road visibility was not really clear but luckily there isn't many cars. So when he went through the first tunnel from Ang Mo Kio, he was searching for the breakdown car as the owner said it is just nearby once he entered the tunnel.<br><br>But when he reached, surprise caught him as there were a lot of cars breakdown on the side of the road. He stopped his truck and put some name card on it as he thought this might earn him more money for tolling all these cars. So after he checked the correct car, hook it up on toll and started walking down to put more name cards.<br><br>While he was putting name card on the forth car, he realised all the cars engine was still on and the key are in it, just without the drivers, he started to wonder why is it so.<br><br>All of a sudden, someone horned him. He turned around to see but there was no one and there was no car or bike travelling inside the tunnel so he went to check the car 1 by 1 to see is there any fault but still no sign of anyone who horned him.<br><br>He started to think otherwise and returned to his truck and about to leave. He thought, why not just leave those cars alone as there might be other toll truck companies tolling those cars and he start walking from the last car to his truck. While he was walking then realised the cars' numbers look the same and without any alphabet infront.<br><br>Just 1234 and while he keep walking, those cars start to change from metal to paper cars. It was only the third car that he passed as there were around 20 over cars to his truck. He started to run and those cars he ran passed all changed to paper cars which were burnt for dead people. He start shouting and praying as he knows he met something dirty.<br><br>Finally he ran back to his truck and quickly starts his engine and roll out. Those paper cars start to burn 1 by 1 when he passed by causing him to speed even faster. He sped all the way in the tunnel until he came out from outram exit. He keep on chanting as he was too afraid to look anywhere but in front for driving and finally he reached 1 of the car garages in alexandra which it said to be delivered.<br><br>He quickly unload the hook of the toll and left the car at the garage as he wanted to return home as soon as possible and all of a sudden, he found out there was something inside the car which he already check nothing in there before he tolled away. He screamed so loud and fainted as he saw there were 3 paper dolls (male and female as these are suppose to burn for the dead ) at the rear seat and 1 paper doll on the front driver seat without a head...</div>
