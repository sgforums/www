People said Pasir Ris Park have alot of spirits around, in the maze or central park of the park between the two bridges, i met this incident at between the two bridges early in the morning.<br><br>Then last time i was working in the old SMU complex at Bukit timah, it was around midnight, i walk out to take a cab, i walk pass a lamp post, it switch off.. making the whole place dark, i run to the main road then i look back, the lamp post is on again. Then i saw a guy behind me walking down also... the lamppost went off again, after the guy walked past, it went on. Seems to me that the lamp post is purposely switch off making the area darker than usual.<br><br>Now my work place is deserted at night, there is two lampposts also having this problem, switch off when people on bike or walking pass by, cars have no effect on the lamp posts.<br><br>And i notice trees usually shroud the lamp posts, making the area dim.. if the lamp posts is switch off, the area have no lights around.. so eerie. As people know dark places have spirits, my conclusion is they lives in the trees around.<br>I met alot of such lamp posts, any one met before?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>During my ns, during weekends, i usually go to my gf house in the tanah merah area, As you know, the condominium there used to be a huge burial ground. It had been exhumed and move away la. The whole area always look dim at night.  One day, i was about to miss the last bus to my house around 12 midnight. I go by a short cut to the bus stop, it was a dimly lit shortcut through some houses. My gf told me not to walk pass there as people have slighted a ghostly lady haunting there. But i always walked there to her house near to 11 at night never see or heard anything before so i ignored her la.<br><br>As i said, i was in a hurry to catch last bus, NS no $$ take cab. I decided to go through the short cut, as i walk quickly, the only lamp post switch off itself..<br>the whole shortcut was dark, i can feel something is around, my hair is standing and i keep walking cause i afraid mah..i look around there was no body.. since i know when lamp posts switch off suddenly,  it means something is around.

People said Pasir Ris Park have alot of spirits around, in the maze or central park of the park between the two bridges, i met this incident at between the two bridges early in the morning.<br><br>Then last time i was working in the old SMU complex at Bukit timah, it was around midnight, i walk out to take a cab, i walk pass a lamp post, it switch off.. making the whole place dark, i run to the main road then i look back, the lamp post is on again. Then i saw a guy behind me walking down also... the lamppost went off again, after the guy walked past, it went on. Seems to me that the lamp post is purposely switch off making the area darker than usual.<br><br>Now my work place is deserted at night, there is two lampposts also having this problem, switch off when people on bike or walking pass by, cars have no effect on the lamp posts.<br><br>And i notice trees usually shroud the lamp posts, making the area dim.. if the lamp posts is switch off, the area have no lights around.. so eerie. As people know dark places have spirits, my conclusion is they lives in the trees around.<br>I met alot of such lamp posts, any one met before?<br><br></div></blockquote>some lamp posts are equipped with motion sensors and switch off when you pass near them ....<br><br>it's a security feature ....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
