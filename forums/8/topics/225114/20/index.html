            <div class='col-md body'>http://www.yensa.com/scary/ha16/12.htm<br><br>submitted by xiqua<br>This incident happened 3 year ago. Most of you might not believe it but this might happened to YOU. This happened on friday the 13.<br><br>I was on the road. I was travelling on my motorbike after sending my girlfriend home. I was like travelling around 100km and enjoying the wind blown toward me when suddenly i realised that i was alone on the road. So i decided to ride faster as i felt a bit uncomfort.<br><br>Out of the blue, i saw a white figure from afar but it was very blur. As i approached nearer, what i know was that it was a headless figure with white clothing on it. I begun to approached nearer and nearer. I dared not open my eyes and i decided to take a glance and to my surprise, i saw a lady dressed in white talking to me. I don't know why i stop but i did stop.<br><br>Guess what the lady asked me?? "Ah boy, want to buy hot beancurd or not".<br><br></div>
