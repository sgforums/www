            <div class='col-md body'>i don noe whether this is consider as a ghost story but something mysterious happen in my home a few years ago..<br><br>i used to have 3 terrapins.. one died 2 weeks after i brought home so now left 2. one day i was alone at home. my family members all went out.. before i went to sleep, i change my terrapins's water and was playing with them.. after a while,  i feel tired and went to my bedroom to take a nap.. few hours later, i woke up and when i pass by to see my terrapins, i was shock to see that the whole tub (where i kept my terrapins) is loaded with their food (i bought tins of foodsticks for them). i rem i didn;t feed them before i take a nap. the water is clear, so it cun be the residue of the foodsticks..  immediately, when my parents and siblings came back, i ask them if they went home while i am asleep, feeding them with food.. but they all say they did not return home. so if they are not the one who fed them, so who is the one who feed them? it cun be the turtles themselves cos the tins of foodstick is located quite a distance from them. it also cun be they vomit out their food cos some of the foodstick is still intact. and they cun possibly climb out from the tub too cos it so high..<br><br>till now, i am still puzzled.. the only reason i can think of is the spirit of my another terrapin returning home to see its's fellow "fres"..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually my stories are not very scary but I try not to remember them because they are not what I would call happy memories.<br><br>When I was very young, maybe about 6 Â– 7 years old I met with a terrible accident. While speeding down slope in my bicycle I collided head-on with a moving bus from the opposite direction. I thought that was it; that was the end of my story. But miraculously I survived with only a few bruises. My bicycle twisted as if it was in pain and the bus suffered a dent at its front.  I got a beating from my parents but I knew they were actually very happy that IÂ’ve survived, so was that bus driver. (A few years later just before my PSLE exam, I stepped on a toy bus, fell, sat on myself and broken my left leg.)<br><br>Well after that accident, I would frequently wake up in the middle of the night unable to move. I was afraid to sleep with the light off.  It was also about this time I realized that for no reasons, my back would suddenly feel very cold as if something was attaching itself on me.  Although occasionally I still had this feeling but I am so used to it now after all these years that I simply ignore it.<br><br>So this is my background, and I will tell some of my encounters when I slowly recall them.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think most of you here have encountered this phenomenon before i.e. you Â“wake upÂ” in the middle of the night and find ypurself paralysis. Not only are you unable to move, you are also unable to talk. The strange thing is you know when it is coming; it may makes its presence known with a high pitch sound, or occasionally with some unintelligent noises. Often you fight back by kicking or giving out a yell. Of course this can easily be explained by the condition of  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis" rel="nofollow">sleeping paralysis</a>. I believe this explanation easily accounts for most of my countless encounters. I say most because two such encounters were so bizarre that I find it difficult to explain with sleeping paralysis.<br><br>Both encounters took place while I was serving my NS in Camp X.  The first story took place during a routine patrol within the camp. Camp X is different from the other camps because it is located within a security area. No lights are allowed after dark. You performed your guard duties in pitch darkness. (Maybe except for the guardhouse and the guardsÂ’ sleeping barrack)<br><br>Although it was against the rule but guards on patrol usually try to take a short nap before reporting back to the guardhouse. So there I was with my buddy on our back trying to get some sleep in the middle of a T-junction under the open sky. It was about 3 or 4am in the morning. I can't remember the exact time.<br><br>Then it happened. As usual, first came the voices followed by the hapless condition of being immobilize. But I was ready and soon managed to break free from its grips. I quickly sat up, turned to my buddy to make sure he is okay. Then I saw them Â… two black hands holding down my buddyÂ’s legs above his kneecaps. There was no body, no head or face, just two black hands. I stared at them for quite a while too afraid to move. Then suddenly they disappeared.<br><br>Soon my buddy woke up but I was too shocked to tell him about the hands. Besides, I donÂ’t think he would believe me. As we were making our way to the guardhouse, he suddenly turned around and told me, Â“You wouldnÂ’t believe this but just now I was unable to move. It was as if something was holding me down to the ground. I tried calling you but I was unable to make any sound. Luckily this dreadful feeling went away after a while.Â”<br><br>Tell me about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
