            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by DeadPoet:</div><div class="quote_body">I think most of you here have encountered this phenomenon before i.e. you Â“wake upÂ” in the middle of the night and find ypurself paralysis. Not only are you unable to move, you are also unable to talk. The strange thing is you know when it is coming; it may makes its presence known with a high pitch sound, or occasionally with some unintelligent noises. Often you fight back by kicking or giving out a yell. Of course this can easily be explained by the condition of  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis" rel="nofollow">sleeping paralysis</a>. I believe this explanation easily accounts for most of my countless encounters. I say most because two such encounters were so bizarre that I find it difficult to explain with sleeping paralysis.<br><br>Both encounters took place while I was serving my NS in Camp X.  The first story took place during a routine patrol within the camp. Camp X is different from the other camps because it is located within a security area. No lights are allowed after dark. You performed your guard duties in pitch darkness. (Maybe except for the guardhouse and the guardsÂ’ sleeping barrack)<br><br>Although it was against the rule but guards on patrol usually try to take a short nap before reporting back to the guardhouse. So there I was with my buddy on our back trying to get some sleep in the middle of a T-junction under the open sky. It was about 3 or 4am in the morning. I can't remember the exact time.<br><br>Then it happened. As usual, first came the voices followed by the hapless condition of being immobilize. But I was ready and soon managed to break free from its grips. I quickly sat up, turned to my buddy to make sure he is okay. Then I saw them Â… two black hands holding down my buddyÂ’s legs above his kneecaps. There was no body, no head or face, just two black hands. I stared at them for quite a while too afraid to move. Then suddenly they disappeared.<br><br>Soon my buddy woke up but I was too shocked to tell him about the hands. Besides, I donÂ’t think he would believe me. As we were making our way to the guardhouse, he suddenly turned around and told me, Â“You wouldnÂ’t believe this but just now I was unable to move. It was as if something was holding me down to the ground. I tried calling you but I was unable to make any sound. Luckily this dreadful feeling went away after a while.Â”<br><br>Tell me about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div></blockquote>Camp X??? Come on, why don't you say the name? There is nothing secretive about ghost stories in army camps... Well unless your camp is some ultra secret camp that no one heard before or is supposed to know about.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is the other one. Also happened at OCH.<br><br>Some of my friends went to OCH to explore after their bbq at the beach. While they were walking in there, they saw a security guard walking towards them. They thought, jia lat, kena caught already. But the security guard just walk towards them and smiled.<br><br>He started a conversation with them and told them about the different rooms in OCH. Like where the mortuary is, the surgery room and all these. They talked for quite sometime than he excuse himself saying he need to patrol round the area.<br><br>My friends den continued walking around and tried to find the room which the guard mention just now. When they were walking, it suddenly dawn upon them that how come in places like these got security guard. And the guard being a chi, should be more or less superstitious, how come dare to work in this kind of places.<br><br>Than they also thought for awhile and realise that not only did the guard not scold them, he even introduce them around and allowed them to carry on walking. If this is the case, he don even need to go around patrolling.<br><br>They decided to find the guard and ask him. After walking about 15 mins round the compound, they couldnt find him. Not a single soul was in sight. They quickly rush off and started praying for their safety.<br><br></div>

As we had to use another room cuz the band was using the music room. By the time we ended the practice, the band had left and it was around 6:45pm, the sky was darkening...So to quicken things up, I ran to lock the music room myself..As i went in to double check that everything was in place, i heard a group of girls chatting and laughing in the store room that we kept our Guzhengs..As majority of the members are girls, I thought nothing of it and went ahead to push open the door and join them..But when i pushed opened the door, the room was eerily quiet, lights off, fans off...I got shocked but still managed to pluck up the courage to lock the room door and ran out...<br><br>Thankfully, my friends decided to come to the music room to find me...Since then, I always tell my members not to go there by themselves..BTW, the school was very new but seems that the feng shui not very good..within months of moving there, alot of things happened...*shudders*</div>

We bought a Buddha face sculpture recently and they were talking about it and this friend was telling us to be careful with such stuff coz his friend bought one before and there was something in it and it caused havoc in his house (ours is clean and no free resident  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  )<br><br>Anyway, they drank alot and after that they went home. SO was almost drunk so he said he is going to bed, whereas I went to play WoW  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>See, if SO is sleeping, I turn off the lights of the whole house and only the desk light at my study is on.<br><br>Around midnight, I heard some noises in the kitchen (btw when I play WoW, I wear headsets coz we communicate with a mic)<br><br>I called out to my hubby but no reply. I looked back and it's dark and I can't see anything.<br><br>I thought my imagination is playing tricks on me and I ignored it coz I didn't feel any chills down my spine (I tend to feel that if something else is around) Anyway, I couldn't help thinking if there was something especially after the story I heard earlier in the day.<br><br>Anyway we were talking last evening and SO said he woke up to vomit then went to the kitchen to take a drink but he is too drunk to remember anything else<br><br>So he is my ghost  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
