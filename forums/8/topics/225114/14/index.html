This reminds me of a story of my ex-colleague.<br><br>He said he was at P..... Princess hotel (bangkok) with his family. They got 2 rooms. So, after checking in.. they all gathered in 1 room to play cards.. and watched TV. But the TV kept changing channels by itself. It'll change from Channel 1, to channel 2 and so on until it reach the end, then repeats from Channel 1. And the volume went from low to very high to very low and very high again.<br><br>My ex-colleague thot the TV was spoilt. Asked the technician to come and check. As soon as the technician stepped into their room, the TV was back to normal. The technician could not find anything wrong with the TV. As soon as the technician went away, the TV started its antics again. My ex-colleague and family were a little spooked. Decided to turn the TV off and not touch it.<br><br>That night.. they were all asleep. My ex-colleague's wife woke up in the middle of the night and found my ex-colleague in a daze.. and then he got up to walk out of the room.. like he was sleep walking. His wife was a little worried and called out to him. Then he "woke" up. He said he did not know anything at all. And he did not have any sleep-walking before, ever..<br><br>The whole family checked out immediately the next day..</div></blockquote>Hohoho I heard stories that this hotel is haunted before but it is very popular with Singaporeans leh<br><br>So far touch wood the hotels I stay in Bangkok I have no experiences</div>

His captain one again, immediately odered that the room be opened and searched. Then, at a corner of the room where its quite gloomy, they found the captain's wife body chained to a pipe.<br><br>Till today, no one on board could explain how did she manage to get in there because the room is alway lock and only authorised personnels could get in. My teacher however firmly believe that its because the ship is jealous of the captain's wife and hence chained her to a corner of the ship.<br><br>Believe or not, its up to you. </div></blockquote>like that millions of women had died on ships already.. our forefathers also come by ships.. aint your grandmother too?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hahaz.okay..<br>i was from tanjong katong secondary school and there used to be this servant who was very well-known in my school and we called him - Mr Manap. He was a friendly guy who's quite old..and the reason he's well-known is because he could see ghosts. Every time we passed by his room (yes! he got a room of his own!), we'd hear him chanting..den playing around with his beads... sometimes in the morning, i could see him walking his bicycle to school from the side gate while talking to himself. Spooky eh?<br>and one day, (saturday) he died mysteriously. what happened? the police said he died of heart attack but it was impossible. He was a fit guy! we couldnt buy the story. some said he was attacked by ghosts of the school(heh..we do have a lot you know), others said it was jus his time to go. Also, a week or so before his death, he actually requested to take a group photo with the staff of the school. that's why there was still his picture in our school magazine last year. it was as though he knew he was gonna die.<br>he passed away in the canteen, near to the bookshop. any ex-tk people would know him ba..=)</div>

It is derived from the Diamond Universe Nine Assemblies mandala of Shingon Buddhism. It is also used by other Buddhist sects, especially in Japan; some Taoists and practitioners of Shinto, Korean Shamanism, and Chinese traditional religion; and in folk-magic throughout East Asia.<br><br>Technically the word "Kuji-in" refers only to the hand postures (mudra) and their related incantations (mantra). The related practice of making nine cuts--five horizontal and four vertical, alternating--in the air with the finger or on paper with a brush is known as "kuji kiri," nine syllable cuts. In Japanese folk-magic and Onmyodo, the nine cuts are often made over writing or a picture, to gain control of the object named or pictured. Thus, a sailor wishing to be protected from drowning might write them over the kanji for "sea" or "water".<br><br>The Kuji-in practice symbolizes that all the forces of the universe are united against evil; because of this, it was often used by the common people for luck when traveling, especially in the mountains.<br><br>In Japanese, the nine syllables are: Rin, Pyou, Tou, Sha, Kai, Jin, Retsu, Zai, Zen. If the nine cuts are then made, as is sometimes done, the syllable Kou is sometimes spoken.</div>
