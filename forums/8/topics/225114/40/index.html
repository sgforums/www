            <div class='col-md body'>The story that I'm going to relate here was experienced by 2 person at the same timing.<br><br>My bf was doing his national service over at the SCDF BRTC. After he enlisted on a tuesday, the first book out date falls on friday in the same week. During the stay in period, his room was left empty and everything was left intact.<br><br>On the very first book out day (friday) I went down to BRTC to fetch him and proceed to his house where I stayed over for the weekends. When it was time to turn in for the night, we chit chatted away on the bed before falling asleep near midnight. I was sleeping on the left side of the bed and him on the right.<br><br>After a very short interval, a presence suddenly wakes me up from my sleepy mode. I could make out exactly where that presence is, it stood over at the left side of the bed where my leg lies. It remains at the position for a few seconds before shifting away. This encounter of feeling a sudden presence totally freaks me out because never in my 20 years that I felt such a thing.<br><br>I thought the presence went away as fast as it came but what happened during the next few seconds, really startled me. My bf suddenly jerked from his sleep. The feeling is like u are being thrown off a building in a sub-consciousness state and upon reaching the ground, u wake up. He refused to tell me what had happened although he was sweating profusely  from the encounter and told me to get back to sleep.<br><br>When the next morning came, I relate to him that I felt a presense in his room the night before. The following answer which came out from him was "at the left side of the bed right ?" It turned out that he felt the presence at the same time that I did and afterwards something hold on to him. He wasn't able to move an inch, the whole of his body was paralyzed and at that same instance,<br>he heard noises very closely to his ears. It sound as if there were a few people talking at the same time in lightning speed. It disappeared very quickly, it was only after that he managed to break free from the body paralysis and that was the time when he jerked.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

I gather this from my own theory where only sightings appear to scare people over at night more than in the day  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>His was only a three months stayed in for the basic training course. From the period of tuesday to friday which is his first week in BRTC, I believe that the door to his room was closed.

            <div class='col-md body'>will bad fengshui of the room attracts those things ?<br><br>Initially my bf's bed was placed right in the middle of the room facing the opposite side of the wall. On the wall itself hanged a framed jiasaw puzzle and the pc is on the left side of the puzzle beside his window. With the door, closet on the right and tv set, window on the left.<br><br>With this fengshui, theres a high possibility that he encounter sleep paralysis which people term it as "bei gui ya". When we moved the bed to one corner of the room just beside the wall, which is more comfy for us while watching dvds late into the night ... nothing like this ever happen again.<br><br>strange ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

However, I not sure about the swimming pool part. Maybe it not related.<br><br>If not mistaken, it could be the small taoist temple under a big old tree located in Toa Payoh Central which is still present today. It is located around the row of shop houses blk 177 &amp; 178. I am not sure &amp; cannot remember much about this story. I think the big old tree is suppose to make way for the shop houses. More ever it's location is in the central area, which make one wonders why it was the only tree not cut down during the development.<br><br>Anyway this is not a ghost story <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

However, I not sure about the swimming pool part. Maybe it not related.<br><br>If not mistaken, it could be the small taoist temple under a big old tree located in Toa Payoh Central which is still present today. It is located around the row of shop houses blk 177 &amp; 178. I am not sure &amp; cannot remember much about this story. I think the big old tree is suppose to make way for the shop houses. More ever it's location is in the central area, which make one wonders why it was the only tree not cut down during the development.<br><br>Anyway this is not a ghost story <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div></blockquote>hahaha...scary ma....TYING wun mind rite?? where is he/she anyway???Like so long nvr see him/her le....<br><br>TYING!!!!!!!!

The tray was left outside the room.
