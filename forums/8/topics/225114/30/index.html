            <div class='col-md body'>Was talking to a friend about ghost stories and he shared a couple of stories with me..<br><br>About 10 years back.. my friend J was staying in the east.. (won't reveal the location) he had his friends staying over at his place.. then at about 3-4AM, they decided to take a leisure cycle around the neighbourhood and then head over to the ECP Macs for breakfast.<br><br>There were about 6 of them.. Since there were no cars on the roads, 6 of them were hogging the road. Then behind them came a lady in a bicycle too. all of them made way for the lady and she biked past them.<br><br>In front of them, they saw this lady drop a bunch of letters on the ground and she made a left turn. The 6 of them hurried to chase after the lady. When they turned left (it was on a small hilltop, so they could see the road all the way to the bottom) no one was around. The lady vanished! There was no way the lady could cycle so fast that she reached the end of the road.. They looked back on the ground where the letters had dropped.. ALL of the letters had disappeared as well...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In an army camp somewhere in sg.. 2 guys who are good buddies sleep in bunks next to each other. They usually have the radio turned on to Class95 throughout the whole night... One night.. Guy A went to the toilet.. when he came back, he went to bed immediately covering himself with his blanket. He told guy B that he saw a woman sitting on a chair at the other end of the room humming to the song that was playing on the radio at that very moment. He knew it cannot be one of the guys playing pranks on him because the voice was too feminine.<br><br>The next night.. guy B went to the toilet in the middle of the night. When he came back.. he also saw the woman and he heard her humming to the song playing on the radio. He dashed back onto the bed and covered himself with the blanket...</div>
