            <div class='col-md body'>my mind was like... " frangrance.. like flower.. oh my god ! frangipani ! "<br><br>so i shut my gap and quickened my pace with her. we decided not to walk pass the waterfront theatre terrace so we kept with our path near the sea and almost ran.<br><br>the smell kept with us. all the way until we reached the exit. once we reached the exit, we both flagged down a cab which somehow appeared when we needed it.<br><br>* * * * *<br>the little exit near the round-about and with a phone symbol<br>* * * * *<br><br>we didn't say anything as i sent her home. after telling her to take care, i made my way home, reaching about 1 am. i fell into a deep sleep.<br><br>i dreamt of a lady smiling at me. she was standing a distance away, not within touching distance, but close enough for me to see her smile. i shrugged it off when i woke up, but she came back into my dreams, and she was starting to get closer to me...<br><br>i told my ex about my dreams and she was scared stiff. she told me to place a cactus in my room to scare the lady away. when i asked her why she only screamed at me.<br><br>"JUST DO IT!"<br><br>"ok lo.. no need to scream ma.." i thought while i placed the cactus in my room and prepared to sleep. little did i know i will bring trouble to my ex..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the day after i placed the cactus in my room, my ex refused to call or meet me. i was happy because i could play more games, but this lasted for almost a week. so i was pretty puzzled and went to her place to look for her.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>she looked so pale. i asked her what happened and she said the female spirit was disturbing her. i didn't catch on to her words immediately so i asked,<br>"what spirit ? we didn't do anything last week, did you do anything wrong ?"<br><br>she shook her head and told me that it was ok. she was gone after her grandma had got a bomoh to help out. me being the sotong, i kept prodding her to tell me about the spirit. here's something similar to what she said.<br><br>" that night when you asked me about the passageway, i turned and saw a lady standing inside the passage. and she was baring her teeth in a smile. so i kept quiet and led you away.<br><br>then after we took the pictures of the cbd, i smelled frangipani which meant something dirty was around us, so i gripped your hands and led you away. for once, you noticed i was scared and walked faster.<br><br>then when you told me about your dreams, i knew who the lady was.. i guessed she wanted to harm you, but not immediately, hence the distance being closed slowly.. and when i told you to put the cactus in your room, she got angry and came to disturb me instead.. "<br><br>at this point, i asked her, "but your room got those arabic prayers and a cactus also, how come... "<br><br>"i'm female." i went  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">, and she went  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">, so i realized what she meant. "it just happened to be my weakest time so she managed to follow me in and disturb me. and she was chasing me, and managed to scratch me before my grandma found the bomoh to chase her away.."<br><br>at this point, she showed me her lower back.. 10 short scratch lines from her mid-back to her waist...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>moral of story ? dunno man... just my luck bah.. or rather lack of it.. as my next few stories will explain..</div>
