            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, thanks for sharing...Hmm, this thread seems to be abit dry, no new contributions??<br><br>I have another personal experience that I suddenly recalled.<br><br>Once I had a quarrel with my bf and we went to the staircase area at my block to talk things out...Then suddenly, when we were talking, from the corner of my eyes, I saw a black hooded figure, without face (not very dark/ real) standing on the adjacent flight of steps looking at us. When I actually turned, I saw nothing...<br><br>Even though my bf and I was not at the best of terms at that time, he got concerned when I told him about it. He said what I described resembles that of a Grim reaper (how to spell huh??). And he say that if a person sees that, something bad is going to happen.<br><br>However, luckily, nothing bad actually happened. Some say we see dirty things when we are depressed, but though we were quarrelling, I had seen worst times, so I wasn't THAT depressed.<br><br>My bf and I are fine, (not that I wish for anything to happen, CHOY!!) I am still rather disturbed by what I experienced that night.</div>
