            <div class='col-md body'>This one taken from another forum...<br><br>just 2 days ago TSS (truthspiritualseekers.com) organised an outing to a cemetery at midnite to invite 'good friends' to show themselves. This is a cut n paste from one of the participants:-<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Originally Posted by shleesx13<br>Well I did not know that there were altogether 3 group sessions for this tour. Anyway I took up the first tour because I could not stay up too late. Let me share some interesting stories for my group of 6 people.<br><br>Like all have mentioned, we were briefed by Randall from TSS at pick up point. Very serious, straight to the point regarding the safety and what to expect. When we arrived at site, another detail briefing was done again.<br><br>My first challenge of my life - walking only with a stranger partner into what seems a very dark unknown endless road leading into a Chinese cemetery. I have never tried that before and if I had known that before hand, I would have not joined this tour! To make matter worse, no torchlight was allowed, just the light stick issued to us during briefing. It was the most challenging task for me to do it or back out, I decided to go ahead. This was probably the longest and most challenging walk for me in the dark!<br><br>The road was completely dark, wet and muddy as it had a downpour earlier in the day. Trying to keep your shoe dry is a task especially when the only light source is from your light stick. Finding the right path was a challenge as your sense of direction is completely lost. My partner, somewhat younger than me, was also complaining to me as we stroll along the road not knowing what to expect ahead of us. It was the longest 10 minutes of my life, the fear, the strange sounds, the unexpected, the challenges and the what-is-next coming fear that really pushes you to your own limit.........<br><br>Thankfully right deep into the road we saw many lights. The road ahead was lilted with many candles and joss sticks on both sides of the road path. The smoke and smell created a heavenly eerie in the air, coupled with the humid weather and our sweat which is like a running tap makes me very uncomfortable. We were in a big open space which acts as hold up area. I notice they have Â‘fencedÂ’ up a big area like 40 X 40 meter with white strings forming a square. We were been led inside this perimeter! The surrounding dancing candle lights Â‘exposedÂ’ many Chinese tombs Â‘starringÂ’ at us. The old tombs looked really 'cold' and 'unfriendly' but hey, they are supposed to be the resting place for the dead, not for the living.......<br><br>Well at least there is human presence, a welcome sight for both of us. Few helpers were on site dressed in white T-Shirt (What a joke, they are dressed in white for special effect?). A guy briefs us - his instructions are simple, all of us are assigned a spot alone with a candle and drink. We will just spend our time sitting down, relax and try to spot what we came here for. Anytime we need to pee, or something is not right, we just have to raise our light sticks and they will come to us. At no time are we allowed to leave our place and wander off. This is the 'safe zone'!<br><br>Once again Randall told us that for the first time, the participants will get the chance of our life time to have their 3rd eye 'open' by their Spiritual Advisor on site. But it's like 'open' at your own risk as there is no assurance that the 3rd eye can be 'close' after that. It's at your own risk. Only 2 warriors from the group went for it!<br><br>Their Spiritual Advisor, which is dressed in a Thai monk robe, was sited with many ritual stuff of which I have not seen before. His sharp eyes looked very focus and surprising he spoke very good English (Later I found out from the TSS directors that he is actually a Singaporean!). He asked the 2 volunteer again very sternly whether they are sure they wanted to 'open' their 3rd eye. The confirmation was given and they knelt before him. It was an interesting scene - he applied a brownish but clear liquid from a small plastic bottle and drips into their eyes, chanted something and spread the liquid onto their forehead between the eyes.<br><br>We were than led to our respective position. All of us are separated and I sat facing the tombs. It was nothing but darkness out there. Shortly I could hear loud chanting from their Spiritual Advisor. It was in a language I could not understand. I did what I was told, relax myself and focus my eyes towards the open.<br><br>Many minutes went by. The dogs barking could be heard very clearly down the roads. As the chanting gets louder, the crazy barking from the dogs intensified. As I sat waiting nervously for Â‘somethingÂ’ to appear, I felt my area getting chill. I could smell a strange fragrant, somewhat different from their ritual powderÂ’s smell. At times it smells very bad, like as if something was turning bad. I can feel my hair slowly standing up. I strained hard to see ahead but still cannot really see anything. For whatever reason, I felt the urge to stand up and go out of the Â‘borderÂ’ set up by TSS. I hold back this urge and continued to relax my mind. Many things flashed over my mind and I begin to image things moving. I saw many red lights like a pair of eyes flashing here and then gone. It was like now you see, and now you donÂ’t. Red color seems to be the favorite over here with occasional green and white flashing. Was it fire flies? I asked my self but if it is fire flies, it would be flashing non-stop and you should see the insect flying continuously. At times I swear I could see some dark shadow figures moving from one place to another. Was this what I came for?<br><br>It was interesting as I turned my head to steal a glance of the other participant. The guy who had Â‘openÂ’ his 3rd eye was just sitting few meters away from me facing the small path. His reaction seems to tell a thousand words as one can see he is very uncomfortable and smoking non-stop one after another. His sweat on his body can be seen from my side. Wow must be damn happening for him.<br><br>I want to thank TSS and the rest for this wonderful experience which I will never forget. Thought I felt at times very nervous, it was done in a very professional way and never at any time I felt any danger. Well done boys keep it up. I looked forward to the next tour to come.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just had an experience.<br><br>Me and a group of friends were exploring an old tunnel complex (secret place). We reached around 11pm. Was completely dark, we had to use torchlight, bash into the forest. So around 11:30pm we reached the tunnels, and we went into the first room, then some guy commented he felt 'very dangerous' and we turned back to explore the area. When we were exiting, a friend said he heard something from one of the other rooms. While going into the forest, someone remarked he smelled a fragrance, after a while I smelled it too. A very faint fragrance, on and off.<br><br>After a few minutes we went back into the tunnel, and went down to explore with bright torches. At first was nothing, then we went back to the first room to rest. I heard something from outside the room, like someone talking a few words, or might just be an animal.<br><br>We made a second trip down, and did something crazy. We split into groups of 2 people, each group at a part of the tunnel. 2 people were a few metres apart. Then we switched off all lights and sat in the darkness for 10 minutes. Then there was this "BONG" sound from the end of the tunnel. Sounded metallic, without an echo or resonating sound. This really startled me. Then the "bongs" became more frequent and louder. Finally the 10 minutes were up and we left. As I was climbing out, I heard a knocking noise from the same end of the tunnel, this time a different sound.<br><br>Then I ventured in for the third time into the tunnel and repeated the experiment, this time I sat near the end of the tunnel. Lights off again. After about 3 minutes, the "bong" noises sounded again, this time much louder, and louder as each sound came, and as frequent, as fast as 12 seconds per sound. Then I felt uneasy, a little freaky and signaled to my friend to move, we moved about a metre away from the end, and turned our backs to the end of the tunnel.<br><br>It was at this position that I heard soft footsteps behind me, someone stepping on the wet sand (there was sand inside the tunnel). And I felt as if someone was walking behind me, my back felt a tingling sensation. I was only about 50cm from the wall. It was only around 3 minutes later the next "bong" came, this time much softer. I also heard very faint music at a point in time.<br><br>Finally 10 minutes was over and we went back to the first room and discussed our stories. My friend who was in front of me said he hear deep breathing behind him (in direction of the tunnel end). Another friend down the tunnel (near the entrance) said he felt as if someone walked pass him. About the music, because we had a torch with radio, but I don't know if the torch was inside the tunnel at the time.<br></div>
