            <div class='col-md body'>Ok let me write my story.. Heard this from my guy friend who studied in that school and its his personal experience..<br><br>This is a guy school in the east side.. my guy friend and his group of friends (6 of them) once stayed back one evening because they promised the teacher they will finish their pottery for their O levels (or exam..) the teacher had asked them to stay back and try to finish it by the next morning.<br><br>So there was a smaller room inside the pottery room where it houses the kiln. The outside is where they put their finished work to dry. So the bunch of them sat in the smaller room and they had the radio on.. working on their pottery.<br><br>Suddenly, 1 of them said.. "hey.. hey guys.. did you hear that??" they said "What?" and then "sccreecchh" They heard the sound of chairs being pulled across the room.. they opened the door and looked outside. No one.. It was already about 8 in the evening. By right there shouldn't be anyone else in the school. They closed the door and continued to work.<br><br>"scrreeecchhhh...!!" The sound of chairs pulled across the room again! All of them heard it. So 1 of them said "look. let's take a break. Go outside, sit on the chairs and there is 6 of us. Whoever is playing the prank sure cannot play with us all around".<br><br>So they all went out, switched off the radio and then sat on the chairs and just waited.. They were all seated in a row.. facing the windows, looking at their potteries that were at the window sill drying..<br><br>For few minutes.. there wasn't anything. No one pulling chairs, no sound.. Then all of them saw the pots move.. as if someone is pushing the pots. CRASH! 1 by 1 they saw the pots crashing on the floor as if an invisible hand pushed the pots down.<br><br>They just ran! They were really terrified. It was obvious that no one could be standing outside because it was on the 2nd floor and it was facing the canal. The 6 of them spent the night sleeping on the bus stop outside the school.<br><br>The next morning, their teacher woke them up. The teacher said that he was driving past and saw the boys sleeping at the bus stop. They tried to explain what has happened the night before to thier teacher. But their teacher did not believe them. They said they weren't lying. Why would they destroy their own pots? They need their pots to pass their exam!!<br><br>The teacher still did not believe them. Walked all of them back to the pottery room to take a look. They can't believe their eyes. All their pots were not broken at all! Until today.. they still believe in what they saw the night before...</div>
