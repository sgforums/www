            <div class='col-md body'>Time to share mine<br><br>I remembered when I was younger, Around Pimary school to early primary school<br><br>My brother during that time was either in camp or working night shift, So I slept alone<br><br>I would sometimes wake up in the midnight of the night with or without the lights turned up.<br><br>Guess where I would be?<br><br>STANDING on the top of my bed and I would open my eyes just like that in that state!!<br><br>But I don't think my house haunted lar, Cause I'm home alone most of the time with my dog.. But when my dog came, Those things stopped happening<br><br>I used to have a dream where I would lie on a railway track and watch as a train run past through me BUT I wouldn't die.. But that's only when I'm very sick.. I get that dream even now, Its a recurring nightmare from my childhood<br><br>Whenever I'm sick, I don't dare to sleep..<br><br>Last time, My mother say I suffer from very bad sleepwalk, Once I even walked to the front door and opened the metal gate before she woke up and stopped me, I do recall one time when I woke up sitting in the kitchen chair with the lights all turned on<br><br>My mom took me to a chinese bomoh or whatever, He said its because I slept with my hand pressing my forehead but I never do that at all..<br><br>Once again, Even after drinking all the talisman, I still sleepwalk.. But after my dog came, All these stopped<br><br>When I was young, I think 8 or something, 2 cousins came to my house then my siblings, me and my cousins were in my bro and my room..<br><br>Then the TV outside was turned on, So my sister ask my cousin go turn off, He went out awhile and came back saying that my dad was watching it<br><br>Then my sister say my father not at home, She ownself went out and true enough, My father wasn't home BUT she say she smell my father's odour.. then we were quite scared.. but didn't tell anyone<br><br>Last time, Me and my same age cousin always come my house play PS, Once we were in my room playing, My sister was alone in the kitchen washing dishes.. Then she suddenly shouted something about don't play lar.. We go see and she scold us for walking past her BUT WE WERE IN OUR ROOM!!!<br><br>Then my mom brought her to some bomoh and he said it was a god not a ghost or whatever...<br><br>I noticed all these things stopped happening when my dog came, It's like last time can feel presence one, Now can't feel anything anymore<br><br>When I was secondary 1, I was in SJAB.. there was a camp, I woke up in the night and saw a human like figure pacing up and down in the middle of the class, I got scared and closed my eye and try to sleep<br><br>Then that night, I woke up around 5am to switch on the light and went back to sleep <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
