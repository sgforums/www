So he will ask ppl to buy when they go that country. But whenever he buy back, my cousin will start to feel unwell. She will get fever, diarrhea, vomitting all these.<br><br>When they bring her see the doctor, the doctor will just prescribe some normal medicine for her but cannot seem to get well. By than, the doctors also just say wait for a while more cause they dare not give the stronger ones to her. They than visited those temple inside the ppl.<br><br>They made a trip to my uncle hse and found those figurines to have some kind of aura around it. My cousin belong to the group where the internal energy(i forgot what issit already, something to do with the soul or what) is weak. So cannot get in touch with this type of stuff or they will clash together.<br><br>After my uncle remove those figurines, my cousin got well immediately.</div>

He described the figure as white from head to toe and appear as a guy...The thing was, that particular classroom was used by the deceased student previously...Perhaps this once incident might not mean anything, but appearently, none other classrooms had this white figure...<br><br>Then, that night, they went to sleep in another blocks of classrooms. The guys on the ground floor and the girls directly one floor above..The classrooms were near the back staircase but the gates to this staircase was locked that night for security reasons.. The next morning, a girl (who of coursed was supposed to be sleeping upstairs) was found in the boys room...She had no sleep walking history, and even the lighest sleeper didn't sense her coming down that night...<br><br>They were told not to spread but of course, how can such stories be kept well among the student bodies...<br><br>I have sinced graduated from that school for a few years, but when i travel past there at night, it never fails to give me the creeps...</div>
