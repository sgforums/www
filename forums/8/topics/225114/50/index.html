(only recently i realise it's a homage to lord buddha) so again using super broken english, hokkien n alot of hand gestures, i understood him telling us to pray for ourselves.<br><br>so after temple trip, went back to hotel n we were like  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> . den i finally showed my true self, i told ivan n ken i no balls n went to another room.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>within 5 mins, they also appeared in dat room which i was in. i asked them wat happened, ivan said<br><br>" CCB ! u ask me niam geng, i niam already whole room become disco !! lights on n off <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> "<br><br>so i did de bravest thing in my life up to den. i told them i go n take our stuff n we go change room.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> but before i entered de room, i saw dis school mate knock on de door n saying something. i was curious cos dat was his room, so i asked him why he knock on his own room door. he told me "so i wun disturb them lo"<br><br>AH !<br><br>so i said "ooooorrrrhhhhhhhhh" n den did same thing before going in n packing all our stuff n rushing out in like 3 mins. lucky never take out alot of stuff..<br><br>went to hotel counter n request change room, de guy din even say anything n said ok. so we 3 guys went to new room, but dis time i knocked before entering lo.<br><br>only when we were on de plane den i overheard my teachers gossiping about our incident. de hotel ppl told them de room actually got case of female accidentally taking too much sleeping pills n dying.. n quite common for ppl to be disturbed by her.. when i tried to ask them for more info, they told me they only knew so much cos de hotel ppl dun wan to say more..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>moral of story : always inform de possible occupants of ur temp stay so they wun be disturbed n disturb u back..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>some tips for hotel room occupants.. remember, these things will only be applicable if you feel uncomfortable. if it's a normal room, even if you dun do anything, nothing will happen de.. but of cos.. who knows..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>guidelines for a ghost-less hotel staying...<br><br><strong>1. dun be greedy</strong><br><br>logical reasoning will save u alot of trouble. if the place is cheaper than the average, something must be amiss. so if you still go ahead with the choice, please be alert and change rooms whenever you feel something is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">slightly</span></span> wrong.<br><br><strong>2. greet them</strong><br><br>simple. knock on door or use door bell, when enter the room just say out "execuse me" + your name + you staying for how long. if wan to add other things, it is up to you lo..<br><br><strong>3. mirrors</strong><br><br>mirrors have sometimes been held as a possible connection point between the ghostly and human worlds. and even if you dun believe dat, when you suddenly wake up to see your own reflection, you might scare yourself silly.<br><br>so if you see the mirror directly opposite your bed, recommend you 3 options..<br><br>a. change room<br>b. move the mirror<br>c. cover the mirror<br><br><strong>4. look for religious books</strong><br><br>they are common in all hotels. unless they are opened. then please check around to see if there are any rumours about that room.. but when they are opened, most probably is.. the previous occupant flip open to read.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><strong>5. dun leave an empty bed neat n tidy</strong><br><br>unless u wan them to be there resting as well. if not, when you have an empty bed, mess it up !<br><br>particularly if it's a big sized bed and you only one person ah.. mess up the other side.. if not middle of the night, you might feel the empty side sink down.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><strong>6. dun place your shoes neat n tidy</strong><br><br>this is to prevent the bros n sis to rest in them n we unknowingly disturb them.<br><br>but if you ever had the experience of finding your shoes go somewhere else when you placed them there before..<br><br>congrats ! someone DID visit you in the middle of the night !<br><br><strong>7. check for 'left-overs'</strong><br><br>simply said, dun have anything suspicious in your room <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">before</span></span> you entered it. although it may have been left by previous occupant or by hotel, just check with hotel counter.<br><br>especially weird and scary stuff like.. red high heel shoes, expensive looking clothes, etc.. better just to hand over to counter.. scarly the stuff still have left over energy from them.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>of cos, got alot of stories regarding such hotel incidents, but i share slowly.. seeya guys later !   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
