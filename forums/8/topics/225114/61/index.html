I was sweating because I was scared the THING was back for revenge.<br><br>" dear.. save Siti. " I half smirked at the remark as suddenly everyone was thinking I am the hero when I was actually scared stiff.<br><br><strong> " help me.." </strong><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>" GET OUT FROM MY ROOM !" </strong></span><br><br>" WE ARE OUT OF YOUR ROOM ! " I shouted across the room. The eyes staring back at me was full of daggers and made me shiver uncontrollably. However, I tried to scare it away with logic. Obviously I failed.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>" I AM NOT GOING TO BE EASY THIS TIME,, " </strong></span><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>" IF YOU DARE... MUAHAHAHAHA " </strong></span><br><br>The rest of the girls suddenly decided to take out their handphones and try calling for help. My ex also tried to help by praying. The guys just looked at me as though waiting for my call. I decided to do the same thing again. I was going to pray. This time round, I was going to pray out loud. Before I could do it however, Siti moved and walked towards me.<br><br>Courage and logic do not mix. I was thinking I should stay put and try my best to push this THING out again. But my courage failed me and I was backing away from Siti just like the rest of the group.<br><br>" how ? phone still cannot work !? "<br>" this time die liao la ! "<br>" someone do something lei !!! "<br>" dear.. "<br>" ok, on the count of 3, we run for the door.. "<br>" In the name of the Lord.. "<br><br>I was going mad thinking of how to handle the situation when I saw the guys suddenly ran towards Siti and wrestled her to the ground. More accurately, they tried. They failed and they ran back to the group hiding behind me.<br><br>" OK, I don't know who you are, but if we are disturbing you, we apologize and we'll leave immediately in the morning ok. Just leave my friend alone "<br><br>A smile spread on Siti's face as she said :<br><span style="color: red;"><strong>" NO ... " </strong></span><br><br>" Then I will pray and drive you out again.. "<br>I was joking of course because I wasn't sure if I could do it again. Then again, my friend was at risk and I couldn't just leave her there like that.<br><span style="color: red;"><strong>" I AM NOT SCARED.. I WILL SLOWLY DRAIN YOUR FRIEND'S LIFE AWAY.. " </strong></span><br><br>Then I started my prayer out loud. My friends just stood behind me and they muttered their own religious prayers. Supposedly in an attempt to help me. My prayer wasn't working as well as it should be and the THING knew it.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>" HOW CAN SUCH PRAYERS WORK ? DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH ! " </strong></span><br><br>I continued praying.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>" MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA !!! " </strong></span><br><br>I continued praying..<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>" GIVE UP !! " </strong></span><br><br>I continued praying louder..<br><br>And then silence.. Siti was suddenly lying down in the place where she last stood. None of us were brave enough to go over and do anything. And I was exhausted. So we just waited for awhile... I remembered thinking how come I so lucky encounter such stuff... After awhile, I went over to Siti and shook her.<br><br>Her eyes opened up and looked at me.

            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like interest in this topic has dried off. I shall just post 1 of the incident relayed by a friend to close off.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>My friend and a colleague of his went back to campus during a holiday because they had some work to finish. After some discussion and splitting of work load, he went back to his office and left his colleague in another room to work.<br><br>As soon as he stepped in, he heard the phone ringing. So he picked it up, and its his colleague. She sounded flustered.<br><br>"There are banging noises coming from the ceiling! ... and footsteps outside but I can see no one!"<br><br>She was very scared and wanted my friend to quickly come back to her room. So my friend set the phone down and quickly made his way back. He couldn't hear or see anything as he approached the room. When he stepped inside, there were no disturbances as well...<br><br>So he proceeded to calm her down, and tell her it's just in her imagination, etc. Whatever it was has stopped anyway. After some time, she calmed down and my friend felt safe enough to go back to his office.<br><br>Now, it so happens that this room the girl was in, has a dead tree outside the window. There were a row of trees but only the one closest to this room was dead.<br><br>So my friend went back to his office. After a while, his colleague dashed into his office. She was frightened and shocked. My friend calmed her again, and she told him the noises got worse and louder after he left. She was sure it's not just her imagination.<br><br>My friend later revealed that they soon got used to such events. And they only seem to happen to someone when they are alone...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, I have another story to relate regarding that campus. The spirits there seem to like unlocking doors when people are not around. But I forgot to ask my friend what type of locks they use.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>This is incident was experienced by a lab tech. His lab is in one end of a U-shaped building. So one evening, he was going off duty to meet his colleagues for dinner. He closed the lab and locked the door as usual and made his way to the other end of the building to meet his colleagues.<br><br>By the time he reached the other side of the U, he looked back at the lab and he saw the lights were on! So he took a closer look and he saw, to his surprise, there were students in the lab using the facilities. This made him mad, so he huffed back to the lab and burst in.<br><br>He scolded the students "Can't you see the lab is closed? How did you unlock the door?"<br><br>The students were puzzled.<br><br>"But the lab was not locked, we thought it was open so we came in to use."<br><br>Apparently the unlocking of doors became a very serious problem at one time. Because security officers would carry out checks at night and find that all the doors were not locked. They even went so far as to issue out a warning notice to the faculties, telling them about negligent behaviour, protecting campus property, etc. etc.<br><br>My friends faculty replied that they would claim responsibility if a few doors were not locked. But if all the doors were unlocked?? The case was dropped after that.</div>
