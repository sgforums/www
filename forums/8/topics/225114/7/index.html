Suddenly she heard a sound coming from the roof of the car. Thumping sound, as if someone was being thrown on top of the roof again and again. She freaked out and decided to get out of the car. She dare not screamed, yet she dare not even open the door.<br><br>10 minutes pass by, a police-car came by and started slowing down. As the car appeared closer to the stationary car, the policeman then sped up the car and drove to about 100 m away from them. One of the police came out from the car and shouted to the lady to come out of her car and run towards them without looking back...<br><br>The lady obeyed, although she was still trembling with fear, she did not look back and kept on running towards the policeman. She reached the cop car and decided to turn back when to her horror she saw her husband's body decapitated. The pontianaks were banging his head on top of the roof of the car and sucking the blood from the detached neck... </div></blockquote>this is a famous north south highway story leh</div>
