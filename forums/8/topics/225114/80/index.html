            <div class='col-md body'>okie!!! here's my contribution:<br><br>1st story of personnal experience.<br><br>Happens in Tekong during Dec 03.  My coy is N , &amp; as you know is neither here nor there the bunk location.  My sect &amp; me got experience some funny things...even my sargeant said they hear too much stories from previous batch &amp; told us to ignore when we sense something not right. Ok the story comes.....<br><br>At 1 of the night after training (as i was in PTP batch), the following morning, my sect leader ask did we hear soldiers marching in the middle of night.  Some of us hear it &amp; it doesn't make any sense for marching in the middle of the night......this is 1st incident....<br><br>2nd incident in regards to me.  As my bunk is in 2nd floor middle sec , facing the door out is facing orion &amp; behind is basketball court.  At 1 night, cos too urgent to go toilet, lasy to call buddy, so ownself go.  The funny things starts.  Once i step out of toilet.  IMMEDIATELY i can smell FRANGIPANI <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> .  I sense something not right as i was in 2nd storey &amp; no way there are flowers at my area &amp; i quickly went back silently.<br><br>3rd incident revolves my bmt buddy, whom a chinese, during 1 of the book in, brought some chinese desert.  As you know some chinese desert got pork in it but he not sure got or not so he put in his cupboard.  Suddenly that night while sleeping, i face his cupboard &amp; i can hear banging noise <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> .<br><br>Well this is the stories i had for Tekong....next....SELARANG CAMP.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As i OOC frm PTP due to back injury, i posted to selarang camp 1 of the unit there.  The creepy part is<br><br>1.  My bunk buddy has "3rd eye"<br>2.  OUR BUNK IS HAUNTED<br><br>Why do i say that?  When i 1st posted there, i was curious of why whenever he sleeps alone, he would blast the radio in the bunk and open the door BIG IG.  Our bunk is the biggest &amp; is the only 1 that is tiled.  Initially when i moved my stuff there ( cos my unit is stay-in unit, duh....), i do not know abt it (blur blur as usual).  Is only when at night while sleeping then i sense something not right....<br><br>Whenever you cover with blanket, you can only feel the blanket right????  NNOOOOO for me....when i sleep, i can sense static around my leg area, as if someone like sitting on my lap <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  .  At 1 point of the night, i can feel the static up to my neck area!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> As if the "thing" wants to hug me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>The following day before work starts, he ask me whether i got sense something unusual &amp; he told me his part of the story.  Nw this is credible as whenever new ppl came to our bunk they will sense this also......<br><br>The next incident is when we book in on 1 of the sun night , when we switch on the bunk lights after we sign in funny thing is.... ONLY OUR AREA SURROUNDING BED &amp; CUPBOARD IS WET!!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">   And our shoes/boots are not wet.  Or bunk window is facing the road while i'm on 2nd floor, beside is smoking point &amp; toilet and below is Gym, there's no way water could come in and forget to tell you all  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  our bed is the 1st 2 nearest to the window corridor...creepy eh.......<br><br>The next incident was, at 1 night, we are bored, so me, him &amp; COPA (also sleep together in the same bunk) play scrabble.  After playing until 10+pm, my buddy suggest we al to sleep &amp; he went off to sleep immediately ( told you he got 3rd eye, so confirm somthing is not right).  We followed his idea and sleep.  The following day, he told me that ard that timing, he saw a young girl outside the window pillar that is facing the road &amp; is watching us playing while FLOATING !!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>The last incident is kinda weird......we are so tired tat both of us set alarm for the morning 5bx, funy thing was, our alarm did not ring, nobody wake us up &amp; both of us wake up at 7am sharp .  And nobody knows that we aren't reporting for the 5bx!!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Time travel???? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>The next 1...Maju camp..(cos shift camp ma....)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The last incident i had was at BB Sembawang campsite during 1 of the youth camp there.  On the last day i didn't really sleep while most ppl slept.  So i brought my 6510, bring a chair and sit at the corridor area waiting for sunrise.  while looking sideway with my eyes, i somewhat can see an blurry image.  Just at the same time, the radio soung play was Ememeim.  In th emiddle of the song, suddenly i can hear an evil laughter  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> , &amp; the thing told me that he knws i am here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> . i was frooze&amp; can feel a sense of coldness also <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> .<br><br>Immediately i went back to bunk and when back home, i replay the song frm com again n again to hear whether there is the voice or not but none. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

It was evening around 7plus. And I was inside my room which was facing the carpark. My comp was beside the window which was wide open. There was no trees outside. I was living on the 3rd storey. The smell lasted for a few seconds though. But I had goosebumps all over. So, it might be a passing, floating spirit.</div>

My coy is N , &amp; as you know is neither here nor there the bunk location.  My sect &amp; me got experience some funny things...even my sargeant said they hear too much stories from previous batch &amp; told us to ignore when we sense something not right. Ok the story comes.....<br><br>At 1 of the night after training (as i was in PTP batch), the following morning, my sect leader ask did we hear soldiers marching in the middle of night.  Some of us hear it &amp; it doesn't make any sense for marching in the middle of the night......this is 1st incident....<br><br>2nd incident in regards to me.  As my bunk is in 2nd floor middle sec , facing the door out is facing orion &amp; behind is basketball court.  At 1 night, cos too urgent to go toilet, lasy to call buddy, so ownself go.  The funny things starts.  Once i step out of toilet.  IMMEDIATELY i can smell FRANGIPANI <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> .  I sense something not right as i was in 2nd storey &amp; no way there are flowers at my area &amp; i quickly went back silently.<br><br>3rd incident revolves my bmt buddy, whom a chinese, during 1 of the book in, brought some chinese desert.  As you know some chinese desert got pork in it but he not sure got or not so he put in his cupboard.  Suddenly that night while sleeping, i face his cupboard &amp; i can hear banging noise <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> .<br><br>Well this is the stories i had for Tekong....next....SELARANG CAMP.....</div></blockquote>You are not the first person to hear soldiers marching in the dead of night at Tekong. One of my friend, his intake around 10 years earlier than yours, he said he heard like a whole company marching in the night.<br><br></div>

But it could have just been my imagination though. But my mother, she believed me and she also had the same experience before so I presume my experience is real.<br><br>One fine day, I was really tired and was really stressed out because I have an exam the next day and was studying till very late at night. I finally forced myself to go to bed telling myself that I should sleep already since I have to be awake quite early the next day. So I off the lights and closed my eyes but I could not sleep. So I closed my eyes and thought of something to make me feel sleepy such that I could sleep. After some time, i felt myself getting sleepier and sleepier, so I tried to relax and hoped my head would get me off to sleep. But instead of going off to sleep, I had this jerks of half asleep half awake. Just like when you are about to sleep you suddenly wake up and when you suddenly wake up, you feel like sleeping again sort of thing. So I decided that its getting irritating, I might as well wake up and use the washroom before I go back to sleep.<br><br>But I found out that I could not move at all. I couldnt even to open my eyes. I found myself not breathing. I was awake at that point of time due to shock but I couldnt move. I could only hear sounds of my parents outside discussing about some issues. Its just like you are in a coma state where you can hear stuff and think but you cant move at all. Your brain is awake but your body is asleep. It was so scary because I was not breathing for more than 3 minutes already since I begun inspecting my surroundings and forcing myself to breathe. And I was quite relieved when I managed to force myself to start breathing again. My body was easier to control as I forced my eyes open.<br><br>But to my horror, when I open my eyes, I was in my room, but I saw what I wasnt supposed to see or say, not been able to see. I saw white shadows of glowing balls of white mist (like the pictures you took but more clear) which (to my opinion) if it were to materialise will look like small human/witch-like characters but they look horrible. (Its not cute or funny ok?) Those things were floating in alignment to my furniture very close to me (Like they were really travelling on my furniture) and they were travelling in from the window and surrounding me. I was like struggling from my confinement in this kind of situation. Suddenly, my parents open the door and came in quarrelling which aroused me out of my predicament. I suddenly able to move and they were really shocked when I just jumped out of my bed. This is not the only time I experienced this kind of thing...</div></blockquote>I have alot of ghost laying (some say it's physiological, you mind is awake but your nerves haven't turn on yet) on me experiences during young, almost everyday since sec.3 to sec.4, that why I don't sleep during the night, but after I moved house, all these occurences stopped, it only happened again during one hungry ghost festival. To this day, I sleep with my lights on.</div>

I wasn't a believer, even when I was doing my BMT and my stint at other camps I don't believe in things like that, I only started believing when I saw one myself, I wasn't tired, wasn't hallucinating because someone else saw it with me that night.
