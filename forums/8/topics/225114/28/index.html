It even scares me off when someone suddenly runs off saying that they saw something. god... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have 1 question to ask. If a Singaporean or Malaysian is with a Brazilian or Haitian together in a banana plantation, what will their reactions be?<br><br>Will the Singaporean/Malaysian &amp; Brazilian/Haitian 'see' their so-called own ghosts in the plantation, but the Singaporean/Malaysian isn't able to 'see' the Brazilian/Haitian ghost &amp; vice versa.<br><br>Or will the Brazilian/Haitian doesn't have any reaction &amp; instead asks why the Singaporean/Malaysian what's making him/her freaked out.<br><br>I think it's all the culture &amp; mindset already put in place since we were young. Maybe the pontianak 'exists' over here in Singapore &amp; Malaysia, but not in countries that have banana plantations like Brazil &amp; Haiti.  So are we scaring ourselves for no reason then?<br><br>I thought that this test of putting 2 different people from 2 different cultures together in those so-called 'haunted' places e.g. places with banana trees, is quite useful.<br><br>For example if this test works, maybe the pontianak 'exists' only in the minds of Singaporean &amp; Malaysian, not in those of Brazilian &amp; Haitian. Or they have their own ghost, they're scaring themselves &amp; we're scaring ourselves, when in fact there's real nothing at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ya lor. What if i cut up that piece of land and move to england.<br>Ghost meet ghost what happen. Scare each other arh?<br><br>But maybe they got different terminology for same ghost. Pontianak may be called pwned in their culture. There are few classifications of ghosts, but different terminology.<br><br></div>
