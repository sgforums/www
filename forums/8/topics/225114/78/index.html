            <div class='col-md body'>I have seen some "not on this earth" things before. But it could have just been my imagination though. But my mother, she believed me and she also had the same experience before so I presume my experience is real.<br><br>One fine day, I was really tired and was really stressed out because I have an exam the next day and was studying till very late at night. I finally forced myself to go to bed telling myself that I should sleep already since I have to be awake quite early the next day. So I off the lights and closed my eyes but I could not sleep. So I closed my eyes and thought of something to make me feel sleepy such that I could sleep. After some time, i felt myself getting sleepier and sleepier, so I tried to relax and hoped my head would get me off to sleep. But instead of going off to sleep, I had this jerks of half asleep half awake. Just like when you are about to sleep you suddenly wake up and when you suddenly wake up, you feel like sleeping again sort of thing. So I decided that its getting irritating, I might as well wake up and use the washroom before I go back to sleep.<br><br>But I found out that I could not move at all. I couldnt even to open my eyes. I found myself not breathing. I was awake at that point of time due to shock but I couldnt move. I could only hear sounds of my parents outside discussing about some issues. Its just like you are in a coma state where you can hear stuff and think but you cant move at all. Your brain is awake but your body is asleep. It was so scary because I was not breathing for more than 3 minutes already since I begun inspecting my surroundings and forcing myself to breathe. And I was quite relieved when I managed to force myself to start breathing again. My body was easier to control as I forced my eyes open.<br><br>But to my horror, when I open my eyes, I was in my room, but I saw what I wasnt supposed to see or say, not been able to see. I saw white shadows of glowing balls of white mist (like the pictures you took but more clear) which (to my opinion) if it were to materialise will look like small human/witch-like characters but they look horrible. (Its not cute or funny ok?) Those things were floating in alignment to my furniture very close to me (Like they were really travelling on my furniture) and they were travelling in from the window and surrounding me. I was like struggling from my confinement in this kind of situation. Suddenly, my parents open the door and came in quarrelling which aroused me out of my predicament. I suddenly able to move and they were really shocked when I just jumped out of my bed. This is not the only time I experienced this kind of thing...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well if that is counted, its my first official experience with ghostly things but if its not then its another time. If its sleep paralysis, then I have sleep paralysis three times in my life. First time was then. Second time was immediate and not like im trying to sleep or what. It could have been hallucinations but my mum only had the paralysis no hallucinations. I had it all the time except for the last time. It is believed that you will sense the supernaturals on some special occations and especially when your aura is low. Especially weird is that I see the same things everytime.<br><br>Once, I even saw my maid going into my room at night and I called after her. But she gave no response and just walked in, so i ran in after her. But when I went in she was not there. I was like ha? Then my mum told me she went down for medical checkup and wasnt at home for an hour already. I was like O.O I just saw her go in my room...<br><br>I have had many strange occurrances in my life from young til now hehe but didnt know it was strange until I had stranger ones and talked to my friend about it haha. Anybody sleepwalk before?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>let me tell my experience<br><br>Bangkok 2004. I was there with my wife.<br><br>We stayed at this tallest hotel in Bangkok. 42nd storey. Room no. 4264 (not a good no. since you noted it means die and die again).<br><br>Came out the lift felt really awful. The corridor smelt mouldy, the lighting gloomy. It had everything fit for a horror movie. The smell of mould and decay was in the air.<br><br>The incident in my room occurred towards the last 2 days of our stay. I woke up 3 times, and each time, though I was sure I did close the toilet door, the door was opened ajar each time I woke up.<br><br>Then my wife, on the last night felt something brush past her when she woke up to use the toilet.<br><br>When we came back to singapore, both of us were very sick, throwing out. We were extremely careful and avoided street food just in case we got food poisoning. All meals were taken at restaurants or the hotel restaurant.<br><br>I was admitted into hospital the night I came back. Doctor said severe case of food poisoning.<br><br>To this day, we wonder if its becoz we met something, and was so 'dirty' that we had to get sick to clear the yin energy from our bodies.<br><br>Last year, we went Phuket, ate street food, never did get such horrible case of food poisoning.</div>

That's why you need to light up a ciggy when you walk down a dark, deserted road.<br><br>One day, my friend's friend had to go home late, maybe around 11pm plus. Tired and stressed up, he lighted a ciggy while walking home. Suddenly, he felt something was wrong. He turned his head a little bit and saw a pontianak following him a few metres away. Pacing up his steps, he opened the house door and threw away the ciggy. Just as he was entering the house, he felt something scratched his back. When he looked through a mirror, he saw scratch marks on his back. Coincidence? I don't think so.</div></blockquote>Hmm...okay, I always keep my SwissCard with me when i go out. Its got a pair of scissors, a miniature knife blade and a needle.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tuggy<br><br>This happened in March this year, during my CCA Camp. Am an instructor for a uniform group, so the cadets slept on the 2nd floor on one wing, while us (instructors) slept on the same floor, opposite wing facing the cadets' rooms.<br><br>As usual...during such camps, we'll do the usual of posting sentries at the main gate, back gate and a pair of prowlers. so all in all, there are three pairs of sentries, all issued with walkie talkies and also us the instructor room/ops room also have a walkie talkie there. There were 4 of us senior instructors that night, and i was the so called "DO". Camps being camps,one of the junior instructors brought his PS2 and we were playing, while the others are either chatting or trying to get some shut-eye. As I was the DO, I slept in 1/2 uniform, at about 3+, got a message from the prowlers that they heard some noise.<br><br>So together with one other guy, we went to check it out, I had a drop bag strapped to my left thigh and proceeded to the corridor where they reported hearing the sounds.Went to investigate, turned out, it was the firehose's tap properly turned off, so there was a "hissing" sound of the water leaking out. The two of us then went back to the ops room, while on the way back, my fellow instructor needed to use the restroom, so we made a stop there, he went it, while i waited outside. The school is mostly dark except for the ops room and the ground floor lights. As the sound was reported on the 4th floor, we stopped at the 4th floor toilets while on the way back. While i was outside, i had my back facing the toilet door and was looking out towards the staff room. That was when i felt a tug on my thigh bag. It was a sudden tug, like somebody calling for your attention. So i turned, thinking my friend was done. But he was still inside. I wasn't spooked at this point, so I sat on the stairs, back still facing the toilet door, there came another tug, this time more violently, and it was repeated tug. I stood up and stretched, asking my friend if he was ready. At that time, he came out and was sheet white. He ran back to the ops room and kept to himself in a corner, i followed behind, intending to question him.<br><br>"Oei, why you run out? Siao ah?"-&gt;Me<br>"Sir, you never see somebody beside you?"-&gt;Cadet Instructor<br>"No, why?"-&gt;Me<br>"There was a kid pulling your bag, and holding a ball, like asking you to play with him"-&gt;Cadet Instructor<br><br>At this point, my balls were in my mouth, and the others had gathered, when I confronted him. But I was still skeptical, so my fellow senior instructor asked him, if thats the case, where's the kid now. He told us the kid was on the cadet's wing, standing on the parapet, and walking, waving at us. By that time, the group of 12 of us turned on music and sat together, backs facing the window, not daring to look out and just chit-chatted through the night.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I'm not too sure whether this can be counted as one, but the heck of it.<br><br>Usually, this happensevery Thursday and Friday night, whenever I'm nodding off to sleep about 2 to 3 am, and this often happens once I fall into a deep sleep. When I try to move my body, it won't budge, and there's this heavy pressure on me. Not only that, there's this some sort of faint hissing sound once in a while, hence I tried to ignore it, but was still doing so. Of course, i was afraid, but I had to do something. And to my stupidity, I growled while saying a sentence.<br><br>"Don't make me <span style="font-style: italic;">TAME</span> you."<br><br>The pressure was a bit harder before I fought back, but seconds later, it ceased, like as if nothing happened. Guess back then, I made a wrong move, but I pulled up a fight. It's still going on every now and then, but it isn't bothering me that much these days.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Don't annoy me, I don't annoy you.</span> - I'm trying to use this idea.</div>
