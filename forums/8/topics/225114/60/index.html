We waited for them to come to us because we were also scared of what was happening. Below is what I heard roughly.<br><br>" WTF ! Why got water suddenly gushing in the toilet there one ! "<br>" How I know ? "<br>" I'm scared.."<br>" But just now I tried the tap I cannot use one lei "<br>* sobbing *<br><br>So among ALL the <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> faces, I saw someone very calm. My ex. She told us not to use the toilet in the master bed room... Because her dad said it was spoilt and prone to gushing.<br><br>So while everybody heaved a sigh of relief, we suddenly thought of something. Who was going to shut the tap. If not water fee expensive siah ! So, we did a very stupid thing. We scissor-paper-stone the loser to do it.<br><br>I freaking lost.<br><br>So I had to enter the toilet in the master bedroom. This time round, the water from the tap stopped after I stepped into the bedroom. Just to make sure though, I went in the toilet while praying silently. I then used ALOT of masking tape to tape up the tap. Now I wonder why I did it that way back then..<br><br>Anyway, we then moved into the second bedroom to have a rest. Nothing else happened that night. And the morning was spent playing games and having some fun in the chalet with lots of stupid games. Evening came and we had to shower and this time round, the girls decided to do it last. So the guys went ahead for our showers with no incidents. Until the last two girls, including my ex, encountered low water pressure in the toilet. They were all  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> and scolded the government for building lousy facilities.<br><br>(I think the low water pressure thing was a systematic failure, because we checked with each other after the whole incident) So the two girls decided to risk it and bathe in the other toilet.<br><br>The toilet in the master bedroom. With the whole group inside the master bedroom as guards. So they happily finished showering and came out. And since no incidents happened and the master bedroom was the only room with air-con back then..<br><br>We all decided to rest in the master bedroom.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now because the bedroom had only one bed, so the single girls went to sleep there while the couples slept side by side and the rest just basically squeezed in. The bed was in the middle of the room while the rest of us were sleeping in a row like this.<br><br>A.B C.D EFG<br><br>A = My ex<br>B = me<br>C.D = Couple<br>EFG = rest of guys<br>2 girls on bed<br><br>* Insert eerie atmospheric music *<br><br>OK, being the nearest to the toilet in question and a light sleeper, I knew who went to the toilet. And it happened that the girls and EFG were not sleeping, instead they were playing "chua-dai-di". And in the middle of the night, my ex went to the toilet to relief herself. So when she came back, I continued hugging her to sleep.<br><br>And a few mins later, after I had almost fallen asleep, she bolted up into a sitting position while slapping her neck. (Our conversation.. normal is me, in bold is my ex, red and bold is ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> )<br><br>"What happened ?"<br><strong>"I dunno... Something bit me.. " </strong><br>"It's ok, I sayang you ok.. Have a good rest, you sleepy liao. See your red eyes. "<br><strong>"I dunno... I don't feel well.. I'm uncomfortable.. " </strong><br>"Uncomfortable where? "<br><strong>"I dunno... " </strong><br><br>Silence. I kept massaging the place where she claim she was bitten until I realized she was stiff.<br><br>"Dear, you ok ?"<br><br>What I heard scared me stiff... She didn't turn to look at me, or do anything else. But her voice and her soft answer scared me shitless...<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>"I AM NOT YOUR DEAR" </strong></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> To be continued...</div>

It will be a happy occasion if you actually hate your ex  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But this time round, those words shocked me to my core. Because those words were spoken in a man's voice. A deep, low man's voice.<br><br>I was stunned and looked at the couple beside me. They were sleeping. The people on the bed were playing cards and not paying attention to me. So I tried to see if my ex was just playing tricks on me. My voice was trembling by this time and I spoke to her again.<br><br>" Are you ok dear ? "<br><br>I freaking froze because she turned her body and looked, no, STARED at me in my eyes and whispered in a low, hoarse masculine voice:<br><span style="color: red;"><strong>"I AM NOT YOUR DEAR. WHY ARE YOU DISTURBING ME ?" </strong></span><br><br>My sweat beaded down my face and I was shocked into silence. Somehow though, one of my friends playing cards noticed my ex and me having some sort of problem. So he shouted out to us.<br><br>" Oi, come out here is to enjoy one lei, dun be angry la.. "<br>My ex then turned her body and looked at my friend and said out loud:<br><span style="color: red;"><strong>"YOUNG MAN, YOU DISTURB ME AND DARE TO BE RUDE TO ME !" </strong></span><br><br>Wa ! No time to scream man, when I saw my ex suddenly fall back lying down on the mattress beside me. I thought she really just joking because she suddenly closed her eyes. Then,<br><br><strong>" Help me, dear.. Please.."</strong><br>" Dear ? "<br><strong>" Help me, dear.. Please, something is inside.."</strong><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>"GET OUT OF MY ROOM NOW !" </strong></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br><strong>" Call my parents and tell.. "</strong><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>"SHUT UP BI*CH" </strong></span><br><br>By this time, all my friends were awake and everyone was around my ex and me. But they didn't know what to do as they saw her lying down and speaking to herself with her eyes closed.<br><br>I only remember jumping out of my skin when my ex suddenly sat up again and grabbed my hand. My friends made me realise how fragile friendship is when they all decided to keep a distance from me when that happened.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>"GET OUT OF MY ROOM NOW ! BEFORE I.. " </strong></span><br><strong>" Call my Dad !! NOW !!!  "</strong><br><br>" DON'T DISTURB MY GIRL ! WHO ARE YOU !? "<br><span style="color: red;"><strong>" I AM NOT YOUR GIRL. " </strong></span><br><br>And my ex called out my name and spat at me. My fear was huge, but that angered me and I snapped out of my shock.<br><br>Then the guys finally decided to try and hold her down while the girls went outside the room and tried to call her parents. My ex was being held down by four guys and simply shook them off. FOUR guys.<br><br>Then for the first time, that THING shouted Malay and snarled like a tiger at one of my friends. All this while she was gripping my hand. Wah biang, my guts was almost gone liao. Then one of the girls, a Muslim, came in and kneeled down beside my ex to pray.<br><br>A laughter so cold and frightening came out of my ex.</div>

I looked at the Malay girl and she looked at me.<br><br>I mouthed out " Now what ? ". Her lip reply was " How I f*** ing know ? " Best reply man. So my guy friends started to take out their handphones.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>" YOU THINK YOU CAN CALL OUT ? MUAHAHAHAHAHA !!!! " </strong></span><br><br>My guy friends just stood there with their mouths open. The girls were all crying except for the Malay girl who was still praying. Then something sounded out inside my mind. It was a portion of a Thai prayer my Dad taught me almost 10 years ago. Being scared out of my mind, I started to try and recall the whole thing.<br><br>Then I whispered it into my ex left ear. And I was freed of her grip while she just screamed out like hell. I continued praying into her ear and she started having fits and struggled to sit up. Then she suddenly went limp into my arms and closed her eyes.<br><br>Great. So now I had my ex who was possessed like a few mins ago in my arms, my friends all looking at me like  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> and my ex started to move.<br><br><strong>" Dear ?"</strong><br><br>I looked at her eyes directly and somehow felt it was really my ex. So I nodded and quickly pulled her out of the master bed room and into the second bedroom. She had gone limp and was very very weak. By this time, everyone was following all my actions and abandoned the master bedroom. It was almost 3 or 4 am at this time.<br><br>After settling down in the second bedroom, I kept an eye on my ex while the rest of the group just basically crowded around me. I asked them why and they all said because I drove the THING away, so must stay close to me in case happen again. Honestly, it was not something to be happy about at that time. Then my ex asked me what happened. I told her the whole incident and she remembered saying all those things to me.<br><br><strong> " I also remembered feeling something inside me controlling my movements. I couldn't speak sometimes and I only saw how the guys tried to hold onto me. And I heard someone whispering some muslim prayers. But it was so dark and cold and I was shivering with fear until I heard your voice and a golden light slowly filled my sight. Then I woke up and felt in control again. Then you pulled me here.. " </strong><br><br>Everyone was just whispering about what I said to drive the thing away and I was starting to feel tired. Then I noticed it. The Malay girl wasn't around. I felt a bad omen and looked around to find her sitting hugging her knees in a corner. The group saw what I was looking at and looked at her too. One of my friends called out to her :<br><br>" Siti(fake name), are you ok ? "<br><strong>" I'm ok, just very tired.. And I want to rest.. "</strong><br>" ok, why don't you crowd with us here, it's cosier.. "<br><br>Silence.<br><br>" Siti ? "<br><br>Silence.<br><br>My ex pulled my hand firmly suddenly and I jumped.<br><br>" Dear.. she.. " I looked at Siti. Great, she was lying in the same position my ex was when she was possessed back in the master bedroom. But I prayed I was just being paranoid. None of the others noticed and one of my female friends went over to put a blanket for Siti.<br><br>" Here Siti, it's very cold here.. " My ears pricked up and noticed the cold atmosphere in the room. This room wasn't supposed to have air con. And there were 5 guys and 4 girls here. Cold ? I looked at my ex before both of us turned our heads in Siti's direction.<br><br>Siti was covered with the blanket by our friend. Then being concerned, she asked her if she was ok again. My friend turned and ran for us when Siti replied. I was just scared stiff and my eyes widened as she turned her head to look at us while smiling and still lying on the floor.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>" I AM NOT SITI.." </strong></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> To be continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wah. I'm new to sgForums. Took me more than a day to read all the posts in this thread alone. Anyway I'd like to chime in. I remember when I was young, I used to see things out of the corners of my eyes too. But not just flitting shadows as a previous poster tried to explain away these things. Because I can make out human shapes.<br><br>The first time I saw, I was very young. I saw a small boy/girl, totally black, run across the front door of my house. I didn't know better at the time so I ran out and looked around. But there was no one outside. Only as I grew older did I start getting creeped out.<br><br>I agree with the others that you can only see these things when you yourself have a negative state of mind. Depressed, etc. I was pretty quiet and gloomy when young.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Ok, I don't have any really scary experiences myself. But a friend of mine who works in a university (which shall remain nameless) in Malaysia has shared his stories of hauntings with me. Not really scary, so not sure if you guys interested. Mostly mischievious or annoyed spirits I think.</div>
