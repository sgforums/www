            <div class='col-md body'>remember the Eye 10, which details 10 different methods for seeing the dead :<br><br>1. A corneal transplant from a donor who is psychic (as seen in The Eye)<br>2. Attempting to commit suicide while pregnant (as seen in The Eye 2).<br>3. Playing the Spirit Glass game (similar to Western Ouija boards).<br>4. Tapping chopsticks on an empty bowl at an intersection to attract hungry spirits.<br>5. Playing hide and seek at midnight while holding a black cat.<br>6. Rubbing the dirt from a grave around your eyes.<br>7. Opening an umbrella while indoors.<br>8. Brushing your hair at midnight while staring into a mirror.<br>9. Bending over and looking between your legs (called the "Peek-a-stoop" in the film).<br>10. Dressing up in "used" funeral clothes whilst sleeping to fool the dead into believing you are one of them. (The film is not clear on how one is supposed to obtain used funeral clothes, but this could be a translation error.)<br></div>
