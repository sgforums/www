            <div class='col-md body'>i was returning from chalet with my group of classmates, which decided to drop by my place for a quick lunch.<br><br>after the lunch, i was supposed to bring them to the next bus stop. on the way, they asked me if the blk 611 flat was really haunted...i told them i was not too sure...heard a few tales...never seen it for myself tho...<br><br>being curious, they asked me to show them to the block...and i did...i bought them there<br><br>when we were there....there was nothing much to see...all the way leading up to the staircase were sealed with wooden plank. and being a hero, i climbed on the railing of the staircase and peeped inside...<br><br>we walked around the void deck and were shouting for "them" to appear before us....<br><br>we did not see anything nor did we felt anything<br><br>but things happened after we left the block<br><br>i accompanied them on the bus to the interchange...and one of the classmates fell from the bus when alighting...she claimed she felt someone pushed her from behind..when it was us that was behind her, and none or us pushed her...<br><br>a few of them had disturbing dreams that night...<br><br>the photos we took during our chalet were all blurred...with overlapping images...a man which we all did not know...the pictures were overlapped in such a way where we could understand...tis like a landscape pic being overlapped with a portrait pic of a man (faded) but stop short of the head and face of the man<br><br>we were all very worried....i blamed myself fo bringing them there....and i took it on myself to redeem what was done<br><br>i told one of my classmates to standby bible, and i found some taoist talismans and i went to that block again...<br><br>when i was there, i "apologized" to whoever that was tthere.....and told them it was my idea to bring my classmates there...and if they want to take any action, i shd be the one to come to, not my classmates...<br><br>when i reached home, i armed myself with many religious stuffs...to my relief....nothing happened to me and my classmates after i went to offer the apology</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>got this off spookycorner.com<br><br>Bedok Block of Flats -When these block of flats at Bedok Reservoir was still standing, it was left empty for years. Rumors included that a whole family had committed suicide in their flat and that a person had been killed by a ghost in a lift/elevator. Passerbys would sometimes see lights flinkering in the supposedly now empty flats<br><br>i remembered hearing something like this from a friend of mine whose relative lived there for a very short while</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from <a href="http://www.yensa.org/scary/ha18/15.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.yensa.org/scary/ha18/15.htm</a><br><br>Hello to all...I am not sure if any of you have heard of the so-called haunted block of Bedok Reservoir Road...611<br><br>Well...I used to live next to that block 611..my kitchen window faces the back of block 611..<br><br>Actually there was this time when for no valid reason the whole block of residents just moved out of that block..and I mean every residents just moved out and soon the whole block was vacant..<br><br>And somehow the government decided to "renovate" the whole block..putting on a new coat of paint..so there was this time where the workers lived on the second floor...the lifts were not operating and the stairs were being blocked except for the ones that allowed the workers to go to their temporary quaters...<br><br>However there was this night when I was up and need to go to the loo...my loo was in the kitchen and so I made my way to the kitchen...out of habit, I turned to look at that block..I saw that there was someone on the 6 floor..I was shocked as how can anyone be there since the whole block is vacant except for the workers.. Furthurmore, the lights are on for that unit only and I am sure the "person" I saw was not one of the workers as the workers were tanned and that "person" was fair and wearing white..<br><br>Well...I went into the toilet and finished my business...then I came out and looked at that block again..The light was still on and that "person" once again walked along the room of the unit..as I was quite young at that time..I ignored it and went back to bed..<br><br>Well...up till today I am not sure if I am dreaming or my eyes are playing tricks on me..<br><br>Although now the block has residents living in there..I am not sure if they have any encounters...also there are still some vacant units on the second and third floor...maybe you guys can check out that place and see if there are any intersting things you can find...</div>
