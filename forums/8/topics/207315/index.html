            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding outside food, i think it is just ridiculous they staff try to stop us from bringing any. We already pay the ticket price to watch movie, and yet they want to exploit us by forcing us to buy their ridiculously priced food and beverages sold by cinema. You guys should do like what i did, that day they deny me of entering the cinema, i ask for a refund. Though they offer to keep my food, i refuse to let them do so. So they dont allow me to enter and the movie going to start. I throw my food right into the supervisor's face. and you know what the heck he said? he siad you are very rude. So my boyfriend want to slap him, and he even challange my botfriend to slap him. by that time, their manager come by and apologise and let me in. U know wut i mean? u must be loud and demand for you right!!!<br></div>
