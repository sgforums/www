It goes on for a good 20-30 minutes before the show starts. No such problem at Eng Wah Cinemas, they usually start on time,  and the advertisements are very limited. Same too for Shaw and Cathay.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The cinema operators have every right to impose the no-externally-purchased food rule.  They lease the premises, they pay for the staff and ultimately they provide a service for a price.  If they profit unfairly by overcharging on snacks then that's their perogative because it is always in the custormer's power to choose not to patronise a given operator.  To argue that there really is no choice given to consumers due to the fact that all operators impose the same rules is really no argument at all.  You can choose not to watch movies.  The profit imperative drives all of us and GV and Cathay etc are not doing community service.<br><br>Furthermore it is very rude to throw anything at anyone, let alone an employee of an establishment who has no say in what policies his employers implement.  Perhaps you should consider what you would do if 1) you were in the position of selling a product or service and 2) you were a employee having to face an irate customer who really had no reason being irate anyway.</div>
