Which might not see immediate results or might not even cure the problem but just more like 'contain' it....<br><br>Of course, there're also doctors who would use stronger prescriptions.. Which might risk other side effects or even cause other hazards to a patient's health...?<br><br>Such things are really quite debatable... Even if you're seeing a doctor from NSC and you want 'faster' effect, you can always try asking for a stronger dosage or prescription... Or if you feel that the doctor's no good? Ask for another doctor...?<br><br>I can agree with you that some privates might be more 'knowledgable' in some ways.. But between GPs and NSC, it's really no point generalising this way... If you can really find a GP who can give you GOOD results.. By all means, do go for the recommendations..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  But I also believe that a REAL GOOD doctor should be one who would care more for the patient's general health than just the 'objective need(s)' alone...<br><br>To add, information on many medication should be able to be searched on the net nowadays... If you're using a certain prescription, you can always ask the doctor to explain a bit on why he / she choose for that (that's what you're paying the consultation fee for anyway yeah..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> )... Alternatively, search the NET...  (but make sure that your SOURCE is RELIABLE...) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It would be wise if you do a little researching on the net to find out which are the types of medication that has worked for most people of similar problems.<br><br>If the medicine can only be prescribed by a doctor, then it may be good to see a specialist and consult his/her advice on it.<br><br>The procedures are correctly described as above. For first-timers, you will be seen by a full-fledged doctor (not trainee). However, to ensure accurate diagnosis, you will be seen again by a senior consultant who will verify the first doctor's analysis.<br><br>As NSC is a training specialist centre, your case may be used as a study guide for teaching trainee doctors. However, your approval will be sought prior to this.<br><br>The above is true, cos I've just visited NSC yesterday.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey people. thanks a lot for your suggestions. i think i go to the polyclinic first then see how. i have tried quite a number of skincare products, but not much use. frankly speaking, i quite afraid of such products now. so i guess i have to find a doctor to help me out. hope it will serve much purpose.</div>
