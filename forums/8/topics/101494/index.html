            <div class='col-md body'>Shouldnt cost more than 60 bucks for the consultation fees and the medicine. (however this was about 2 years ago, so the price should change a little)<br><br>Usually the doctorwill perscribe tetracyclene or doxycyclene depending on the severity of the acne.<br><br>Personally, I'd recommend against the use of these antibiotic pills chiefly because although they kill the bad bacteria, they also kill the good bacteria too. And yes, one can have clear skin after 3 - 6 months of consuming these pills, however the effect is not lasting. After some time the acne will come back plus its not good to take the pills on a long term basis. Side effects include nausea, increased sensitivity to sunlight and yeast infection.<br><br>But then again, its my own personal opinion, different people have different reaction to medication. So what might not be suitable for me, could be suitable for you and vice versa</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by OrneryBoy:</div><div class="quote_body">...its cheaper to get referral from polyclinic doctor. </div></blockquote>Yes definitely, but i notice that many doctors tend to pay more attention to their private (GP-referred) patients. Sometimes the drugs that they prescribe to the private patients may be different also. Cos the docs get paid an additional sum for every private patient that they see whereas they don't for the subsidised (polyclinic-referred) patients.<br><br>Whether or not that translates to better care or not is, of course, up to you to decide.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

He / she would try to diagnose for you because referring you to the appropriate doctor. I think the main reason why that's the practice is because they wanna cut down time on handling 1st timer who would usually have more 'history recording' to do... And also to avoid 'no show up' (follow-ups would probably have a higher turn up rate?) for more senior doctors (proper ultilisation of human resource)...<br><br>The 'bunch of trainees' are usually attached with 1 or 2 doctors in practice... This is sort of like a 'on the job training' thing and also to give their doctors better 'exposure'...<br><br>NSC itself is a Specialist's Centre...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
