As much as  Buddhism tells u to live a good life, it doesnt point you to the true and living God. And finding God has nothing to do with religion anyway.<br><br>Anyway, I am not offended by ur responses. I am more than willing to answer your questions and doubts.

Most major religions teaches us about ethics and morals. But its amazing that Jesus dare to take a step farther and claim that He is God and offers a relationship with God. And He did it of all places Israel, a place where the 'Holy men' or 'teachers' of the Word, believe that for a man to proclaim to be God is blasmephous.

Again, I would say that Revelations mentioned that there will be disasters, wars and battles but did not say anything specifically  about the 911 incident.<br><br>There are many interesting ways that men try to understand God and "ANalyse" his words. I tell you one of the most interesting one I ever heard.<br><br>Charles Manson, a famous serial killer believed that the BEATLES (famous rock band in the 60s) were the "locusts" sent by God after he read these verses in the bible<br><br>Revelation 9:7-8<br><br>"The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled human faces. Their hair was like women's hair, and their teeth were like lions' teeth."<br><br>Why? Because, locusts are insects, so BEATLES! Also, the "locusts" mentioned in the verses had human faces (BEATLES!). Then these locusts had women's hair, long hair meaning (So BEATLES had long hair!!).<br><br>So, you see how men can so twist God's word so much to their own beliefs and logic?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

But that is the problem with many christians nowadays is that they can study the bible so much that they become legalistic and technical.<br><br>The bible did say that if you do not believe in God, you go to hell. But hey I do not go around shouting at everyone that you go to hell! Believe in God! I believe in free will cos God gave us free will! But I would try my best to tell people about Jesus and let the person use his free will to decide. I wun force neither will I use threat. I do tell certain people I share to, if necessary, that he will go to hell if he does not believe, but i state it as a matter of fact, never as a threat which I abhor.</div>
