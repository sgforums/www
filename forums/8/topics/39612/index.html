            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by |-|05|:</div><div class="quote_body">it said there will be wars and nation againest nations....yea and the people in the 30 year war thought that was it too and said the world was going to end then!or how about during the 900's-1400's when there was constant warfare and the black pluage(sic) killed half of europe..they thought that was it.......well hasnt happened has it?</div></blockquote>Who thought that that was it? When I said end times, i dont mean today or next year, the world will end. Simply, I dun know. The bible says so, I wun know when the world will end and when God will come again, as in specifically.  In the bible, there are many revelations that signify the end times, many have not been fulfilled yet. Some claimed it has, some claimed it has not. Let me quote u an example, in Revelation 13:11-18<br><br>"Then I saw another beast, coming out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon. He exercised all the authority of the first beast on his behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed. And he performed great and miraculous signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of men. Because of the signs he was given power to do on behalf of the first beast, he deceived the inhabitants of the earth. He ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. He was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that it could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. <span style="color: red;">He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.</span><br>This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man's number. His number is 666.<br><br>These verses are one of the many that reveals the ending of days. Look at the part in red, this part many people argued that this part has happened. The "MARK" people believed is the chip that engineers are working on. The chip that they are embedding on people's body so that in the future all information is stored and buying and selling can be done thru this chip. THerefore people argued that  this part  has been fulfilled. But of cos, some people dun think so.<br><br>What I have done is not to say hey end time is here.  God definitely is here. It is true that there have been bloodier wars than this. I do not know when. There are many other signs that the bible reveals which is almost impossible for me to explore and expound on here.<br><br>What I ultimately wants to say is that I believe in God. YOu many not. But if you do or will or  want to, dont ever try to understand God other than using the bible because it was never meant to be.</div>
