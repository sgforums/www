And to be frank, Buddhism teaches some good stuff. I believe there is buddhism and the existence of the people mentioned. But alas, way of life is different from finding God.  As much as  Buddhism tells u to live a good life, it doesnt point you to the true and living God. And finding God has nothing to do with religion anyway.<br><br>Anyway, I am not offended by ur responses. I am more than willing to answer your questions and doubts. I am not here to convert but to communicate. If you believe in God one day, praise Him. If not, I am cool about it. I have met more vicious people than you trust me hahaha...<br><br>so well, stay cool and God bless. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
