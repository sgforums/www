People are coping with an otherwise disastrous situation by using imagination and not letting fear hamper their style.<br><br>From the streets of Hong Kong to the esteros of Manila, people are donning multicolored cotton masks-with Nike Swooshes, Winnie the Pooh prints or floral patterns.<br><br>All of a sudden, the mask has become the latest fashion must-have-not out of luxury, but out of necessity.<br><br>With the ecological decline our planet is suffering, masks may soon become permanent fashion accessories for safeguarding our health against pollution.<br><br>For the time being, our worry is SARS, and even haute couture houses and high-end fashion brands are reportedly coming out with designs to combat the plague-in style.<br><br>An e-mail recently went around (like a virus) about "atypical masks for atypical pneumonia in an atypically unique city."  The mail narrates how, in brand-crazy Hong Kong, Louis Vuitton came out with special-edition masks-in super-soft Connolly leather with a monogrammed sterling silver clasp with matching LV protective case, priced at 1,800 Hong Kong dollars.<br><br>Inquirer verified the report with Louis Vuitton in Manila, and was told no such masks were put in the market.<br><br>But if the chi-chi brands are too slow to pick up the trend, China's factories have been quick to cash on the fever.  Fake Burberry masks are all over Shenzen.<br><br>Closer to home, at the  Divisoria and San Lazaro markets, cartoon prints like Scooby Doo, among other fun and funky prints, are the rage.<br><br>When the Fashion Design Council of the Philippines (FDCP) went to Shanghai with Citem, delegates were equipped with masks.  Top designers, diplomats, businessmen, government officials, journalists and even models all wore masks.<br><br>I remember years back when I sprained my arm and had to be in a cast.  My doctor gave me a generic-looking sling to hold my injured ligament.  Too bad it really did nothing to spruce up my outfits.  Since I believe that in sickness and in health, one must be perpetually chic, I called up my friend, designer Michele Sison. She made me a slick leather sling bag.  It even had a zipper to keep my mobile phone.<br><br>With this in mind, Lifestyle called up some designers and asked, "How do we fight a cutting-edge, never-before-seen virus?"<br><br>By coming up with cutting-edge, never-before-seen masks, they all said. And so, once again, we put the creativity of the Filipino designer to the test.  Most of them handed in prototypes of chic coverups.  Rajo Laurel submitted sketches.  Mich Dulce dealt with the atypical pneumonia scare with typical Pinoy humor.<br><br>Patrice Ramos-Diaz used denim, cotton and other light fabrics with light floral patterns for her mask.  She made another one with a 3M breathing attachment for functionality.<br><br><img src="http://www.inq7.net/lif/2003/apr/06/images/lif_8-1-3.jpg"><br><br>Randy Ortiz used t'nalak and put his logo-"Randy Ortiz couture"-on the mouthpiece.<br><br>Vic Barba decided to spice his mask with humor by using the "smile" and "pout" icons, in red and yellow colors, to drive home his point.<br><br>Eric Pineda used abel Iloko fabric and asked Grace Nono to draw on it an early alphabet Mangyan prayer.<br><br>Len Nepomuceno-Guiao embellished hers with beads for glam cocktail wear.  Eddie Baddeo put Swarovski stones and dangling beads for that Tessa Prieto-Valdes look while Rhett Eala used denim rhinestones for casual chic.<br><img src="http://www.inq7.net/lif/2003/apr/06/images/lif_8-2.jpg"><br>It should be pointed out that these designer creations do not meet World Health Organization standards for filtering out particles the size of 0.3 microns. No one is sure how big the droplet causing SARS is, so better to wear your designer mask over the N95 surgical mask.<br><br>Luckily, no SARS deaths have been reported in Manila-at least not yet.  Meantime, it is better to be safe than sorry, but that doesn't mean we have to submit to fascist fashion dictators or all look sterile and boring.  Individuality reigns, even at times of crisis.<br><br>What are you waiting for? Don that designer mask now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On commuter buses and tourist ferries, in designer stores and trendy coffee bars, the surgical face mask has become an eerie symbol of the fear gripping Hong Kong.<br><br>With 16 people dead and almost 700 infected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), millions of people have donned protective masks in a bid to prevent transmission of the mystery virus.<br><br>"It's a very strange sight, almost scary in some ways," said British tourist Dorothy Smith, on holiday with husband Ian. "We'd been warned but we really didn't expect this. It's very odd."<br><br>With schools closed because of the outbreak and many people avoiding public places, the gloomy streets were as oppressive as the low cloud that cloaked the city's skyscrapers heralding the onset of the notoriously humid wet season.<br><br>At the Star Ferry terminal in Central district, the usual flood of commuters had slowed to a trickle as workers stayed home or took private transport.<br><br>Nearly everyone who braved the journey wore a protective mask. Only tourists travelled without.<br><br>"We hadn't been told to wear one so we didn't bother," said British visitor Chris Ryan, 41, in Hong Kong on honeymoon with his wife Glynis, 47.<br><br>"We were told to take precautions, and we wash our hands every hour, as we were told to," said Glynis.<br><br>"It looks like one big episode of E.R.," scoffed one American tourist, who preferred not give his name. Ironically, the previous night local television aired an alarming episode of the US hospital TV drama involving a lethal outbreak of a mutated monkey virus.<br><br>Making a fashion statement<br>For Hong Kong's famous fashionistas, the health scare has challanged their sartorial talents to the extreme as they try in vain to make masks look cool.<br><br>In the Landmark, one of the city's top malls, well-groomed ladies tried to match the hospital pastel pinks, blues and greens of most masks with designer shawls and accessories.<br><br>Younger trend-setters attempted to liven-up their masks with stickers of cartoon characters like Hello Kitty or Oscar from Sesame Street. Enterprising vendors are also hawking counterfeit designer masks sporting Louis Vuitton, Burberry and Nike symbols.<br><br>The virus scare has altered the pace of life in other ways.<br><br>In the cafes of trendy SoHo, the usual kiss-kiss greet of friends has been replaced with antisceptic waves or nods as citizens heed health warnings against physical contact.<br><br>"Nobody kisses me anymore, it's like I have the plague or something," mused flamboyant local fashion designer Roberto Conte. "It's terrible, nobody's touching at all."<br><br>On the open-air escalator that climbs the steep hill to the Mid-Levels neighbourhood, travellers balanced precariously on the moving walkway, fearful that steadying themselves on the handrail would mean coming into contact with something touched by an infected traveller.<br><br>All levels of society are feeling the effects of the health scare. With children forced to stay away from school while classrooms are disinfected, childminders and maids are battling to balance chores.<br><br>In the family-filled Happy Valley area, one Filipino domestic helper was seen bravely herding three mask-hidden children and four yapping dogs to the nearby McDonald's.<br><br>Hoax<br>And in supermarkets all over the territory, shoppers were faced with empty shelves following Tuesday's hoax warning about a quarantine order on Hong Kong that sparked panic buying on staples and fresh goods.<br><br>At the branch of supermarket chain Wellcome in Mid-Levels a sign told customers that "The Rumour" had led to shortages. In response, harried staff were seen busily restocking shelves.<br><br>The taxi drivers smile<br>The only people who seemed to be enjoying the panic Wednesday were the city's taxi drivers.<br><br>"There have been far more people taking taxis in the past few days because they don't want to spend too much time among other people on buses or trains," driver Au Yeung Lee Shing said through a white mask tied behind his ears.<br><br>"It's boosted business for us."<br><br>Health Warning<br><br>* The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised against travel to Hong Kong and China's Guangdong province.<br><br>"We've decided to make a recommendation that people who are planning travel to both Hong Kong Kong and Guangdong, which is adjacent to Hong Kong, consider postponing their travel to another time," Dr. David Heymann, head of the WHO's communicable diseases unit, told reporters in Geneva.<br><br>The advice does not apply to other areas, such as Singapore, Vietnam or Canada, where health authorities appear to be managing to control the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Heymann said.<br><br>AFP</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jittery international travelers are making white surgical masks part of their flying routine as they try to avoid the mystery respiratory illness that is spreading from Asia.<br><br>Travelers on flights from Tokyo and Beijing stepped off at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport wearing the masks Wednesday. They also carried U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention leaflets advising them to monitor their health for at least 10 days and tell a doctor of their Asian travels if they come down with a fever and cough or difficulty breathing.<br><br>The unidentified virus, being called severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, has sickened more than 2,200 and killed at least 78 worldwide. The Illinois Department of Public Health has listed five suspected cases in the state, including four in the Chicago area.<br><br>Some were on edge before boarding their flight. Steven Subar, of Chicago, said he donned his mask in Tokyo after asking airline employees whether anyone from Hong Kong was on the flight to Chicago. He then asked whether people sitting in rows near him had been in that city, so he could change seats if necessary.<br><br>"I didn't eat anything (on the flight)," he said. "I brought my own water. I didn't touch the door knobs ? I used a paper towel."<br><br>The 42-year-old business traveler said he was not comforted by the registry that passengers had to sign while checking-in, saying whether they had any symptoms.<br><br>"It's sort of like when airlines ask if anyone's touched your bags. It's worthless," he said.<br><br>Los Angeles International Airport spokeswoman Nancy Castles said roughly 90% of passengers arriving from afflicted areas such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong were wearing masks. She said some have bought designer masks.<br><br>"They're getting a little creative and colorful," she said. "Some entrepreneurs in the originating cities on the other side are adding design of popular characters like Hello Kitty, rainbows, hearts."<br><br>Some travelers weren't sure whether the masks would do any good, but they weren't taking any chances.<br><br>"We're just trying to stay safe and when we came home, we didn't want to give it to our family," Matt Foran, of Chicago, said through his disposable mask. Foran is a student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who left before the semester's end because of the scare.<br><br>On Wednesday the university posted a notice on its Internet site requiring its staff and students to wear masks in all public places, but few students are left there anyway.<br><br>Foran said he planned to go see a doctor after leaving the airport to determine if he had SARS.<br><br>Federal health officials said Wednesday they are developing guidelines to respond to passenger illnesses in an effort to avoid the confusion that occurred when a flight from Tokyo was essentially quarantined in San Jose, Calif., because the crew reported five passengers might have symptoms.<br><br>Dr. Gary Noskin, medical director of infection control at Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital, said the disease's relative contagiousness is unknown, though it appears to be spread by droplets in coughs and sneezes. He said the illness is similar to any upper respiratory tract infection but includes aches and a fever greater than 100.4 degrees.<br><br>Noskin said the hospital is beginning to see patients who believe they have the illness.<br><br>"I just happened to see a patient 15 minutes ago who (had been) in Beijing," he said Wednesday evening. "She just has a common cold, not even a fever. Her employer told her she couldn't come back to work (without seeing a doctor)."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)<br>Mask Culture sweeping the Hongkong Fashion scene<br>by ModaBali Foundation<br><br><img src="http://www.cosmoworlds.com/Graphics/fashion/peter_lau/peter_lau-400x600.jpg"><br>SARS is a mysterious and fast-spreading pneumonia that has already killed 54 and infected 1,460 people. SARS first broke out in Guangdong Nov.02, now it has spread as far as Hongkong, Hanoi ( Vietnam ), Taiwan and Toronto ( Canada ). These early cases even spread rapidly to the doctors and nurses who treated patients suffering from the outbreaks. Some hospital staff stayed in the hospital instead of going home after duty in order not to affect their family. Singapore Airlines grounded the entire cabin crew of flight SQ 25 New York~ Frankfurt, March 14, after the flight attendant became ill. Passengers / Foreign business visits to Hongkong have plummeted. The ones here, many donning face masks and cutting short visits to the city, Rolling Stones who are scheduled to play at a concert Friday night have cancelled their trip. The Rugby Sevens team from France, Italy and Argentina pulled out of a weekend tournament.<br><br>Asian fashion designer Ika Butoni joined exhibition and fashion show in CHIC Beijing. The same flight the day before, Air China Flight II2 Hongkong~ Beijing, 9 people were infected. Returning to Hongkong, to her surprise, half of the population donned on face mask, especially in public area/ transport like in MTR &amp;  busses. On her flight home to Bali, half the Cathay Pacific Airways cabin crew also wore gloves and face masks, this has been approved by Cathay Pacific after the cabin attendant in SQ was down with this mysterious influenza. Now there is a 'Mask Culture' sweeping the Hongkong Fashion scene with designers coming out with 'Designer's face mask'. Peter Lau, Hongkong designer is selling it for Hkg $299,-( US $38,50). It comes out in laces, polka dots etc. He felt Hongkong doesn't have to walk around with these hospital surgical mask, it can go with his clothes to be fashionable at the same token while it protects his customers. There are also products claimed to be with brands like GUCCI and LV selling at HK $ 1800,-( US $232,-), although when called, these company did not have any plan to sell face mask</div>
