You can grab hold of the hand holding the knife though. Once you grab hold of his hand holding the knife, do an arm lock or twist his hand. The arm lock or twisting of his hand will make him painful and he will drop the knife.

Everyone learns it independently, I have not come across any martial arts school/centres which specifically teach tricks. It is very much like break dancing. Are you interested?

Don't learn it through the web. If your school has wushu CCA, join it. Nowadays, wushu is more of contemporary rather than for self defense. So you will get to learn all these tricks.</div>
