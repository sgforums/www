            <div class='col-md body'>1. Boarders is better known as the national library<br>2. Newater tastes so bad you'd rather drink your own shit. Wwaaaiittt a minute<br>3. Half of singapore's economy can be found in neoprint machines<br>4. Your presidents' name rhymes with cockanarthan<br>5. You'd willingly spend thousands of dollars on a car but blatantly refuse to pay $1.20 for parking<br>6. Your girlfriends cant finish their 2.4km runs under half an hour but would cover the entire length of orchard road and back in 7 nanoseconds<br>7. You cant remember the last time the "great robinsons sale" ended<br>8. You elect PCK as the next prime minister<br>9. You think chicken rice is the national food and is god's gift to the world next to beer and weed<br>10. Talking cock is more believable than the local evening news<br>11. You speak better english than your english teacher<br>12. You're able to swear in hokkien so fluently the f word is redundant<br>13. You cant punctuate a sentence without lah, leh or lor.<br>14. When a green man means saunter across the road and a flashing green man means indecency<br>15. Your mother loves you more when you get into RI than when you were born<br>16. You'd rather SMS for 1/2 an hour than get the same message conveyed in 3mins by talking on the phone.<br>17. CS and IRC are national sports/activities and DDR gets you more motivated and worked out than the national "work out".<br>18. A multi-million dollar world class center of the arts is better known as a spikey green fruit with a foul stench.<br>19. You're not an honourable husband if you havent donated your liver to your wife.<br>20. "SSCCCUUUSSSEEE" is an acceptable method of getting someone to shove off<br>21. The entire day is spent reciting every-single-station on the MRT lines.<br>22. You've forgotten what it feels like to speak softly into the phone.<br>23. You still think you open and close a light.<br>24. When boasting that you live in a culturally diverse society actually means you swear in 5 different languages.<br>25. 3. When a british guy farts and says "pardon me", an american guy farts and says "excuse me", but a singaporean farts and says "wasnt me!"<br>26. A red light means go unless there's a camera, a green light means hit the blind pedastrian crossing the road and an amber means disregard the old lady shuffling her way across the street for it's pedal to the metal<br>27. When it doesnt phase you that 4 out of 4 million people turned up to protest against the war on iraq (whereby million and millions of innocent lives will be lost) but you'd fight over your mother's grave for a hello kitty doll<br>28. You run for cover when there's a woman behind the wheel of a merc. You call the police when there's a taxi driver next to the woman in the merc and you hide for god given life when there's a SBS bus behind all of them<br>29. When "isolate yourself in fear of SARS" becomes "Hey let's go down to orchard!"<br>30. Porn is banned but most kids at 11 are getting their sex ed off kazaa and can teach their teachers a thing or two<br>31. When you've sung the national anthem and said the pledge every morning for 15 years but still have absolutely no clue wtf they mean.<br>32. When chicks dig bands like F4<br>33. Give me a second, still trying to get over 32.<br>34. oo and bands like "comic boyz" and "5566". wtf man?<br>35. For the love of god, will someone kill zai zai and get it over and done with already?<br>36. As the malaysian saying goes, "The chinese will do the work, the malays will get the credit and the indians will get the blame"<br>37. When our education standards are among the worlds' highest but we persist to literally buying foreign talent.<br>38. Foreign talent = ang moh who speaks chimology littered with random big/long/complicated words that have absolutely no use but to condenscend and intimidate.<br>39. You're labelled a 'quitter' when you leave the country to contribute your talents elsewhere but its ok for stayers with a load of potential to be overshadowed by white foreign talent<br>40. You cant tuck your shirt in without having the back part of it out.<br>41. Disappearing forests of the world can be attributed to our students studying for their Os<br>42. "Serving your nation" is merely 3 years of the prime of your male life wasted away to bad food and torture<br>43. The singapore flag has exactly the same colours as the nation that tortured and mutilated our country just decades ago. repeat after me, rriissiiinnggg ssuuunnn<br>44.
