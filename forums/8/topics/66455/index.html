            <div class='col-md body'>to bring a relationship into NS means lots of trust and commitments from either party...<br>the gal gotta be more understanding tat along with NS is a package of tight schedules and limited time... You will not get enuff time to spend with the gal as before, so this must be understood. If she can't understand this fact then this is goin to be a hurdle for you all to cross.<br>then there is also temptation from the "outside" world where she will get to interact with other guys. This means that the ger must be commited to stay with you and withstands the lure of the "outside" world.<br>If your relationship can withstand thru the test of NS, most likely, it would last...<br>just my 2 cents.</div>
