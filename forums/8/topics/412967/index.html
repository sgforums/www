              <p>Hi I am thinking about buying a new electric guitar. I am currently playing some ibanez gio series, but i want to get a new guitar. I was thinking of an Ibanez Jet King or maybe a Fender Stratocaster. </p>
              <p>Can you guys tell me what electric you play, and what it's like?</p>

              <p>Just like photography can after process. The cam and lens can produce a standard quality of photos, however, printer for hardcopy prints, post processing software and also your computer monitor determines the final output.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>your guitar body prvide the ergonomy, the pickups and quality of the connectiosn from the pickup to the audio output jet quality is of importance. however, your pedals, sound amplifier and strings type and branding cannot be missed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>brand i don't know. pros can advice here.</p>

              <p>what sound do you like?  that is the main reason why people have different guitars.</p>
              <p>once you have decided what sound you want, go have a feel of the guitar : is the action too high or low? it the neck comfortable for you?</p>
              <p>after all that, then you look at the cosmetic side of the guitar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>fender strat has its own sound, the les paul has a fat sound... etc etc</p>
              <p>and within the brands, they have different guitars with their own sound.</p>
              <p>so choose your sound, then feel it, then choose the design.</p>

              <p><br>so compare to airbrush sketching and all types of art lor. the most important thing is the sound you liek to play. heavy fine. you playing for fun or any bands song you play over? why you like their sounds? or imagine one day can play on stages like them? i used to dig certain bands. but as i grow older i find that the music scene is very similar to the business commercial world. sometimes musicians just cannot play the sounds they want due to constarints. to sell and make money the type of sounds majority of the people wants or the market demands. i suggest you not buying a new one. just play and enjoy it. if you know your notes well you should be writing your own sounds. you have any blog? maybe can link it. i looking for musicians to photograph. but i will not contact you here and with this nick. leave your contact information at the blog. one fine day i will contact yu for photography session if you are keen also to do it with me after your own review.</p>
