            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan warned Singapore could very well be the next target for terrorists.<br><br>He said the people of London had beaten the terrorists by getting back to their normal lives quickly.<br><br>So too, must Singapore if it ever comes under attack, he added. The stark message is that Singaporeans have to live with terror, and take security measures as a necessary fact of life.<br><br>Dr Tan, who is also Coordinating Minister for Security and Defence, said this in a ministerial statement in Parliament in response to the recent London explosions.<br><br>Singapore's public transport system comprises a comprehensive bus and train network - both underground and above ground.<br><br>And security agencies have been progressively increasing its security, to prevent an attack, and to deal with the consequences of one.<br><br>Immediately after the July 7h London bomb blasts, police patrols at Singapore's MRT stations were stepped up and train operators increased checks done on commuters.<br><br>Singapore's security agencies are now planning to deploy explosive detection dog teams at MRT stations to carry out surprise checks.<br><br>And there are lessons for Singapore from the latest London incidents.<br><br>Dr Tan said: "Even a city as hardened and prepared as London became victim to terrorist attacks.The next target could well be Singapore. One of the lessons we can learn from Britain is practice does work.<br><br>"In Britain they have a Civil Contingency Secretariat, which practices these scenarios again and again. When it happened, all their systems went into place. There is no panic, people were evacuated, rescued, life went back to normal within a day and that is what we have to do in Singapore."<br><br>But the fight against terrorism is not just the government's responsibility.<br><br>Dr Tan mentioned a Channel NewsAsia news item which showed that Singaporeans were just not vigilant enough.<br><br>He said he watched the television programme where an unattended bag was deliberately left at Raffles Place and it was spotted by two American women.<br><br>Dr Tan said the two women had been used to such an attack that they decided to raise the alarm.<br><br>He reminded Singaporeans that they are "the eyes and ears, and the extended reach of the security agencies".<br><br>Dr Tan said it was just as important that the country's Muslims are well integrated into the community to prevent any backlash if there is a terror attack.<br><br>He said any backlash against the Muslim community could split the country and lay to waste the decades of hard work we have put in into nurturing racial and religious harmony, and in building up social resilience. - CNA/de<br><strong><br>I have learnt not to be in blue chamber of a MRT train.<br><br>What have your learnt?</strong></div>

And Singaporeans are usually the "bo hew" attitude,doesnt pay attention to any special stuffs left alongside the road,etc..thinking its rubbish or whatever. Not much of in-dept education is given to the public regarding the types of bombs and how to identify them,maybe except for guys who went through NS and have done guard duties before. Singaporean really need to be very alert!<br><br></div>

The JI gets fingered by the government, then when investigations prove them wrong, confidence in them erodes overnight. As a result, a new regime gets voted in at the polls. This is one lesson we can learn from the Spaniards.</div>

Caused the whole East to west line to jam at peak hours in the morning. Businesses expected to lose $10 millions. Some of the major trading houses are planning to sue him. Durai is planing to sue too. He said that he missed a $100,000/month job interview and is planning to sue Moo for 10 peanuts. As of now, Uncle_MooMoo is believed to be on the run. Also, a report from the AlQaeda website says that it is planning to sponsor Uncle_MooMoo to get out of Singapore as it is very thankful for him to cause panic in Singapore without it lifting a single finger.<br><br>But our Uncle_MooMoo is a smart uncle. The above scenario won't happen because he won't call the cops.</div>

I am too.<br><br>So unless the family member, friends or myself kana, then I care, else, no money no talk.<br><br>That is another reason why i want to migrate to Australia, at least they care for their citizens. I want to go there to pick up civil-mindedness and be a good citizen of the earth. In Singapore, it is always just money money and me me. Look at the drug traffiking lady who kana jailed in Indonesia. If it is a Singaporean who kana jailed, who cares right?</div>
