              <div><br></div>
              <p><span> China can expect to be a major target of rising trade 
              protectionism - particularly from the United States and India - as the world 
              struggles to recover from the global financial crisis, the Ministry of Commerce 
              (MOFCOM) said Thursday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span>    The crisis has pushed trade protectionist cases to a historical high. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"The US is abusing trade protectionist tools to help its own industries 
              tide over the economic slowdown. The loss for Chinese businesses is huge," </strong></span>said 
              Zhou Xiaoyan, deputy director of the China Bureau of Fair Trade for Imports 
              &amp; Exports. </span></p>
              <p><span>    As a consequence, China will have an even harder time than it does now, 
              encountering anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and special protection cases, officials 
              said. </span></p>
              <p><span>    From last September to this June, the main World Trade Organization 
              members, including the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> US and European nations, launched 77 cases worth $9.8 
              billion against China, </strong></span>increasing the number by 112 percent from a year earlier. </span></p>
              <p><span>    Zhou said, moreover, that due to the sharp competitiveness of Chinese 
              products and to the advantage it has of cheap labor costs, sufficient funds and 
              high-quality technology, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the country will be targeted for some time. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span>    The fair trade bureau, which is under MOFCOM, is responsible for dealing 
              with trade protectionist cases. </span></p>
