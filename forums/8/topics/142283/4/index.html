            <div class='col-md body'>One angmoh has just written to ST Forum, asking if the artistes who performed received payments, and if they charged 'full' scale for their performance. Now that is going to open another CAN of worms....<br><br>The Chinese papers this morning lambasted Cao Qitai - Timothy woh ! The viewers were unhappy that Cao in his closing speech said that unlike Singaporean views who might eventually forget 1900 112 6868, he would always remember.<br><br>Viewers complained that Cao was being sarcastic in his remarks, and that his facial expression was apparent.<br><br>NOW let's find out how much Cao Qitai is being paid. If he is paid some astronomical figures, that will be interesting. He is just unhappy that Singaporeans have together slaughtered his 'golden goose'.<br><br>Cao is a PR after so many years. Like the rest of the FTs who refused to take up citizenship, Cao's fox tail has finally shown !<br><br><a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages/?msg=77204" rel="nofollow">http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages/?msg=77204</a></div>
