            <div class='col-md body'>Our PM has given his reasons for giving the green light to casinos.  Very diplomatically, he has stated that he "hopes to bring all Singaporeans together, so that even though we may not all agree on this issue, we understand and respect each other's reasons and concerns, and can close ranks and move ahead."<br><br>It would appear that the primary reason for the approval of the casinos is that it would boost the tourism industry in Singapore.  Mind you, it is not that our tourism industry is presently ailing.  The numbers are in fact up.  It is just that our share of the Asian tourism pie has gone down.  As an example, whereas tourists used to stay in Singapore for 4 days in the past, they now stay for 3 days.  This compared to 4 days in HK, 5 days in London and a week in NY.<br><br>Ok, so it would seem that casinos have a direct correlation with tourism in Singapore... No, now wait a minute, we cannot be sure of that, can we?  Singapore never had a casino, so we don't quite know what impact a casino will have on tourism in Singapore.<br><br>Or maybe casinos have a direct correlation with tourism in ANY COUNTRY.  That would be a good basis to think that a casino would boost tourism in Singapore, now wouldn't it?  Unfortunately, we do not have any feedback on whether the tourists stay those extra days in HK, London and NY because of a casino...<br><br>So it seems that we're really just guessing and hoping that a casino would have a positive effect on tourism.<br><br>Ok, let us move on to the next issue...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What we have by way of feedback is that Singapore is unexciting.  There are too few things to do that hold the attention of tourists.  Apparently, them blasted Hongkies and Rebel Chinese laugh at us, saying that the water in Singapore is too clear and hence there are no fish.  Hmm... what does that mean?<br><br>So Singapore is now too clean and green?  Too law and orderly?  Hence unexciting?  That is why we need to introduce some vice into this country in the name of tourism?  Doesn't sound very Confuscian to me to do that...<br><br>But really, is the ONLY solution to an unexciting Singapore the introduction of a casino??  Perhaps if we were to relax some rules and regulations here and there, allow people to develop their own areas of interest, allow places of historical interest in Singapore to have a chance of organic growth... maybe that might make Singapore more interesting?<br><br>Or maybe a Disneyland without a casino?  Or something else?  Is the casino the only answer to make Singapore exciting?<br><br>Well I know I do not go to London or NY because they have casinos (do they?)...  I find the city exciting for many other reasons...<br><br>Are we barking up the wrong tree here on the tourism issue?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Then it is said that the rest of the world is reinventing their cities.  Singapore has to do so too.  We want Singapore to have the X-factor - that buzz you get in London, Paris or New York...<br><br>Hmmm...  How does that translate into casino again?  I am probably right in posing this question, because the PM does seem to admit that "[a] casino by itself is not essential to this vision.  But an IR is not just a casino.  An IR is one significant idea we must consider, that will help us reinvent Singapore."<br><br>Sigh... I have this nagging feeling that it takes a LOT more from within the soul of Singapore to reinvent Singapore than just the building of these so-called Integrated Resorts and casinos... but I digress.<br><br>Point is, in view of the apparent admission above, can we have an IR without a casino?  Has that been considered and explored?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bottom line to me is this.  Gambling is a vice.  We are trying to introduce a vice into Singapore.  Whether it is a vice for foreigners only or not, it will still not look very good on the moral foundation of Singapore.  Yes, Singapore, the most vociferous proponent of Asian/ Confuscian values on the international stage.  The justifications had better damn well be good if they're going ahead with the idea.<br><br>Because really now, let us not forget that the sex industry is also one that attracts tourists from around the world.  It is a slippery slope once you start compromising morals and principles so easily for the sake of $$$.<br><br>NB.  Personally, I have no issues against casinos.  What I have an issue with is inconsistency (putting it mildly).  Are we, or are we not clean and green?  If we are not, a lot of restrictive laws and regulations have to go.</div>
