            <div class='col-md body'>Heh.....some years ago I was on a business trip to Bangkok and was having dinner alone at the hotel cafe.  Just opposite me there was drop-dead gorgeous-die-die-also-must-beo kinda girl.  Tall, fair, pretty, boobsy...beats any model.  She was eating alone too.<br><br>Before I knew it, she was smiling at me.  Wah, first time in my life....in fact, it was the first and only time in my life any girl (pretty or ugly) has smiled at me lah.  Wah....felt so special....oooh, steam-steam. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But one thing hor....when she ate, she spat the chicken/fish bones all over the table.  Wah, so untidy and disgusting.  So I knew she couldn't be Thai.  She must have spat out at least 0.5 litres of saliva that evening.<br><br>She then walked up to me and asked for a light.  She was from China and spoke immaculately sexy Mandarin.  After lighting up, she asked me if she could join me.  Of course I said OK lah.  But being a frequent traveller, of course alarm bells also went off...."if its too good to be true, its probably fake".<br><br>When we were done with dinner, she insisted on separate bills, which impressed me.  Then she asked to come to my room, which didn't impress me (I don't let strangers into my hotel room - its like asking for trouble).  So I polite declined, giving some excuse (forgot what excuse lah, probably work or something).<br><br>Then she asked me if I could buy her a four-faced Thai Buddha pendant. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">   Wah.....like that also can.
