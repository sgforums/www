Mahathir asked,<br>"Yes, but how do you know that they are able?"<br><br>PM Goh replied, "Just ask them simple questions to test their<br>intelligence, dont need to be too difficult. Let me illustrate to you."<br>Just then, Tony Tan was walking by, PM Goh called out to him,<br>"Hey Tony, come over here." Tony obediently walked briskly over.<br><br>PM Goh asked, "Tell me, Tony, who is your fathers son ?" Tony Tan<br>immediately replied, "Me! Of course."<br><br>PM Goh turned to Mahathir and said, "See, all my ministers can<br>answer this question. Why don't you go back and try."<br>Mahathir thank PM Goh and left.<br><br>Once he was back, he immediately summoned Anwar, his deputy,<br>and shot the question at him, "Tell me, Anwar, who is your father's son ?"<br>Anwar was shocked beyond words and did not know the answer.<br>After a while, he recovered and said, "Boss, let me find out and I'll<br>tell you tomorrow." Mahathir, a bit disappointed, agreed,<br>hoping that Anwar will give a good answer tomorrow.<br><br>Meanwhile, Anwar was panicking that his boss was testing him.<br>He tried desperately to find out the answer from his staff,<br>but none of them knew the answer. The next morning,<br>he decided to call Bill Clinton for help. Surely the most powerful<br>person in the world must know the answer.<br><br>When Bill picked up the phone, Anwar said, "Hello, Bill,<br>can I ask you a question?" Clinton, very busy, replied,<br>"Alright, but it better be good !" Anwar quickly asked,<br>"Tell me, Bill, who is your father's son ?"<br>Clinton was fuming, "Of course it's me, you stupid !"<br>and he slammed the phone down.<br><br>Statisfied that he's got the answer, he confidently walked into<br>Mahathirs office and said, "Boss, I've got the answer to your question."<br>Mahathir, happy that his deputy wasn't that dumb, said, "So tell me quick,<br>who is your fathers son, Anwar ?"<br><br>Anwar confidently replied, "It's BILL CLINTON !"<br><br>Mahathir slapped his own forehead in disgust and said,<br>"No you stupid, it's TONY TAN !"<br><br>[This message has been edited by Atti (edited 21 June 2000).]</div>
