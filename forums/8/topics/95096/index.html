            <div class='col-md body'>Stick-Free Thoughts from a Sticky Mind<br><br>A normal pan sticks to the food on it, making it troublesome to cook and wash. A non-stick pan* makes cooking and washing easier because nothing sticks to it. Likewise, an untrained mind is attached to many unnecessary things, making it difficult to "cleanse", to be clean enough to be truly useful. A "non-stick mind" is skillful because while it sticks to nothing and nothing sticks to it, it can function afresh in each moment, and "behold" everything it encounters in its true light without any preconceived ideas. It sees the Truth.<br><br>In the Platform Sutra, the Sixth Patriarch Master Huineng said, "When he (the Fifth Patriarch) taught the line (in the Diamond Sutra), 'One should use the mind without abiding anywhere,' I at once became thoroughly enlightened, and realised that all things in the universe are the essence of mind itself."<br><br>A pure mind clings to nothing whatsoever. That is how the mind should be established -<br>by not establishing anywhere, by not dwelling on anything, be it sight, sound, smell, taste, touch or thought, greed or non-greed, hatred or non-hatred, delusion or non-delusion. It does not dwell on the past, present or future. A non-stick mind neither creates nor retains any stubborn "stains", and harbours neither attachment nor aversion. It makes peace with the rising and falling of pain and pleasure, gain and loss, fame and defame, praise and blame. It knows the temporal and therefore empty nature of the above eight worldly concerns, and is thus "unconcerned" of their ultimately unsubstantial effects on oneself.<br><br>Such is a liberated mind, at one with all, trapped by nothing, free from everything, functioning directly from one's Buddha-nature, flowing with natural compassion and wisdom. When our mind truly does not dwell on anything, it is truly capable of anything in its immeasurable openness. It is then one with the boundless universal womb of emptiness, which gives birth to infinite possibilities. Realise that everything manifests from the mind, that in dwelling on its manifestations and thoughts about them, we miss the true unadulterated original nature of everything - the Truth itself.<br><br>The closing verse of the Diamond Sutra says "All conditioned phenomena is like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows, like dewdrops and lightning flashes. One should contemplate thus." What then, can truly stick in your mind? Thinking that "to have and to hold" is possible in the first place is but wishful thinking, a figment of our deluded imagination. Realising the Truth will set you free. But the Truth is, you already are free.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Q: How does one clear away ideas?<br><br>A: By seeing ideas as ideas and not as truths; by being aware of mental formations through meditation.<br><br>Q: Are there various kinds of Buddhist meditation?<br><br>A: There are different exercises taught by teachers of different Buddhist traditions and schools. The main differences, however, are superficial ones, related to psychological or emotional problems. Many of these exercises can only be administered by experienced meditation teachers. For the average person, however, whose sole aim is to realise the deep clear teachings of the Buddha, meditation is a simple process of awareness and investigation.<br><br>Q: How does one practise this kind of meditation?<br><br>A: By being fully aware, as one thinks, speaks and acts.<br><br>Q: But what about sitting meditation?<br><br>A: Sitting meditation is the same. It is just a question of being aware. Sitting meditation is an excellent thing to do, but some people are not able to find a quiet spot to sit in every day. If this is the case, one is not automatically debarred from the insights of meditation. To meditate properly is to do one's duty and to live without wishing life were different, or somehow better.<br><br>The opportunity for seeing truth is ever present, because truth is ever present. Just because the sun is covered by clouds does not mean the sun is not there. Conditions are always just right for being aware of the true situation. All one has to do is be conscious of what is taking place within one and around one, without making any judgements. If we "see" by being aware, then we shall see very deeply into everything.<br><br>Q: How does one practise sitting meditation?<br><br>A: Sitting meditation is the shutting down of all sense stimuli in order to realise that awareness is not a function of the senses or of the thinking process. It is practised by sitting quite still with the eyes closed (or not focusing on anything), by letting life be, by breathing in and out (not changing the breath, not trying to breath deeply), by just breathing the way one always breathes, and by noticing the subtle changes in the mind and in the body. It is neither difficult nor complicated.<br><br>Q: Does one need to have a meditation teacher?<br><br>A: The Buddha's teaching can be the teacher and awareness can be the practice which will lead straight to liberation.<br><br>Q: What is karma?<br><br>A: It is cause and effect. When someone commits a crime, he suffers the consequences. That is karma. When someone does good, he enjoys the consequences. That is karma. But karma runs deep; its affects our hearts and minds. From the beginning, mind is absolutely pure. If we are unkind, deceitful, greedy or cruel, we defile that purity. Imagine a plain white cloth, beautiful, bright and clean. And then imagine someone splattering it with black ink. The cloth is then spoilt. The mind is like the white cloth. Like and dislike, greed and hatred, are like the ink splattered across it. When the mind is unmarked and unspoilt, suffering and enjoyment do not exist. This is happiness beyond pleasure, beyond karma. All karma is impermanent and runs out in due course. A Buddhist will learn how to get off the karmic see-saw of pleasure and pain.<br><br>Q: Can anyone see the Truth?<br>A: The Buddha was compassionate. He did not teach an impossible teaching that ordinary people could not understand. On the contrary, his teaching was clear and simple. Anyone who makes the effort to be aware will realise his or her Buddha-nature and be freed from suffering.<br><br>Before you go off<br>in search of enlightenment,<br>see the Buddha<br>of your own mind.<br><br>MAY ALL BE WELL AND HAPPY <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></div>
