I am very suspicious on why there are very big differences in timings and the accounts from all parties....<br><br><blockquote> Checkpoint officers had rendered assistance<br>WE EXTEND our sincere condolences to Mr Norhafiz Zahid and his family on the loss of his father ('No help for dying dad at Woodlands checkpoint'; ST, July 16).<br><br>We wish to clarify some facts. Mr Norhafiz wrote that he arrived at Woodlands Checkpoint at 12.10am where he called 995 for an ambulance from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF).<br><br>The timings of CCTV recordings and computer systems at the immigration booths are logged. All calls to SCDF are also recorded and tracked automatically, from the time of call to the despatch and arrival of the ambulance, and until the patient is transferred to hospital.<br><br>Based on these records, Mr Norhafiz's car arrived at the Woodlands Checkpoint at 12.50am, joining a queue of two cars at an immigration booth at 12.53am. He got out of his car and handed over his and his father's passports to an officer of the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) and sought her help to jump the queue. As the single-lane design of the immigration booth allows only one car to pass, the ICA officer quickly cleared the two cars in front of his so that he could drive through.<br><br>Mr Norhafiz made a call to the SCDF for an ambulance at 12.55am. He was informed that an ambulance would be despatched.<br><br>Mr Norhafiz and his father's passports were processed without delay at the immigration booth at 12.57am, four minutes after his car joined the queue at the booth.<br><br>After immigration clearance, he alerted the checkpoint officer manning the Police Enforcement Terminal to his father's condition. This was at 12.58am. The officer immediately called the SCDF for an ambulance. This call was also recorded by the SCDF system.<br><br>The ambulance arrived at the Woodlands Checkpoint at 1.01am, six minutes after receiving Mr Norhafiz's call. The paramedics found his father to be having no pulse and not breathing. They commenced cardio-pulmonary resuscitation immediately and continued CPR en route to National University Hospital.<br><br>We are sorry that our officers might have given Mr Norhafiz the impression that they were unhelpful and uncaring. Our officers had tried their best to render assistance.<br><br>Mr Norhafiz suggested that more staff should be trained in first aid and CPR. Some officers have already been trained and more will be trained. There is also an on-going effort not only to train Home Team officers but also to encourage members of the public to learn such skills.<br><br>We would like to assure Mr Norhafiz that we do not condone rudeness and unprofessional conduct by our officers. If he wishes, we could meet him to discuss this matter further.<br><br>LTC N.

The most she justifies her action by telling herself that there was this mad person knocking frantically on the glass. And she was doing her duty protecting the borders of Sg from illegal immigrants. I will bet she sleeps soundly as always too. Only when she is put into such a critical situation, as the poor man, will she understand that helplessness feeling. Too bad karma does not come around fast enough. Too heartless a society we have become.</div>

He did something out of panic and caused the officer in the booth to slam his/her door at him. He should had approached any officers stationed at the side of the road  to actually inform the officers in the front what is going on.<br><br>By doing so, he would actually be able to move through the custom more smoothly and not having to stop his vehicle, leave the seat and try to get the officer in the booth attention.<br><br>It is normal for people to slam their door shut and hey... it is a safety precaution... Let say you see someone out of the sudden ran towards you and maybe in a pananorid way... would you not slam the door at that person to protect yourself first?<br><br>And somemore, he should had ask other passengers in the car to seek help... you think it would not take time to park the car, open the door, walk here and there, come back, release handbrake and drive meh?<br><br>It can be done, but is the person really rational enough to correctly seek help at that moment? No one would know.</div>
