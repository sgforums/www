I am sure everyone will let him first.<br>The person - say the officer process 2 cars more before his car !!! Dumbass !! he should just run to the 2 car that is waiting to process and just tell them - my dad got heart attack in car behind you, need go hospital - pls let us go 1st !!! then they will let he go first to the officer, that time the officer sure to process him first.<br><br>There is so many officer there in different counter, or the main office, he just ask once, and dumb dumb wait in line !!! he should have ask others for help also.<br><br>I do not think we should believe what that person is saying !!! <blockquote>Not a single officer came forward to help at first.

Think his brain that time is screwed , to him everything is in slow motion !!!<br><br>I think the person panic till he does not think, and expect everyone to read his mind , which is unfair.<br><br>Also his comments<br><blockquote>shouldn't a paramedic team be stationed there in the event of an emergency?<br></blockquote>How many case like that !!! happen at the causeway ? I think not enough, think other place have more need of paramedic than there in Singapore !!!

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ORIGAMIST:</div><div class="quote_body">Home &gt; ST Forum &gt; Story<br>July 16, 2007<br><br>ON JUNE 29, my family and I were on our way to Johor Baru. At about 11.30pm, just after clearing the Malaysian checkpoint at the Causeway, my father had chest pains and breathing difficulty. We had to cancel our trip and return to Singapore. I immediately made a U-turn.<br>At about 12.10am, when we arrived at Woodlands checkpoint, I called 995. A Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) operator assured me an ambulance would be dispatched as soon as possible and I would be kept informed of its arrival.<br><br>I proceeded to booth 15. As there were two cars ahead of us, to save precious time, I pulled up and, leaving the engine running, I ran to the booth, hoping to jump the queue and get our passports endorsed quickly so we could secure medical help for my father.<br><br>Seeing the immigration officer engaged, I tapped on the glass panel in desperation. Without allowing me to explain, she slammed the glass door in my face and pushed aside our passports I had placed on her counter to continue serving the two cars before us.<br><br>The whole episode took a good 10 minutes and by the time I went back to drive my car to the booth, my father's condition had taken a turn for the worse.<br><br>Finally, after our passports had been endorsed, I drove to the red lane for Customs clearance to seek assistance from Customs officers. Another rude shock awaited me there.<br><br>Not a single officer came forward to help at first. Subsequently, an officer who noticed my father gasping for breath called for an ambulance. The ambulance eventually arrived but, by then, it was too late as my father had slipped into unconsciousness.<br><br>I was appalled by the way the officers conducted themselves.<br><br>Also, the assurance by the SCDF operator that an ambulance would be rushed to the scene and I would be kept informed of its whereabouts was false. Isn't 995 meant for emergency only and shouldn't cases involving a dying man be attended to as quickly as possible?<br><br>When I sought assistance at the red lane, none of the officers could perform cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Aren't front-line officers manning checkpoints supposed to be trained in CPR? Alternatively, shouldn't a paramedic team be stationed there in the event of an emergency?<br><br>If only help had been at hand, it might have saved my father's life.<br><br>Norhafiz Zahid<br><br>This is taken off ST interactive.  But here, it does show us how a world class country with a world class government work.  There is so much to learn from them ....<br><br></div></blockquote>I dont think front-line officers manning checkpoints are supposed to be trained in CPR. They are there to check illegal immigrants which is their priority. CPR should be done by medical officer and not immigration officer as they are inexperience.</div>
