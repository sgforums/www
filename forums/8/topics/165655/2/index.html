            <div class='col-md body'>when i was in Sec 3, i had a new classmate. this PRC fellow from dono-which-part-of-china. he had no friends. we tried very hard to mix with him and bring him into our circle of friends. he would give the same reason like "i'm busy.. very sorry." (yes, u can imagine how their english would be)<br><br>3/4 months later, he ran away frm home and booked a ticket to beijing and flew off w/o telling any1 of us. not even his parents. it became a police case and my classmates and myself were all complicated in it. the reason he gave for running away : they didnt want to be friends with me.<br><br>Dec 2004. OBS in Pulau Ubin. we all thought that we would be with students from other junior colleges or something.. when we reached Ubin, we found out that majority of the campers were PRC scholars who just came in. being in a sports CCA, me and my friends went thru rigorous physical exercise for OBS, thinking that it would be stretenous. 5 days with PRCs. in a group of 15, 10 were PRCs, 5 were my schmates.<br><br>the instructor told us all to be ready in PE attire coz' we're going to do a jetty jump. DESPITE THIS SIMPLE INSTRUCTION, they turned up wearing long pants and jeans!! isnt it ironic that they do so well in sch but cant understand simple instructions..<br><br>and on the last day.. the instructor told me and my friends.. the locals lah.. that our OBS had activities cut off coz' of the PRCs. as in our OBS was less challenging, or shud i say not challenging at all.<br><br>Jan 2005. PRCs were in the 1st 3 months of JC. after this 1st 3 months, they would go and join the universities in singapore in july(which they are already in now). as usual, 1st 3 months syllabus is very slack.. yet, some of them had to blatantly shout to the tutor... "this is very easy!!!" (yes, again, u can imagine how they wud say it)<br><br>it's not that i hate them. as the saying goes, when u're in rome, do what the romans do.. as a visitor, they shud know the do's and don'ts. be humble. any similar experiences anyone wud like to share?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sinicker:</div><div class="quote_body">when i was in Sec 3, i had a new classmate. this PRC fellow from dono-which-part-of-china. he had no friends. we tried very hard to mix with him and bring him into our circle of friends. he would give the same reason like "i'm busy.. very sorry." (yes, u can imagine how their english would be)<br><br>3/4 months later, he ran away frm home and booked a ticket to beijing and flew off w/o telling any1 of us. not even his parents. it became a police case and my classmates and myself were all complicated in it. the reason he gave for running away : they didnt want to be friends with me.<br><br>Dec 2004. OBS in Pulau Ubin. we all thought that we would be with students from other junior colleges or something.. when we reached Ubin, we found out that majority of the campers were PRC scholars who just came in. being in a sports CCA, me and my friends went thru rigorous physical exercise for OBS, thinking that it would be stretenous. 5 days with PRCs. in a group of 15, 10 were PRCs, 5 were my schmates.<br><br>the instructor told us all to be ready in PE attire coz' we're going to do a jetty jump. DESPITE THIS SIMPLE INSTRUCTION, they turned up wearing long pants and jeans!! isnt it ironic that they do so well in sch but cant understand simple instructions..<br><br>and on the last day.. the instructor told me and my friends.. the locals lah.. that our OBS had activities cut off coz' of the PRCs. as in our OBS was less challenging, or shud i say not challenging at all.<br><br>Jan 2005. PRCs were in the 1st 3 months of JC. after this 1st 3 months, they would go and join the universities in singapore in july(which they are already in now). as usual, 1st 3 months syllabus is very slack.. yet, some of them had to blatantly shout to the tutor... "this is very easy!!!" (yes, again, u can imagine how they wud say it)<br><br>it's not that i hate them. as the saying goes, when u're in rome, do what the romans do.. as a visitor, they shud know the do's and don'ts. be humble. any similar experiences anyone wud like to share?</div></blockquote><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;">share what?,you want to get trouble,a sick man .</span></span></strong></div>
