            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Manager433:</div><div class="quote_body">I love dogs. Sometimes I stay over at my friends place just to play with his dogs. Dogs bark because they r protecting their territory/master, a way of 'greeting' you. Or simply a way of trying to 'chase' you away...try give a light pat on their head and let them lick your hand so as to let them get use to you and trust you.....</div></blockquote>I make it a point to "greet" and get to know dogs living in homes close to friends, neighbours and relatives whom I visit regularly. This has worked for me very well and after the initial visits I don't get barked at anymore. In fact, I get greeted by wagging tails and happy faces. It really makes my day <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Sometimes it just takes alittle understanding, effort and graciousness for everyone to get along.  The action taken doesn't have to be vicious or retaliative. I have friends who don't have children yet who complain that their neighbours don't know how to bring their children up - they allow their kids to scream at the top of their lungs, throw tantrums, shout at adults, throw food wrappers into their neighbour's houses, play noisily, push other kids at playgrounds and pee in public.  When they read complaints about dogs in the newspapers, they wonder whom they can complain to about irresponsible parents and noisy children  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
