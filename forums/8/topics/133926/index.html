            <div class='col-md body'>I moved in Hougang about two years back. My neighbour owned a dog which bark everyday when you passed by the flat.  After so long the barking continue....<br><br>When we move in, my father move in with me.  He was 88 years old.  He had weak heart but he endure the barking and so we try to live with it too.  The dog will only bark right after you passed the flat and always give you a fright.  We try not let it bother us as we just moved in.  One day, the dog ran out of the house and scratch me on my leg.  Their children ran after it and saw the bleeding.  At that moment I did not complain to them and since they came and apologised and asked about my wound.<br><br>Once, the sudden barking make my father looked pale and I was worried but then my father do not want any trouble and say to let the matter rest.  Then one day, the dog came running out when their door was opened and wanted to attack my 7 years old son.  We were waiting for the lift.  I fend it off and I was very angry.  The owner managed to retreive the dog but I wasn't too happy now.  I called the HDB to complain for the first time and guess what HDB say.  They say they can't do anything to the owner since it is the AVA who issued the license.  I cannot believe HDB cannot do anything and I spent two whole day nagging at them until one of the manager decided to give the owner a written warning.<br><br>In the mean time, I wrote to AVA, they responsed and called my handphone and asked me what had happen.  I relate the whole matter and they were willing to visit that family and mentioned that they will revoke the license if it is true.  I decided to let the matter rest and I told AVA that I am willing to forget the whole matter.<br><br>Then came the irritating part.  After the incident, instead of the dog barking, I got human barking.  Often, I can heard, " Complain, go la complain .... "  It played like a scratched record.  Or they will passed sacartic remark.  I do not response as I do not wish to fight them.  Not long after, my father passed away.  They asked my wife the cause of my father death.  My wife told them that my father had a weak heart.  Then the barking stopped for a few weeks before it resume. My mother is 77 years old and she walk passed the flat every morning.<br><br>Last week, the sudden bark caught my mother off guard and she almost fainted there.  My wife went to the flat and talk to them.  My wife asked that they trained their dog to bark continously and not suddenly.  If the bark bark from the begining and didn't stop, no one will be caught off guard.  With that they complained to my wife that I complained to the Authority because the dog bark.<br><br>They still do not understand that I complain because it wanted to attack my son.  When it attack me, I did not even go knocking on their house...<br><br>Reading in here, I hope someone out here is from the Government Agency to advise me what can I do.  I cannot afford a lawyer to sue them and I don't wish to confront them.  But I do hope the matter can be resolved as I don't want my mum to die of fright.  Anyone who can help, please advise.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

It those small sized about 2 to 2 and half feet.  What I cannot understand is, on the ground floor, there is this family with a large dog.  I think it is a shepherd or something like that.  Stand up, on two feet, it is even taller than me.  This dog don't bark at all.  When the owner take it for a walk.  It walk quitely without disturbing anyone...</div>
