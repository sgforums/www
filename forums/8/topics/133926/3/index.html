I live near Bungalows and the rich asses' dogs are damn irritating. bark and bark non-stop.<br><br>Anyway I have found a solution for you. Buy a dog whistle. It is audible by dogs only but not human. Whenever the farking dog barks. Blow it. It will irritate the hell out of it but your neighbours are clueless what is happening.<br><br>I'm not sure where this is sold but you can easily find one online. Do a search on Google. They even have electronic ones where it can be programmed to  sound whenever a dog barks but damn expensive.</div>
