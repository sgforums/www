            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I suppose this would be my last reply for this thread. Was having a number of interesting conversations with a couple of people last night. And this is what I have learnt:<br><br>1) Never attempt to argue with someone who is dead-bias against u. He/she will bite u like a rabid dog, just to show he got sharp teeth that has nothing else better to do with.<br><br>2) Try not to communicate with a psychopath. Let the experts do it. That's why they have institutions to house them for better care and recovery.<br><br>3) A person who resorts to name-calling in any discussion is someone who doesn't have any better things to say. Learn to ignore them.<br><br>4) Scoring a victory online in any forum is as good as winning $2 in the Big Sweep. Why bother?<br><br>5) When someone is twisting facts to his/her better understanding, respect that belief. We can't change a wrapped and twisted mind. Let the experts do it.<br><br>6) The satisfaction level a psychopath can get from mutliple online personalities is something commoners like me don't comprehend. So don't bother. It could be possible that it's a disguise to hide from many enemies. Who knows?<br><br>7) Green-eyed monsters are devious creatures. They appear anywhere from within a company to a social circle. Learn how to watch out for them.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Not only women have PMS. Guys have them too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>9) Everybody has their own ways to help a friend. That reminds me of a question that was posted some time back.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Larry:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, I suppose this would be my last reply for this thread. Was having a number of interesting conversations with a couple of people last night. And this is what I have learnt:<br><br>1) Never attempt to argue with someone who is dead-bias against u. He/she will bite u like a rabid dog, just to show he got sharp teeth that has nothing else better to do with.<br><br>2) Try not to communicate with a psychopath. Let the experts do it. That's why they have institutions to house them for better care and recovery.<br><br>3) A person who resorts to name-calling in any discussion is someone who doesn't have any better things to say. Learn to ignore them.<br><br>4) Scoring a victory online in any forum is as good as winning $2 in the Big Sweep. Why bother?<br><br>5) When someone is twisting facts to his/her better understanding, respect that belief. We can't change a wrapped and twisted mind. Let the experts do it.<br><br>6) The satisfaction level a psychopath can get from mutliple online personalities is something commoners like me don't comprehend. So don't bother. It could be possible that it's a disguise to hide from many enemies. Who knows?<br><br>7) Green-eyed monsters are devious creatures. They appear anywhere from within a company to a social circle. Learn how to watch out for them.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Not only women have PMS.
