I know of another method using fusion nuclear reaction to produce the same effect using Einstein's theory of General Relativity.

The energy that seems free, but isn't.<br><br>We don't notice it now because we're tapping nature's energy on a small scale, but here's what is going to happen:<br><br>1) dams : tapping water velocity upstream equates to a slower velocity downstream. Slow-flowing water downstream could lead to major ecological changes<br><br>2) wind turbines : tapping the airpower up stream similarly leads to lower wind velocity further down. Can you imagine an area where there is perpetually no wind?<br><br>3) solar power : if we errect enough solar panels to capture the power from the sun, the energy normally reflected back out is cut down.
