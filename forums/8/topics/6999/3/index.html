            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha, this is extremely interesting, someone who sounds so much like me ! If not for my fren who told me about this "Belittled", i wouldn't have come back to sgforums. Hahaha, just curious. Even transquilice is being fooled.  :p<br><br>Well well well, Belittled, very smart of you to use the "attack" strategy like i always do, cos when one adopts the "defence" strategy, he'll post more and he'll tend to make more mistakes ! Hahaha, really smart of you.<br><br>Looks like you have been reading my posts too .... you know well about the "You Are a Chinese, You Better Know Your Language!" thread, and you had also read my quotations in colette's "Quotations" thread. You have even used the quote in my post as your quote !!<br><br>"Life is about making choices. How good is your life depends on how well you make your choices" is MY quote. For the rest of the forumites, if you people dun believe what i say go see :<br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/ubb/Forum2/HTML/001739.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/ubb/Forum2/HTML/001739.html</a><br><br>search for my post, it is on the first page.<br><br>Well well well, Belittled, you are truly interesting, at least to me ! Hahahaha<br><br>Ok ok, let's get down to business.<br><br>I like your mp3 example cos it is MINE !!! Too lazy to search for that thread liaoz, but IT'S MINE !!!<br><br>Sigh.<br><br>I like your hen example, dun worry, it is not mine hahaha !<br><br>Most people had said what i want to say alredi. But Belitted, i will like to remind you that contentment is a form of emotion. And when it comes to emotion, it is difficult to measure. Even if you have 2 persons who are contented, one may be more contented than the other. It is not a discreet factor but more of a continous one.<br><br>My point is, emotion, and hence contentment, is a very complex issue and your hen example does not hold ground here becos you have simplified the situation into only 3 categories. The resolution of such a classification is too low for us to even take a serious look at it.<br><br>Well, I would say that Singapore is a place where the <strong>basic needs of good living</strong> is provided. But the contentment of life is more than just the possession of these basic needs. Don't tell me about the starving Africans or the begging Indians cos we are NOT them.<br><br>No one place in this world allows <strong>all kinds</strong> of plants to grow well. Some grow better in cold conditions, some strive better in warm conditions. And we all know that you cannot have cold and warm conditions all at the same time.<br><br>Singapore has its own environment. This environment allows quite a number of people to strive well. But there are always some plants which prefer cold conditions. Sometimes, it is not their <strong>preference</strong> but more of their <strong>nature</strong>.<br><br>Well you may say that those who need "cold conditions" are the minority. But it is exactly the unhappy minority which we have to take care of, don't you think so ?<br><br>Like to hear from you.<br><br>------------------<br></div>

Being a minority does not give us an excuse to ignore them.<br><br>In the contrary, <strong>local talents</strong> are a group of minorities in Singapore.

It is great to see you back, at least that is a bright spark on an otherwise gloomy horizon.<br></div></blockquote>hi colette, i thought you left liaoz. The thread "singles" seems to have closed down. Nice to hear from you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Well if not for my fren (someone with the nick MaCcCcCcCc) tell me about this Belittled, i wouldn't have came back and check.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Wow, you don't pull your punches, do you? I don't need much clues to know which forumite you are talking about.<br></strong></blockquote>i know you know who i am refering to, but many in this forum may not know mah.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>But why did it bother you so much that you had to leave in the first place? That was what I wanted to ask but never did in the original thread  "Declaring Your Love Publicly".<br></strong></blockquote>cos i am TOTALLY disgusted especially after i had read his 600th post. My gosh !<br><br>He said he could distinguish his real life from his virtual one, how true is that ? So he can have a real lover and a virtual lover at the same time ? And after that, a real family and a virtual family ? or maybe even a real life baby and a virtual baby ??? My gosh ! I am totally disgusted. After that one of the forumites posted in the "declaring" thread saying that if i can't take it, i shall leave. It makes sense, so i left.<br><br>Anyway, i am back. It may be bad news to many. But I am back.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi LittleMan,<br><br>Er, I was only trying to leave the Â“singlesÂ” thread, not the entire forum, but only post once in a while these days. Yup, the Â“singlesÂ” thread is almost as good as dead.<br><br>LittleMan, you sure donÂ’t give subtle hints. Anyway, what goes on behind closed doors, nobody knows and it is none of my business. I would have thought if anyone were to be pissed, it would have been me. Anyway, most of us like to think that we can differentiate between the real and virtual worlds, but sometimes, things are not so clear cut any more after you have been Â“virtual whatever-ingÂ” for a while and thus can get caught up in your own trap, especially if the parties involved have been acting lover-like in private emails and even in the public forum. Even the most level headed of us will also lose it sometimes, my advice to you is that before you brush off my above observation, is that cupids are a bored bunch and they love nothing better than to make one eats oneÂ’s words uttered in haste. I should know, the cupids who are assigned to me suck, they need training in arrow shooting!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You cannot deny that the virtual world do offer people another avenue of expression, sometimes a bored housewife may find solace on the Net with people who seemed tuned in to her needs while her husband ignored her, thereby assuaging her loneliness or a ugly man/woman may find Â“potential partnersÂ” with whom he/she can clicked with just because they can express themselves well with words and since that ugly face is not shown, it may be easy for the potential to fall for the Â“personalityÂ” before the face factor kicks in. And with the passage of time, feelings will definitely come into play and sometimes it is inadvertently, that one may just yearn for the virtual and real worlds to merge. Perhaps that was the case for this forumite, he may have thought that he can keep the two worlds apart but in the end, he may have just hope that the real and virtual worlds are not two but one, well we will never know.<br><br>As the virtual world is also a delayed world, it also allows the participants to present their most beautiful self to all involved, an initial reaction of anger can be worded to sound like calm, etc, etc, so it is terribly easy to beguile another in the virtual world, but not so in the real world as every reaction is instantaneous and recorded as such. So, I would say it takes a lot of skill to keep a balance outlook on these two worlds.<br><br>And it is a good thing you are back, I donÂ’t think many will find you bad news. See? It brought out my first long post in days and I am learning again to type in the correct way too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> And I hope you will stay a while longer this time.<br><br>As to the contents of this thread, I am ashamed to say that I have not be following it, but hereÂ’s my lousy take on it. If one is too content with what one has, one will never improve whereas if one is not content enough, one will be restless forever as one will search and search for it. The best thing would be if one can know what it is that one wants, work for it and once it is achieved, finds another worthwhile goal to pursue, at least this way, one would be less likely to be running in circles.</div>

Kind of funny to write you a post when you are sitting right in front of me hehehehe.<br><br>If you people have been following LittleMan's post you'll know of a person who he mentioned a few times. The person who took 7 years to discover that he is really in love with a girl (same for the girl) and that person is ME !!!!! Well, but you may not know that LittleMan also has a 7-years relationship, hahahaha, a really faithful guy you know !<br><br>iamabird :<br><br>sorry to disappoint you, but i will definitely not go into war with LittleMan, he is too powerful, i am completely thrashed by him in the "Fees Hike" thread.
