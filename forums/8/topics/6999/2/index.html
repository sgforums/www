Maybe I took what you said in the wrong way.<br><br>I have been saying that there have been some areas in which I am not happy about, and I tried to explian why I think so. It is pretty evident that you hold different priorities in life, because you have admitted that you are contented with what you have. Why should I try to persuade you that there are things to complain about?<br><br>Earlier you said that when your friends complain about certain things, on deeper discussion you will discover that it is usually about superficial things. Perhaps you could give some examples of the things that they complain about, and lets see if some discussion can arise from that?<br><br>I'm a bit confused on why you don't think people slog day in and day out. Thats what I hear people do in the working world. Like I said, I have never worked seriously before, so if you know what I don't, which sounds likely, do share.</div>

Belittled, its unfortunate that you don't think that there can be subjective views on this matter. Maybe I took what you said in the wrong way.<br></div></blockquote>it is not that i don't see the issue as an subjective one. My point is, ultimately, ALL issues are subjective. And when you have come down to this "last defence line" there is nothing I can talk about anymore. For example, if you argue about the pro and cons of Speaker's Corner in the parliament, if a Minister says "Well, it is a subjective issue, some people like to have the Speaker's Corner, some don't and some don't care" Can anybody say that he is wrong to state such a statement ? No ! He is right ! But he is not contributing to the discussion at all ! He is just stating the obvious.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Why should I try to persuade you that there are things to complain about?<br></strong></blockquote>it is not about persuasion here. You will not end up changing my believes and vice versa at the end of the day.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Earlier you said that when your friends complain about certain things, on deeper discussion you will discover that it is usually about superficial things.<br></strong></blockquote>i never mention that they are "superficial" things. I said they are "childish and unrealistic desires". Let me give you an example :<br><br>I have a junior. He scored badly for his O'Levels, went to poly. After 2nd year, he was kicked out of poly. So he went to SIM to do a business course. His attitude is very bad. He is the kind who does not work hard. We will complain about the nearing exams but yet still go out and play. He will complain about how difficult the exams is but yet fail to spend more time studying it. I have not come to the "childish and unrealistic desires" part, here it is :<br><br>he once told me he would like to complete his SIM course in another 2 years' time, get an executive job in Shenton Way and drive a red BMW.<br><br>Now, is he being realistic ? From his qualification, he may even have difficulty finding his first job. I am not saying that it is impossible for him to achieve what he wanted in his life. But I am very sure that he will not get what he wants at his first job ! And no, he is not joking when he told me that. He is the type who is given a hen and expect the hen to lay eggs even without feeding it.<br><br>Another example is during the economic crisis in 1997/8. The graduates at that time still expect the same amount of salary that one would draw before the crisis. This issue is well-known nation wide, i believe you are informed about that too.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I'm a bit confused on why you don't think people slog day in and day out. Thats what I hear people do in the working world.<br></strong></blockquote>well, singaporeans are well known to reject difficult jobs. For example :<br><br>Who are doing the construction work in Singapore ? Who lay the roads ?<br><br>Everyone wants to work in air-con condition nowadays. Slog ? I don't think so. I once work in China, over there, i really see how the Chinese <strong>slog</strong>. And it is strange, the real people who are slogging do not complaint about it. The ones who complain are those who are not slogging!<br><br>You hear the working class complain ? Well well well, once you step into the working world you'll discover that the people who do less complain more. They just want to sound busy (aka doing lots of work) by complaining. The same happens in the army. The people who lobo more complain more.<br><br>Hope my examples help.<br><br>------------------<br>"Life is about making choices.

            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporeans nowadays are growing soft,not all,but some anyway.They now are not willing to do work belittling their status like construction worker etc etc or that they have to slog in the hot sun all the time,they are brought up in comfortable environments and never really experience hardship before,i bet our forefathers have no qualms about doing the work that most singaporeans shun nowadays because it is unglamorous,tiring,dun have air con etc and dirty etc etc,these people should be sent to 1 far away ulu country for about 6 months to experience living with the poor and doing some hard honest's day work,then they will appreciate how truly lucky they are and quit griping,but of cos some people just complain and complain just to let off steam which is only human,me included,heheeh.Only when we have seen those who are less fortunate than us wil we appreciate what we have now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there's a difference between being contented and blindly accepting things in life as being undeniable facts. singaporeans may be kiasu, and we may set what some will term "unrealistic" goals and aims, but isn't that what got sg so far? our ancestors that came over to start a new life were not simply satisfied when they had a slightly better standard of living than what they "suffered" back home, but instead decided to strive further and test their limits. if they did not have that spirit of "shang jin xin", sg would definitely have not gone as far as it is today.<br><br>being contented and ambitious isn't mutually exclusive. one can be happy with what he enjoys now, and yet, still continue striving to go that extra mile, to go that step further, for his own reasons. and therein lies the difference.<br><br>there are those who will complain non-stop, expecting life to be perfect, and all things to be handed to them on a silver platter. these are the truly greedy ones... or rather, lazy. all they know how to do is pick and criticise, expecting others to do the dirty work for them. they think the world owes them. majorly. these people will never be contented, because in order of be contented, you first have to realise what you want. such people equate happiness with material gains, or status symbols. if i get a degree, i'll be happy. if i get a high-paying job, i'll be happy. if i fall in love, i'll be happy. if i have a sports car and a condo, i'll be happy. if i have a kid, i'll be happy. but regardless of how many of such "aims" he achieves, he'll never truly be happy. because he cannot appreciate his "wealth". he doesnt even know the meaning of happiness.<br><br>such a person is the total opp of someone who is motivated. if one is ambitious, and likes to test his limits, you cannot condemn him as being greedy and not knowing the true meaning of contentment. he is happy, and does realise the value of his life now, but would like to go that bit further, to achieve a little more. it's that extra for him. you cannot blame others for wanting more than you do. most of us would like to enjoy a little material stuff for awhile. we want to sit in a good car, watch a decent movie, have a delicious meal. most of us, at one pt of time or another, would like to live the good life for awhile. however, unfortunately, in order to do so in sg, you have to work. it doesn't mean that all office workers are mindless participants of the whole rat race... how can you be sure of the motivation behind their hard work? different people have different standards and achievements for themselves, what matters is not the dream, but the action. what they do (or dont do) to fulfill that dream is the discriminating factor.<br><br>sgreans have to learn to appreciate what they have, and not simply demand for more because it's the social "norm". contentment shouldnt be at the expense of ambition.</div>

But when one is going for greater heights, it does not mean that he is not contented with what he has now. Like the contented person in my hen example, he is happy with what he has and try to make full use of it to achieve something better. While the greedy person is not happy with what he has and ask for more.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Greed or complacency play no part in the argument here..<br></strong></blockquote>i think it plays a crucial role here because many are not able to differentiate them from "contented-but-yet-striving-to-excel".<br><br><blockquote>Greed is the obsession of <strong>discontention</strong> and complacency is the folly of a <strong>contented</strong> person.<br></blockquote>well said ! and from this sentence, you can see that "greed" and "complacency" have everything to do with the argument here !<br><br>Good night to you too !<br><br>xue : you share my thoughts<br><br>------------------<br>"Life is about making choices.

To a secondary student, he would be contented to get a basic degree, to a young man who just started working, he would be contented to be a manager. These thoughts are all at the point in time when they have yet to achieve what they hope to attain. But once they achieve what they wish to have, are they happy to stay there forever?? I doubt so.<br><br>If you dream to earn $3k a month when you were in secondary sch and now you are earning that figure, do you think you want to stay there forever? I believe you want more, coz people matured and situation change. Especially when you settle down and set up your own family, you would expect more and it's also a source of motivation for yourself.<br><br>In this sense, one might not be contented with life forever. BUT what one should strive is to be happy with what he have at present, and strive to enhance one's life as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Tommy:</div><div class="quote_body">You bought a flat fully renovated..with a price tag included in the valuation of the house..and you start to hack it all down..incurring extra costs to it..all for what? Is that person contented?<br>Obviously not. He may even want to buy new furnitures and electrical appliances..and others...if he can afford it. If he can't..he will have to wait out..and make do with those available..but he is not<br>contented.<br></div></blockquote>i don't know how much do you understand about the Real Estate market in Singapore. It is extremely cyclical and its cycle is linked to the stock market. It follows the pattern of the stock market but exhibit a 1 year lag (usually). As a result, the real estate market can be a great investment if you have the money since its ups and downs is already "forecasted" by the stock market. This explains why there are people who keep changing houses.<br><br>As for the re-renovation thing, it has nothing to do with contentment ! You buy a good for a price you are willing to pay. But the good may not be the perfect good you have in mind, but it is the BEST you can find. As a result, you can make it more perfect by modifying it yourself at a cost you can afford. Your example is just the same as buying a second hand car and then re-paint it with your favourite color. It is about making-full-use-of-what-you-alreadi--have, and is represented by the contented person in my hen example. He accepted the hen and created something more out of it.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Like your story about the hens...the lesson we learnt from it is..we can't be contented..or complacency will slip in.<br></strong></blockquote>looks like my hen example have not helped you in differentiating between a complacent person and a contented one. Perhaps you would like to read again.<br><br>Well, i think we have come to a point of stagnation in this discussion now, I will like to stop here. We shall leave to the rest of the forumites to decide whose argument is more acceptable.<br><br>It has been a long time since i last had such a nice discussion, thanks guys !<br><br>------------------<br>"Life is about making choices.

I understand what you are trying to say, but I think content is the wrong word to use in this case.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Belittled...it was nice having a go at the topic..even though my english is not good enough. I also enjoy the debate and discussion..but still in dark about the conclusion. So far..you have not come out with concrete examples of Singaporeans who are contented with their present status...and you are resting the case.<br><br>What you provides are the comparison of Singaporean good lives with those you have came acrossed from your visit overseas. I travelled alot too. I seen the people of Thailand and Indonesia. Their standard of living are way below us. Yes..sometimes.. I did tell myself..I am very fortunate to be living in Singapore...but, that doesn't mean that I must sit on my laurel. I can't be contented with what I have..or I will slowly and surely fall back to where I started.<br><br>About the example of the HDB resale transaction..you have misunderstood my point. I'm not talking about the Real Estate as a whole. I'm talking about those who sold their first flat and bought another from the resale market...that was why I specified that I'm not referring to those new housing estate. There are some who are flushed with money after the sale..but they are not re-renovating. That was because the money was put to some other uses like children studies...or the stock market..hopping to generates more out of it. So you see..Belittled..the verdict from my argument is still that..we are never contented.<br><br>Pacman..I am self-employed. My examples are all quoted from the interaction of people I rubbed shoulders with ..and they encompassed the whole strata of the society..from the yuppies to the general workers. I hope that will put your curiosity to rest too...hahaha.<br><br>People..have a good day!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Tommy (edited 21 April 2000).]</div>

However, please bear in mind that examples are examples, they will not lead us to conclusions, they will only serve to help us in understanding a situation. After so many years of education haven't you notice that ? When teachers are teaching half way through they'll always say,"for example ...." but the main idea does not lies in the examples. That's why i did not push pacman for examples when he did not wish to give because i understand that examples are secondary. The examples i choose are the mp3 and the hen one, cos they help in explaining my stand, and hopefully, helping you to understand my stand.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I travelled alot too.<br></strong></blockquote>travel and "living" and "working" in a country is totally different. I hope you dun only "travel".<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>renovating.

            <div class='col-md body'>Belittled:<br><br>Hm... I never did think that any of the examples or accounts that you gave are talk only. I was just curious as to how all you guys came about with those views. As you can see, the views on working life would be different had I been posted overseas as some director as compared to someone of a lower rank.<br><br>I also think that there might not be a conclusion. But the main reason why I like to see and hear other peoples' views on these matters because from those views I reevaluate my own and hopefully, change them for the better.<br><br>Tommy:<br><br>Thats absolutely fine with me... after all, we are also talking about people here. Personal experiences are also good things to bring into the discussion. We are afterall, talking about our own lives as well. Which is why I'll have to disagree that we should not bring in personal accounts into the discussion. Of course surveys and studies are the best sort of evidence we can use to prove our points, but with this "personal contentment (not sure if there is such a word) " issue, I think it would be something really hard to measure.<br><br>So, in summary, my points are:<br><br>1) The rankings and achievements that you have quoted which, again, I do not refute, are something we should be proud of. But, they do not translate to personal happiness or contentment, because the cost of achieving these goals, are very high in my view.<br><br>2) Different people have different priorities and desires in life.<br><br>3) Being content is not the same as being thankful for what you have. The latter suggests that you can strive for improvement, the former, in my view, doesn't.<br><br>4) (I never said so before but this is what I learnt after reading the posts) We should all be thankful for what we have, be realistic of what we want, and work hard to achieve those realistic goals. Oh yah, and think before you complain.</div>
