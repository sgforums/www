            <div class='col-md body'>When you look at someone, what sort of thoughts run thru your mind? Sometimes, I would relate them to what they do and such. When I see those old coffee ladies bringing coffee around the building or a maintenance worker going around, I start to think about myself. I wonder how each person destiny is mapped. How come some people are grateful if they are get pass each day with food to eat, or have a job to do regardless of the nature of the job.<br><br>Yet there are also others who can afford many things in life and still ain't contented. If you are in the person shoe, how would you feel say if you are a coffee lady earning about $30 a day, or a construction worker doing your job under the hot sun.<br><br>There are lots of us in this forum who can afford a good life, study overseas or earning good money. Yet, from what I see from postings so far, some of us are not happy with our life.. mostly coz of relationships and such. We are really a brunch of lucky people if you compare yourself to others you see. If you are not happy with what you have, what about them?<br><br>Sometimes I too am guilty of such thoughts but at most times, I feel that I am really blessed, even though I am not born with a silver spoon, I had a good and normal childhood, with a alright education, having a good job and having friends around. I might have problems in relationship in the past, but glad things are going fine now. Comparing myself to others, I am really blessed. I hope I can give something back to whoever had made me what I am.. the society and the people around me.<br><br>How do you pple feel about life? Be contented in life and you will be happy more often.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, many singaporeans are not contented with their lives. And u can tell by reading the posts in this forum, especially those in "Speaker's Corner".<br><br>There are so many complains and i personally find it extremely irritating.<br><br>There are also many criticisms about our government. I really think it is extremely shameful and silly of us to vote for our government and then criticise them like dirt.<br><br>How much do you know about Singapore ? Let's see :<br><br>a. Do you know Singapore is one of the countries in the World with the lowest crime rate ? (You live in peace and harmony)<br><br>b. Do you know Singapore's economy is the 2nd most competitive in the World (after US) for 6 years in a row ? (You have great jobs)<br><br>c. Do you know Singapore is ranked the 4th in Information Technology in the World ? (talking about internet)<br><br>d. Do you know Singapore is a "Strike Free" Nation ? (we live in harmony)<br><br>e. Do you know Singapore's Army is the most effective in SE Asia ? (You have an effective force to protect you)<br><br>f. Do you know Singapore's GDP per Head is one of the highest in the World ? (our GDP per head is USD$21,000, the GDP per Head for Group 7 are :<br><br>Japan : US$ 31,451<br>Canada : US$ 25,000<br>America : US$ 25,850<br>France : US$ 22,700<br>Italy : US$ 21,500<br>Germany : US$ 20,800<br>Britian : US$ 18,138<br><br>G7 is the 7 strongest economies of the World)<br><br>g. Do you know Singapore's economic environment is always among the top 10 ranked by Perc (based in Hong Kong)?<br><br>h. Do you know Singapore's government is one of the cleanest in the World ? (corruption free)<br><br>i. Do you know Singapore's policies and legal systems are one of the most transparent in the World ?<br><br>j. Do you know Singapore is one of the cleanest city in the World ? (you live in a healthy environment)<br><br>k. Do you know Singapore is a food paradise ?<br><br>l. Do you know Singapore does not have natural calamities ?<br><br>There are many many more .... the list goes on. So do you really think that a small island like Singapore made a name for herself by banning chewing gum and caning Michael Fay ?<br><br>But of course, there is no free lunch in this world. So we have to pay the price by engaging in the rat race. But stress and pressure can be managed.<br><br>The contentment of a person depends very much on his expectations, let me give you a few examples :<br><br>I have a fren who cried for few days cos she had achieved 8 points for her O'levels (she expected 6 points). I have a student who rejoiced because she achieved 16 points.<br><br>I have a fren who felt like a failure cos he did not achieve an overseas scholarship to study in Cambridge University and ended up in a local tertiary institution which he termed as a "dumping ground". I have another fren who had to spend tens of thousands of dollars to study overseas because he could not make it to NUS.<br><br>I have seen how workers in Shanghai worked until they faint in the factory during summer (38 degrees). And when she regained conciousness, she carried on working cos she needs the salary. (her wage depends on how many items she can assemble) How many times have you heard your frens complaining about their jobs ?<br><br>There are many many more examples but i think these are enuff and i believe you get the message.<br><br>However, being contented is different from being complacent. We still have to work hard to maintain our standard or better still, improve it.<br><br>To those who lives in complaints, good luck to you. Ultimately, you are the one who is suffering. And you remain stuck in the mud while we move on.<br><br>Don't create problems, create solutions.<br><br>------------------<br>"Life is about making choices.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Belittled:<br><br>I do understand what you say about Singapore being the best or close to best in some aspects. I also agree that some people are complaining about that. What I'm saying though, is that being best in those areas do not neccessarily make for pleasant living, or maybe just pleasant living for me. Sure, these are areas that we as Singaporeans can be proud of, but the reason why some people complain is because the COST of achieving such VERY commendable results.<br><br>Yes, our country is small and we need to be competitive etc. No arguements there. Thats exactly what I'm also referring to. The competitiveness is not for everyone.<br><br>Singapore IS a shopping paradise compared to many countries. You are right partially. Like you yourself have said, there are many things which are more expensive compared to other countries. If you are asking if I know that cars and houses are expensive because of the size of our country, again, I'm not disputing that. I'm saying that some people would like to be able to enjoy large houses and lots of space and drive nice cars without having to pay through their nose. That is definitely not an unreasonable desire. And cars and houses are just examples. There are other stuff, e.g. fruits, clothes. It might sound materialistic, but our lives cannot be separated from these material needs. Well, let me put it this way: Generally, Singapore is a cheap place to live. Since I don't use much of the general things that are cheap in Singapore, I am wishing for a lowering in prices of the things that are specifically expensive in Singapore.<br><br>I'll also have to disagree about anyone being able to live a quiet little life because its a free country. Actually, I'm not sure. I haven't worked seriously before. I don't think so. Feel free to enlighten me if I'm wrong. Please. But, if the cost of living a life that I want is so high i.e. I want to enjoy myself with a bit of material enjoyment once in a while, then there is no way I will be able to live my little life. I'll have to slog day and night because its just the environment around us.<br><br>Going along with your analogy of MP3s, I would like to clarify. Those people who download new ones without listening to the ones they already have, are like people who look for the new things without being aware that they already have something good. However, the people I was referring to are those who have listened to what they have, and decided that the Top 10 pop songs mp3 that they have are not to their taste, and they would rather listen to some Jazz instead. Its a matter of different tastes and desires rather than not appreciating what they had in the first place.<br><br>Well, before I go too far away from the topic posted by Luf on whether we are contented with life, I would just like to say that I am thankful for lots of things. On the other hand, there are other things with I am not contented with, but this by no means take away from my gratefulness of what I already have. I think they are 2 separate categories.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 19 April 2000).]</div>

I am the best example ! I lead a simple and quiet life. Am i engaged in any form of competition ? No i don't. I know what i need and what i want in life. I see them as goals which i want to achieve.

For example, the Hello Kitty incident.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>But, if the cost of living a life that I want is so high i.e. I want to enjoy myself with a bit of material enjoyment once in a while, then there is no way I will be able to live my little life.

If you want some material enjoyment, you will have to work for it, it is the same everywhere. When kind of enjoyment are you talking about which will require you to <strong>slog</strong> day and night may i ask ?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>and decided that the Top 10 pop songs mp3 that they have are not to their taste, and they would rather listen to some Jazz instead.<br></strong></blockquote>yes, you are right. But there are many people i see who have switched from pop to jazz, and after some time, complain about jazz and switch to rock. And after some time, they complain about rock and switch back to pop.

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, I hope I dun offend anyone... I can understand why most of you feel so much about this topic, but why write so much?<br><br>I think some of you are confused about contentment in life and motivation in life. Personally, I feel there's a great difference between those two words. When one is contented about his/her life, it doesn't mean that the person is no longer motivated to achieve better things (tangible and intangible).<br><br>Just think about it, why do monks, nuns, pastors, sisters, etc... continue to pour over scriptures, bibles, etc...? To normal people, they seem to have achieved the stage of being contented with life, but why do they still continue doing what they are doing? When you think through this, I hope you can get the point that they are motivated to seek enlightment, yet they are contented with life.<br><br>Again, personally, I feel that contentment in life shouldn't be measured by how much complaint one has. Some people just have to complain about things, so as to get that 'thing' out of their mind.<br><br>And usually, you won't be able to spot a person who's contented with life... they dun complain much...<br><br>As for me, I'm quite contented with my life already. There may be difficultied ahead in my long life, but I dun think much about it. For me, I gain happiness from little things in life. I do have high expectations...but little things like: my windchime blowing, stars in the sky, etc... bring smiles to my heart, and makes me feel thankful for all that I have :&gt;</div>

I was having my A'Levels then.<br><br>I was very depressed at that time because I just broke up with my loved one. I started to complain about life, about A'levels, about everything. Until one day when i was on my way home, i saw a rainbow about 1 metre above the ground (YES ! ONE METRE !)<br><br>I thought how nice it would be if i could "enter" the rainbow. It must be very beautiful inside ... i expected to see lots of colours .... so i stepped in ...<br><br>However, the rainbow suddenly disappeared when i "stepped into it". Disappointedly, i walked away. After a few steps, i looked back .... and the rainbow was still there ! I tried a few more times but had seen no "colorful lights" around me.<br><br>I learnt a lesson :<br><br>you won't know that you are in a rainbow when you are in one but you can see those rainbows which you do not belong to.<br><br>in short, we always envy others and think that they are better off than ourselves. In fact, the rainbow we are in may be much more beautiful than theirs.<br><br>I studied very hard for my A'Levels and achieved excellent results.<br><br>------------------<br>"Life is about making choices.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes things happen for a valid reason and you just have to step back and look at it.Given singapore limited land mass,if big houses are very cheap and a lot of people owns 1,you will have a situation where there is a misuse of space,why land prices are so expensive in singapore is simply because of our limited land area,it's the simple law of supply and demand,if supply is not enuff to meet demand,prices will rise.As for cars,if you don't want to pay thru the nose just to own a car,i bet a lot of people will like that also,but if cars are made affordable to everyone in singapore,do you wish to have singapore become another Bangkok where the air is so bad and the traffic is horrendous because there are too many cars there,on hindsight,i have no disputes with any of the government policies so far(except the chewing gum ban) as i realise that i dun mind sacrificing a bit by not getting a car as i know that i will be helping Singapore to remain as it is now without have all the problems of developed countries like pollution etc etc  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We humans are by nature not contented with what we have now..if not..how are we going to improved. If you say you are..you are just kidding yourself. Let me quote you some examples:<br><br>Employment. Why do the peoples (usually the young) likes to change jobs so frequently. The reasons are obvious. Not contented with the salary..the job advancement opportunity..the attitudes of the co-workers or employer..etc. Likewise for those who goes the 'start-up' way.<br><br>Cars: Most Singaporeans yearned to own one someday. That is a fact..even though we have a first class transport system. For those who owned one..will like to change to a newer.. bigger cc and more luxurious one too..if they can afford it.<br><br>Housing: Upgrading. The word from our Govt's mouth. Why? Better and more comfortable way of living. If we can..from rented to owning a landed property.<br><br>Last..but not least...Computer. We have come a long way from DOS to Windows. From storing informations to net-working. From simple telephone line dail-up to cable(broadband). You tell me..are we still contented with it? *wink*<br><br>A quote from Desiderata by Max Ehrmann:<br><br>"If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter, for there will always be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans."<br><br>What we have now is a blessing..be it good or bad.The future is for us to map out..for we are never contented.<br><br></div>
