            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sorry to hear that you were used by a chinese gal, but at this point, I just like to question your aim in meeting chinese gals. Is it just an asian fetish that you are having? Or are u serious in marrying a local female?<br><br>I have no doubt that there are decent enuff caucasian aka ang moh men around (despite the bad press and slurs going around)<br><br>Primarily, if you are working here in Singapore then there really should be no need to go to any special place to meet any of the local females. Your basic contact in work should put you in favourable position to meet many local girls.<br><br>But however if you are looking to pick up gals for a one night stand......thats a whole new question all together.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm only interested in a long-term relationship. I've had countless discussions with so many ppl, as to why Singaporean Chinese.

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyah, if I'm not wrong, the best wives are from JAPAN, they're the MOST open minded, the MOST housewive oriented, smart and hardworking too, and with thier totaly out of this world culture, you'll never run out of things to talk about all your life... ALTHO!! living in japan does mean u'd better have shitloads of money, as living expenses there totally suck, like, DaBomb...and also, the way they spend (X_x)... nothing is perfect  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway back to the topic....I thought being ang moh in singapore would already be a large drawing factor for most singaporean women. Even for that I think there is no shortage of SPGs (Sarong Party Girls) around. Maybe you could hang out where almost all ang moh expats hang out - Holland Village?<br><br>Or maybe would Boat Quay be a better place to try ur luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After having read the book "No Money, No Honey", I think I may attract the wrong type of girl (at very worst a prostitute and at best an SPG). What about a fun girl that can remain faithful to one guy, etc.......I think I'm far too idealistic. By the way, Japanese women may speak the language of love, but what about English?????</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately PerfectGent, being an ang moh here will ultimately attract the wrong type to you for most of the wrong reasons.  If you're Going into town to try and find women, then ur just "cruisin' for a bruisin'..." as an old friend liked to say.<br><br>Very hard to find.  Ur best bet is to station urself here on a semi-permanent or permanent basis...join some kind of extra-curricular grouping....take a course up  or something which will put u into contact with the real women of Singapore...People who aren't out for just fun with a good looking, big cock ang moh guy...:-)  wasn't a slander, just joking there:-)<br><br>But really, a lot of local women find people with foreign accents very enticing and exotic..even if they won't admit...and a lot of them are curious...who'se to say that from the women u get to meet, u won't find one that likes u ultimately for ur personality/character.<br><br>Ok, that's all I have to say about that.  I think tho, that not being here on a stable basis would likely put many serious women off...unless they're the types looking for expat fun....:-)<br><br>Good hunting<br></div>
