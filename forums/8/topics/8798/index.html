That depend on what post you goes into.<br>If pilot.....no need to say. Go for it.<br>If Tech (my cousin)...... no problem in taking up evening class as airforce does not require to stay in except for night ops.<br>If Aircrew (me)...... also no problem except for duties and night flyingd which require you to go home late.<br>As for pay, should not be that bad. 2 years back my starting pay as a Diploma student is $1700 excluding allowance.<br>Give it a thought.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the pay might be high but if u wanna join the air-force u shoud go for a pilot cos i think all the other vocation does not pay as much or is as challenging or unless u are really intrested in planes n avaition then u would like to be a technics then i think u should go ahead n besides there is olso other vocation in there like acss and aoss but migbht not really be as exciting(heck i onli noe this feel things bout rsaf thats all)think 1st do u wan a boring career doing something the same everyday or do something thats different thats ur call hehe</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you wanna join the RSAF,it's best to join as a pilot as you will be assured of a good pay and good prospects unless you do something really bad.As for technicians,you most probably will be required to do shifts which may affect your part time studies.Overall the pay is quite attractive after the pay rise.But now the contract is 10 years,not 6 years,so think carefully as once you put the pen to the paper,there is no way to back out,heehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Makan begins with a drool, grows with a chomp, ends with a burp.When you were born, you were hungry and everyone around you was full.

            <div class='col-md body'>basically wat i dream of would of coz be a pilot's job, otherwise i dun mind being flying a chopper<br><br>FYI, there is now a 12 yr bond.<br>And i have heard from an ex-RSAF that not all are allowed to take leave for degree or to be released from the force to go SIA.<br><br><strong>So i am afraid i may land in a trap where i have to serve a 12 yr bond and may come out with only an A-cert looking for a job, not to mention the A-cert level pay i will be getting thruout the 12 yrs</strong><br><br>And even worse i heard from that retiree that it is hard to resign from RSAF as they will reject your resignation and try to hold u back and even if u do, they'll write a stinky report to your future employer.<br>&amp; that they release some pilots to SIA juz for "show"?<br><br>Anyone noe what some RSAF retirees are doing for a living now?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the RSAF family isn't all that small. Not only do they include the likes of the pilots, technicians and aircrew, u cant forget the air defence guys and the air ops guys, in short, the C3 gang, hehehe..... For an A-Level, you might consider going for one of the study awards (maybe the ATA local or overseas??), or maybe u might choose to work for a while and go on a no pay leave to study (this is a tougher option), or study while u work (the toughest option).<br><br>Anyway, in terms of prospects, after the pilots (which seriously the selection process is ridiculously tough), the next best vocations would be that of the ADA and Air Ops already. Especially ADA, whereby you can further fulfil the dreams of being a pilot, how..... dunno whether it is classified or not.......<br><br>Many talk about red tape, beaurocracy, politiks and stuff, although I agree they are present in RSAF, but u find them everywhere, but only especially so in RSAF, so, well, your choice. This time, u r signing with the government, so u cant really wriggle around much. The maximum period of time I remember they can hold u back is, I forgot, 6 months to a year, whichever is the case. Anyway, you can also sign for the Saver's Scheme (at least that is what I remember)..... but remember, if u wanna join the force, join as an officer, the prospects are better that way.<br><br>Just remember Bangster that your signature will carry you through the best yrs of your life. And you are a JC student too. If you were from poly, the incentive will be higher since u need some work experience before going to the Uni and going to the forces would be a good tradeoff for NS. But a JC student, that would be a little tricky. Would rather you go on to get your degree first. No such thing as "unconditional".<br><br>Oh yah, if you wanna hear any "shit" about RSAF, feel free to ding-a-ling my name, hahaha.....<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>
