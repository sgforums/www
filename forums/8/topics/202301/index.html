After about 20 minutes, he suddenly noticed that at least 1,000 black ants, led by an ant general, were approaching a red ant fortress 30 metres away.<br><br>When they were about 6 metres away from the red ant colony, about 400 red ants, also under the leadership of a general, climbed out as if in response to an alarm. They waited for several minutes as the black ants advanced towards them. Then the battle began.<br><br>Though the black ants were slightly smaller than their opponents, they had the advantage of numbers. Two or three black ants would surround an enemy ant and bite it to death.<br><br>The two groups fought each other for about 90 minutes. In the battle, the red leader was slain and most of the red ant troops were slaughtered.<br><br>Police said the aim of the black ants had been to steal eggs from the red ant colony.<br><br>Black ants can often be seen creeping into a red ant nest to carry off eggs, but it is very unusual to see ants fighting a major battle.<br><br>(Star News)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hapless ants, like mortals caught in a crossfire between competing gods, are exploited in turn by two other insectsÂ—a butterfly and a wasp. When the wasp attacks the larval butterfly, it drives the ants to attack each other, turning them into incidental casualties.<br><br>The ants, researchers have discovered, are manipulated by chemicals produced by both sides in the struggle.<br><br>The highly sophisticated chemical warfare that has evolved between the Ichneumon eumerus wasp and Maculinea rebeli butterfly in western Europe has resulted in Myrmica schencki ants being used as pawns.<br><br>The ants are duped by chemicals into accepting, nurturing, and protecting the butterfly caterpillar as one of their own. But when the wasp detects a caterpillar hiding inside an ant colony, it uses its own clever chemical trickery to sow confusion in the ranks of the ants, allowing it to gain access to the caterpillar.<br><br>The intruding wasp, by secreting a cocktail of compounds called pheromones, throws the ants into such a frenzy that they attack and even kill one another. In the chaos, the wasp slips unnoticed through the ant nest and preys on the unguarded caterpillar.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ISHIKARI, Japan (AP) - A man in a tweed blazer and a white sun hat walks<br>slowly through a patch of sea grass on the coast of northern Japan, searching.<br><br>A truck rumbles down the highway toward a cluster of cranes in the distance,<br>but he doesn't look up. He bends down when he finds what he was looking for,<br>a small hole in a pile of sand - the entryway to the largest colony of ants<br>ever found on earth.<br><br>For Prof. Seigo Higashi, this is not just an anthill, it's a life's work. For<br>28 years, he has studied, counted and even lived among the hundreds of<br>millions of Japanese red wood ants that dwell on this strip of shoreline.<br><br>Higashi has observed every facet of their lifecycle, from their eating habits<br>to their mating rituals. Now 50, he began studying the ant colony as a<br>graduate student in his early 20s. Today, he is watching their ancient empire<br>die.<br><br>``There used to be a whole lot of these,'' he said, kneeling to pick up one<br>of the orange-brown bugs between his thumb and forefinger. ``Now, so many<br>have disappeared.''<br><br>In the early 1970s, Higashi was part of a Hokkaido University team that made<br>a startling discovery.<br><br>Studying ants on the coastal grasslands of Japan's northern island of<br>Hokkaido, they found a cluster of nests linked in a large network, a<br>supercolony.<br><br>At the time of its discovery, the Hokkaido colony included an estimated<br>45,000 nests and stretched nearly 12.4 miles along the shore of the Japan Sea.<br><br>The complex housed an estimated 307 million Japanese red wood ants, including<br>some 306 million workers and about 1.1 million queens.<br><br>The scale was - and still is - unprecedented.<br><br>``As a species, this ant isn't rare or particularly unusual,'' said Higashi,<br>who took the first headcount here in 1971. ``As a supercolony, though, it's<br>really something.''<br><br>There are only two known ant supercolonies in the world. The other, smaller<br>one is in the Swiss Jura mountains.<br><br>A typical ant colony is comprised mostly of one or more egg-laying queens and<br>infertile females, or workers, who tend the young, expand the nest and defend<br>the colony. For a short period once a year, the colony produces males and<br>fertile females. These ants leave the nest in a ``nuptial flight'' to mate<br>and start new colonies.<br><br>Generally, individuals from different nests will fight each other to the<br>death, even if they're the same kind of ant.<br><br>But for reasons scientists don't fully understand, the ants here and in<br>Switzerland - both of the Formica genus - have been able to build<br>supercolonies connected by trails or tunnels through which workers can travel<br>freely.<br><br>The Hokkaido supercolony is populated by a relatively common species, the<br>Japanese red wood ant. It can be found in Japan, Siberia, China, Taiwan and<br>the Korean Peninsula.<br><br>But only in Hokkaido is it known to have constructed a supercolony.<br><br>Higashi said he thinks the colony could have been started as long as 1,000<br>years ago near the mouth of the Ishikari River, about nine miles north of<br>Sapporo, Hokkaido's largest city.</div>
