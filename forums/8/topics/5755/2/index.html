            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I suppose not many people here know who I am. Relatively quite new to this forum, if you look at the no. of posts I made so far. Yeah... like most of the others, I don't want to say my real name, afraid of revealing my real identity.<br><br>Anyway, I'm 18 and female. Very soon turning 19. I was from XXX Junior College and now awaiting for my A level results. Was doing very much of bumming around. Not for long, found a job.<br><br>Hmmm, this is supposed to be an introduction of myself. But what do I say? I'm someone who most people would misunderstand. I still have not found the reason yet. I'm glad though, I have a bunch of friends I can rely on.<br><br>As for music and movies, sometimes I think the older they are, the better they are. Hard to imagine that an 18-year-old would listen to oldies and like shows like "singing in the Rain", "Gone with the Wind", etc ... so it's kinda hard for me to find people who have the same interest as me in that aspect. Hey, but I'm not like a piece of antique... I still am able to appreciate modern movies and songs by Pulp or The Cranberries.<br><br>What else is there to say about me...? I do like reading and have yet to master how to rollerblade... long since I bought the pair of blades (that are actually too big for me, a mistake on my part). I like to swim and suntan a lot.<br><br>My ambition is, .... well, haha, maybe I should get one. An ambition is like something that most people must have. Yet, I don't have one. I guess I haven't found my direction in life. If I don't get one of those impulses like... to want to be an artist, prison warden, police officer... or even to join the ARMY (seriously, I think there isn't much of a career in the ARMY for a female), then I'll most probably do something that is more sensible and practical. That is, to be an engineer.<br><br>Okay, I think I've said more than I wanted. So will end off here.</div>
