            <div class='col-md body'>Currently pursuing a degree right the middle of Manchester. HAPPILY not a Man Utd fan. First to be raise my hands in victory when their opponents score a goal, but alas most of the time the hands will eventually come down. (They're good, I admit).  More of a Liverpool supporter.<br><br>Just a simple quiet guy. Into outdoor activities: hiking, cycling, climbing, anything in the big nature. Likes reading up on future technologies, general knowledge stuff. Into music and movies. Still prefer music in the 70's and 80's but not retro music, more of Bread, Air Supply, Carpenters, Anne Murray, Oleta Adams, etc. Ya nice and slow. Avid movie fan, but not being able to keep up with the movies now since the flow of movies here is simply moving like a snail.<br><br>So that's me in a nutshell.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by iamsilly (edited 28 January 2000).]</div>

Hopefully, I'll pull through and do either journalism in the States or comm studies at NTU. I'm a fan of most british music, and by no means am I referring to certain boybands which will remain unnamed. Pulp, Radiohead, the Verve, Suede, Depeche Mode and Strangelove are more my thing.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm 21, male, and currently studying at NUS School of Computing for the first year.<br><br>I love sports, especially soccer, basketball, and volleyball. Can play the guitar a bit also(classical, acoustic, electric). Listens to mostly music with guitar elements in them. Plays Unreal Tournament when free. Supports Alan Shearer ever since he was at Blackburn. Currently I don't have a life, and don't really think I could do anything about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Oh no prizes for guessing I'm single and I'm giving up on love already.<br><br>------------------<br>"And when my love for life is running dry, you come and pour yourself on me"--- David Gates</div>
