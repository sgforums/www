            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ppl,<br><br>Intro? Hmm... seems like a chatting session, but anyway, I am born in 1977, a scorpio just incase any of you gals out there needs to know.*Laffs* Currently with a uniform group also, left with 5 more months before I step out into the real world. A rather ambitious person by nature, I look forward to life and challenges. I believe in developing a person's potential  and moving forward in life. but 1 of the set back I recently discovered about this supposed strenght in character is that, I tend to move too fast in life to notice about the needs of others in my life. So been trying to slow down quite a bit.<br><br>I am a movie buff, love movies, it is one of my ways to past time when I have too much on my hands. I used to club, but have grew out of i., I still do go for a drink or 2 just to catch up with my buds,<br><br>Computing is also another area of interest for me, Not a wiz though, just interested in learn more things. I believe that life is short and will try anything for the experience. Dun have much things to try out though since I am in such a safe country like Singapore. *Snigger* Tried Rollerblading, but never made it, *laffs* only manged to blade for a few meters before my legs goes jelly. *LOL* HEHEHE not that bad lah, but I guess I am just not so much physically inclined. Hmmm... I do like Marital Arts though, was learning Hapkido a few years back, but stopped due to an injury. Well, I dun really have intention to pick it up again as I felt It is time I devote more of my time to developing my puny brain.<br><br>Had a rather bad experience in my last relationship, but grew from it, but I am not looking for any now, so gals BACK OFF! *laffs* just kidding, just not ready for any, I see where I go with this attitude, my friends tells me that I am going nowhere with this and that I should settle down and not hang around. But I guess it is still my life.<br><br>Well, I do have another problem, I am too lenghty for my own good, heheeh, so think I better change for the better and do you guys a favour by stopping here. Maybe I tell you all more next time if we ever meet up. Ciao.<br><br>My $0.02 worth.</div>
