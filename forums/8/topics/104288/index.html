            <div class='col-md body'>I got it from a friend so i post it here instead of forwarding to people.<br><br>-------------------------------------------<br><br>While waiting for my husband at Tangs side entrance facing Lucky Plaza,<br>suddenly a Chinese man approached me, disregarding my personal space,<br>stood so close to me that i need to back off.  Then he asked me where<br>was a place, which i didnt comprehend.<br><br>After repeating 2 times or so, he said the place was where they sell chicken rice, duck rice, making some innocent hand gestures like counting, so i thought he meant food court, told him that he could go down the flight of stairs next to Mac to basement.<br><br>He appeared lost and asked me again, then asked if it was on left hand side or right hand side.  I was little irritated as we were facing the stairs, such a big stairway and u are asking me right or left hand side?  Luckily my husband arrived and a taxi behind him sounded the horn as my hubby waited for me.<br><br>So i pointed again to the stairway and asked him to go down.<br><br>This morning suddenly awaken with uneasy feeling.  Realised that he<br>might be a hypnotiser.  As i remembered that he was loitering near me<br>for some time, but i just took it that he was another passerby at that<br>moment, he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">spoe in a deliberate and slower manner</span>, his hand<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> gestures </span> when mentioning chicken &amp; duck rice, his deliberate attempt in asking me if left or right.<br><br>These people try to get us to conjure up images in our mind, thats how<br>they hypnotise us.   Why i thought was a hypnotiser was because my KL friend shared with me 3 mths back that it happened very frequently in KL, her<br>friend was a victim when she woke up naked, not remembering what  happened.  She herself almost fallen prey.<br><br>Her story was that she was at busy shopping centre exit, saw a<br>flustered overseas chinese man speaking very loudly on HP, then the man<br>approached her for help, told her that his girlfriend from overseas came to look for him but was lost, so wanted to borrow money from  my friend, amount was quite a lot which my friend didnt have.  After talking for a while, he even managed to ask her to follow him.<br><br>Fortunately her HP rang, she said she suddenly became more aware of<br>what was happening, before that, she just wanted to follow him to help<br>him.  Immediately she told the man she didnt have money and left.<br><br>So beware of all foreign chinese man ( i really cant decifer his accent, definitely not sporean, very decently dressed, normal guy on the street, maybe late 30s, carrying a rather big shoulder sling bag).</div>
