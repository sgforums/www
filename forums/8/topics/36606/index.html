I'm not an MO. The level 1, 2 and 3 are for medics, not medical officers! Level 1 course is 3 months, 2 is two months, 3 is 2 months and level 4 in Canada is around 3-5 months I don't recall. Most people don't go to Level 4 unless they are damn good.</div>

MOs complete their tri-service term and then go for their medical studies. after they become certified docs, they go back to OCS to do a mocc lasting some 6 weeks. after that, they get a in-house commission to the rank of cpt.</div>
