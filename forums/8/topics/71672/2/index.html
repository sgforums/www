If he/she approach you as if he/she waits for someone to walk by - he/she is definitely a cheat. If you have problems, you mind will be wandering and you wouldn't be observing your surrounding so much. You ask whom you think can help, while conman ask those they think they can fool.<br><br>II) Story check. Real case who borrow money emphasise the desire to return you the money almost immediately after telling you their grandfather story. Fake case expect the money after the story. If they demand more money - confirm fake case. <strong>Beggars can't be choosers - if he is a chooser, he is not a beggar</strong>.<br><br>III) Body language check. This is the area I dunno how to explain. I look out of body language they display to discredit them. (Pai seh, usually only trained to look out for people interested/loving/liking/etc in all form of BGR-related sh!t when it comes to body language- not too much about exposing a cheat)<br><br>IV) Aftermath check. When you successfully lend the money, real case, are geniunely happy and you could almost see a sign of relieve. Fake cases show sign of greed. When leaving the scene, they wouldn't look back at all and wants to leave the area as soon as possible. Real case hang around there for a moment. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Learn to reject.<br><br>Cheers</div>
