May be we should include neglegence on HN parents part but is there a pwoerful lawyer with took's to point this out and mayb bring HN's parents to justices? What i ahve written here is already out of the records and even if took paid a good lawyer it would have been to lessen his own punishment or better can tok the court out of him not being guilty of murder!<br><br>In simple bedtime story, the queen can own the kingdom after the princess' death but to do so she has to throw her to the wolves while taking a stroll with her in the forest.<br><br>when the righteous knights arrived, they have to slaughter the wolves and overthrow the queen to preserve justice. but without proof of what is going on in the heart of the queen, it is very difficult to convict her while it is easier to punish the wolves since from their actions they are already worng.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by crazy monkey:</div><div class="quote_body">you give him chance then who give huang na chance ?</div></blockquote>to me.. the death gal cannot be brought back alive.  Why make another innocent child fatherless.  And yet again, there are too much doubts like why Took doesn't defence himself and resign to fate, when there are still good chances to do so.  Why did the Huang Na's parent leave her for good alone in SG ?  And to cried for etc.. when she gone missing and die.. Is it for some conspiracy or some planning ?<br><br>Ask any parents if they would left their child alone away from one native country ?  Asking whoever auntie or fren to look after ??<br><br>When this thread posted what is on my thoughts :<br>Anyone supporting the plead just do so..<br>Against it, just read and forget it..<br>But of coz expected, some will react in such a ... way...<br><br>Anyway i am self prepared for such etc...<br>But basically i find it, very meaningless to get work up on such cases.. haaa...<br><br>GEt a life.. that's life..<br>There will be ppl support and not supporting..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>Basically everyone has individual thinking, there is no right nor wrong in our thinking.. Same things as certain medicine/ thoughts might be another poison right.. I learn this from some forumies...</div>
