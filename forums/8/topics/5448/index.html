Me and ECK are there as what I have replied to NgKaiHoe but I can't find anybody!!! We reach there at 6:40 but and waited till 7:15 before leaving....We waited and waited till I can't find your big big star! From your reply, you are not local? Sorry but I don't know that. In the end, ECK and me had to went to TAKA for 2 lonely guys dinner!!! That is shit man.<br><br>I'm even disappointed that the administrator is not even around there!!! Then it is really f**ked up! Anyway, don't get so work up. It's too typical that everyone just say and say but no action. Anyway, probably you, me, ECK, and NgKaiHoe can meet up this coming friday? If not tomorrow also can. If you guys are free, why not come down to Funan to look for us. Then we can go for dinner. How about that?<br><br>Then this time around, whoever is interested can just join us. What do you think? Email me to let me know. Should have ask for one of the contacts.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey thanks Bishamon...<br><br>No, I'm not local, but I'm asian so if ur looking for a white guy, then u probably won't find...:-)<br><br>Anyway, i feel a lot better after venting that out of my system...I was ok at first, but while taking the bus home, I just thought about the situation and how many times I've been "had" by people here...and thus started to get really angry...<br><br>Anyway, noone should have to stand qietly for this kind of situation right?  I don't know, maybe it's just a case of a foreign guy making too much noise...It does seem to me that a lot of the local way of dealing with things is to just agree and then no show.  Why I don't know....I would think that it was just common courtesy to show urself if u say ur going...I don't think that us 4 can be the only people from this forum who thinks about it like this...( I have a few "friends " that can call me up and ask me out...then I go and wait at the designated spot and they never show...call them up and they say they're on their way....almost there...then 1 hour later still no show...then I go home and they switch off all devices...until it happens again from another "friend" or acquaintence...)  I mean, if people are not sincere about it don't say anything lah...say so much just waste ur own energy and other people's time.<br><br>As for ur invitation...I am really really busy...It really took a lot for me to go down today because I have so much work I have to finish...I went down against better judgement because i already commited to it...so there u have it...<br><br>Anyway, thanks again for  the invite...how about another day? (I really mean that..it's not a brush off ok:-)I love Funan, wouldn't mind going down to have a good meal and conversation with u and eck.<br><br>But it will have to be after Wednesday or Friday...my assessment is on Tuesday and WEdnesday...then my exhibition is on Friday at the new URA building in china Town...so I'm really packed with shits to do...:-)<br><br>But what I don't understand is why weren't the Administrators there....1 hour late I can understand, but 2 hours plus and still no sign???....Guys!!!!please give us a response...<br><br>Oh yeah...A bit late now, but I was wearing light brown pants, and a cream sweater/singlet?  Sitting there and having an intersting discussion about local girls with NgkaiHoe at the center of the outside seating until 8:00++ before we went off....I got there at 6:00sharp, and Ngkaihoe got there abotu 10 minutes later...Sorry that u missed us...Every now and then I would get up and parade myself around , but I guess u missed it anyway...but I will mail u about visiting u at Funan....hmmmlove that place.:-)<br><br>...love it when ur not going to buy anything...look around for new gadgets can, but want to buy things must go to SimLim...for us poor folks yeah:-)<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 20-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know it's useless saying "Sorry" now that the whole affair is blown. But since I'm one of the administrators I have to say something. I mean, it's like all of you are lambasting Chief and I feel so damn bad because I myself did not turn up  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Anyway, shouldn't the girls be there or something? Oh well, what an attempt on my part to shift the blame on the stars of this site. Man, I need a slap.<br><br>Well, I really don't know what to say now, except that I'm pretty much apologetic to all who actually went, and even to Chief, even though he was late, he DID turn up after all. I don't about Madzzie. Was he supposed to organise the whole affair and therefore had to be there by 6?<br><br>The thing is, I thought this outing was planned way, way before. I dunno when. But it was on the message board when, during the breaks between exam revision, I checked it out and I saw so many responses to the event.<br><br>I was in total shock (and I learned it only now. I met Chief on the IRC last night and he was totally pissed and refused to speak) that only so few people turned up. But then again, being one of the majority who didn't turn up, I couldn't say more. I'm wholeheartedly sorry to everyone here, to firewire, ngkaihoe and bishamon especially. Please forgive me. Please forgive us.<br><br>And I also wanna apologise to Chief for not standing by him when this sort of thing happens, until it's too late...<br><br>Anyway, let's all be understanding, ok? I mean, things often cock up at the first run. But I hope this doesn't dampen the faith or screw up the affinity all you regulars have for the site and this forum. It's tragic that things didn't turn out the way it's been planned. But bearing in mind that this is really the first meeting -- you can call it the first date -- let's just give it some accomodation. Please? I know it's just so darn painful to be stood up by people whom you thought you could trust. And we admit Chief and the Administrators failed this test of trust badly. But still, there's the exams. And we're waiting for you to invigilate us.<br><br>Don't give up on us. Don't give up on SGGIRLS. We have come so far, and let's not let a bad night in town... ruin the hopeful persons that we are, 'cos we swear we'll always be around.<br><br>Unfortunately, Chief has had some bandwidth problems with the ad scripts, which really came at the wrong time when everyone was so frustrated at the outcome of things. Just pray that this doesn't spell the end of SGGIRLS. And once again, we appeal to the magnanimity of all those who have been working hard to fuel the success of this outing, which failed due partly to the fact that -- (shall take the beam out of my eye before removing the mote in anyone else's) -- I was god-damned insincere.<br><br>Jasonnex<br>@ SG-BOYS <a href="http://sgboys.cjb.net" rel="nofollow">http://sgboys.cjb.net</a>  <a href="http://www.sggirls.com/~sgboys" rel="nofollow">http://www.sggirls.com/~sgboys</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firewire and gang who were at the "outing"<br><br>Well, what can i say? I was there at 5pm. And kept dropping by every half an hour till 7.30pm to spot u guys. I was wearing white long sleeve t shirt and blue jeans (later on change to dark green tshirt). I didnt really see anyone actually until like about 7pm when i saw chief (i know him in real life). Sorry that we made u waited that long, but i was already there before anyone from this forum was. But i really didnt see u. When i did saw u was when i was sitting near the entrance to paragon with chief. We did look at u and spotted ya tattoo, but u looked really fierce and pissed off that we did not dare to say hi. U were with the other guy in green shirt rite? But we actually went out to paragon to look for u and the other guy, but it was already too late. As for the accusation of us doing nothing to make ourselve known, well for your info, we wrote MADZZIE on a piece of paper and walked around the cafe like a idiot to attract whoever is coming. But we got no response. And i think we did enough for this outing as we did not organise it. U couldnt ask us to go around and ask each and other person whether if they were there for the outing?<br>I am not saying that we r completly not at fault, let us say that this time, its a really badly organised outing. We apologised to all who did turned up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dear people, why get so worked up?          there's always next time and better planning with lessons learnt......<br>organizing an outing for 40 strangers is not easy....although i think its a case of 'dispersed' responsibilitiy shared between everyone.....everbody thinks somebody will<br>go and missing it wont make a diff<br><br>and to firewire....all those things you said about Singaporeans (including those in other<br>topics) i hope you said it in a fit of anger (in which case you should apologize in due<br>course) coz it really isnt good to hear somebody criticize and entire population.......<br><br>your western upbring may provide a more vocal expression when u feel really<br>pissed.......but dont forget juz cos we keep quiet doesnt mean we arent pissed with<br>you or with anything<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First off...<br><br>GTR...I'm not blasting u here, but I actually do believe that a lot of Singaporean people are like this...I'm not blasting the whole nation..if it sounded like I was blasting the whole nation...THAT was a fit of anger.<br><br>I know that some of u would have a need to protect ur namesake or whatever, but the fact is that I have met an equal number of good people and really insincere people full of hot air...all the time....and it really can't be me ok...My luck is bad but it can't be so bad that I keep running into these kind of people.  The previous 2 places I worked was really screwed up...headed by local guys(and 1 woman)...shit man...that's another story, but it's really just another thing that I'm talking about but on a bigger scale because it involves work/money/and reputation...<br><br>anyway, let me get back to this....I think that Singaporean people are great people...or else I wouldn't want to stay here so bad.:-) My problem is that there are waWAY, WAY, WAY too many people who are full of hot air and insincereity here...shit man, even local people can say the same thing about their own people...my perceptions are based on experience (7 years total and continuing...and whether i am angry or not i am usaully still very clear headed and logical...I know that's contradicting, but trust me...When u get to know me in real life u'll know what I mean)...I don't know what it is that can make so many people come out like this...but I have a theory that I think i will post up after my assessment...<br><br>It's like facing a damn firing squad at the assessments...U stand in front of 7 Architects from japan, Singapore, and Australia and they blast the shit out of ur work and flame u for ur skills and thinking process...shit...I can't wait..:-p<br><br>Any3way, GTR, i hope u can put off posting any response to this right now until I can post my topic up in a few days time...so that u have a chance to understand me more before there's any misunderstanding. ok?:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To everyone else.<br><br>Let me just say that in real life, u will never see me get angry like this...unless I see some guy trying to punch the shit out of his GF, but that's another story...<br><br>I was expressing my frustration and anger, and it was aimed at the administrators...for good reasons too(in my eyes anyway).  WE all know already that the people responsible for the event take responsibility if anything really terrible should go wrong...just a sad fact of life...besides, they organized it and they should have been more proactive about how we were going to meet and recognize or what...Also, I think that as administrators, u all should be there at 6....<br><br>Ok, so most of the admin showed up but not that it helped anyone as we can see....and the thing about not approaching us after seeing me?....huh?<br><br>Before I continue, I just want to say that There is no bad blood in me towards the admin or the forum...What's happened has happened and today is two days later...next time, it just needs to be set up better...if there is a next time.<br><br>Also, i already knew that most people weren't going to show up so it didn't really bug me...it was just that me and kai couldn't understand why there were no apparent signs of people(admin) looking for us....<br><br>I did as much as I could.  Sat in the center facing the front, angled towards the direction of human traffic, showed my big ass star tattoo like I was trying to show off or something...every now and then get up and parade around hoping someone will see the fool with the star 'too.<br><br>Ok, i also would like to blame myself a bit because I usually leave my handphone number whenever there is going to be some kind of outing....ie, my first outing, me asking ATAX to Wong Sans.....<br><br>I left my number both times, but this time I didn't because I just figured that the admin would have something cooked up...as it was their party after all.  also, I forgot...getting too damn old man.:-)<br><br>But then again u know, i think that blaming myslef isn't really fair as it wasn't my invitation to people for this outing...this time, I'm just an invitee....:-)<br><br>Altho I was fuming at the time, i was still glad that Chief managed an apology and took blame and responsibility for it as it should be.<br><br>Now u might think that I'm just an old fart asshole who wants to find blame or what, but that's not the case...blaming people isn't what I usually do(I hate blaming anyone or anything...would much rather blame myself than others)...pushing blame is usually the last resort of people too scared to take responsibility for their own failure....but sometime...sometimes...it's necesary to point the finger...I felt that this was one of those times.<br><br>I don't know....I felt that i had done enough on my part...there just wasn't anything else I could have done at that time we were sitting there.<br><br>So now I am asking for people's forgiveness for lashing out like that...I don't do it in real life, so I don't really understand why I would do it here, but i did...maybe it had something to do with the fact that this week I was stood up twice...this being the 3rd time.  Damn lousy luck for anyone man...patience or no patience, 3 in one week will throw u into some kind of a doozy.:-)<br><br>So please everyone who got offended by my language and message, i ask for ur forgiveness also....<br><br>Administrators....u have a great site and a great forum, and i am most definately sure that u guys didn't intentionally plan for the event to happen like this...my anger was only momentary and didn't last for more than an hour...max....in fact, I was going to write an apology to Chiefs posting "to everyone who went to the outing"....but the message board just crapped out on me at that instant for the whole night...I think I sent u guys an email about that....Then just now I came back from school...pulling all nighter and sitting here like an idiot typing this explantory apology instead of sleeping...have to wake up in a couple hours and back to work again.<br><br>And to Chief, I wasn't pissed off...I really was having a really interesting conversation with NgKaiHoe about women and of course eyeing them:-)..like mad!!!:-)<br><br>I just look that way all the time...But don't judge me by my cover, because u will find that what u see and what u get from me is very different...I prefer that people see me one way, but experience me in another...it's what u get when u think too much abouth things...and also because i grew up in places where looking like a wimp can get u beat up for sport....good defence mechanism...It worked on u didn't it?  :-)<br><br>So, lets all forget the bad incident as it was just one big terrible tragedy,...Today is new and tomorrow is not even here yet...<br><br>lets rock, forum and roll!!!:-) smile men.<br><br></div>
