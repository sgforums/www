Currently, the market is keeping up, no much problems with experienced agents. But for new comers, I advise you to be fully mentally prepared for this career. It is a tough career and you need a lot of network. Another important issue is that you need to enough cash flow for you to manage.<br><br>If you really want to earn big bucks in property line, you have to be extremely hardworking. All those top producers took years to achieve today's results. I can tell you, your 1st year will be extremely tough. A lot of young agents I see, give up after 6 months of torture. You have to be physical, mentally and monetarily prepared. And, not missing out on your discipline. Since this is not a desk bound 9 to 5 job, do you think you will have the discipline to report to office everyday, say maybe 10am, and work till 9pm at work? Or are you going to sleep till you are satisfied and take 5 days off as and when you like? In this line, no work means no income.<br><br>As for your friend, how long has he joined this line? Does he have the experience of leading you onto the correct path to this rewarding career? Or has he just started out and is trying to recruit you out of goodwill for buddies' sake? And, are the both of you going to be under a good and trustable manager? I suggest, you start trying out as a part timer 1st, get to know the company and the market before you commit fully. Nevertheless, your interest must be there too. Like me, I'm not keen at all. That's why, I'm still a staff instead of an agent till now...<br><br>Good luck!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br></div>

This job takes a lot of discipline and energy - Consistently doing what you shld do, you  will definitely see results. Lax a bit, you don't get business and you get demoralized quickly. (Very much like building muscles. You are keen working on it constantly, your muscles grow but once you start getting lazy, your hard earned muscles disappears).<br><br>To me, as a real estate agent is a much relaxing job than working for others. At least I set my own target and satisfy myself, not others. This is a job just like any other sales job - Hardwork and drive is required and don't think you can get big bucks without putting in the effort. (There's no free lunch on this earth!)<br><br>Currently, I'm doing ok. No regrets going into this line as yet. (At least my family members noticed that I'm much happier than when I was working for somebody).<br><br>However, what works for me may not work for you. You have to evaluate your circumstance and personality to see if you are suitable for this line.<br><br>In any case, if you need more advice, can give me a call - 9170 6562.<br><br></div>
