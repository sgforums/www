              <p>A newbie too. I would like something to create awareness to the girls especially.</p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">5 months back, I’ve known this guy. I don’t feel like going into details on how we met and how the meet up was. Lemme just get straight into the point. It all started where I liked him based on empathy. He told me he had a son, not yet married. He is 1994, had a son with his ex-gf. I was shocked in the first place, but I keep calm. I remembered he even told me he was once a head of gangster. His face looks innocent to me and he even told me he wanted a changed in his life. Thats when I end up with him in a relationship. Thinking that I could give him motivation to change for better. But I’m wronged all this while. I was blinded by his bullshits and “world” stories in his life. I admit I was stupid &amp; foolish that I have stayed by his side for all this 5 months. He kept saying I’m such a waste of time and all. Even when we are out for “dates”, we pay our own separate bills of foods &amp; drinks. I had once confronted him asking if he treat his previous gf like this, he said yes. I’m like wow okay. I tried breaking up with him countless times cause I can’t stand his behavior. But always end up patching back because he knows to console me well. Unfortunately, things didn’t went well on 14 May 2015. I found out that he were contacting other girls even when we were in relationship. Still contacting his ex whom he had son with saying just for the sake of his son. When I confront his ex, she doesn’t even know that our relationship existed. All I want to say here is, beware of this guy who going around playing with girls’s hearts. I am not here trying to get him back to me, never at all. I just don’t want other girls to be in the same place as me. Nevertheless, I would like say thank you to him, a guy whom initial name starts with A. Thank you for making a fool out of me for 5 months long, u did a great job in that ðŸ‘�ðŸ‘� Thank you for your effort and time wasted on me. Thank you for your “good deeds” towards me. Thank you for “loving me” and “cared” for me. To end this, please stop finding for me. Stop calling from different numbers you get through your workplace. Stop asking your mum or sister or your ex to even contact me. Don’t do any extra account on twitter just to contact me. Just focus on your current gf or gfs? Well I don’t know but yea I know you’re not single now. To his current gf, please be extra careful whomever you are. Well if his love for you is true then lucky you, but please tell him to stop looking for me. Details for the guy: he is a malay guy living in the Lion City, had a son with his ex-gf and is a 1994 human being. May you still stay as “world” as you areðŸ‘�</span></p>
