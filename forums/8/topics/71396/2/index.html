Prolly because they don't know what they want?</div></blockquote>how many folks knew what they wanted at SEVENTEEN? give the kids a break, it's easy to be critical but to be helpful? that takes something else.<br><br>i wish i could just tell all of them that it doesn't matter where you go, coz you'll just end up where you started from. haiz, another year, another batch gets led to the slaughter house.<br><br>i remember when it was my turn to make a choice (false reality; the actuality was that the decision had already been made for me by others, those in authority and with the power, i am helpless before them), NYP had a new course, Diploma in Digital Media Design (those short animations you see on the bus are made by 'em). i thought to myself, this seems right my alley, so i put it down as no. 1. i don't know how they appoint applicants in NYP for that course, but i didn't get in. i went to SP and took Civil and Structural Engineering. Worlds apart, from my initial selection. I cleared it in 3.5 years, deluding myself that I could probably get a job easily once i grad. then came the construction crunch. it happened prolly halfway thru my ns. i spent a few sleepless nights trying to see where i could go. suffice to say, i'm still not sure of my path, and i ORD'ed for five months already.<br><br>anyways, enuf of this rambling. to all those about to make the choice, take the time to think it thru, but don't over-analyse the situation.</div>
