            <div class='col-md body'>over whether to go poly or jc?<br><br>when i had to make the choice, i also faced the damn problem. every year, i always see students facing the same problem over and over again. last year when i reported for duty for JAE, some students asked me what is poly life like when they asked me abt my course. seriously speaking, after spending 2 years in poly, i cant answer u. all i can tell u is, there is barely anything u need from sec sch to come to poly/<br><br>it seems that yes, the jcs and ci get a 3 mth course but we dont. and now it is being scrapped. i have been thinking abt proposing to my sch to allow sec sch students to come and sit in for lectures, without setting any entry requirements at all. they can jsut come in to attend lectures with the engine students today then after lunch sit in with the biz then next day spend time with the chem process ppl. just come in if there is enuf space. of course dont come to labs and classrooms just for the lectures only.<br><br>why bother setting a requirement when u are going to do so during JAE?</div>

Heck, even in January the stress starts to pill up. In JC, it's stress all the way, and it's a matter of whether you can hang in there all the way till the end of the 'A' levels. There's not to say it ain't good, just that some people loath this kind of arrangement.</div>
