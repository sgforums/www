Where do we actually draw the fine boundary? The rationale is simple. I do not see anything which entitles adults to more rights to public display of affection. If adults can do it, what actually prevents teenagers from committing the same act? That they are only a few years junior to their older counterparts? That they are still under their parents' custody, and thus, are not entitled to rights which would otherwise be possessed by them?</div>

Good job son.<br><br>And I am not much older here, but at least I take the extra mile to be mature and not JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS, or seize opportunities to humiliate others with cheap shots. Chances are you still would not get it, I am only 15-years-old this year.<br><br></div></blockquote>OK MY MISTAKE THERE..... REALLY SORRY.

I feel uncomfortable at seeing something that should be done in private, done openly. I mean, i don't even know what they're thinking.<br><br>If they want to make everyone jealous, then they've succeeded(to some extent anyway), if they're just such exhibitionists, then what can we do?<br><br>Dang i'm tired today.

It was a double-decked bus, and they went right to the end, half-undressed, and the girl just stood up and sat down on the guy.<br><br>I told my friend about it, and we both looked over. The girl looked at us, then ignored us.<br><br>I guess, sometimes, another reason why people do it in public is because, people just can't wait til they reach the safe places of their house to make out.
