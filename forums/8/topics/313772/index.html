              <p><span>SINGAPORE: You've heard or experienced it all, the good and the
                      bad that service in Singapore has to offer. Now, here are credible
                      statistics to back the anecdotes — and the numbers paint a picture of a
                      somewhat satisfied customer.
                      <br> <br>Based on a new, comprehensive measure of customer contentment, the
                      city of the smiling Singa scored a "healthy" 68.7 out of 100 on the
                      national average satisfaction scale. Other developed countries scored
                      in the 70s.
                      <br> <br>A first in Singapore, the Customer Satisfaction Index of Singapore
                      (CSISG) — developed by the Institute of Service Excellence (Ises) and
                      the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) — includes the views
                      of both residents and tourists, on eight key economic sectors.
                      <br> <br>Of the individual entities that stood out, the national carrier
                      took pride of place. Thanking its customers, a Singapore Airlines
                      spokesperson told TODAY it had invested "substantial resources in
                      training" its staff to keep customers happy and was "honoured to have
                      topped the survey".
                      <br> <br>Less satisfied, however, were those who ranked Singapore's two
                      healthcare clusters, the National Healthcare Group and SingHealth, near
                      the bottom of the overall list. For instance, in terms of polyclinic
                      service, they scored 60.5 and 64.7 respectively.
                      <br> <br>With the issue of long queues having repeatedly made the news,
                      consumers like band instructor Goh Koon Chuan, 36, were not surprised
                      polyclinics fared badly. "Their waiting times are long," he groused.
                      <br> <br>While the transportation and logistics sector was ranked third, one
                      of its sub-sectors — public buses — scored a low 64.3. SBS Transit
                      said: "We are of course disappointed that we did not do better and this
                      will definitely spur us to do better."
                      <br> <br>Most consumers were not surprised at the sector rankings,
                      especially with tourism coming in first. But market researcher Eugene
                      Fok, 25, did not expect telecommunications to take bottom place, while
                      housewife Ms Cynthia Sin, 47, felt the scoring for public buses was
                      harsh. "I depend on public transport, and I think it is quite
                      efficient," she said. <br> <br> While Singapore's national average is healthy, there is some catching
                      up to do, said Ises director Caroline Lim. South Korea and the United
                      States, which use the same model, scored 72 and 75 respectively. <br> <br> South Korea had scored 58.8 when it launched the index in 1998 but has
                      moved "steadily upward" since, said Ms Lim, adding that Singapore can
                      do likewise.
                      <br> <br>Interestingly, tourists gave higher scores than residents did. Most
                      tourists came from Indonesia, China and Australia, said Ms Lim, and
                      when they compare against their experiences at home, "they would rate
                      Singapore higher".
                      <br> <br>That Singaporeans could have higher expectations was also a
                      "possibility". Even so, only 6.3 per cent of respondents had complained
                      to a company at least once in the last three or six months — compared
                      with the US' 14 per cent. <br> <br> This could be due to US consumers being more vocal, or there being more
                      well-established feedback channels and a faster service-recovery
                      culture in the US, said Ises, which comes under the Singapore
                      Management University (SMU). The key to customer satisfaction, findings
                      showed, depended on how well a company handled the complaint.
                      <br> <br>The CSISG is an international gold standard based on the American
                      Customer Satisfaction Index, said Ises, which co-funded the $1-million
                      survey with the WDA. Data was collected through face-to-face interviews
                      with 10,229 households and 2,159 tourists between May 1 and July 23
                      last year. The survey took into account how customers' expectations and
                      the quality of products or services affected their satisfaction. <br> <br> Acting Minister for Manpower Gan Kim Yong said good service skills will
                      become a critical asset and a competitive advantage for Singapore. "The
                      CSISG is not just a barometer of customer satisfaction. It is a
                      diagnostic tool that allows companies to understand, compare, improve
                      and monitor their customer service over time," he said, challenging
                      companies to score above 70 within three years.
                      <br> <br> The results will be posted at </span><a class="path" href="http://www.smu.edu.sg/">www.smu.edu.sg</a><span>. Data collection for CSISG 2008 will begin in mid-year, and will expand to include other sub-sectors, such as insurance.

              <p><span style="color: #993366;">You hit the nail on the head. Singaporeans are bad customers. But there is probably also another side to it. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993366;">Some of the industries, like for example restaurants, have really high employee turnovers, and when new staff are put on the job, they are not given adequate training, therefore, bound to perform badly. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993366;">To add on, many Singaporeans also do not take pride in their jobs, only wanting to do the bare minimum just to get paid.</span></p>
