              <p>update</p>
              <p>It actually happened in Malaysia. I remember reading a newspaper report about this. There was this hawker that got "pow toh" hence the people from the relevant agency organized a surprise check on his stall. When the hawker saw the people coming for him, he scooped "something" from his soup/gravy and ran to the river behind and dumped it. They never got to properly identity what was the item he disposed of, but from the description and also the situation you can guess what it was.</p>
