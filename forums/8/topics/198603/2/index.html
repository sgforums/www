And the world I'm referring to is not only Singapore. Singapore is just a part of the world, if you can realised what I'm talking about. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If guys are still dreamy and trying in vain to look for their one true romantic love of their lives in Singapore, chances are you may need to look out of this piece of granite rock...cos even true love also need nurturing and it does means that you can and will have only one true love in your entire lives. Besides, there will always be someone out there who is so much better than your true love. So start asking yourselves how true is your love for each other? Don't bother holding onto time for your true love cos even your true love won't be bothering themselves with holding onto the hour glass for you. Even if you're not leaving your options open when you're in a relationship, do not be a fool and believe that your true love is also doing the same thing as you.<br><br>It's time to use our brain and think rationally about love itself. Most of us overrided our brain's curiousity in hope of searching for the betterment of our relationship, so how many is actually truely and genuinely happy with their relationships in their lives? We often ended up bitter and sour and console ourselves saying "This is life and such is our lives and so on...". Is our lives really supposed to be lived like this? At the disposal and whims of our loved ones? It's time to live your life in your own way and put a stop to your own despair and misery. Life isn't worth living for if it isn't anywhere near happy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So take control of your own lives and be happy with it. Ignore what others prefer cos they shouldn't have control over your happiness unless you allow them to do so. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>By the way, guys can go and die too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyah , maybe at first lang zi or bad boys or freelance workers mite seem very attractive or very cool cos of their laid back attitude. But then long term wise , gers will still want to choose a partner who is financially stable. They are not being materialistic , they are just being realistic. I dont think any ger out there will want to enjoy the excitment of love and yet survive on an empty stomach..Of course if the guy is very rich and yet has a humble and really nice character , why not?</div>
