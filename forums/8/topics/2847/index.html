            <div class='col-md body'>Have any of you ever realised that if there is a group of people out together, if the guy/girl ratio is unequal, with waaay fewer girls, people tend to generalise the girls as cheap, flirts or buayees, to put it colloquially? Just wondering why that is so...cos as a girl, I sometimes do go out with a group of guys, who are my BUDDIES and they treat me as such, and I, them. However, certain narrowminded people seem to be displeased and think I am FLIRTING. What does this mean? A girl cannot get along well with guys as friends and nothing more?<br><br>------------------<br>Love &amp; poison,<br>Suede<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that the way you and the guys in the group interact contributes to the perception of a bystander...I mean, if the guys in the group treat you like one of them (that's why I think you call them BUDDIES) then body language would tell them that NOTHING is going on.<br>However, if the some guys in the group are interested in you and acts accodingly, then it would be inevitable that bystanders would think that you are a 'Lan Hong'(as opposed to the guys who are called Chee Hong).<br><br>But that's what BYSTANDERS think.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all your replies...I agree that I shouldn't bother what others think, and I usually don't. My starting this thread was not the result of being affected by others' opinions of me, it was more that I was wondering how people could be so narrowminded in the first place, and I was curious as to what you guys thought.<br><br>Fey: Yes, I have gone out with groups of guys before where there was a guy there who was interested in me and acted as such, but I don't agree that that is what alters the opinions of people. Basically, I'm a very sociable person by nature, and I tend to get along well with both sexes. I suppose the reason why I have more male friends than female friends is because I am able to interact with them as a PERSON, not restricted by the confines of my sex. I know only too many girls who act SO differently in front of guys as they would in front of girls. The act sweet, and try their best to impress guys by basically being a hypocrite. However, my problem lies in the fact that I don't "put on a show". By not putting on a show, this includes my treating my guy and girl friends almost exactly the same. This means that acts of affection such as hugs, playful slapping, teasing, tickling and such extend not only to girls but guys too. I guess most Singaporeans are still to narrowminded....*SIGH*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>------------------<br>Love &amp; poison,<br>Suede<br><br></div>

This could not be further from the truth. I am very careful to ensure that I do not act like this with guys whom I do not know well, as I know only too well that my actions could easily be misconstrued. I am confident that my close male friends do not read too much into my actions. I am also confident that, as a person, I am worth knowing for much more, contrary to your implication that " the guy friends that U have is not with you because U are more physical in expressing yourself". I also believe that my personal judgement of character is good enough to be able to weed out the guys who just want to cop a cheap feel. Unless of course, you are implying that I would enjoy such attentions...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
