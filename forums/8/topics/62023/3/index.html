            <div class='col-md body'>i dun think its right tt we dislike HYS...we hve no right to judge any person...be it christian or non. One of the worst thing tt can happen is to hate a person because of his/her religion or hate a religion because of any person found within. Religion in this case, Christianity preaches forgiveness of sins and grace. No doubt there exist in the world today many who professed to be Christians but their actions and manner of doing things are non-conforming to the Scriptures. But we are not to condemn, discriminate or pour judgments simply because God is the One who judge. All we can do is to maintain our personal Christian integrity, walk in His ways and testify for Him.<br><br>Have a look at this........<br><br>MATTHEW 13<br><br>The Parable of the Weeds<br><br>24Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. 25But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. 26When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.<br>27"The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?'<br>28" 'An enemy did this,' he replied.<br>"The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?'<br>29" 'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may root up the wheat with them. 30Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.' "</div>

One of the worst thing tt can happen is to hate a person because of his/her religion or hate a religion because of any person found within. <span style="color: orange;">Religion in this case, Christianity preaches forgiveness of sins and grace. </span>No doubt there exist in the world today many who professed to be Christians but their actions and manner of doing things are non-conforming to the Scriptures. <span style="color: green;">But we are not to condemn, discriminate or pour judgments simply because God is the One who judge</span>. All we can do is to maintain our personal Christian integrity, walk in His ways and testify for Him.<br>.' "</div></blockquote><span style="color: orange;">aiyah, if you are so high and mighty, and all about forgiveness and and grace,  you should turn the other cheek, right?  why do you care so much about what ppl say?  and keep trying to close down any topics that offend u.  not practicing what u preach leh</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">and if nobody is to judge or comment, then why are you judging and commenting on other people who judge and comment?  you contadict yourself already again.  again never practice what you preach.  own goooooaaaaaaaaaaaal!</span><br><br></div>

In your teaching show integrity, seriousness, and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.....so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Saviour attractive.<br><br>[Titus 2:7-10]</div>
