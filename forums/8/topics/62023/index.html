It is baffling to note that the media has been highlighting her outrageous outfit and image she portrays as a Pastor or consellor so to speak. We are uncertain whether she has compromised her christian values in the midst of her limelight. I believe that we shouldn't badmouth her based on our own judgement. I am appalled by the recent HYS saga which many people write in and criticise her. I would kindly request that we stop all the pointing of fingers because that would eventually lead us no where and create more animosity. And that is certainly something we can do without.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From friends who had clarified with me, I would conclude that the songs she sang and produced are non-Christian songs. In fact, I don't think HYS intend to produce Gospel songs or even contemporary christian music such as Jars of Clay, SonicFlood etc.. However, if we are observant enough, we can note that her songs are written and targetted to the depressed and lonely people. (The title of her latest album will evidently suggest my point) HYS once commented that she hoped for her songs to bring hope to people who listens to them. This is subjective to every individual, therefore some people liked her songs while some do not. On top of that, HYS would practise altar call each time she ends her concert. I guess that is when her Christian practice comes into the picture.<br><br>Let's take a look at Stacie Orrico. Maybe you'll be bedazzled if I am to tell you now that she's also a Christian singer, almost quite similar to HYS. Her top hit "more to life" is somehow likewise identical to HYS's music.<br><br>My point here is simple. Their music may not be totally christian from what the artistes would probably have claimed to be. But we can take a step further to understand the intention and the outcome of it before we lay a judgement.<br><br>My two cents worth =)</div>
