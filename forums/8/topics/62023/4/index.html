            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by blue_kelvinsg:</div><div class="quote_body">From friends who had clarified with me, I would conclude that the songs she sang and produced are non-Christian songs. In fact, I don't think HYS intend to produce Gospel songs or even contemporary christian music such as Jars of Clay, SonicFlood etc.. However, if we are observant enough, we can note that her songs are written and targetted to the depressed and lonely people. (The title of her latest album will evidently suggest my point) HYS once commented that she hoped for her songs to bring hope to people who listens to them. This is subjective to every individual, therefore some people liked her songs while some do not. On top of that, HYS would practise altar call each time she ends her concert. I guess that is when her Christian practice comes into the picture.<br><br>Let's take a look at Stacie Orrico. Maybe you'll be bedazzled if I am to tell you now that she's also a Christian singer, almost quite similar to HYS. Her top hit "more to life" is somehow likewise identical to HYS's music.<br><br>My point here is simple. Their music may not be totally christian from what the artistes would probably have claimed to be. But we can take a step further to understand the intention and the outcome of it before we lay a judgement.<br><br>My two cents worth =)</div></blockquote>hmm.. i duno.. i didn't really hear her songs.. but my sis bought her album.. i think there was one song talking about can't live without Him or smth.. mei you ni.. smth like tt? maybe heard wrong</div>

There're many people on both side, who can quote scriptural verses to support their stand. I think, first of all, we do not really know whether someone is really saved, or whether they're saved now or 10 years later, assuming they're still saved in the end. I do not believe paying lip service can get you saved. Also, whether one is saved is dependant on grace of God. But topics like predestination and God choosing the elect is a big can of worms, so we won't go into detail here.<br><br>1). I think we cannot reduce all the scenarios in this world into "christians are saved, non-christians are not". Too simplistic to me.<br><br>PS: I have a question for christians here. Are toodlers who never heard of Christ saved if they die? Is the bushman in Africa who never heard of Christ saved if he die? Is someone who got the wrong impression of Christianity saved if he die? See, so many scenario ...</div></blockquote>its written somewhere that the word of god is in the hearts of man.. we know what is right.. we just choose to do the opposite.<br><br>there is an island.. around new guena, above australia.. a team of evangelists went there to evangelize, and found out they didn't hv a written language, keep in mind, these ppl are totally out of it, they communicate in their own language, no one has ever came here to teach them to be nice ppl and stuff like that. untouched paradise. kind of..<br><br>but yet these ppl, who have no link to the morden world, knew, the importance of like.. murdering = bad, must respect elders, cannot steal.. blah blah.. which is written in the 10 commandments, the law of Moses..<br><br>the word of God is written in the hearts of man.. and no one is excused.. sounds harsh yea?<br><br>but as for yourself. u living in the morden world. i believe chrsitianity or its ideals are not foreign.. but do u choose?<br><br>i may sound harsh.. but its really wierd.. u are concerned about someone who hasn't heard.. but if u hv heard, why don't you choose?</div>
