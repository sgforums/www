In fact, I don't think HYS intend to produce Gospel songs or even contemporary christian music such as Jars of Clay, SonicFlood etc.. However, if we are observant enough, we can note that her songs are written and targetted to the depressed and lonely people. (The title of her latest album will evidently suggest my point) HYS once commented that she hoped for her songs to bring hope to people who listens to them. This is subjective to every individual, therefore some people liked her songs while some do not. On top of that, HYS would practise altar call each time she ends her concert. I guess that is when her Christian practice comes into the picture.<br><br>Let's take a look at Stacie Orrico. Maybe you'll be bedazzled if I am to tell you now that she's also a Christian singer, almost quite similar to HYS. Her top hit "more to life" is somehow likewise identical to HYS's music.<br><br>My point here is simple. Their music may not be totally christian from what the artistes would probably have claimed to be. But we can take a step further to understand the intention and the outcome of it before we lay a judgement.<br><br>My two cents worth =)</div></blockquote>Ok... this may come a little late considering your post's on the first page.<br><br>You say she practices altar call at the end of every concert and I find that abit scary? ... the people who approach the altar, do they know the meaning of accepting Christ and they sincerely wanna accept Christ or are they following what their "idol's" asking them to do and find an excuse to get near her?<br><br>I'm not here to slam HYS nor to encourage her actions. I don't think it's fair for anyone to judge her or ask her for any justifcation. She only has God to answer to on judgement day. Nuff said.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Icemoon:</div><div class="quote_body">What's the real reason for covering the head last time? I think snk86 never really answer this question.<br><br>The next question to ask, logically, will be is that reason applicable now, as it did 2000 years ago in their Roman-Palestinian culture?<br></div></blockquote>We should also observe that it was when a woman was praying or prophesying that a woman was to have her head coveredÂ…<br><br><span style="color: red;">1 Corinthians 11:4-5<br><br>"Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncoveredÂ–it is just as though her head were shaved."<br></span><br><br>To answer your follow up on question on current days application, it is a personal conviction that it is not a LITERAL command to cover a woman's head.<br><br>If we study into Paul's teachings which were taught to Timothy, you would see a teaching about intrinsic focus. Like in<br><br>1 Timothy 2:9-10, "Likewise the women are to adorn themselves in respectable apparel with modesty and sensibleness, not in braids and gold or pearls or expensive clothing, but, as is fitting for women who profess godliness, through good works."<br><br>Timothy is not condemning the use of nice expensive clothes,gold and braids. He is condemning the misuse of these things.The point is not to warn against something intrinsically evil, but to warn against its misuse as an expression of self-exaltation or worldly-mindedness.<br><br>Thus in the teaching about the covering of head for women, the culture then was that there are women who took off their coverings (which were a social norm THEN) as an act of rebellion towards authority.  Thus, in the same way, Paul is not teaching that taking off coverings or not covering their heads are bad but that the purpose of the actions.  I would say that in present day, PAUL would say "Do not do anything or show acts of rebellion in open public to challenge the authorites in the church."<br><br>Hope you get the gist of it.<br><br></div>
