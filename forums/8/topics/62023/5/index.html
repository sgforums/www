The other threads were fine, but this one is ultimate. Just look at the way she dressed [EvilClown had posted this somewhere in the forum], and is she going to say it is edifying to God?<br><br>Oftentimes we just to have simply use our common sense to judge what is of God's and what is off God's. An AK47 toting monk shooting at civilians claiming he's sending them to their rebirth and new life? An extreme example, but i'm sure you guys get the drift.<br><br>Sun? Period.</div></blockquote>i dun think there's anything wrong with her dressing, even if it's "that red dress that started all the debate". I dun remember any verse in the bible that states how a person must dress, hence there's nothing wrong with a person dressing scantily. It's more of people's thinking that is causing all these. Everyone just has this concept that a pastor or a church worker is conservative, thus it is wrong for them to dress unconservatively.<br><br>Besides, i find there is nothing wrong with her being a pop singer and a pastor at the same time. A pastor cannot survive on just being a pastor, they have to have a second job elsewhere, and hers just happen to be a pop singer. As long as she doesn't deny her religion in the pursuit of her pop career, there's nothing wrong.<br>The only thing wrong is with CHC. Playing her music video at every church service, that's like advertising for her, glorifying her. They should be glorifying God only, instead of God AND her. But then again, maybe they do that becoz her husband's one of the founder of the church, and he's just proud of her. Still, the fault dun lie with her, it lies with the church.<br><br>That's just my opinion, besides, I've never heard any of her songs, nor saw any of her music videos. All the info i got are from the straits times.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wat u don understand is this... she is nt applying wat the church preaches... n tat is nt to dress scantily... also... they treat the title of "pastor" as a joke... happy call herself pastor nt happy call herself music director... the church claim tat the title of "pastor" is given to ppl who have made significant contribution... so let's say one day i donate one million to the church... will i be made a pastor? of cos nt... a pastor is one who have have a better knowledge of the bible... and who follow Gods' words closely... i don think HYS is doign tat.... so as the church...<br>being a pop singer is okay... but being a pastor N a pop singer is different... cos she makes herself beign idolised as well! and God says t to follow idols! CHC nt only played her music videos... but also prayed for her! CHC claims tat they do it for all successful members of the church... but i don see tham doing it to teh founder of 77th street! so y r they onli giving the priviledge to HYS?<br>Pastors DO draw salary from the church and the amount of money they get depends on hw big the church is... juz like other companies... CHC is a pretty big church with more than 15000 followers... out of which 53% are salary drawn workers... 53%=7950 followers are salaried ppl... i will take $1000 as their monthly salary... which means they give AT LEAST $795000 to the church... for non salaried ppl... 47%=7050 ppl... i will take $300 as their  monthly allowance... they r giving $211500 to the church monthly... in total every month the church receives $1006500!!! n tat is nt adding the various donations they r given... minus off the maintenance of the church... n other expenses... i am sure the pastors themselves draw quite a healthy sum of salary...<br>y HYS wans to go to showbiz i can onli think o one reason and tat is to expand the church's power... or rather area of influence... if nt i think she might as well concentrate on her "music director" job at the church!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Devon:</div><div class="quote_body">i dun think there's anything wrong with her dressing, even if it's "that red dress that started all the debate". I dun remember any verse in the bible that states how a person must dress, hence there's nothing wrong with a person dressing scantily. It's more of people's thinking that is causing all these. Everyone just has this concept that a pastor or a church worker is conservative, thus it is wrong for them to dress unconservatively.<br><br>Besides, i find there is nothing wrong with her being a pop singer and a pastor at the same time. A pastor cannot survive on just being a pastor, they have to have a second job elsewhere, and hers just happen to be a pop singer. As long as she doesn't deny her religion in the pursuit of her pop career, there's nothing wrong.<br>The only thing wrong is with CHC. Playing her music video at every church service, that's like advertising for her, glorifying her. They should be glorifying God only, instead of God AND her. But then again, maybe they do that becoz her husband's one of the founder of the church, and he's just proud of her. Still, the fault dun lie with her, it lies with the church.<br><br>That's just my opinion, besides, I've never heard any of her songs, nor saw any of her music videos. All the info i got are from the straits times.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>about your dressing part, trust me, the bible have WAY too much examples on dressing morally, kinda in direct, but it is obvious, pls check 1 king and 2 king if you don believe</div>
