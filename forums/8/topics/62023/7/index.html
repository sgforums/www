Our Lord commanded it;<br></div></blockquote>In a sense yes and in a sense no.  It is not a command like as in like the 10 commandments. This is more of Paul speaking in authority as as Apostle of the church.  Being an apostle and father of the church, it is his responsibility to advise the believers on what is good and what is not, thus his advice for women to keep their heads covered as a sign of respect for authority.  And since Paul spoke in the authority of Christ, yes in the sense, God commanded it.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">2. it is a visible sign of an invisible order established by God</div></blockquote>I do not quite understand. What invisible order? Please advise me what you mean. If you are implying inequality, I can tell you, no. If it is indeed that, I will elaborate more when you reply.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">3. The angels at Mass are offended if women don't use it</div></blockquote>Firstly I wun use the word Mass since it is only used in a Roman Catholic setting, in the bible it was just a church setting.  I believe you are referring to this particular part in the bible in 1 Corinthians 11:7-10<br><br>"A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head."<br><br>Because you saw that 'because of the angels', you think that women were asked to cover because the angels will be unhappy.  However, if you read the verses in entirety, You will see that 'A man is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.' then the verse went on to say 'For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.'<br><br>The context is that angels and men are present in a church meeting.  In that cultural setting, as i said, removing the covering is an act of rebellion towards the authority in the church.  Thus, in order not to stumble or cause confusion to both the men and angels in the church, women should show submission to the church authority.  You may think, ANGELS stumble? Confused? Satan was one of them. God recognises that angels, fallen or not watches us in church. Head ship was the real issue. Satan rebelled against Christ's and God's head ship in heaven and ended taking 1/3 of the angels with him. By wearing a head covering a woman is saying outwardly that she acknowledges that authority.  It also says to all the angels whether fallen or not, that she accepts God's order of head ship, not Satan's and that she does not want to be part of his rebellion.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">4. it is a ceremonial vestment</div></blockquote>What do you mean?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">5. it is our heritage. </div></blockquote>Well if you mean heritage as in we need to do it in modern days, its really up to individuals.  I think there is no need to do it because i find that it is an apparent teaching from Paul about the importance of not doing anything to rebel against the church authority.  But some would take the literal meaning of the bible and apply it.  Is it wrong? No, why would it be wrong?  If you despise the act of head covering because you think it is sexual inequality, then you are reading into the passages wrongly, which I can explain in another post if needed.  The more important thing here is that you must understand that Paul is not demeaning the status of women here and since he is not demaning women, there is really no issue whether head covering should be practice or not. Yes or no, there is really no issue.<br><br></div>

For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. For this reason ...</div></blockquote>Yeah God created Man first. Then He saw that Man was lonely and thus made Woman for Man. The classic Adam and Eve. Thus from this order comes the order found in the church.  Some people says that this is saying the women is lesser than men. BUT. When did the bible ever say that?<br><br>What this order means that the role that women play in a church is that of a helper of men. And the role of men is that they need to be the heads of church.  Again, does this mean that women is lesser? No. You see, men and women are made differently but equal. They are complementary and yet equal.  Take Jesus for example when He came to earth as a man.  As God, He could have just dismissed and render the pharisees speechless and could have just escape from death from the cross but He did not. Why? Because despite His divine powers and abilities, He understood His role on earth - to die for the sins of men.  Thus Paul is admonishing women to be the same - to understand the role of a helper of men - to help men in the leadership of the church and women who do this - like Jesus did - understands her role and like Jesus though full of abilities but yet willing to submit.<br><br>So, I hope you will not be misled to think that the order of the church is an order that says God says women is lesser.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>she was ''marketed" as a pastor, THEN she said recently that she wasnt one. then kong (her husband, founder of church) and other pple excused and explained it away with the definition of pastor which is kinda wider these days. to add credibility, trinity theological college issued a statement which supported theirs as well, that 'pastor' [the term] doesn't have to refer to someone who speaks from the pulpit, does baptism stuff etc these days. and taiwanese still interpret the term as such, so they stopped calling her pastor.<br><br>1) Many pple still hold more conservative ideas abt pastors and church, and i've never heard abt the widening of the scope of this term, funny that we hear about it only when controversy arises. i find that really doubtful, that we can just change or adapt the definition of the supposed head(s) of a church as and when we like, to keep up with changing times. call me a fogey, fossil, whatever-it just doesn't feel too right to change terms to suit our own ends. first you didn't bother to change yin yue mu shi (music pastor) bit on your album because your "mandarin is too bad", then you claim that you aren't a pastor. HUH?<br><br>2) 'When Asian-American Lucy Liu wore even more revealing clothes in the movie Charlie's Angels, it hardly raised any eyebrows among Singaporeans.' -Rev Kong Hee<br>he seems to miss the point that this isn't just about hollywood and clothes. heck, lucy liu, coco lee and everyone in asia can dress as revealingly as they want. he is simply evading the fact that as "the church's music director and leading counsellor", it is entirely disgraceful for her to set such inappropriate example to dress as such. is there really a need to attract media attention with the "slinky red dress"?<br><br>There is a verse that says that women should dress modestly and clothe themselves in virtues etc. can't find it now. they have conveniently neglected her role as a pastor in the church in view of her "cross over to the American pop market". He has failed to address the controversy that arose from her dressing and statements that show an obvious clash in Christian values (that a pastor should possess) and worldly values (in dressing whichever way one likes, and chasing fame and money internationally). for goodness sake, lucy liu is not a pastor, why should her dressing "raise any eyebrows among Singaporeans?"<br><br>he was quick to point out that "his office has been inundated with e-mail and letters by Singaporeans, encouraging Sun to ignore the critics and keep doing Singapore proud in the international scene." this is not as simple as sun yanzi doing singapore proud internationally, the media is zeroing in on HER ROLE AS PASTOR.<br><br>i am surprised that he refered to the naysayers as "people do vote with their feet". from all appearances, an overly defensive stand is taken against those who fail to show support and raise their concerns over what Miss Ho is doing. Rev Kong, 39, said he would 'never force my members to support her singing career against their will'. why then, is "the church play(ing) her music videos before the services"? isn't that an avenue of garnering more support and fans for her singing? i'm sure there is no coercion involved, but as far as i can remember, City Harvest places great emphasis on fellowship and support of fellow brothers and sisters, which one would suspect, is naturally extended to supporting a Pastor on her singing career.<br><br>He added: 'We can't please everyone and people do vote with their feet. So, if there is a philosophical difference in our world view and the way we do things in City Harvest, they would leave.<br><br>'What's good is that we have 400-over wonderful churches to choose from in Singapore, and they should settle into a church that they feel comfortable in.'<br><br>the implication in this statement is that surely the church does not need members who do not support them, they should leave if they do not feel comfortable with such controversy. i wholly agree with that, since they can afford to do so with a whopping congregation of 15,000 members.<br>however, what about the image they are projecting to the world out there, especially the unsaved? isn't evangelism by lifestyle a large part of Christianity, to save the lost? is such adverse media attention necessary? there is scant mention of God in their statements, which are oblivious of the bad press all this is are generating. how are Christians, or City Harvest members supposed to explain or provide satisfactory answers to the doubts that their friends might raise? so far there seems to be no mention of that, and the focus seems to be Ms Ho's ambition to make it to Hollywood.<br><br>one wonders if all this media attention is a bid to raise popularity, since she hadn't protested since she came into the music scene as a pastor. surely that has contributed to her being propelled her to fame.'There are a lot of pastors with part- time secular careers. Even the great Apostle Paul of the Bible was a tent-maker.'<br>1) there is nothing wrong with having a secular career, but not when it appears to compromise on spirituality and the image one is portraying to the world. there is little logic in bringing up the great Apostle Paul, since he does not seem to have generated such bad press in his, er, tent-making days. by this analogy, he might as well bring up that Jesus was a carpenter's son, or a carpenter.<br><br>finally, i would just like to clarify that despite the strong tone of this post that appears to be a personal attack, i am aware that one has no right to judge another's spirituality since Christianity is a personal relationship with God. Despite this, one ought to watch one's actions (which includes dress sense), behaviour and speech, since all this might lead another brother or sister to stumble, which is the last thing any Christian would want.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>abt the Bible discriminating women, that is a claim that is obviously skewed and cannot be condoned. I know that the Old Testament seems to imply that, but pls remember that Jesus was sent to die for all of us, if women were unworthy, He would not have sent Jesus to die for women as well, only men. Does that make sense to you?<br><br>Also, with His death and resurrection, a new covenant has been set up, I believe, so yup.the Bible does not discriminate against women, since that would mean that God is a MCP.
