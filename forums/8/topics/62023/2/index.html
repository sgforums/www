            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by blue_kelvinsg:</div><div class="quote_body">From friends who had clarified with me, I would conclude that the songs she sang and produced are non-Christian songs. In fact, I don't think HYS intend to produce Gospel songs or even contemporary christian music such as Jars of Clay, SonicFlood etc.. However, if we are observant enough, we can note that her songs are written and targetted to the depressed and lonely people. (The title of her latest album will evidently suggest my point) HYS once commented that she hoped for her songs to bring hope to people who listens to them. This is subjective to every individual, therefore some people liked her songs while some do not. On top of that, HYS would practise altar call each time she ends her concert. I guess that is when her Christian practice comes into the picture.<br><br>Let's take a look at Stacie Orrico. Maybe you'll be bedazzled if I am to tell you now that she's also a Christian singer, almost quite similar to HYS. Her top hit "more to life" is somehow likewise identical to HYS's music.<br><br>My point here is simple. Their music may not be totally christian from what the artistes would probably have claimed to be. But we can take a step further to understand the intention and the outcome of it before we lay a judgement.<br><br>My two cents worth =)</div></blockquote>agree....the intention counts. but also one need to present him/herself in a manner that is in line with the biblical teachings and image if the person wants people to listen and convinced of what he preach.<br><br>i read the Holy Bible, not the Holly Bible.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not going to defend her nor criticise her. By criticising her, we are making judgements on her.  But by defending her, we are also judging her, aint it? Its just a matter whether you are gonna pass or fail her by ur perceptions and judgements.<br><br>I am a musician. I am a christian. I am a christian who happens to be a musician who is also a sales executive, also a son to my parents and a brother and friends to many.  When I play with my band, our direction is clear. We are christians but doesnt mean we need to put Jesus in every song or every song must have explicit christian teachings in it.  We sing abt everything.  Abt the Bosnian war, abt the insatiable hunger for power in men, about simple things like our struggles with our lives, or even thoughts of killing ourselves.  Thru these songs, we are fully aware that it does not convey anything abt Jesus but its really thru our off-stage persona, how we interact with people and what we say on stage and off stage that will really make a difference.  Our songs are just but a mean to an end not an end by itself. Understand?<br><br>So I think HYS hopes her songs could be a mean to an end, which is to bring more pple to Christ but of cos, people are debating is she really leading people that way? That I have to agree is still pretty debatable, but hey everyone needs a chance, isnt it?</div>
