              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Currently need some advice. I am graduating from poly this year and my cumulative gpa is 3.9+. I am currently 23 years old and have done my NS.</p>
              <p><br>I have two options to do a private degree which takes 1 year, and another option to take a degree at NUS/SMU/NTU. I am more inclined to finish up a private degree, and then follow up with a Masters at SMU. SMU has noted that this private degree is recognized in their intake for Masters.<br><br>I do not want to waste too much time on a 4 years degree cost.</p>
              <p>Is there anything to watch out when if I do take this move?</p>
              <p>Hope someone experienced can enlighten..</p>

              <p>I do have an option to enter it, quite ironic that having more choices now is actually giving me a headache.</p>
              <p>Just feel that at times what I am going to do at uni level is quite similar to poly level, and if I can move fast to Masters with this private degree, why not?</p>

              <p>Verify with SMU first if the degree entrance is the real deal or not 
              (i.e. Scully you have to be actually be in that university physically taking 
              that degree and not through local private institution, etc)</p>
              <p>Things
               to note on private degree is their modules track and their quality. 
              Although you may be taught here but your exam papers might be flown to 
              the actual Uni for marking. In that case, your grade is based on the Uni
               Professor grading and not through ur local assessment. Hence if your educator 
              here is f**k up, you can get screwed easily so do take note.</p>
              <p>If 
              you must, try to see if you can take via well established private 
              educators. First, they are less likely to fold. Second, their modules 
              are more structured where there are classes, do note there are some 
              private schools that organised their classes differently where you have 
              to do a lot of "self learning". So if you are the kind that cannot 
              self-discipline, you are going to have a hard time.</p>
              <p>Lastly, you have to weigh your odds, what if you get the private 
              degree and you can't get into SMU Masters? Find out their acceptance stats and 
              their class size, if the class size is small your chances are diminished
               rapidly because you are not only competing with ppl like yourself, you 
              also have ppl who have degrees from the local Uni trying to get in also.</p>
              <p>I do not know ur background so I am giving my 2 cents from a 
              Engineering/science perspective, Uni is going to be totally different, example,
              there are some course in Uni that are finish in one semester that covers
               2  or more years of work in poly. And Uni (in general) tends not to practice poly system of 
              "I feed you everything, you vomit everything in exams" approach, testing
               modal are usually focus on seeing if you have understood hence you get a
               lot of "thinking questions" even in labs practical, etc.</p>
              <p>You 
              have to judge for yourself how much is needed for your plan study, the 
              key idea here is dun disadvantage yourself by choosing a shorter route. 
              You have to dig a lot of information here before you can make a better 
              judgement.</p>

              <p>actually, it can be explained why he can complete a private degree in 1 yr.</p>
              <p>Most UK degrees are completed in 2 years, w/o honours.</p>
              <p>taking into consideration of 1yr exemption due to poly background, it is possible to complete the said degree in 1yr.</p>
              <p>But, TS, something to be noted.Does the private degree confers you with honours?</p>
              <p>to get into any masters class, excluding MBA, they will be looking at Second Upper class honours, or its equivalent. a mere pass degree might not be to your advantage if you cannot eventually make the cut to ur desire smu masters course</p>

              <p>hi keneal,</p>
              <p>my question would be are you sure you will stick to doing a masters at smu and that you can get the necessary grades to enter? </p>
              <p>There are alot of variable factors from your poly graduation to your uni graduation(regardless of private or local). Usually people decide to do a masters only after they are close to undergrad graduation or with a few working years experience. There are people who decide that masters is not their cup of tea at the end. Oh having a master degree only matters if its relevant to your future career.</p>
              <p>cheers</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p><br>@deathmaster: You are correct, I was told that the university - University of Glamorgan - helped to setup TP's IT courses. They are clear with what the Singapore polytechnics offer to students and they offer a 1-year course to get a degree. Depending on the grades, you might be able to get an honours in an additional 6 months on top of that 1 year.</p>
              <p>@octega: Thanks for your reply too. Your points are valid and to be considered.</p>
              <p>Thanks for all your replies.They are all very helpful in my deliberation of choices - I will most likely apply to join SMU and see what happens after that..</p>
