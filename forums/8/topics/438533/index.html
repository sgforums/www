              <p>For Singpost, even if you make effort to call their hot line that no one will be at home on that day to deliver the item, they won't bother. They will advise that the post man will leave a delivery notice on your door step, and you make another arrangement for item re deliver or for item to pick up at post ofice. Efficient?</p>
              <p>As for DHL, they will call you prior their attempt delivery. And you are free to arrange or a more suitable time slot. And they delivery during 1900h~2100h as well.</p>

              <p>I am comparing vpost and hopshopgo services.They are apple and apple. Vpost using speedpost whilst hopshopgo using dhl for local courier. I am not comparing vpost and hopshopgo. I am comparing singpost [speedpost] and dhl sevices in my earlier comments. If you want me to compare vpost and hopshopgo, that's another disapointed service offered by Singpost. There are indeed aot of rooms for improvements for singpost. And please stop those 'handphone, mp3 players' sales at post office. Wondering how much revenue they bring, and how much agonies they bring to queuing at the counter.</p>

              <p>well basically in my experience i used both singpost registered mail and DHL overseas mailing services before, to be honest, i really never met any hiccups.</p>
              <p>some singaporeans studying overseas tend to mail their items back to singapore every few months as stuffs will accumulate with time and the flight baggage is limited at 30kg. i guess u must be one of them since u paid $400 for DHL.</p>
              <p>just wanted to ask, didnt the post office provide u with a website where u can login and track your parcel?</p>
              <p>my experience last time when i use DHL from singapore to overseas, the post office gave me a site for me to track my parcel. and the site is updated promptly. so i did not have any hassle.</p>
              <p>oh by the way, did u fill in the particulars legibly? do u know that (other than the destination address) u must write the receiver's phone number on the parcel too?? it is a MUST for all DHL mails..</p>
              <p>the reason why DHL is so expensive i guess it comes with insurance, so if you didnt receive it, maybe u can call them and demand something??</p>
              <p>as for the $2 or $3 singpost registered mail, yeah they will knock on your door (if u not at home they will put a slip of paper on your doorgrills and u take it to post office to exchange for the package), but the item always comes crumpled. why? because the part timer auntie will pack the envelops like sardines in her basket and strapped it like as if it gona run away... damnn.. and it comes one day after... if not for the DHL local service so exp... anyway u get what u paid lah.</p>

              <p>ohh another thing,</p>
              <p>if you send from overseas to singapore, it means it was passed from the post office where u posted, then to your local post man, CUSTOM CLEARANCE, then to the DHL international courier, CUSTOM CLEARANCE, then to singapore speedpost sorting centre, then to the post office nearest to your house, then to the sg postman.</p>
              <p>so the problem must lies somewhere.. u go check who is it lah... they always say "subjected to custom clearance"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what i do always is that i will write a note on the item/parcel to declare or explain what things it is or what's inside... anyway just a suggestion for u =)</p>

              <p>Great point that you have raised. Since you got use singpost registered mail service before than you will know that they will give you a tracking number that you can check on their singpost website to see the status</p>

              I went to China and took my wedding photos. The company was great and even updated me when my photos and frames will come on Friday or Sat. Hence standby my father to collect the package. It was heavy, hence I felt the 400 SGD or rather 2000RMB was worth it.
              
              However, I was really pissed with DHL's service. The Guy obviously did not wait or bother to ring the bell on Friday. ( I stay in a landed property btw) and I just received a slip. Then when I asked them to redeliver, they never appear and I have to call them to realize that it did not even leave the storage area. 
              
              The manager apologize and mentioned that I was the 5th that night. I have no idea how hard it is too tell a person a range of time and they fly kite on you!!! Especially on a Sat night!!!
              
              He apologized and told me the package will come by 11am on Sunday.
              
              FYI, it did come, but only at 1130am
