            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, i know it's been long time since i posted. was troubled by something and really had no answers to it.. hence decided to ask for opinion in here.<br><br>What will u do if u have a step brother.. who is very ill mannered and spoit by his natural parents.....<br>Recently he is getting onto my granny's and my nerves..<br><br>He's 4 this year, but he speaks like a hooligan, threatening to kill or beat us up if we scold him or refuse to let him have something....even though we know he doesnt have the capacity to do that, still it irritates us because of his ill mannerism.<br>He eats like nobody business.. he will want to have a share in whatever we are eating...and it's really irritating when we are eating at the living room, he comes along and swallowing his saliva..and throw temper at us if we dont give him a share of ours.<br>he throws things and litters around the house with his sweet wrappers and toys..... once my granny nearly slipped when she stepped onto a small ball...and i often find ants crawling under my sofa...<br>What is unbearable is that, he will talk back at us.. whenever we have something to say abt his behaviour....<br><br>His natural mum of coz will wack him when we complain abt him, only when we complain...and not so when she herself witness that (when we dont say anything abt it). A few occasions me and my aunt noticed she was actually noticing us when wacking him..to see if we are looking..there's no reason for her to do that.<br>Above all these, he bullies my granny to the max.. asking her to do this and that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> and today, he even ask me to clean his buttocks after he shitted!<br><br>Dont ask me to try to treat him like my own brother...coz i did that before..and it's really a daunting task.. every 5 "good" things i hv taught him during his stay, it will be "corrupted" again when he returns back to his another natural parent over the weekend..and how to teach when one is simply not repent? Maybe he is stil young, but i felt at least the other natural mum who is living with us shld do something abt it.. to facilitate my "teachings"... maybe she thinks her way of teaching is right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>I ever bought assessment/activity books for him..taking my time off after a tiring day to go thru with him....<br><br>We have also another 3 and 4 year old boys in our house. Their behaviour is totally different from he's. and because of his ill mannerism we of coz doted more on these 2 other boys.... and definitely not on trying to discrimate him.<br><br>I needed opinion on how i shld go abt deealing this "problem" child. afterall it's still not totally up to my control, if it is..he's gona get it from me. and i cant do nothing to see him in the house at the expense of me and my granny.</div>
