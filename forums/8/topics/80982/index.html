            <div class='col-md body'>Might I add that some vcds that they sell in proper vcd shops (that sell originals as well) also sell some non-original vcds I think...<br><br>First thing is the casing, if its the very colorful casing (usual is transparent or black right?) with colors either blue, yellow, red etc. then probably is fake (even though the front cover looks real and has the nice "B" "A" grades sticker on them.<br><br>Second, if the casing can be opened, check the CDs to see if near the center of the back of the cd there is an IFPI number imprinted on it. If not, then its probably a fake. For more info on this, go   <a href="http://www.ifpi.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ifpi.org</a>.   But even then, seems that this can be faked too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>One last rule of thumb is to check the prices and casing, if its too good to be true then it probably is. Give allowances though for oldies/lower quality films, cus they may be originals and still sell for a low price  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Learnt all this from my own mistakes... if you may have the idea of wanting your cds to be worth anything or selling your cds in future, best buy originals lo!<br><br>ps: the hubby should wake up his idea la, where got material things more important than wifey one  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
