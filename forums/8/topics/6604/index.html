            <div class='col-md body'>hi leann,<br>i think i'll try to contribute a positive example.<br><br>i am currently going thru LDR too. and funny that you have to mention about how soon your friends met before going having to stay apart. my gf and i went together just 2 months before i flew back to UK. and it's 8 months since we got together. things have been wonderful since. well, there's bound to have quarrels, especially when you try to use ICQ and communicate. the slightest misunderstanding can be blown into a big disaster. then you desperately type and type...but to no avail.<br><br>sure it takes up a lot of energy lor. but you have to perservere if you want to reap the "rewards". ya, you are right to say you cannot be sure if he/she is the one. i guess that's the thing that only you have the answer. SOMETIMES, it's a gamble.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>but the most important thing is to enjoy it while you have it and not worry about the future. if every mail and every call causes you to worry so much about the future, then this LDR will definitely be an arduous one lor. trust and constantly reassure each other of your feelings. be tolerant because the distance apart makes it even more miserable having hurt someone you really love.<br><br>lastly, being alone abroad would tend to make some people a bit emotionally vulnerable (that's why you can see so many couples coming together when they are overseas). can't give you any advice on that  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. just a warning  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LeAnn,<br>So you are the one in SG and he's the one overseas ah? I thought it was the other way round. Well, glad to hear things are going well for you. I guess he must be taking the Easter holidays to go back running into your arms again... Awww... hehe   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. I guess I only have to wish both of you all the best!

I'll try   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. What I can say is that you take one thing at a time. Personally, I do not put much faith in cyber-relationships. I have friends, 2 of them, who also got to know someone over the Net while they are here. To cut the story short, they went back and "reality" hit them. I can't say it will happen to you. If I was in your position, I would wait and see. You don't have to decide now. See how things go when you go back. Another advice is that don't commit yourself unless you are more or less sure of your feelings and that you are willing to put in the effort to start AND maintain a LDR. ya? Decide for yourself, only you have the answers   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by iamsilly (edited 17 March 2000).]</div>
