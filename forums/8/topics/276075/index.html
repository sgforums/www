Every min the machine idle, it cost the company alot of money... And as the wafer gets bigger and bigger, the market price of the chips drops more and more... So, in order for it to survive, they need to cut cost... And that is where process engineers' job are...

            <div class='col-md body'>i've been in semicon industry for a few yrs...and wat has been discussed in here is pretty much true..it's a VERY high stress job and u will be contacted often if problems happen in the line concerning ur device-expertise..frankly, not to answer the call is not preferable as it would heavily reflect on ur responsibility nature..and of coz, u'll pass the work to others which is not good for ur collegue-collegue relationship<br><br>pay-wise is also true, slightly higher as compared to other field (heavily dependant on ur past experiences and of course the company itself)..bonus is always not guaranteed as it is dependant on the fab's profit or worst losses..<br><br>job nature of a process engr is of course dependant on the module that u will work in e.g. photo, etch, diffusion, impant etc..each module is unique and the most high-stress module will be etch because all process goes thru etch..but generally u will be responsible for all the decision-making if wafer is fit for the next recipe to be run...sounds simple right? but again, u must know wat is the implications of ur actions...immediate termination due to error in decision making are often heard in this industry as a mis-process wafers will result in bad yield thus losses..<br><br>btw, juz curious, which fab are u applying at?</div>

Highly stress?<br><br>As for the bonus, what is the highest you received and what is the lowest  you received?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I have been in the industry for abt a year already.<br><br>Semiconductor industry is a tough industry and once u are in...U can kiss all ur free time gd bye..<br><br>As the fab runs 24/7, everytime something crops up... almost everyone will get called up especially if u are a senior engineer and the problem occurs in ur process...<br><br>There are many different kind of positions so depending on wat post u hold...the responsibilities differs..<br>Those fresh into the industry usually will be working rotating 12-hr shifts and once u are senior enough... U will revert back to normal 8-hr shift...<br><br>As the industry is tough... Many people left the industry completely after a few years... tat is why EDB is offering all Final Year Graduates in NUS and NTU, specialising in MICROELECTRONICS, a monthly scholarship of up to 1 K a mth, so as to entice graduates to join..<br><br>Poly grads usually become engr asst while uni grads usually will become Equipment or Process Engr... Those with Microelectronics specialisation or with semicon background will usually become either Process Intergration, Device or Yield Enhancement engr... Bascially those with semicon background have more job options...<br><br>Paywise, relative to all engineering pay, it is slightly higher but if u compare to the financial fields, the financial fields pays way better...<br><br>OT pay will usually be given and one can stand to earn up to 6K a mth taking into consideration the OT hrs and the shift allowance... That is also dependent on which fabs u are in....<br>Currently these are the main fabs in Spore,<br>1) SSMC<br>2) UMC<br>3) Chartered<br>4) TECH<br>5) STMicroelectronics<br>6) Hitachi Semicon<br>7) Qimonda (coming up)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Intel-Micron Flash (coming up)<br>9) Soitec (Coming up)<br>10) Siltronic<br>11) Samsung Siltronic (Coming up)<br><br>Ideally, u can join the semicon equipment vendors as Field Service / Applications engr... Paywise is slightly higher but more stressful and hectic...<br><br>In short, Semicon industry is similar to the financial sector as everyone is hopping from 1 fab to another so as to get higher pay... and it is pretty small... Long termwise, it is a stable industry at least for the next 10 years till all fabs shift their manufacturing to lower cost China...<br><br>If u are solely just interesting in making money.... Join Keppel Shipyard lah as they pay way better dur to their 10 mth bonus a year... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
