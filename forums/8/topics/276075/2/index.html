It is a money spinner but it also leads the way of downspiralling when the economy hits low. That is one of the reasons why Philips divested 80% of its semicon business, a very huge business and a big player in the industry, which is now called NXP for 8 billion euros.

U will revert back to normal 8-hr shift...<br><br>As the industry is tough... Many people left the industry completely after a few years... tat is why EDB is offering all Final Year Graduates in NUS and NTU, specialising in MICROELECTRONICS, a monthly scholarship of up to 1 K a mth, so as to entice graduates to join..<br><br>Poly grads usually become engr asst while uni grads usually will become Equipment or Process Engr... Those with Microelectronics specialisation or with semicon background will usually become either Process Intergration, Device or Yield Enhancement engr... Bascially those with semicon background have more job options...<br><br>Paywise, relative to all engineering pay, it is slightly higher but if u compare to the financial fields, the financial fields pays way better...<br><br>OT pay will usually be given and one can stand to earn up to 6K a mth taking into consideration the OT hrs and the shift allowance... That is also dependent on which fabs u are in....<br>Currently these are the main fabs in Spore,<br>1) SSMC<br>2) UMC<br>3) Chartered<br>4) TECH<br>5) STMicroelectronics<br>6) Hitachi Semicon<br>7) Qimonda (coming up)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Intel-Micron Flash (coming up)<br>9) Soitec (Coming up)<br>10) Siltronic<br>11) Samsung Siltronic (Coming up)<br><br>Ideally, u can join the semicon equipment vendors as Field Service / Applications engr... Paywise is slightly higher but more stressful and hectic...<br><br>In short, Semicon industry is similar to the financial sector as everyone is hopping from 1 fab to another so as to get higher pay... and it is pretty small... Long termwise, it is a stable industry at least for the next 10 years till all fabs shift their manufacturing to lower cost China...<br><br>If u are solely just interesting in making money.... Join Keppel Shipyard lah as they pay way better dur to their 10 mth bonus a year... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div></blockquote>Which fab is paying the highest for fresh grad?</div>
