              <p><br>salary are paid accordingly to qualifications (masters, deg, diploma, A level, O level). It doesnt matter whether you are teaching in a sec school or primary school, two person's STARTING pay will be the same if both have the same education level.</p>

              FirePig is right.
              
              As to any diff btwn 4 yr BA/BSc course vs getting ur own degree (eg. NUS) than taking the NIE Dip Ed only, yes and no. On the surface, it's the same (pay). But obviously, the govt would rather u use ur own money to get ur degree. So teachers who pay for their own degree (eg. NUS) first then take 1 yr Dip Ed in NIE, will have advantages, most importantly being able to teach immediately in a Sec sch or JC. Those taking the 4 yr BA/BSc course will have to start teaching in a Primary school for at least the first few years.
              
              Teaching is a prudent, wise career move, in this cutthroat, unstable economy of today and the future. Even if you cannot earn as much as say, an investment banker or financial analyst, at least with teaching, you need never starve to death for the rest of your life (less likey to be retrenched/fired, though not impossible; and even after you decide to retire/resign from MOE, being a tution teacher will earn you enough to put food on the table).

              <p>i m currently teaching in a primary school...</p>
              <p>will be going to NIE this july...</p>
              <p>it is not an easy job...most people have this illusion that it is...after all you are just dealing with little kids, how difficult can it be?</p>
              <p>teaching here is not just about pure teaching, there are a lot of other stuff involved, even at the primary school level. School ends at 1pm but most of the time I stayed on until 5pm or even later. Very seldom I can go back before 5pm. And you need to be in school by 7am, sometimes even earlier to finish up your workload. So more often than not, it is a twelve working hours per day.</p>
              <p>It is of course rewarding in its own way, funny how a badly drawn card by your seven or eight year old kids can cheer you up so much after a bad day at work :) But unless you have a deep passion for teaching and able to keep calm in stressful situation, do try it out first before going in. Best way to try out is to become a contract teacher first, then if you think you can handle the stress, then sign the bond and go on to study in NIE.</p>
              <p>The pay for ladies is 2.5k if you have a degree :)</p>

              <p>i admire the teaching profession, partly because of the stable pay it offers, and the other advantages it offers, example mingling with the students and being able to learn new things all the time.</p>
              <p>but to be honest, it can get pretty stressful when u have to deal with rowdy kids .But if you have the capabilities and the patience to turn them around , it's much more rewarding and fulfilling as u have the ability to change young minds.</p>

              Just posted on HWZ forum a min ago here ( http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/showthread.php?p=30213853 )
              
              MOE/NIE application interview is like any other corporate company interview - don't expect it to be any easier or any more difficult than interviewing for a investment banking or financial analyst position. Nowadays although the attrition rate (ie. resignation rate) is at an all time high, but competition to apply into teaching is also at an all time high (overall, supply still exceed demand). This includes a rapidly growing group of professionals looking for a mid-career switch into teaching. So if your interview cockup, don't expect to be successful in your application even if you have honours or masters degree.

              <p>dun think be teacher is easy. pay seems attractive but the workload is not. after teaching still have to be in charge of a particular CCA if u are assigned to and also u think school holiday means teacher also holiday ar? u wait long long. u will still have to come back school  and prepare for the next term or semester, but u still can clear a few days leave during the holiday period la.</p>
              <p>and also if u are assigned to a class where the students grades are below average, good luck to u! if the student grades nv improve, den question will be asked on how u teach the students one.</p>
              <p>i working in pri sch now and hear so many stories from the teachers. so dun be a teacher hastily just for the sake of money.</p>

              <p>cos teachers dont need to entertain clients. Once they are married, they start to not bother about their looks as all day long, they are just dealing with kids. So in the end, a banker is actually more concerned about their looks and so they tend to maintain better as well.</p>

              <p><br>depends which school you are in. I know there are some schools who actually send their teachers for image consultation sessions with professional image consultants to maintain their looks of "professionalism" in school. The session will teach them how to dress, how to walk and even how to put on their make up.</p>
              <p>If you are wondering what are all that for, it is because teachers need to meet "clients" too-the parents.</p>
