Remember the late president Ong Teng Cheong? When the cancer first started, it progressed so slowly that no treatment was necessary initially, but eventually it progressed and finally killed him. In fact, low grade lymphoma such as small lymphocytic lymphoma was excluded from some 'critical illness insurance policies'. I saw one many years ago...the policy included cancer but the small print included some exceptions...skin cancer and small lymphocytic lymphoma were not covered.<br><br>Breas_t cancer is potentially curable if detected early.
