            <div class='col-md body'>Just found this article on the internet (some mail-order bride site) written by an American guy.  He brings forward his points on why Asian women like American men.<br><br>Some excerpts.....<br><br>"Women from Asia are gentle. They don't bust your chops, when you are home a little late, or forget an anniversary"<br><br>"Women from Asia appreciate a gentleman. These women do not scold you, and call you a male chauvinist when you hold open a door for them."<br><br>"Women from Asia appreciate the way western men treat their women. Asian men have bad track records for the way they treat their women. They expect their women to serve them, to carry the heavy bags, to walk behind, to take orders from him, his son, and his mother. Western men, especially American men have very good reputations. We are world famous for treating women with respect and consideration."<br><br>Click <a href="http://www.heart-of-asia.com/gen/whyasia.html" rel="nofollow"><strong><span style="color: red;">HERE</span></strong></a> for the full article.<br><br>This guy is trying to sell some matchmaking services, so its understandable that he's exaggerating a bit, etc.  In doing so, he seemed to not only put Asian men down, but also Asian and western women.  Its frightening to think that some of his customer may have the same mentality as he does....and they come looking to marry some demure slave.<br><br>For your reading pleasure only....don't turn this into a male-bashing or female-bashing thread ok?  Good boys and girls.....Down! Down! Sit! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Lastly, please don't ask me what I was doing surfing mail-order women websites ok? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
