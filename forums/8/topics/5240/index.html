            <div class='col-md body'>This question has been in my mind for some time.<br><br>As i see young kids today being influneced by the media , the kind of people they hang around with and etc. , I notice that some people are prone to use vulgarities and swearing, with a rebellious attitude to their parents or good friends and or teachers, not having a correct conscience and etc.<br><br>Some people do it because they feel like doing it, or some feels that this is how everyone on the world is like and they don't want to be left out in what is so called " The World Standards Today." And more and more people have wicked intentions in their hearts. I m not saying majority are like this. But soon there will be more severe cases like this. So , people , tell me how you feel about this topic ? ^ ^</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reminds me of a college essay I wrote yesterday...*grin*<br><br>According to Crime statistics, young people are more likely to commit crimes now than in the previous part of the 20th century; shoplifting, rioting, gang activities, drug abuse, even murder and rape have been committed by offenders below the age of twenty-one. Some of the most heart-wrenching and jading cases that I have encountered include the rape of a young girl by a pre-adolescent of eleven, and the shocking mass murder by the Â‘Trenchcoat MafiaÂ’ of their fellow schoolmates, exhibiting not only deep-set racial and religious prejudices, but also a frightening familiarity with the art of war through their ease with planning a military assault and expert marksmanship.<br>These young people have allegedly been adversely affected by media which was explicitly sexual or violent in nature; by this I refer to the availability of the type of shows on television, and also the disturbing computer and console games like Doom whose themes revolve around murder and mayhem. Is it because such materials are more easily obtained during this generation, or are we more susceptible to such negative influences?<br><br>Yes it does matter deeply if we blindly follow what everyone else is doing.<br><br>but influence?<br>that depends on the kind of influence, we may be spurred to do differently, since we have seen such disastrous results; we may also have a serious problem of an inability to learn from others' mistakes, thus we do as they do.<br><br>one thing for the followers.....<br>*BaaaaAaaAaaaaaaaaaaa*<br>SheEp geT KiLLeD and EatEn....are u sure u WanT to bE onE?<br><br>------------------<br>*************************Mean what you say and say what you mean.<br>@--}--------}------------<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>everyone wants to fit in. not just within society, but all of us want a "clique" of our own, a place where we belong, and never have to wonder. does anyone truly want to be an outcast?<br><br>but, there are people out there, who refuse to conform... because? simply to be different. in a sense, aint that conforming as well? to society's ideas of what's cool.. and what's not?<br><br>there are a lot of things out there that has the potential to influence us. but, the thing is, it's still up to you. a lot of christian churchs go around expounding the negative sides of mass media. do you know what their solution is? dont be exposed to it at all. i honestly find that very dumb, and narrowminded. what gets me even angrier, is that people actually buy this crap! human beings have this thing, called FREE WILL. we have the ability to THINK and make CONSCIOUS decisions... we can analyse situations, and CHOOSE the best option. for example, peer pressure. yeah, it may be there, but must you conform? do you have to succumb simply because it's there?<br><br>mass media, simply reflects our life. burrowing your head in the side like a freakin ostrich, would not do a thing. you can pretend it doesnt exist.. you can pretend it doesnt happen. but the key word there is? PRETEND. such things do happen.. such things do exist. simply ignoring it would not make it go away. to me, the main thing is education. let kids know about such stuff since they're young, and desensitise them to the "cool factor" of such crap. let them know what's right and what's wrong, inculcate the proper moral values, and let them know about the perils of living in the 21st century. then let them loose.. and let THEM make their own decisions.<br><br>im sick and tired of people pushing the blame to everything and everyone.. except yourself. if you go bad, if you start smoking, drinking, getting into fights... it's your fault. unless you're retarded, unless you're a lil kid of five, stop blaming the world. they may put the gun in your hand, but in the end, it's you who has to pull the trigger.<br><br>[This message has been edited by ataraxia (edited 07-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>woah, way to go atar!  u r definitely right tat people (above the age of 12 anyway!) have  to be responsible for their own doings.  man, we can't go around whining and blaming people for stuff that we did &amp; which we know deep down that its our fault.<br><br>the mass media ..... well, we can't deny that it is a big influence on our everyday lives. its up to our own selves to filter out what information should be allowed to influence us.  but again, our actions taken becoz of this influence should be purely our responsibility.<br><br>one cannot get influenced unless one wants to be.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like it is based on freewill to choose and be responsible for the older people who develop a mature thinking of making choices.<br>The younger ones which have yet to have to be taught carefully about things.<br><br>Mass Media may be easy to filter at 1st sight. But what if they are being exposed to it for a long time. Will they be able to sense anything wrong at that time? Take note that it is not just Mass Media that can be of influence. There are many other types.<br><br>Of course NO ONE is to blame any others for bad influence. But bad influence can come to a unwary vitcim at times not known to him/her.<br><br>Man may have the freewill to choose. But they are of course vulnerable to temptations.<br>Will anyone will stand still in the face of temptation ? He will succumb beneath it. So what if people feels that ignoring the existence of worldly influence is being narrowed-minded and lame ? Or if pretending that it isn't there is just gabbage ?<br><br>Okay, simply put this way , what is the people interested in world standards? Sex ? Violence ? Money ? Entertainment ? Not many may notice it , but mass media has slowly having the 1st 3 factors in.<br><br>Clearing this up. Everyone has some sort of feeling that they feel secure if they are in groups. Even if it takes he/she to do what the group does. And of course , it is not innocent, it is being newbie and attempting to settle down with the group quickly. Although it is mainly the choices one makes, it also takes feelings , stress , conscience and any psychogically factors that aids the decision making. Yes, the world and anyone else is not to blame. But by rights, if one feels that what the world is doing is not right &lt; Like what Christians think &gt;, it is better to FLEE from temptations which spews from the world. I don't about the others who reply. And who ever who makes the mess is not to be blame unless it is intentional or never bother to fix it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It has to do with the search for the self and his/her placement in society or the world around them.  In the process they go through different phases, looks, and attitudes until they find the thing that fits them or find that they fit it.<br><br>Many do not find it and go through a long process that leads to a lot of self destruction and creates tension within their society or within themselves or families.<br><br>In this day and age, humanity is beginning to realises that the individual is important.  In the past, the individual was pretty insignificant...especially as asians we feel this.  We have moved to a new level of consciousness and now our children are experimenting with the fruits of that knowledge attained....That's all there is to it...and since parents aren't willing to properly spend quality time to teach their children properly, then they find whatever source of education that they can connect with....ie media...etc...<br><br>" In the beginning of a man's existence when he is innoccent...when he sees a tree in a field, the tree is just a tree...<br><br>In the second state of man's existence, when he becomes experienced and knowledgable...when he sees a tree in a field, he realises that the tree doesn't have to be a tree and can be whatever he so chooses it to be...<br><br>And in the last stage of man's existence when he has attained enlightenment or nirvana...When he sees a tree in the field, he realises that the tree is just a tree."<br><br>Sorry, feeling very Philosophical at the moment and so this post is very idealogical but it oes have it's meanings behind it...<br><br>Our children are living in the second stage which we and our ancestors have so prepared throughout history before we as a human race attain the third and final stage of enlightenment.<br><br>ahhh...no I'm not religious, but maybe I believe this hah...</div>
