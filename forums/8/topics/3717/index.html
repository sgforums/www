            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>After much thought, I have decided to put forward my theory of classifying women. You can refer to creative corner for the poem. I would make two disclaimers : first, my model is not by anyway, making a personal attack on any women, and second, I am merely presenting my theory. All you guys out there, if you have a better model than me (particularly, my best intellectual sparring partner, Terence), feel free to join in this discussion. As for the ladies, particularly the goddess of Love, Rinoa, Mayar, Lex, my honorable opponent Colette and many other ladies, your criticisms are equally welcome, but be prepared to be refuted and not get into any personal attacks.<br><br>In my own classification scheme, basically, the women which I encountered are three types 1)Women who do not understand and accept me.<br>2)Women who do understand and do not accept me.<br>3)Women who accept me and do not understand me.<br><br>I have to use "me" for a reference to a guy. How does the theory work? It does not require you to have any inherent features built on a women, i.e. you don't need to impose any conditions on them, because they would fall in certain categories by this theory of mine.<br><br>On the first type, the women who do not understand and accept "me", these women are generally pretty (and can be intelligent at times) and sometimes appear bimbotic. They do not care about the feelings of other guys, because they have so many guys after them that they do not care. they are good heartbreakers, and would make a guy go thru all lengths and waves to do something which they desired. Sometimes, their bfs are hunks. Of course, they are either prom queens or the chio-bus. Otherwise, they have very good dress sense. They have no regard for worldly affairs, consider people with slightly more knowledge as "cheem" people and would never in the right mind, want these guys with more intelligence..<br><br>The second category of women are those who can understand and cannot accept "me". Of course, the thing about these women is that they are generally nice, sensitive to people's needs and feelings. They need not necessariy be intelligent or be well-versed in worldly affairs, but at least, they have the patience and look beyond the surface to see what is the internal beauty of the guy. They can be pretty or average looking. However, the greatest problem with this class of women, is that they can only be platonic friends, and once you crossed the boundary, they would avoid you or give you the famous line "I am sorry, but I think we can only be friends" even though they have understood you in depth. Well, nevertheless, they always have someone in mind, maybe the guy with a long hair and riding a Harley Davidson or someone else who are the "bad" guys. Notice that I use the "bad" guys. Because even though they are nice, they don't like "nice" guys.<br><br>Finally the last class of women, they are generally people who can accept and cannot understand you. Well, of course, they do not bother to understand the person and can get into a r/s easily without thinking. They normally break up fast and always thinking of searching. They can fall between two broad spectrums from being a bimbo to a nice gal, and the whole thing about mature and sensitivity is irrelevant to these class of gals.<br><br>So much about my classification. Meanwhile have fun...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ALLe,<br><br>Well, you are right about that, and you can read the poem version of my model which I wrote 6 years ago. I wrote that as a reply from a female lead in a short story (so far, only Rinoa has taken a preview of this story) which I have written to rebutt the male lead who made the classification.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prodigal, hi.<br>I have a suspicion that I may digress from the topic =)<br><br>...<br>(laff a bit) from my general impression of the two posts, it seems that you're forever fancying girls while girls are forever running away from you.  I've got some questions, maybe can use the answers to build future posts on.  Firstly, what about girls understand you and accept you but you are oblivious to them, are they included in this topic?<br><br>Anyway, is this still in line with your conviction that you may be destined to stay single forever?  Since you are talking about "you", permit me to talk about "me" and if I sound patronizing like the way 'attached' people often do to singles' ears, please forgive me.<br><br>I think women  should be categorized into two big category, the first is those who like you, the other is those who don't care about you and thus they should not be further classified.  Of these women who like you, it's divided again into those who you like and those you don't care about.  As before, the latter are ignored in further classification.  Of those you like and like you, there are two types:  the platonic friends and the one for you.  With the last one if you decide to start a relationship you should be prepared to work at it real hard.<br><br>The above will work if being understanding and worldly wise and all the qualities you are looking for in a mate are prerequisite to enter the category [you fancy them]<br><br>As to whether anyone will ever be in the third category or not, I believe from so many people in the world, in Singapore, in UK, maybe in occassional trips to French, there will be at least one of em.  I mean,..erm, let's get personal here, if ppl attack me on this one I'm gonna. I am okay, I think, not much bimbotic, loyal and understand that relationship needs a lot of work.  My boyfriend isn't bad at all, he clear the tray at fastfood outlets here in singapore because it's not nice to let the aunties clean after us.  The thing is, I don't think I'm rare, too.  There are many girls like me...it's just that...maybe all of them fell to the category of those who escape your notice and thus gone.<br><br>Just chill out, there's no need to classify every woman you meet.  One day when the time and place and person is right, you will suddenly find one sitting on the throne of the queen of your heart.<br><br>------------------<br><a href="http://homepages.go.com/~caruccia/insomnia.html" rel="nofollow">Panjenengan mboten ngertos</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, Rinoa Heartilly,<br><br>Well, I guess, you can hit either the 2nd (can understand and cannot accept) or the 4th category (can understand and accept) if you are the character "Elizabeth" in my story since the lead character shares a lot of my personal thoughts and traits. Well, perhaps, maybe I am more skeptical of internet relationships. I think I can only tell you which category if you ever meet me.<br><br>Well, I find it so "disappointing" (dun worry that I am not so sad that I want to jump into the  river) that Rinoa would not consider a guy like me. Maybe I would put forward another personal opinion. It is likely that my profession would allow me to earn a lot of money in Wall Street later and perhaps, get a lot of fame and fortune, since I have been involved very much in administration now. I would say that the security argument you would give to me is a little unfair. U see, I have made myself a promise that by a certain age like 35, if that someone not appear, then I would remain single forever. I don't see any point, because even if there is someone who is interested in me, I think it is because it is that security which I could give her rather than love. I always believed that true romances are only experienced at this point of life between 16 to 30, and beyond that, it is more of security, because women's expectations becomes lower as they grew older. If someone would to tell me about the security argument, it would perfectly fail because it seems that my love life is inversely proportional to my career. The lesser love in my life, the more successful I become. Yet, deep down in my heart that I still believe that behind every successful man, there is a woman who support him.<br><br>Your points are perhaps valid, and maybe that is unfortunate, maybe you have not understood me in some sense that I would be willing to trade away all the talents, fame and glory of myself away for just the love of one woman. That is a sacrifice which I am willing to make.<br><br>Have a good day, and cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi MayaJade,<br><br>Unfortunately, I wrote this post with no intention of being oblivious to women who know me personally. I was just tabulating and perhaps do a classification for my own amusement years back when I wrote the poem of the model for my friend, who make the same lamentations.<br><br>It is very unlikely, that a woman who understands and accepts me would not be accepted by me. I think most of those normally fall between 2nd and 3rd category. And I am not being patronizing to arguments from you that this model which I proposed speaks of my own conviction of "perhaps I am destined to be single". I think that you have not given substantial argument but merely taking the potshot out of my previous posts.<br>Well, your model works in some sense, but the category who like you, can be broken down into those you like and those you don't like. I would be more inclined to say that it is similar to the case where I have broken down into the understand but not accept and accept but not understand. For example, I can like that someone but I don't think she understood me at all and would go into a r/s, it would be similar to you saying a gal who likes you but you don't go into a r/s because she is not suitable for you.<br><br>I think that with all effects, such a classification is harmless and would not contribute anything to my personal life or anything... The way I see it, as often times, I would say it to people, people are either meant to be together or they are not. Most of the time, you thought you see that there is a potential chance for somebody, then you realize that it was just an illusion, and just move with it..<br><br>One thing I am sure, you are never on the side of giving but on the side of taking, and I think it is very hard for you to comprehend what it is like on the other side of the story. Maybe I am wrong. Perhaps, it is just the way you have delivered it. Not many people are so fortunate. Many people spent half their lives searching and get hurt in the process....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi prodigal,<br><br>This topic of yours is quite funny. Hmm ... still single at 25? That's not that bad for a guy, anyway, you've given yourself till 35, so that's a good ten years of 'looking', you're bound to meet with someone whom you can love &amp; hopefully, she'll love you too.<br><br>Maybe you can tell us what are the traits &amp; qualities you're looking for in a potential partner &amp; we could help you out in letting you know if you're setting impossible standards for yourself.<br><br>I tend to agree with Rinoa Heartilly that maybe there some possible reasons why some great gals tend to run away from you:<br><br>Her point (2): intimidated - you're too smart for your own good. If 85% of the time, you tend to want to discuss 'cheem' topics, it's scary &amp; very taxing on the human brain, you know &amp; sometimes it's a killjoy. The gal may not want to appear ignorant in front of you but to keep up with you - that's ...<br><br>Her point (4): any negative traits that might turn a woman off? Eg: egoism, insensitivity, self-centredness, stinginess, do you like putting people down, love correcting people or simply likes to brag?<br><br>I know I'm going to appear shallow here, but you are presentable looking, right? I'm not saying that you've to be good-looking to get a gf but only a really terrible looking guy would have problems getting a gf.<br><br>Most of the time I believe it's very difficult to get the person of your dreams, usually you have to compromise 'coz the ideal that we have tend to be impossible to find &amp; likely doesn't exists.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Excuse me, I take exception that you wrote that as a woman age, her expectations get lower, there are women who doesn't feel that they are living a wasted life if they don't have a partner. Of course if they have someone to love &amp; someone who loves them, life would be just perfect but even if they don't have a partner yet, life is just as good for them.<br><br>Security (ie financial independence) is an issue these days not only for women but for guys too. How often do we hear of guys wanting to marry down these days? Even if they do, they don't want to marry too far down 'coz that may affect their standard of living. Most of my friends (if they're graduates) marry either fellow graduates or dipolma holders, I've yet to hear of one marrying an 'O' level holder.<br><br>Anyway, you're still young at 25, there's plenty of time for you yet &amp; true love doesn't happen only between 16 to 30, older couples will tell you that. Perhaps passionate love occurs between 16 to 30, true love can occur anytime, it can't be hurried.<br><br>Again best of luck in your search for your life partner.<br><br></div>

'Prodigal' itself as a nick ends with the letters 'gal' just like other nicks like 'Cutegal' or 'sweetgal' or 'hornygal' or 'wetgal'. Your nick is not 'Prodigal Son' or 'Hunky Prodigal' or 'Mr Prodigal' (as i advised you to change it to).<br><br>All your smartassed- go look up the fucking dictionary retorts show only your ignorance and stupidity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prodigal<br><br>I am sorry if it seems that I am taking potshots at you but I think I was merely  being practical.  I think making this classification, yours or mine, is, how should I say it, useless.  You can't go around classifying women into three groups, that's done by cheesy magazines like Cleo and FHM to simplify matters which are not simple.  If it is as you said it just for amusement, then I was mistaken in letting the mood (and the seriousness?) from your other posts influenced what I wrote earlier.  In any case, if you are offended, I apologize because I don't mean to do it and I just want to lift you up from the gloom I thought you're in.<br><br>Really, I do not know what to say anymore.  this categorization is just for amusement?  What about your promise to yourself that you won't get married after 35?  I took it seriously, I think it's a waste to fix deadlines on things that do not inherently have deadlines.<br><br>Finally, I don't have to tell you anything about my personal life.  If you think that I am forever taking and never bother to give, so be it.  I thought you knew better than to say things like that.<br><br>------------------<br><a href="http://homepages.go.com/~caruccia/insomnia.html" rel="nofollow">Panjenengan mboten ngertos</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi colette<br><br>Finally, it's your turn to join the rest of the ladies in being sarcastic to my unfortunate fallibility that I am still single and available. Well, at least, I am still average looking... Maybe Rinoa can give you a better description since she sees my picture.<br><br>Actually, this discussion has turned from a model of a woman to a discussion what I want in a possible partner. I can tell you that my first ex-gf has met all what I looked for, inner beauty and brains, except for her cynicism, and my 2nd ex-gf has nothing which I looked for and I compromised. This whole question of compromise has often come into the picture. I can compromise, yet my 2nd ex-gf still ran away with another bloke.<br><br>Actually, I am beginning to find this discussion very shallow because it has turned into a nitpicking session with people who could suggest sexy names and do not understand how to check the dictionary. I think that the ladies all assumed that I am some ivory towered person who have no other hobbies other than doing my work... I enjoyed ballroom dancing, watching movies, taking photographs and etc... Everyone has a life, and it depends on how you live.<br><br>*sigh*<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear MayaJade,<br><br>The catgorization was meant to be an amusement, and I really in my real life tell myself that if I don't find someone by then, I would choose to remain single. I know that it is senseless to make a deadline, but I still feel that if that person were to come by then, I feel that it's too late. Maybe by then, every part of the diehard-romantic feature of me has died. Like I said it before, true love if not experienced during between 16-30, does not mean anything anymore, because beyond that, the issue would be complicated with a contract of security between the woman and you. Somehow, I envied most of my classmates who have all gotten married recently and have the chance to be a godfather for a child already. Sometimes, they would tell me that I have achieved the most among them, but it turned out that I would just tell them, that is not true, and I think that at least they have someone to be with...<br><br>I would apologize for my tone of saying the things which your personal life does not have. But I put it earlier, that I could be wrong, and maybe you ladies have given me that impression, life is so rosy and bright that we have to wear sunshades. But that also means that there is the other side of the story which you all seriously condemned because you don't experience or see it..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi prodigal,<br><br>Hey, I wasn't being sarcastic at your single state. Sometimes in a post it's just hard to convey a friendly or teasing tone &amp; one can come across as being harsh/sarcastic when that is far from the case. I read in the LDR thread that yours didn't work out, no wonder you sound gloomy sometimes and you're touchy too.<br><br>Yes, I admit that discussing what you're looking for in a partner is far more interesting than categorizing women, I'm just nosy.<br><br>Your first ex-gf cynical? Hmm ... you're getting cynical too. Love after 30 would be complicated by issue of security between the lady &amp; you? Come on, not all woman are out for the guy's money. In a fanasty world, if my bf could be dirt rich, tall, dark &amp; handsome and endowned with all good positive character traits, my life would be heaven on earth. But life is such that no such person will ever exist, so I would have to settle for the possible best. Compromise on certain things but not the fundamentals &amp; everybody's fundamentals are different, you'll have to work out on what you can compromise on &amp; what you can't.<br><br>Falling in love is not an exact science, sometimes, we have an ideal of whom we want for a partner but the person we eventually fall for may be drastically different, I think it all boils down to feelings, it's very hard to describe but I've been told that when it hits you, you'll know. What I am trying to say here is almost the same as MayaJade, why restrict yourself to falling in love before 30 or 35? Sometimes love will come late for some of us which is better than never. Are you trying to say that should you feel deep love &amp; passion for a woman after you turn 35 &amp; she feels the same for you, you won't take the relationship further 'coz you're afraid she'll be going after your money only? Isn't that cutting your nose to spite your face?<br><br>I'm not flaming those who marry young, some of these young couples whom you may envy now may not even stay married a few years down the road, things are unpredictable, especially relationships, they take a lot of hard work.<br><br>Er, you're a die-hard romantic meh? Wow, I sure can't tell from the posts you've post. Mostly you come across as a bit prickly. No sarcasm here, just friendly banter  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> and it's good to know that you have other hobbies besides discussing 'cheem' stuff.<br><br>God bless.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>proddy,<br><br>have you tried refraining from imposing pre-conceived conceptions on the women you meet? perhaps taking them one at the time as individuals, warts and all, might help you see women as people and not potential partners. if you don't see them as potential partners then maybe you won't be so disillusioned?<br><br>anyway, a lot of the advice here is well-meaning but very dangerous. like 'women want security', 'don't want to talk about cheem topics, might feel stupid' etc. if ALL women were like that i'd have turned gay years ago. (and there were a few propositions too i might add). no pal, see women as individuals with untold beauty and horrid faults, see them as they are and learn to deal with that.<br><br>anyway, you're in UK, what variety! what range! what opportunities! i'm off!<br><br>cheers<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 23 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Prodigal,<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by prodigal:<br><br>One thing I am <strong>sure</strong>, you are never on the side of giving but on the side of taking, and I think it is very hard for you to comprehend what it is like on the other side of the story. Maybe I am wrong. Perhaps, it is just the way you have delivered it. Not many people are so fortunate. Many people spent half their lives searching and get hurt in the process....<br><br></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> No, Prodigal, I won't let you get away with saying that it was a very tentative guess.  You were sure that I've lived a rosy life and I did resent that.  Bygones, self righteousness won't get me nowhere and neither will your self pity.<br>Please excuse me again, but I mean well.  So is everyone else though he/she may sound sarcastic and attacking to you.  I do not mind listening to your, dare I put it this way, lamentations but I really do not want to see you wasting away in sorrow when I feel that you can learn to control it.<br><br>I agree that not many people have it easy and find their ideal partners in the early stage of their lives, but does it decide whether it is okay for those to languish about waiting for _the_day_ all the time? It is your right to grief, to keep rubbing the scars and reminiscing about what you were before they happenned and to dwell on the emptiness around you but don't you agree with me that it cannot go all the time until 'the end' at your 35th birthday?<br><br>Nevertheless, it is still your decision.  If you think that what I posted here will not make a whit of difference in your perceptions, then I'll talk about something else next time.<br><br>------------------<br><a href="http://homepages.go.com/~caruccia/insomnia.html" rel="nofollow">Panjenengan mboten ngertos</a></div>
