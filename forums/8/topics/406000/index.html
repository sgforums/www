              <p>Le me start off with what the term GCP means ( Golden cheesepie) , a layman term used by singaporean locals to describe gals who are after money and material comforts from guys</p>
              <p>"Today i asked one golden cheespie why bf must have car,she say because take<br><br>1) public transport is a chore,<br>2) At night can go alot of places,<br>3) can also wear sexy, short skirt or revealing dress go dating,<br>4) can compare with friends' bf's car<br>5) drive bf car when he go reservist.<br>6) Bf can take car to fetch her friends, colleagues and family member around<br>7) Bf can come airport fetch her when she come back from oversea.<br>8) she can sleep sound and assure while bf send her home after a tired day<br>9) Can go east coast park to cycle<br>10) Can bring dog around which public transport doesnt allow<br><br>I also asked her, but if lets say she go orchard shopping, bf park car at PS, then you all shop until far east how? She say her bf will take taxi wif her go PS retrieve car together, or she will sit at starbuck while her bf go back PS take car n fetch her. "<br><br>Personally, i feel she's a pampered bitch, thou she did raise a few gd points, the rest pretty much shows that she is juz treating her bf as a personal chauffeur<br><br>1: Chore? then how u go from ptA to B b4 having ur chauff... oops bf? leopard crawl?<br>2: Agreed, like hotels.. parks.. dark n quiet places...<br>3: huh, lame, bet she wears tt 24/7<br>4: it's his car, not her car, compare for wat fark?<br>5: tt's if he doesnt drive to his camp n park there<br>6: pretty much confirms the chauffeur role her bf is gonna play 4ever<br>7: chauffeur again<br>8: agreed, after pt2, sure tired one...<br>9: no comment on this<br>10: after reading pt1 n 2, i thought tt's what he has being doing all the time?<br><br>wonder how the bf feels if he reads wat she said...<br><br>kinda sounds like my fren thou lolz... except she demands tt u pay for the bill 1st, or u are not a gentleman, but whether she pays her share or not after tt is another thing<br><br>totally, what-the-hell if u ask me have we bred a nation of spoilt princesses</p>
              <p>What is wrong with singaporean females?<br>As a fact i have lived overseas before and the cars cost much less than here in singapore so much that no one even gives a damn</p>
              <p>its fact sgporean gals are brought up in a system where they think<br>they are the best of the lot when in fact they are<br>not. They get brainwashed by glamorous western media and as a result have a "bastardized" thinking. And a conflict happens where western and asian cultures collide. In asian cultures, the man is supposed to take care of the woman but not necessarily in the western countries where they are more independent,the world is big and there are much better looking gals from asia which singaporean guys can marry</p>
              <p>in any case i have had much exposure than many singaporeans have...and in overseas gals are different, they talk , behave and look better too</p>
              <p>Its also a fact that GCP like to go for the Ang Moh. The irony and most laughable matter is these guys are rejected by their own women in their own country and pretty much just the same as local guys.</p>
              <p>The last most important fact in this issue is an increasing number of singaporean men are marrying brides from overseas who are more practical and in many cases look better than local women</p>
              <p>The GCP gals are increasingly being priced out from their own market and is it time they review themselves and realize what they are doing?</p>
              <p>In their quest to chase material wealth, they end up losing the very thing that makes us human, The right to live, and have a family</p>
