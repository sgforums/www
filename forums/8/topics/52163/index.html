            <div class='col-md body'>wat do u think of these 2 articles?<br><br><blockquote><br><br><strong>Govt should rethink hiring of gays </strong><br><br>I AM a heterosexual man, married to a heterosexual woman and we have four heterosexual children. We believe that the right upbringing by parents will prevent improper and deviant future behaviours.<br><br>We also believe in a God who loves both the heterosexual and the gay, but He hates the sin of immorality.<br><br>So now you know where I would stand on the issue of the Government hiring gays for even sensitive jobs ('Govt more open to employing gays now'; ST, July 4). Or is there no more right or wrong regarding the hiring of gays to help govern the country?<br><br>The saying 'Love the sinner, hate the sin' is my guiding principle. I accept a criminal, a gay, a gangster or a hooligan, but I reject his behaviour. Why? Because as human beings we have a conscience to distinguish between what is good and what is bad.<br><br>There is no greyness between white and black. White is white, and black is black. There is no relativity in morality. Morality is absolute. Yet the guiding principle is love.<br><br>So is it morally right to hire gays for key government positions? It would take a perfect government not to hire them as pressure mounts over the years to accept gays in practically any job.<br><br>Our society, including religious groups, has been bending backwards towards tolerance of immoral behaviour. A government that does not appease the wishes of its people may not last long. On the other hand, many people still expect our Government to take sound and responsible action to protect young citizens from the corrupting influence of immoral behaviour.<br><br>I am concerned about the consequences of the Government's action. Firstly, the Government has shown quite clearly by its action that it has lost its moral authority.<br><br>Then there are other repercussions: gay leaders will one day advocate gay marriages and, as if to complete the cycle, they will promote the adoption of orphaned children by married gay couples.<br><br>I am concerned for our next generation of children. Will they be able to tell right from wrong? By accepting what the Government is doing now, we are not helping our children to see the corrupting and subtle influences of such a lifestyle.<br><br>I disagree with the Government that people are born that way and hence helpless to change. Gays are never born that way. The law of nature has been that you are either born a male or a female, hence the proper behaviour follows.<br><br>However, because of negative influences in their lives, homosexualism and lesbianism set in and took control of the person's mind, soul and body.<br><br>Most gays are reported to have had a history of being sexually abused when they were children. Others mentioned that they had grown up in homes without a father or father figure and subsequently rejected their own sexual identities. Still others admitted that their attraction to the same sex started when they allowed themselves to be addicted to pornography.<br><br>Yet the person himself still has a choice as to whether to accept or reject this immoral behaviour. Some people may be comfortable with the change in views, but I am not and will continue to educate my children in the right way.<br><br>I am surprised that leaders of religions like Islam and Christianity have not voiced their disagreement openly. These two religions have very strong views about the right behaviours where human sexuality is concerned.<br><br>Religions play an important role in society and it is most ironical and sad that religious leaders are refraining from making their stand known publicly in matters of sexual morality.<br><br>I would like to appeal to the Government to reverse its decision to hire gays for key jobs. History has shown time and again that great empires fell because of failing human values and shaky moral principles. Does the phrase 'the chain is as strong as the weakest link' sound familiar?<br><br>We know that yeast causes dough to rise, so in the recent Sars outbreak its containment depended on not leaving even one virus at large to infect people.<br><br>Likewise, the majority of the public should make known its disapproval of hiring gays for key government jobs. This seemingly harmless action today will not bode well for our children tomorrow.<br><br>GEORGE LIM HENG CHYE<br><br>[quote]<br><br>I AM disturbed by just the thought that gays are ordinary people like you and me. Their sexual orientation is more than just a deviant desire which needs to be corrected, and their lifestyle remains questionable.<br><br>If we accept gays as a sexual minority, then subtly we are telling ourselves and our children that it is acceptable to have sex with the same gender.<br><br>I would encourage gays to rethink the way they live, being man or woman. Getting back to religion or the basics of sex is the right thing to do.<br><br>And, hopefully, they would realise that they have to change. They should not allow themselves to be blinded by other parts of the world where the gay community is accepted, nor jump onto the bandwagon on the pretext of evolution of a country or people's maturity.<br><br>To be blunt, even in the animal kingdom, a tiger will look for a tigress to share their lives together.<br><br>PHIROZE ABDUL RAHMAN<br><br></blockquote>personally dun understand why the first writer insisted on equating homosexuality with immoral behaviour. his views are rather biased. and anyway Govt never said it is hiring gays to top civil service positions, just civil service. furthermore the writer insisted that homosexuality is the result of one's conscious decision, which i totally dun agree. one's upbringing, yes, but how can one be condemned due to his/her upbringing? he/she dun haf a choice how he/she was brought up rite? the same applies for the second writer who also said that sexuality is one's choice.<br><br>come on.. can a straight person say he/she want to be gay and den start to like ppl of the same sex jus like that?!<br><br>views?<br></div>

True..some ppl are 'trapped' to become homosexuals due to poor upbringing, exposure to sexual disorientated stuffs, child abuse or even unforgiveness in his heart. In other words, it can never be considered a person is 'involuntary' to be a gay, he allows it. My stand is clear, not just based on human conscience and also with biblical teaching, homosexuality is not natural (ie. defy God's original plan for sexuality) to put it bluntly, our penis and the female counterparts are created in this manner..never intended for other holes.<br><br>There is nothing wrong to provide livelihood for gays, they are humans and need to live too.

            <div class='col-md body'>I must admit I am very shocked and disappointed in the Government's recent decision.<br><br>I am a Christian and I feel that homosexuality is definately not right. We should not continue to lie to ourselves, saying that it is ok to be homosexual. Whatever your religion is, we all know that the human reproductive system is designed for a man and a woman to come together and reproduce, hence the name "the reproductive system". So isn't it just mere satisfaction of our fleshy desires for a man and another man to have sexual relations? True, the way a person is brought up could be one of the factors that influence the way a person thinks, which means to say that being homosexual is a psychological problem, and IT CAN BE CHANGED! Yes, homosexuality can be changed, I've heard of stories of homosexual men successfully changing their way of thinking and who now lead a normal life with a wife and kids.<br><br>The Government's decision is and will affect our children, giving them the impression that it is ok to be gay/lesbian, cause truth is, it's not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are certain things which has been said and I wish to comment on them.<br><br>First off human sexuality is a contium on a spectrum and not an absolute. Human sexuality is not as maellable as one thinks it is. The cause of one's sexual orientation is not fully known, all that can be concluded from studies and observations is that there are a host of environmental and biological factors involved. Those biological factors may not even need to be genetic in nature. The foetus is so delicate that any abnormally high amounts of certain hormones can screw up the baby's development. This has unfortunately caused some ppl to be transgendered. Meaning they are neither may nor female. Are homosexuals to be faulted for their biological defect and their nuturing environment?<br><br>There are many things not meant to be. God never meant for ppl to be born blind, or lame. Yet these ppl exist. Do u then try to change these ppl or do u accept them?<br><br>Another thing, Sodom was not destroyed for homosexuality. Look at Ezekiel 16:49  'Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy' There is nothing homosexual in their sin. Its the prejudice of the scholars that translated out bible as such and thus we interpret as such.<br><br>I dont believe a homosexual can change. Not on his own accord at any rate. I am gay and Christian. I grew up gay and Christian. Negative influence? I doubt so. Sexually abused? I am not. I asked God why me? Of all the defects and imperfections in this world I have to a homosexual condemned by my OWN brethen in Chuch! Where is the love oh u holier than thou self-righteously straight Christians? I never changed. The same feelings are there. I still wonder what God's plan is for me. So stop saying homosexuals can change.<br><br>Heres the question I want to pose. What of transgendered people? They are neither male nor female yet they are still human with feelings, sexual felings. Would they be morally wrong to engage sex with either gender????? They are not meant to be. So do we deprive them of sexual expression? Most of them wont be able to procreate anyway, so what? Are they wrong? They didnt ask to be the way they are. Should they be faulted?<br>I have no answer maybe the self righteous Christians do.</div>
