            <div class='col-md body'>Cherubim, I'm impressed  by your very defiant reply. I totally agree with everything you have said. You did not choose to be the way you are and most certainly if you had a choice, you would not choose to suffer as such.<br>People who do not understand you are mere bigots with their holier-than-thou mentality. I'm sure you have better things to do than engage with them. Some of my best friends are gay(people say a gay man is a girl's best friend) and they have stood by me in the face of fire. They are most certainly as human as you and I and perhaps even more human than a so-called "straight" man who is a wife-beater or child-abuser.<br>I feel sad that our society has not reached the level of maturity necessary to accept people that are different and who are yearning to be accepted. I know how miserable my gay friends in Singapore are feeling, about wanting to belong to this country and yet made to feel as if they don't belong.<br>To all the gay people in Singapore, I can only wish all of you good luck and strength and courage to fight the rest of the race!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just something to add. I made a mistake with the term transgendered. It should be intersex. Below are a list of definitions<br><br>Intersexed<br>Someone born with both or ambiguous genitalia and/or chromosomes.<br><br>Transgender<br>Someone who does not conform to stereotypical masculine or feminine behavior or appearance.<br><br>Transsexual<br>A male or female who spiritually feels they were born in the wrong body and seeks medical help to change their body to match their spirit.<br><br>Androgynous<br>Someone who appears to have no gender-defining characteristics.<br><br>Gender-Variant or Third-Gender<br>Someone who is either intersexed or transgender and who physically or spiritually exists as both genders simultaneously.<br><br>As you can see, human sexuality is not black and white, yin and yang. You are not either gay or straight. There is a whole spectrum. These people are obviously not the way they are because they chose it, nor is it because they had bad upbring. They are just like that.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Love between gay person to another is natural - the sexual part between a gay person (lesbian/gay) towards another may not be physically natural, however its could be emotionally and spiritually natural. I am using the word 'Natural' because it Love itself exist in another world altogether. (Its own set of rules and such) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Your SOUL and your BODY are two different components that doesn't always blend with one another. Your BODY could be a male this lifetime, but your SOUL has been a female in many past lifetimes. Astrologically speaking, you could have many negative energy in your chart (Afflicted Uranus in 5th and 7th house, Moon Nodes, etc) and when you are born into this world biologically as a male - your life lesson is to learn to be one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Everyone is most comfortable in a mode where you had always been there. Ever realise that during your first day of your school, the first thing you could do in the midst of crowded unfamiliar faces, is to look for someone you know, regardless of how causal this friend could be? This applies to the soul - the soul, having many lifetime as a female, would have this tendancy to revert back to this status this lifetime. The cosmic lesson is to be a guy, because the gay person is born as a guy - however, this is largely depended on your enviroment, psychological and sexual development, inner factors, etc and the subconscious freewill power to execise the new journey in embracing this new BODY.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>People realise that nowadays, there is a significiant number of gays around than previous time; you are wrong. In the past, there are equal number of them as well, just that society back than would kill, harm and hurt these people and fearing for their life made them keep mum about it. The numbers is there - but the mouth and behavior has to be suppressed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The SOUL has its own femaine and masculine energy in it. The attraction would occur when the Law of polarity attracts. Understand why a gay person would probably only fall for another gay person? A butch for example, has abundance of masculine energy in her soul. - She would be attracted to Lesbian (Lots of femaine energy, esp Scorpio, Cancer and queen of them, Pisces) and take a freaking good look at those ladies playing the female role in a lesbian relationship. You will realise that these ladies are very femaine, in behavior and actions. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I am speaking about Gay person having this BODY and SOUL contradiction and adaptation and NOT speaking about ladies going for other ladies because of a failed relationship or superficial situations - Because this would be another post and topic altogether. Bi-sexual are unstable because their SOUL longs for another opposite same frequency SOUL, but probably the development of the BODY brings about positive influence. The chaotic conflicting interest wll bring about Bi-sexual. FROM HERE, they have a choice. To learn to become a proper girl/guy OR to revert back to originality (the SOUL's abundance femaine and masculine energy)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I am not defending gays, rather I am giving reasons why they are like that. People who said they are unnatural, physically - probably yes. In love aspect - No. You can have two gay person attaining true love and even the correct soul partner, however, its VERY difficult I shall say. Astrologically speaking - when you are a Gay person - karmically, this lifetime, there is alot for you to learn. The other thing is that your past karmic relationship with other partners, this lifetime may not be having the same orientation as you. As such you will forge a new identity this lifetime - (law of nature, psychological and biological bodily influence). Some astrological and spiritual influence affects and rejects the new union and that's why Gay relationship are easier to fail. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If you were to say unnatural relationship - would be two soul having pure masculine/femaine energy being with each other. Such thing wouldn't take place as well - the law of polarity and attraction wouldn't take place, a relationship would never be born this way. So if it is not - its natural.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If things are unnatural in the eyes of God, it must be rejected.<br><br>So if its natural, it happens.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> It happens in reality - so do you think its natural?<br><br>P.S: I just wanna throw in my few cents of thoughts; bringing up a couple of points explaining homosexual relationship. Maybe in AA outing can explain more.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers</div>
