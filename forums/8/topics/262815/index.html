            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">PRECAUTION IS BETTER THAN CURE MY FRIENDS...</span><br><br><strong>SCENE 1.</strong><br><br>This is a new one. People sure stay busy trying to cheat us, don't they??<br>A friend went to the local gym and placed his belongings in the<br>locker.After the workout and a shower, he came out, saw the locker open,<br>and thought to himself, "Funny, I thought I locked the locker. Hmmmmm." He<br>dressed and just flipped the wallet to make sure all was in order.<br>Everything looked okay - all cards were in place.<br>A few weeks later his credit card bill came - a whooping bill of $14,000!He<br>called the credit card company and started yelling at them, saying that he<br>did not make the transactions. Customer care<br>personnel verified that there was no mistake in the system and asked if his<br>card had been stolen. "No," he said, but then took out his wallet, pulled<br>out the credit card, and yep - you guessed it - a switch had been made. An<br>expired similar credit card from the same bank was in the wallet.<br>The thief broke into his locker at the gym and switched cards.<br>Verdict:  The credit card issuer said since he did not report the card<br>missing earlier, he would have to pay the amount owed to them. How much did he have to pay for items he did not buy? $9,000! Why were there no calls<br>made to verify the amount swiped? Small amounts rarely trigger a "warning<br>bell" with some credit card companies. It just so happens that all the<br>small amounts added up to big one!<br><br><strong>SCENE 2.</strong><br><br>A man at a local restaurant paid for his meal with his credit card. The<br>bill for the meal came, he signed it, and the waitress folded the receipt<br>and passed the credit card along. Usually, he would just take it<br>and place it in his wallet or pocket. Funny enough, though, he actually<br>took a look at the card and, lo and behold, it was the expired card of<br>another person. He called the waitress and she looked perplexed. She took<br>it back, apologized, and hurried back to the counter under the watchful eye<br>of the man. All the waitress did while walking to the counter was wave the<br>wrong expired card to the counter cashier, and the counter cashier<br>immediately looked down and took out the real card. No exchange of words<br>--- nothing! She took it and came back to the man with an apology.<br>Verdict: Make sure the credit cards in your wallet at yours. Check the name<br>on the card every time you sign for something and/or the card is taken away<br>for even a short period of time. Many people just take back the credit card<br>without even looking at it, "assuming" that it has to be theirs.<br>FOR YOUR OWN SAKE, DEVELOP THE HABIT OF CHECKING YOUR CREDIT CARD<br>EACH TIME IT IS RETURNED TO YOU AFTER A TRANSACTION!<br><br><strong>SCENE 3:</strong> <span style="font-style: italic;">(by the author)</span><br><br>Yesterday I went into a pizza restaurant to pick up an order that I had<br>called in. I paid by using my Visa Check Card which, of course, is linked<br>directly to my checking account. The young man behind the counter took my<br>card, swiped it, then laid it on the counter as he waited for the approval,<br>which is pretty standard procedure. While he waited, he picked up his cell<br>phone and started dialing. I noticed the phone because it is the same model<br>I have, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Then I<br>heard a click that sounded like my phone sounds when I take a picture. He<br>then gave me back my card but kept the phone in his hand as if he was still<br>pressing buttons. Meanwhile, I'm thinking: I wonder what he is taking a<br>picture of, oblivious to what was really going on. It then dawned on me:<br>the only thing there was my credit card, so now I'm paying close attention<br>to what he is doing. He set his phone on the counter, leaving it open.<br>About five seconds later, I heard the chime that tells<br>you that the picture has been saved. Now I'm standing there struggling with<br>the fact that this boy just took a picture of my credit card. Yes, he<br>played it off well, because had we not had the same kind of<br>phone, I probably would never have known what happened. Needless to say, I immediately canceled that card as I was walking out of the pizza parlor.<br>All I am saying is, be aware of your surroundings at all times. Whenever<br>you are using your credit cards, take caution and don't be careless. Notice<br>who is standing near you and what they are doing when you use your card. Be aware of phones because many have a camera phone these days.<br>When you are in a restaurant and the waiter/waitress brings your card and<br>receipt for you to sign, make sure you scratch the number off. Some<br>restaurants are using only the last four digits, but a lot of them are<br>still putting the whole thing on there. I have already been a victim of<br>credit card fraud and, believe me, it is not fun. The truth is that they<br>can get you even when you are careful, but don't make it easy for them.<br>FORWARD THIS TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN THINK OF.<br>LET'S GET THE WORD OUT! JUST BE AWARE.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh a decent topic at last among all the rubbish topics..<br><br>anyway i dont have a CC onli 2 debit card and nets..<br><br>i would prefer if credit cards had a better form of authorization other than the security number and the signature.. both of which can be copied easily<br><br>but i don't think the local government or singapore banks can do much since CCs are controlled by VISA, Master etc.<br><br>Wouldn't it be nice if there was a pin to be entered and verified by a machine terminal like nets on top of the signature?<br><br>or maybe in future signatures must be recorded by the bank, entered into a machine, and a high resolution digital POS machine can verify signature and er.. thumbprint?<br><br>i think thumbprint or fingerprint better..<br><br>haiz<br><br></div>
