            <div class='col-md body'>I was with this girl for 5 years.. we spent all our time together and I really loved her. I was still young I guess but nearing the 5 year mark, I wanted to propose to her. I was planning the usual romantic overtures and all..<br><br>But one day, I called her out and she said that she was tired, so I decided to go swimming. Then about 15 minutes later, I called and found out that she had gone out with her friends.<br><br>I later discovered that she was seeing another guy for sometime already.. and that was the guy she was seeing now. I feel so depressed.. its been 5 years down the road. I have not entirely forgotten her but the bitterness is mainly gone.<br><br>Do you think I should publish all the "secrets" we shared during this time. Maybe it might make me feel better.

            <div class='col-md body'>Whenever a relationship failed, hatred usually takes over us in one way or another. Yes, you may hate her for what she did to you, and after 5 years, that was what you got. But please, never ever do that sort of things. Firstly, that's not a gentleman behaviour. By doing those things, you will hurt her, and only tell people of your nature: childish, immatured and revengeful.<br><br>You don't choose love, love chooses you. If love happens to fly away from you, there is a reason and you will know in time. Accept it openly, tell yourself that you will find someone better who appreciates you more than she does. If you really wish to do that, yes you probably will feel good, have a good laugh, but what's next? Let her be, even though she did this to you, she's still a girl. She probably made a mistake by leaving you, at this point of time, and she doens't realise that. By telling tales will tarnish her image. For a girl, that is very important. What she has done shall NOT degrade the character and integrity of you. Stand up, and move on like a man. This is how a gentleman should do.<br><br>Besides, if you really love her, why would you say such things? Making love is something personal and magical between 2 persons. That is a fact, nothing will change it, not even when breaking up. Cherish the good old memories.<br><br>I repeat myself again, don't do that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am sad about one thing though..even though she was the one who broke off the relationship. I just can't forget the fact that I made a promise to love her forever. I still feel this committment and I would really like her to tell to my face that its okay for me to love someone else.<br><br>In fact, for almost 2 years after we broke up.. I couldn't even bring myself to talk with another girl ( I mean one that I could like ).. I just felt like I was cheating on her. I know this is crazy..eventually I managed to get over the feeling and met the lovely creature I am with.<br><br>Its just that I want to love my girl totally and I feel like its unfair to her that I still feel obligated to my EX. I should say that its not a "feeling" that I am grappling with, more like a promise I made..<br><br>Who knows..maybe I will be able to break my promise eventually without feeling upset over it..<br><br></div>

I was still young I guess but nearing the 5 year mark, I wanted to propose to her. I was planning the usual romantic overtures and all..<br><br>But one day, I called her out and she said that she was tired, so I decided to go swimming. Then about 15 minutes later, I called and found out that she had gone out with her friends.<br><br>I later discovered that she was seeing another guy for sometime already.. and that was the guy she was seeing now. I feel so depressed.. its been 5 years down the road. I have not entirely forgotten her but the bitterness is mainly gone.<br><br>Do you think I should publish all the "secrets" we shared during this time. Maybe it might make me feel better. Like her favourite sexual positions, or where we made out.. of course, I won't be giving name names or numbers..I don't think even I can stoop so low..<br><br>Give me your opinions.<br><br>Thanks.</div></blockquote>You know what mb, I agree with you with someone you've spent so much time with, you can't help but feel you really miss her every now and then when she's no longer with you.<br>The point is most will say gals are very emotional, but we guys are very emotional, especially when that's your first love !<br>In my case, SC was my first gal, and I trully loved her and wanted a future with her.<br>During the relationship, she also wanted to have my child, and I was very touched as it meant a stronger bond between us.<br>Even when my current gf found out about SC, she was initially not happy as I would sometimes mentioned SC to her and make innocent comparisons like the way she did with me with her ex-bf !<br>But I told my current gf that she was my first love and it's not so easy to shut of the thought of her completely !<br>Yes, like remembering the good old days and time spent together .<br>Call me emotional, call me vindictive, but on the other hand, after what SC had done to me emotionally, I could forgive her, but not the false police report to rid me and get on to a greener pasture !<br>I honestly did not want to expose her in public, but you know, there is a limit to your emotions expecially when I've given her 7 years of grace to 'say sorry' and we can just move on with our separate lives.<br>Yes, some will say she is proud and steadfast to her decision, but I think when one has done wrong, one should just admit his/her mistake and move on.<br>Maybe still can remain as friends and not enemies.<br>There is no such thing as ' you are a smaller person' just because you've said sorry to a mistake made !<br>Do u guys agree with me ?<br></div>

SIGH.......<br>Guess this is just life !<br>Like the saying goes, life is so unfair !<br><br></div>
