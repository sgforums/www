            <div class='col-md body'>I was wondering, it only seems that everyone here is so down on love and stuff and also seem very disturbed that they're single, so anyway, I'm not so quick to judge everyone as pathethic losers like me, so like, other than loathing over being single, what is your other common interest activities? it'd be enlightening to know we have other interests other than girls on this board<br><br>I for one, like, am a avid hybrid car tuner, supersuccessful netrepenuer wannabe (for the reason of money = girls) and like ummm, exams coming soon, just always finding reasons to be glad for whatever we should be glad for other than thinking life sucks.<br><br>Anyway, I dont know, I dont really give a shit about getting a gf, cause it's going to be so superficial. I mean like, I know, and admit that I like and only want THE PRETTIEST/CUTEST/SEXIEST/BRAINIEST girl outthere, but I can look at myself and be honest with myself, I'm not sexy (but it's possible if you have the disiplin to work out the muscles) I'm no fun (money solves this, but I gotta get it first) but other than those, I think I'm pretty neat, 179cm, smart, healthy(no smoke, no drugs, no booze) (mabye thats why I'm no fun?) as for looks, I know I fall under someones type, cause to some, I'm just downright sCary/mean/bastardy look :p, but definately not ugly, whee. so anyway, If i'm going to expect, it's not suprising that the girls going to expect back, so like, it's just not time yet, MONEY first, (X_x) ciaos...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Glad that Greygoon has his priorities in his life, to make money first. But mind you, money is not everything, although is important.<br><br>OK, to answer your question.<br><br>Not all girls are worthless. So mature one knows how to appreciate your effort and put back the same, or even more effort to you.  Some are willing to do it, but just don't know how. So are reluctant to do it, while some will ask "Effort? What Effort?"<br><br>So it depends on your luck, and your effort and her attitude.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thats like em, a comforting thing said to people who just have no luck with money<br><br>i mean, someone once said<br>"chian bu se wan neng de"<br>"money is not capable of tens of thousands of tasks/things"<br>but<br>"mei yu chian WAN WAN BU NENG"<br>"no money, tens of thousands of things cannot do!"<br><br>so which wan better leh? u choose ler...<br><br>nola, always the case, over generalizing and getting flamed over that, of course not all are worthless, but getting a worthwhile one take a lot of goddamn luck and tries, at least I can simplyfy the tries when I have lotsa money. definately cant buy luck.. increase chances probably...<br><br>also, being a very very observant person, kinda like special abilities, I have 2 sisters, and they are like, real life examples of girls, and I observe (naturaly) them behind the phone talking to guys and the way the comment about guys, all I can say is, very hard to trust girls, they just, no regard for guys feelings one, but yet, cry and whine so much when they get hurt..., well sometimes it the same case the other way round.. so, whoever started the cycle, only got themselves to blame... I did it once and I'm capable of doing it again, thats why until I find a solution to that, my temp choice of action is to stop bothering about girls, wont be going round hurting innocent girls and creating monsters, a deed for the society!

            <div class='col-md body'>May I presume that you are still quite young (somewhere between 18-22) and your sisters are even younger.<br><br>Girls at this age are very "green". They know little about relationships, for all they know they learn from romance story books, hollywood movies and some from their circle of friends. All of those are not really contributing into how a relationships must be build and maintain and last. They merely describe how good a relationship can be, how guys and girls get together, and how love ones got separated. Kind of like a soap opera, only in different packaging.<br><br>Seldom do you see a romantic comedy goes on after the two couples get married. They idea is, they live happily and ever. I wouldn't say that it is total bull shit, but lets be realistics. If that movie goes on, most audiences will be bored till death on what the couples do every morning the wake up, go to work, come home sleep, until they get to 60 years old. That will be another truman show, only the crude one.<br><br>To make girls learn about efforts, they will have to go through may stages. Some may choose the easy way, it they are humble to accept opinions from seniors. Some must go through the hard way if they are .. stubborn on their own thinkings, majority of these categories fits those girls that think they are pretty or chio. It's only through all the heartbroken experience that they start to realize how does it feel when efforts are put in and not appreciated. Then the next bf will benefit, at least bit by bit.<br><br>But all these are part of life, and is because of all these, your life is make complete and with meanings.<br><br>So, Grey, IMHO, don't over do on your money theory. Money helps you with your stability in finance but that is only part of the whole picture.<br><br>Cheers ... but money is still important!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha yeah man, so better have money, so that you wont be used! ie: PEON'ed, CUBICLED<br><br>ha, but I dunno la, people tell me stories about girls, and the way they carry themselves, but it's almost obviously, now that i just realised, is that, only stupid, waiting to be insulted girls are made into chat subjects, the good girls never get any attention, well, cause the shut their mouths! haha! they like many other nice guys, are well kept to themselves, anyway heres some info on some dumb girls..<br><br>girl.1<br>she's like, flat thin and dark and not even a little bit pretty at all, but there are desperados who layan(bother about) her, I mean like, F man, she tells guys about her fantasies and admits she owns a vibrator, but F! nobody wants to know when you're not hot! thinking about it only makes one stomach spin! and she walk around with the face "i'm so pretty, hmp!" u just want to beat her into bloody pulp.. but.. anyway, the guys who layan her are guys who never go out enough anyway (really, controled my parents) so I guess they're desperate/blind enough<br><br>girl.2<br>this one my sis tell me one, come from rich family, and the mother actually teaches/brainwashes her to act in the most digusting (to them it's royalty/princess shit) way, like, very siew cheh wan lah! eat, nibble nibble one, er, haiyah, just imagine a girl whos everyphrase starts with "my mom says, us rich daughters must/will never..."<br><br>girl.3<br>then then, whoah, this one 9 lik one, a guy rated 3 girls, her being one, so her friends and my guyfriend who was after her(now no more) was talking about it, the 3 girls one being girl.3, so 2 names came up 3rd and 2nd, so only first left right? she abruptly intruded with, aiyah, of course I first la, I so pretty, nobody can compare! (actually she is pretty, but reaaally short) then, she is like 2 face maximus, 1 side 1 story, never the same...and she cant speak proper english, example, org.My finger (wound) stinging.. instead, My finger stinking... then then, org.poor abandoned children, but poor obondon children, mind you she's 17 already!, anyway, everyone knows she dumb and stuff, i guess looks doesnt got with brains and attd is never refined when u have looks huh, what a waste...<br><br>arg, sadly , i'm a lazy F'ker, and i'm just to lazy to type to perfection, only rough rants, but better than nothing i hope...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the facts is, a good communicator knows when to talk and when not to, be it a guy or girl. Guys tends to talk less because of nature. Girls are born better communicator, so it is even harder for them to stop and listen.<br><br>No, good girls know how to get attention without much talking. In another words, they speak wisely. That again, is some criteria I think all humans should learn, to speak with their brains instead of some other part.<br><br>Saddest things about girs are, they looked upon themselves too much. I even have a female friend that believe in this theory: "I need to look pretty in order to find a good husband." And mind you, she is a university student. Isn't that sad? Where has all the education gone to? Down the drain? Apparently she is useing her b*b to think, or rather, since she thought she "looks pretty" she don't have to use her brain, I don't know.<br><br>The girls that I like most, are those that have the mantality that although they may look pretty, they don't think they are that marvelous. It's only with this attitude can one be humble enough to take advice.<br><br>And of course, honesty is another irreplaceable quality in a person...that refers to the girl.3 in your story.<br><br>So be honest .. and stay with your heart.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I sense some bitterness in the last reply,kintaro, but anyway, yeah i was beginning to wonder if everything abt this forum centers ard girls, sex,realtionships,sob stories, blah de blah.<br>As for the Girls aren't worth your emotions bit, i say it depends on the person... some PEOPLE just aren't worth the time and effort, but for every one person there is to ignore, i'm sure there is one who is your time and money. well if not money, your time then.<br><br>anyway, straying from the topic,<br>greygoon&gt; what's a hybrid car tuner?<br><br>the thing abt relationships is that, there are sooo many pple ard you who are attached (friends, bros, sis, dog, cat eh?), you begin to wonder, "now where the F did i go wrong?" It had bugged me a few times, but then again, i enjoy being one entity by myself. i mean i have friends who after getting ATTACHED and i do mean attached, go everywhere together. and i mean every-Fing-where!! its like a 2-in-one deal you never bargained for and its damn annoying.<br><br>ehhh... now where did all that come in... n'mind a little incoherent today, i have to sit for some exam tomorrow and i can't thik straight NEmore.... yeah, so that's my 2 cents worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well I think the problem with girls these days, is simply this : They are super materialistic and selfish. While that is a huge generalisation, i think it holds for quite a few girls. A relationship to them is more of a case of how much and what can they get out of it and not what they can put into it. but I think there are still the rare few girls who are selfless in relationships, may we find them soon...</div>

But we should look back at ourselves too.
