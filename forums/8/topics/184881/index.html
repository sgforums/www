Without absolutely zero background and training in piano, and armed only with my love for Pachelbel's Canon and George Winston's "Variations on the Kanon", I bought a $1000 digital piano one day from Plaza Singapura, and started to learn to play the song.<br><br>The Yamaha DGX-500 (floppy disk) and DGX-505 (USB connection) models will show you, note by note, chord by chord, the keys to the entire song, using a midi file. In fact, the DGX-505 (USB connection to PC) will even produce the score to your own user-created song. But mine is the DGX-500 though, at the time, the DGX-505 didn't exist yet.<br><br>Anyways, the moral of the story is, anyone can now embrace the beautiful world of piano. For people who are interested in the piano, or are interested in Pachelbel's Canon, but have no piano background (while in the past these worlds would have been denied to you), today the portals to heaven are open! Hallelujah!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Shade343, you've stated that you prefer George Winston's version. But if you might one day decide to play David Lanz version, PM me, I can e-mail u the score. And if you can record a midi file of the song, I'll really appreciate it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
