            <div class='col-md body'>Friend, firstly, congratulations!<br><br>1) If you can afford a hotel at Orchard Road, affording roses is the least of your problems lah.<br><br>2) Sorry, this one I can't help.<br><br>3) I feel that since you are going to spend so much time and money decorating the room, then do it in the room.  Its also unique because most other people eat in restaurants.  Most of all....its easier for you to kneel to ask for her hand and for her to kiss you to say yes.<br><br>Good Luck!<br><br></div>

Its also unique because most other people eat in restaurants.  Most of all....its easier for you to kneel to ask for her hand and for her to kiss you to say yes.<br><br>Good Luck!<br><br></div></blockquote>Wha thanks guys i didn't expect so many replies in just 1 night... overwhelmed..thanks for the answers<br><br>1) actually the hotel is on promotion, so pretty cheap<br><br>2) ok no probs<br><br>3) heh good idea, i'll ask for the f&amp;b menu of eating in then, maybe they got something nice.</div>
