It was on 13th of 14th of Feb, I can't remember, but it was during the season of peak prices.  I guess following this trend, your best chance is to check those wet market flower shops run by old uncles/aunties, who've never heard of Valentine's.  Can't guarantee anything though.....due to the time lapse, I would say its still a semi-long short.<br><br>2) Sorry, as before, still can't help with this.<br><br>3) It will be normal hotel restaurant price + a bit more (maybe 10%) for room service.  Room service items usually have some local food (noodles, fried rice, etc), sandwiches and some simple western food (simple steaks, fish &amp; chips, etc).  Suggest your bring your own candles and candlestands.  Its not what you eat which creates the atmosphere lah....its how you market the whole situation.  I mean....looks at Nike - in my opinion, their running shoes suck big-time, yet they can sell them at such high prices (sorry, Nike, this is my own opinion and I have the right to it).<br><br>Good luck again!<br><br></div>
