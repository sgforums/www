Scientists have tried to extend confidence in the carbon dating method further back in time by calibrating the method using tree ring dating. Unfortunately, tree ring dating is itself not entirely reliable, especially the "long chronology" employed to calibrate the carbon dating method. The result is that carbon dating is accurate for only a few thousand years. Anything beyond that is questionable. This fact is born out in how carbon dating results are used by scientists in the scientific literature. Many scientists will use carbon dating test results to back up their position if the results agree with their preconceived theories.</blockquote><blockquote>So, is carbon dating accurate? It is for specimens which only date back a few thousand years. Anything beyond that is problematic and highly doubtful.<br></blockquote>So what now?

It is just a matter of phrasing.<br><br>The site you provided is a pro-bible site : <a href="http://www.allaboutarchaeology.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.allaboutarchaeology.org/</a><br>and can be rather misleading<br>A misleading www link indeed.Just look at the bottom half of the site!<br>No matter though, it is still a good read. But I prefer a *scientific* site,  a compilation of journals and research paper would be better.<br><br>If they say inaccurate because of environmental factors despite tree-calibration method then too bad.<br>The calibration method is still continuing as far as i know. I can't really rebut the fact about the inaccuracy of carbon dating, since I have lack of scientific knowledge .But one thing for sure is the accuracy of carbon dating, it should be bad. As for reliability it might be of still some use. BUT still...<br><br>If carbon dating really fall short, other isotope dating(longer half life) would help:<br><br><blockquote><br>* argon-argon (Ar-Ar)<br>* fission track dating<br>* helium (He-He)<br>* iodine-xenon (I-Xe)<br>* lanthanum-barium (La-Ba)<br>* lead-lead (Pb-Pb)<br>* lutetium-hafnium (Lu-Hf)<br>* neon-neon (Ne-Ne)<br>* optically stimulated luminescence dating<br>* potassium-argon (K-Ar)<br>* radiocarbon dating<br>* rhenium-osmium (Re-Os)<br>* rubidium-strontium (Rb-Sr)<br>* samarium-neodymium (Sm-Nd)<br>* uranium-lead (U-Pb)<br>* uranium-lead-helium (U-Pb-He)<br>* uranium-thorium (U-Th)<br>* uranium-uranium (U-U)<br></blockquote>Some of them can be use for the dating of geological stones and can be use to gauge the age of fossil at their point of death.<br><br>That is, instead of examining the fossil to find out when it died, we test the geological substances surrounding it via isotope dating</div>

I've admitted to some of the flaws in all the stuff brought forward, yet you have chose to think that I'm not; saying what nobel.  Why are you so eager in bringing out the flaws, I've stated in my post earlier that I have accepted the tree-ring calibration is flawed and on-going.I'm not even suggesting even the first place, the other dating methods are out there as you state.<br><br>And those comments I quote can be find in the wikipedia, an open-encyclopedia with reference attached.granted wikipedia is a public encylopedia, it is better than the so <strong>called</strong> archeology site you claimed to be standing on an equal footing.<br><br><strong>Atheist and evolutionist have a hard time because they are guilty(wrong) until proved innocent(right) in a way, while religious have the morale high ground, that is they are innocent(right) until proven guilty(wrong).</strong><br><br>And also note that the yahoo-site you provide too stated that other dating methods can be use in conjunction with carbon dating, such as Stratigraphic dating.<br><br>I should have listened to fatslob in the first place.I gonna quit this topic.
