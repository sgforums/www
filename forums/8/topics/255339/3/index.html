Maybe if he knew that absolutism is never the aim in scientific pursuits.. just because newton's laws were flawed (as they have been proven to be), it doesn't mean they were not pointing in the right direction.<br><br>oh, n btw,... even if he live 10000 to 100000 years he may not see much change. Such development takes millions of years, a concept which may not be comfortable with Christian dogma.<br><br>and lastly.. i don;t see myself as an atheist per se.. im open to all possibilities... i won't be that surprised if one day it is accepted that a form of pure intelligence (nope, probably not an old cuacasian man with a beard) was indeed at work in the universe's creation... after all, human intelligence is not 'supernatural' at all....</div>

Why should I evolve if I'm capable to survive the environment? Dinosaurs died out due to some unforeseen circumstances. The dodo became extinct partially because they can't fly and are considered failures, while their cousins evolved from the SAME ancestor managed to survive!NATURAL SELECTION.<br><br>3. How about the missing links? Even evolution theory evolves over time. There is quite a number of debates over evolution theory itself. And it changes over time. Evolutionist try to explain it as that the theory is perfecting itself.<br><br>True. No rebuttals<br><br>4.  They can tell you so much about how living things evolve but can't show you where on this earth it all begins is a crap theory.<br><br>My mum and dad used to tell me how I've become a human from a sperm+egg but they can't tell me where i was made from. From their bed? Car? Washing machine? IS LOCATION IMPT?<br><br>5. I haven't heard of anyone discovered the place on earth where stones turn into living organism.<br><br>U toking Crap +1<br><br></div>

I think I know more about evolution that you. Why not pick up the book and read about it for once that just telling everyone that who ever opposes the views of yours are superficial and immature.
