You're lazy<br>2. You are arguing for the sake of arguing<br>3. Ignoring my comments because they  might be right, and do not know how to reply and just basically shrug it off<br><br>What I wrote are basically the answers you are looking for. Evidence.<br><br>So you are basically saying that hiccups are being used in the future as your statements said earlier?<br>And because they have no function BASICALLY tells us that that might be a vestigial function/structure. A possible and highly evidential for the theory of evolution.<br><br>Anyway a theory and possible explanation:<br><br><blockquote>One possible beneficial effect of hiccups is to dislodge foreign chunks of food, which have become stuck in the esophagus, or which are traveling too slowly. When a piece of food is swallowed that is too large for the natural peristalsis of the esophagus to move the food quickly into the stomach, it applies pressure on the phrenic nerve, invoking the hiccup reflex. This causes the diaphragm to contract, creating a vacuum in the thoracic cavity, which creates a region of low pressure on the side of the lump of food nearest the stomach, and a region of high pressure on the side of the lump of food nearest the mouth.</blockquote>AND ALSO evolutionist are probably more interested to list vestigial structures than list down something of use....tsk tsk...And why they need to wait for me for what purpose? It is common knowledge that vestigial structures are there  for all of us to see.<br><br>Your comments shift from one ground to another too banzie, sometimes I kinda find it hard to reply to your comments.<br><br>on a side note:<br>I rather believe that God create Adam and Eve as primates and they slowly evolve into humans today.

            <div class='col-md body'>how all this vestigial organs which is useful to our so call primal ancestor appear is a question that can't be answered with the theory of evolution to me in the first place.<br><br>as we know natural selection support the idea of survival of the fittest but how the individual creature become fit?By chance the creature got a mutation in the gene which is beneficial and make it superior than other creature of the same species evolution theory tells us.<br><br>but the question is how much more beneficial and how big changes is there in the creature?if we agree with evolution then we must accept that some creature mutate got stronger and got selected by nature which is now we have our organs like eyes,stomach,heart,liver etc etc through evolution.<br><br>you see for a eye to see or even sense light there is a lot of components needed retina,optic nerves and  brain(not human eye.human eye is far more complex)so how a creature in the very early times evolve to have the ability to see or sense light as if there is no retina only optic nerves and brain to process the image it will not work.if short of optic nerves it will not work.if short of brain the part that process images it will not work too.unless if by change a creature was born and wham bang it mutate it genes by chance and got a retina coincidentally which also coincidentally is connected to the optic nerves and which the optic nerves also coincidentally run to the way of the brain which also coincidentally mutate to process images.all this have to happen in a single mutation/time if not it will not work<br><br>in between this processes there is many many more small detail of the protein and information in the dna which is too long and complex for me to mention.<br><br>so theory of evolution is still implausible to me.</div>

The formation, under natural conditions, of just one single protein out of the thousands of complex protein molecules making up the cell is impossible.<br><br>Proteins are giant molecules consisting of smaller units called "amino acids" that are arranged in a particular sequence in certain quantities and structures. These units constitute the building blocks of a living protein. The simplest protein is composed of 50 amino acids, but there are some that contain thousands.<br><br>The crucial point is this. The absence, addition, or replacement of a single amino acid in the structure of a protein causes the protein to become a useless molecular heap. Every amino acid has to be in the right place and in the right order. The theory of evolution, which claims that life emerged as a result of chance, is quite helpless in the face of this order, since it is too wondrous to be explained by coincidence. (Furthermore the theory cannot even substantiate the claim of the accidental formation of proteins, as will be discussed later.)<br><br>The fact that it is quite impossible for the functional structure of proteins to come about by chance can easily be observed even by simple probability calculations that anybody can understand.<br><br>For instance, an average-sized protein molecule composed of 288 amino acids, and contains twelve different types of amino acids can be arranged in 10300 different ways. (This is an astronomically huge number, consisting of 1 followed by 300 zeros.) Of all these possible sequences, only one forms the desired protein molecule. The rest of them are amino-acid chains that are either totally useless or else potentially harmful to living things.<br><br>In other words, the probability of the formation of only one protein molecule is "1 in 10300". The probability of this "1" to occur is practically nil. (In practice, probabilities smaller than 1 over 1050 are thought of as "zero probability".<br><br>Furthermore, a protein molecule of 288 amino acids is a rather modest one compared with some giant protein molecules consisting of thousands of amino acids. When we apply similar probability calculations to these giant protein molecules, we see that even the word "impossible" is insufficient to describe the true situation.<br><br>When we proceed one step further in the evolutionary scheme of life, we observe that one single protein means nothing by itself. One of the smallest bacteria ever discovered, Mycoplasma hominis H39, contains 600 "types" of proteins. In this case, we would have to repeat the probability calculations we have made above for one protein for each of these 600 different types of proteins. The result beggars even the concept of impossibility.<br><br>Some people reading these lines who have so far accepted the theory of evolution as a scientific explanation may suspect that these numbers are exaggerated and do not reflect the true facts. That is not the case: these are definite and concrete facts. No evolutionist can object to these numbers. They accept that the probability of the coincidental formation of a single protein is "as unlikely as the possibility of a monkey writing the history of humanity on a typewriter without making any mistakes"</div></blockquote>You're just playing with probabilities to elude people away from the fact that protein, or rather amino acids, does not store genetic information. It is rather, the RNA in the primitive world that defines the exact codon sequencing such that the right amino acid will be placed at that right position corresponding to the next as dictate by the triple codon rule.<br><br>Stop playing with probabilities when you ought to know that there is something else that dictate how proteins are formed.</div>

No doubt, it is hard to imagine how simple cells can actually come out with wonderful organ such as the Eye. But you should not discount the fact that it takes a hell load of time in order to attain that. Someone did mentioned that we merely lived 4seconds in a day if we were to compress the evolution time scale. Try something more primitive. Like the protozoa first. You know that the organ eye is an advanced photoreceptor that sense light and interpret them in the form of neurological impulse. Why not look at how simpler microbes response to stimuli such as heat, change in pH, osmolarity and photons?<br><br>Even bacteria can sense in the form of quorum sensing. Try to take it slowly, maybe you will find the reason why there is a need to "sense" the environment, and the need through natural selection that resulted in the formation of such complex organs like the eye.</div>

Finally you are talking about  vestigial functions but you are assuming that it could derived from evolution. Which is quite baseless and pure assumption. That is just your thought until you can proved these organs are really so. Which of coz, till now scientist couldn't and put it as an assumption so. So don't tell me anything as part of your assumption as your debate stand here until you prove an used of this organ during from the process of evolution.<br><br>So you are basically saying that hiccups are being used in the future as your statements said earlier?<br>And because they have no function BASICALLY tells us that that might be a vestigial function/structure.

If according to evolution all functions have its neccessity perhaps you should explain that.<br><br>Your explaination of hiccups is also an assumption sorry an not to be taken seriously. Further more we don't even know where you quote it from. Even if it is from a reliable source, the context was really assumption.<br><br>This is very important as you had stated as if it is of no consequence for evolution.
