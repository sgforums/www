            <div class='col-md body'>I think someone mention about Chance and probability.<br><br>Evolution takes chance and probability to happened. If even to replicate the same situation it may not happen. Doesn't it sound familiar? Let's say the alien theory. Doesn't it the same?<br><br>Little to most people know. to create life and evolution to happy it is a chance of greater than 1 out of power of 50. That is statistically impossible. That totally contradict the fact that evolutionist explained that 90% of the creatures evolved on planet earth. Except for sharks and cockaches etc... another point? Why they don't evolve? chance and pobability? or they couldn't find something similar to shark and co cokaches? another excuse for the flawed theory?<br><br>One misconception about evolution is genetic mutation. That is the only thing that is proven and testable. Evolution wise... a big chunk is still based on observation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its not surprisingly that people take evolution as a theory for explaining the world simply becoz there are no better theory in convincing others.

We can anytime show you it right in your own eyes. But as for evolution, you can't. You can only see the observation that's all.

Newton's laws works very well in describing reality and it works (able to predict correctly) much of what is happening around us.<br><br>Einstein's theory better describes "more" of reality (especially outer space) and you can use his theory to accurately predict "more" of "reality".<br><br>It does not matter whether EVOLUTION THEORY IS 'PERFECT' or not... you are right... but it is as good as it gets, for now... there is nothing else better at the moment... no matter what religious people want you to believe.<br><br>It is like, crossing the road at the pedestrian crossing when the "Green Man" is flashing is not perfect because a drunk driver might also knock you down...<br><br>Religious people then want you to run across the road blindly because crossing at the pedestrian crossing is not perfect...<br><br>hahaha I prefer to cross at the pedestrian crossing even if religious people tell me that it is not perfect... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
