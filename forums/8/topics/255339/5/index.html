I would agree that as a predictive model it is definitely sufficient for most purposes, so perhaps 'fundamental' was not the best word to use. I'm just peeved at how banzie only understands science as an antithesis of religious dogma, that being unquestionably 'perfect' was a pre-requisite for legitimizing any theory.</div>
