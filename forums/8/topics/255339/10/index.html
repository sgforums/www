I've admitted to some of the flaws in all the stuff brought forward, yet you have chose to think that I'm not; saying what nobel.  Why are you so eager in bringing out the flaws, I've stated in my post earlier that I have accepted the tree-ring calibration is flawed and on-going.I'm not even suggesting even the first place, the other dating methods are out there as you state.<br><br>And those comments I quote can be find in the wikipedia, an open-encyclopedia with reference attached.granted wikipedia is a public encylopedia, it is better than the so [b]called</strong> archeology site you claimed to be standing on an equal footing.<br><br><strong>Atheist and evolutionist have a hard time because they are guilty(wrong) until proved innocent(right) in a way, while religious have the morale high ground, that is they are innocent(right) until proven guilty(wrong).</strong><br><br>And also note that the yahoo-site you provide too stated that other dating methods can be use in conjunction with carbon dating, such as Stratigraphic dating.<br><br>I should have listened to fatslob in the first place.I gonna quit this topic.

Even if not the content to be evaluated compared to carbon could pose some difficulty. Some of these radioactive material are not readily available unlike carbon. But even carbon's availability deferrs from time to time. Ok so for this part of dating artifacts are considered flawed as you had acknowledge and had mentioned.<br><br>There is not right and wrong at this point I guess... its just a different perception till proven. So finally I can say this for the LAST time... Everyone please do keep an open mind to evolution or what ever theories. Recognising the theory thoroughly and its weakness is good. Textbook are not neccessary complete and even planets status are changed too what else cannot?

However, some evolutionists believed that "half-man half-ape" creatures were to be found not only in the fossil record, but also alive in various parts of the world. In the early 20th century, these pursuits for "living transitional links" led to unfortunate incidents, one of the cruellest of which is the story of a Pygmy by the name of Ota Benga.<br><br>Ota Benga was captured in 1904 by an evolutionist researcher in the Congo. In his own tongue, his name meant "friend". He had a wife and two children. Chained and caged like an animal, he was taken to the USA where evolutionist scientists displayed him to the public in the St Louis World Fair along with other ape species and introduced him as "the closest transitional link to man". Two years later, they took him to the Bronx Zoo in New York and there they exhibited him under the denomination of "ancient ancestors of man" along with a few chimpanzees, a gorilla named Dinah, and an orang-utan called Dohung. Dr William T. Hornaday, the zoo's evolutionist director gave long speeches on how proud he was to have this exceptional "transitional form" in his zoo and treated caged Ota Benga as if he were an ordinary animal. Unable to bear the treatment he was subjected to, Ota Benga eventually committed suicide.( Ota Benga: The Pygmy in The Zoo, New York: Delta Books)<br><br>people keep on saying that from simple slowly to complex but how simple is simple.Can u please tell me one i just need one example where we can see human generate a most simple and not complex living bacteria</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ernst Haeckel(more hardcore than Darwin)a faker who falsified his drawings in order to support the theory he advanced. Haeckel's forgeries purported to show that fish and human embryos resembled one another. When he was caught out, the only defence he offered was that other evolutionists had committed similar offences:<br><br>"After this compromising confession of "forgery" I should be obliged to consider myself condemned and annihilated if I had not the consolation of seeing side by side with me in the prisoners' dock hundreds of fellow culprits, among them many of the most trusted observers and most esteemed biologists. The great majority of all the diagrams in the best biological textbooks, treatises and journals would incur in the same degree the charge of "forgery", for all of them are inexact, and are more or less doctored, schematised and constructed."<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>A well-known geneticist and outspoken evolutionist, Richard C. Lewontin from Harvard University, confesses that he is "a materialist first and a scientist second" in these words:<br><br>It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is absolute, so we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>it is very interesting to see that the "evolutionist scientist" Professor Ali Demirsoy accepts this sort of irrational proposition:<br><br>In essence, the probability of the formation of a cytochrome-C sequence is as likely as zero. That is, if life requires a certain sequence, it can be said that this has a probability likely to be realised once in the whole universe. Otherwise some metaphysical powers beyond our definition must have acted in its formation. To accept the latter is not appropriate for the scientific goal. We thus have to look into the first hypothesis.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>evolution theory does not bring peace some of the pass and present leaders have brought death to millions of innocent people base on materialist thinking<br><br>communist for example every day in north korea hundreds of children starve to death base on the communist idea.we have no idea what is the pain these children are suffering as i don't think anyone in this forum have gone without food for 36hrs<br><br>Relationship between Darwinism and communism goes right back to the founders of both these "isms". Marx and Engels, the founders of communism, read Darwin's The Origin of Species as soon as it came out, and were amazed at its 'dialectical materialist' attitude. The correspondence between Marx and Engels showed that they saw Darwin's theory as "containing the basis in natural history for communism". In his book The Dialectics of Nature, which he wrote under the influence of Darwin, Engels was full of praise for Darwin, and tried to make his own contribution to the theory in the chapter "The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man".

No I dont...All I said was it is the best solution so far...Ad hoc yes....but it is no doubt the most acceptable theory in present context.<br>Ur opinion is not much of a use.....unless u can convince the whole scientific community by writing in ur thesis to debate the fatal errors in the theory and give it a confidence level in statistic on how wrong it is.<br><br>Dun shoot me like that, I am not even targeting anyone and I merely states those who are too deeply influence by religions can never see the point some scientists are trying to make and <strong> VICE VERSA</strong></div>
