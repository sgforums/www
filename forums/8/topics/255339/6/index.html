Blind faith on their theory I guess and imposing others their beliefs. (isn't this what they are complaining about Christians?) Check out their forum.  So whoever is reading this should be clear that evolution is NOT the truth yet. It has its flaws don't take it 100% keep a open mindedness for other possibilities.<br><br>Lastly I haven't even talk about religion or proving my open about creationism and already alot of people is attacking the subject. are these people here to pinpoint on certain religion with  their perjudiced judgement?

            <div class='col-md body'>the theory of evolution fails even to account for the building-blocks of a cell. The formation, under natural conditions, of just one single protein out of the thousands of complex protein molecules making up the cell is impossible.<br><br>Proteins are giant molecules consisting of smaller units called "amino acids" that are arranged in a particular sequence in certain quantities and structures. These units constitute the building blocks of a living protein. The simplest protein is composed of 50 amino acids, but there are some that contain thousands.<br><br>The crucial point is this. The absence, addition, or replacement of a single amino acid in the structure of a protein causes the protein to become a useless molecular heap. Every amino acid has to be in the right place and in the right order.

            <div class='col-md body'>Now obviously many of your claims are reflecting quite bad on the athetist. it only got to shows how perjudice about athetist is. This thread was never about religion vs evolution and it seems that some athethist here got to a point that it is about religion. This thread is about evolution itself. I guess evolution to them is more than a theory it is just an anti christ tool. Is this how all athetist is like? Shallow.<br><br>Perhaps undeniable like some said newton laws is flawed at certain situation. Nano level? It means the law is not entirely detailed enough and our understanding is limited to that point. But you can't just deny about gravity. Even at that certain situation things is different, how do you know? Coz you can test it our right? Which is quite different from evolution. Evolution is still a theory. At least till this very point.<br><br>I think I had already proven my case. Evolution is flawed and it is a theory. People should take it that way as just another of the many explaination. It could be true but until then we found out. It is a theory.</div>

So how did they test evolution out? By observation again? What kind of test is that? I see you holding a knife and it means you kill someone?
