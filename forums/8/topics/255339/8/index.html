            <div class='col-md body'>ok , people. I really dunno what kind of evidence you ppl want? Provide to you the evidence, u shrug it off. I mean c'mon how am I suppose to explain to you how life can magically appear AGAIN on Earth? Like shizzle nizzle? OF COURSE it cant appear again! Life starts from something simple and gets complex and more  complex.<br><br>I have many Church friends who *debate* with me about flaws of evolution theory , flaws of carbon dating, flaws of this, flaws of that, flaws of all flaws etc etc. I always lose my energy in the end.+1<br><br>AND also, someone said that vestigial structures cannot be use as evidence (and shrug it off). Cannot use then how? Make up another evidence? NO WAI! It will probably shrug off again because it is lacking of some magical ingredient again!<br><br>I admit I lose OK, we Atheists lose . SO! People, this Earth is flat, and the sun orbits around us and we are 6000 yrs old. hmmmmmmmmm.And the fossils are there to test our faith...<br><br>Just because you have not encounter other species doesn't mean they do not exists.<br><br>Likewise, in another galaxy far far away, a scientist from another world gets burn on a stake for saying that there are other life forms out there<br>-------------------------------------------<br><br>On another matter : Me and AugoeideS and some others have already fulfilled our roles in explaining and re-explaining the matter to you guys! I (and maybe others) will not try to explain again.<br><br>The only thing we can't explain IS HOW LIFE IS CREATED which is the 2nd question posted by the TS.<br><br>Sorry TS for not answering your last qn.<br>-----<br><br><blockquote>Yea I guess so... scientist couldn't find the use but our dear Augoeides, found the purpose of all these Vestigial Organ.

Whatever the deeper, profound, complexities of his psychosis, it is certain that [the concept of struggle was important because]Â… his book, Mein Kampf, clearly set forth a number of evolutionary ideas, particularly those emphasizing struggle, survival of the fittest and the extermination of the weak to produce a better society.<br><br>Hitler, who emerged with these views, dragged the world to violence that had never before been seen. Many ethnic and political groups, and especially the Jews, were exposed to terrible cruelty and slaughter in the Nazi concentration camps. World War II, which began with the Nazi invasion, cost 55 million lives. What lay behind the greatest tragedy in world history was Darwinism's concept of the "struggle for survival."(describe by historian Hickman)<br><br>and<br><br>While fascists are found on the right wing of Social Darwinism, the left wing is occupied by communists. Communists have always been among the fiercest defenders of Darwin's theory.<br><br>This relationship between Darwinism and communism goes right back to the founders of both these "isms". Marx and Engels, the founders of communism, read Darwin's The Origin of Species as soon as it came out, and were amazed at its 'dialectical materialist' attitude. The correspondence between Marx and Engels showed that they saw Darwin's theory as "containing the basis in natural history for communism". In his book The Dialectics of Nature, which he wrote under the influence of Darwin, Engels was full of praise for Darwin, and tried to make his own contribution to the theory in the chapter "The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man".<br><br>Russian communists who followed in the footsteps of Marx and Engels, such as Plekhanov, Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin, all agreed with Darwin's theory of evolution. Plekhanov, who is seen as the founder of Russian communism, regarded marxism as "Darwinism in its application to social science".6<br><br>Trotsky said, "Darwin's discovery is the highest triumph of the dialectic in the whole field of organic matter."(Alan Woods and Ted Grant, Reason in Revolt: Marxism and Modern Science)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't believe I missed out this topic. I mean, MY FAVOURITE SUBJECT!<br><br>-----<br>The evolution theory is flawed, yes. That's because it's a theory. It's a theory that is supported by certain evidence. Everything in science is a theory. Some are supposed by concrete evidence, others by uncertain ones.<br><br>Evolution is one supposed by uncertain evidences, but the truth is there. The fossils.<br><br>The hundred million years old fossils. The fossils of the dinosaurs. How can man have co-existed with dinosaurs? Scientists has more or less "proven" a portion of evolution, from chickens. They did an experiment, and found that the chickens slightly evolved.<br><br>What proof does the creationism conspiracy have? The bible? A fictional book written by men claiming to be "divinely inspired"?<br><br>The supposed mathematically impossible thing about our world, how the atoms, if slightly varied in size or mass, would not support life. That doesn't hold itself up as even an argument.<br><br><strong>The fact that we have ALREADY existed negates all the argument.</strong><br><br>It doesn't matter if the atoms are so damn accurate, because WE ARE ALREADY HERE. Our existence is BECAUSE of the accurate atomic mass. The universe could have gone through millions of big bangs, each with different atomic mass, <strong>before finally reaching this particular configuration</strong>.<br><br>That said, I do believe in the big bang, but have my doubts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Finally earth does goes through a couple of tramatic experience. Asteriod hitting earth and such... Flood? So how accurate is the carbon content? if you could find something proven to be this old and had a reference to it. Maybe it could share a little light. But even so, the accuracy could be doubted. A little different could range in tens of thousands of years or much much more, although to earth these years are probably neligible.<br><br>Yes I believe in God and the bible didn't say earth was created 6000 years ago.

Thus, logically, it is likely we've only survived for 40,000 years ago.<br><br>But that is impossible, because before homo sapiens, we have a previous "pre-evolved" species, known as the homo erectus. These are found to be at about 1.1 million years ago, to about 40,000 years ago.<br><br>So, if this is the case, we now push our assumption that humans are "created" about 1.1 million years ago.<br><br>But by accepting that, you've accepted evolution. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>What many people do not know, however, is that dinosaur fossils are not dated using carbon-14. They are dated by studying how deep the fossils are buried.
