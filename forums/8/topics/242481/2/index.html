            <div class='col-md body'>There was a time when my friends and I were coerced to buy a pen for $5 at the Pasir Ris Interchange by one organisation without proper licence... There was a slip of paper at the back that states the purchase of the pen was for commercial purposes. That was when we realised that we were duped... well, i expected it... Each of us chipped in, so it was sub-divided to $1 per person.<br><br>But what was worse was that soon after, a great company of people came towards our direction and asked for our 'support' in this 'promotion' or whatever charity thingy... selling the same, worthless pen of course. When we politely declined and told them that we have already made a purchase, one of the men said,"All of you guys have gotten one?"<br><br>These people are only out to pocket hard-earned money of the citizens! They should in fact go look for a ''proper'' occupation instead of participating in such activities that go against their conscience!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
