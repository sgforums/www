Customer is always right wat. Forgot that ? Which customer would wanna buy something that is more expensive when he can get it cheaper somewhere else?<br><br>I understand the plight of part time sales man at SLS and Funan, cos ive been one b4. Sometimes you cant blame them too. There's no proper training given by the employers. You just start your job and you start selling whatever product straightaway. Its a part time job, tell me which part timer (student or watever) will go back home and research about the product?<br><br>And your colleagues might not be of help too. The "top sellers" usually dont share much of their experience because they are afraid you might become competition to them.<br><br>And sometimes you realise these "top sellers" are actually bullshitting to the customers. The ones that actually explain the technology and stuff truthfully to the customers end up not selling much.<br><br>I dont know if ive gone out of point here. But oh well. Sales is a funny thing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>okay we tokin about service and being in the service industries but can we not use retailers of electronics stuff as a comparison? know why we have Newegg, Tigerdirect etc online stores selling electronics hardware? coz the buyer brave enough to order from them knows what to get and the model numebr to quote. the only risks oon top of product functionality (unlike u going over to the stores to check on the packiaging of the parts personally) is damage or compromise to the product during shipment ot transportation.<br><br>i dun think a sales assistant can explain and make u understand the electronic product by tokin to u. they were merely applyin their soft skills and so-called marketing forge to get u to commit.<br><br>its time to break tradition.....<br>why must u tok to the sales assistant before buying? why not march in (wen u know what u want) and tell him/ her to wrap it up for u?<br><br>service has more to offer than in the retails...a good example to trek on are the hotel and F and B industries. u giv good quality service backed by good food and customers will come back again and again.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
