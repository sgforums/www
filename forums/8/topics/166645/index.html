            <div class='col-md body'>This sort of sales attitude is COMMON in Singapore, when most sales people are doing their job for the commission and quota of sales set for them to achieve each month. So, naturally they're ONLY interested in closing the sale, not furnishing you with details on prdoucts.<br><br>They, expect that you have found out about the details from the Internet.<br><br>When people work without passion for the position they hold, this sort of attitude is very apt. Their minds are on the MONEY. Not you...<br><br>Too bad for those companies and or shops who hire such people, local or otherwise.<br><br>I urge local young ones to wake up, because if they don't behave right, foreigners are waiting behind their heels to fill their positions!<br><br></div>

It's not really becos' you look like a kid, that's why they don't serve you. The important point is, they think you're too young to have money. So as long as they see anyone who's not dressed like a million bucks, they'll ignore you. Very shallow kind of thinking right? Well, you'll be amazed by how dumb they are, especially the ones in branded boutiques. They freaking think they own the shop. Can choose customers somemore. Hahaha...I wonder if they realise that they're just some pathetic low life sales assistants(I'm referring to those moronic sales assistants only), no different from the ones in department stores.<br>These people have 0 IQ.</div>
