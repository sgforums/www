I guess if I have the money and ability to get out of this country I would choose to do so too. But alas, I do not possess that privilege. If war comes, and my family and loved ones' lives are at sake, I will take up arms and fight. No too ways about it.<br><br>But I fight not because of the country or the ruling party, I fight because I have to protect my loved ones. Simple as that. I think our country's values have eroded a lot due to the race for material attainment. So much so that I feel very little for this place I supposedly call home.<br><br>Heck, even the government dun give two hoots about the sacrifice of us NS men, choosing to open the floodgates to FTs. Many of us have gone through a lot in NS, some had permanent injuries, while a few even died from it. I am still carrying NS injuries now. But what do we get in return for protecting their arses? Jobs robbed from us...<br><br>Sorry to sound like I am whining. But I am not, for I believe this to be a very real scenario facing us now.<br><br>It is so true the popular saying "Jobs for foreigners, NS for Singaporeans".<br><br>Sigh...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) Firstly, after reading all the posts, I think all of you think poorly of our SAF, right? if war comes, we will all crumble like dominos right?<br>Let me assure you, that you are wrong. I do believe in our SAF. I do believe we have a chance to stand our ground.<br><br>2) Some of you think little of this small island, but share with me, where will you feel really home?  US, Aust? You think people there will embrace you as a citizen? you will just be a refugees or at best a 2nd class citizen.<br><br>3) And you think our leaders will flee? Where they go? UK? US? Aust? You think it is easy for leaders to come and go as they want? Look at what happen to Thaskin.<br><br>4) you think someone can just drop a bomb on us when they like?<br>Why do our Govt invest overseas and we have some many foreign investors.<br>Imagine, if you have a house with many children of different nationality. Is it easy to attack this house?<br><br>5) Also, when you attack a place, you want it for some reasons right? For Singapore, what's worthwhile to take? Our economy and our workforce.<br>We don't have diamonds like africa, oil like arabs, rubber or tin like Malaysia.Hey, we are even drinking recycled water..<br>So do you destroy the very thing you want to acquire? Meaning our economy and workforce?<br><br>So I hope that most can open their eyes and see the reasonings.<br><br></div>
