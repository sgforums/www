In a never-before heard of instance, actress Sanjida Sheikh, better known as Nimmo of Kya Hoga Nimmo Ka was asked by Star to undergo a plastic surgery, as well as a dental one so that she would suit her character in Kayamath ( to be aired from today) better. Surprisingly, both producer Ekta Kapoor and Sanjida consented to it!<br><br>A source in Balaji confirms, "Yes, it is true. The channel wanted Sanjida to improve her under-eye area by way of a small cosmetic surgery. They also thought that she needed to fix her teeth. They conveyed the message to Balaji as well as to Sanjida. Since Sanjida starts shooting next week, she will have to do both this week itself. In fact, they have availed of dentist Dr. Sandesh Mayekar's services this week . Even the surgery is scheduled to be done later this week."</div>

We have heard that Koena Mitra was housebound until a few days ago, after a recent lip job went terribly wrong. She went through a silicone implant surgery, but the result was very different from what she had expected. The actress now intends to get a correction surgery done to get rid of her swollen lips.<br><br>Says a source close to the actress, Â“She got a lip job done about 10 days ago but the result is far from pretty. She has almost locked up herself in the house and doesnÂ’t want to meet anyone.Â”Close friends of the actress inform that she has been craving for a perfect pout. After having consulted a few high profile cosmetic surgeons in the city, she decided to get lip implants done, instead of collagen injections.<br><br>The procedure was painful and expensive. With the not-so favorable results she will have to go under the knife very soon and bear the pain again. A reliable source says, Â“She used to complain about her thin lips. But her lips are completely swollen now. Â“When quizzed about it, the actress refused to come clean. She denied having got any surgery done. She said, Â“I have not got any lip surgery done.Â”<br><br>The actress has been mired in similar controversies before. Her fellow colleagues have alleged that she has had other cosmetic surgeries done including a rhinoplasty. A reliable source says, Â“She has definitely worked on her nose. She is very careful when her make up artist applies make-up on her face on the sets.Â”</div>

He treats them in the darkness of nights, under different names. But who they are is common knowledge in an appearance-obsessed and fitness-driven industry! "My clients recognise me only within the confines of my office room," he chuckles, with a tinge of frustration.<br><br>Dr. Pandya treated Bollywood actor-cum-director Sanjay Khan who sustained burn injuries while filming "Tipu Sultan" some years ago. The actor showed his gratitude by appointing Dr. Pandya as Head, Cosmetic Surgery Department in his health resort in Bangalore, the Golden Palms Spa.<br><br>Public acknowledgement otherwise eludes Dr. Pandya, who divides his time between Bangalore, Delhi (Escorts Heart Institute) and Mumbai (Breach Candy, Lilavati, Jaslok). Recently, actresses Hema Malini and Jaya Prada graced a function to launch his book on "Botox", the latest rage in makeover industry. "Cosmetology is a money spinner and even unqualified people are jumping into the fray for the easy moolah which this lunch-time procedure fetches," he worries.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Honours </span><br><br>Born in Gujarat, brought up in Tanzania, he studied medicine and worked in some top institutions in India, U.K. and the U.S. Dr. Pandya is only one of the two civil surgeons bestowed with the Honorary Surgeon Commodore rank by thenPresident K.R. Narayananan. He is also among the Diplomates of the American Board of Plastic Surgery. Dr. Pandya has lost count of surgeries he has performed. Yet he is struck by the rapid rise in this "self-demolition for a makeover assertion". "Men and women, rich and middle-class, all want to overhaul themselves," he says. Every patient's personal satisfaction remains "his greatest challenge". "Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery restores what Nature or fate damages accidentally, so patients return happy at the slightest recovery. But a cosmetic surgeon has to surpass what God originally created," he quips.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Ultimate beauty weapon</span><br><br>Also called the Columbus of Cosmetic Surgery because he took to nose jobs Â— rhinoplasty Â— when nobody thought of it three decades ago, Dr.Pandya attributes the current facelift and body contouring craze to "three A's" Â— Affluence; Availability; Affordability.<br><br>His chosen field is one where a surgeon never sells an operation to a patient. "Given the variations in expectations, you let the patient buy it from you," he says with no qualms. And the business of nipping and tucking, sucking and suturing, injecting and implanting is undoubtedly brisk and big today. With his knives, scalpels and needles, Dr.Pandya gives a tuck here and a poke there to scrape out puffy bags under the eyes, chisel out higher cheek bones and define better jawlines, knock-off the hump on the nose-bridge or the blobby tip, tuck in tummies, puff up lips, smoothen laugh lines and wrinkles. The ultimate beauty weapon is there. Yet, everybody likes to use it secretly.<br><br><a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mag/2005/05/22/stories/2005052200340400.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mag/2005/05/22/stories/2005052200340400.htm</a></div>
