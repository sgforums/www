              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>kakowi's replies are very unpractical and belonged to those "ideal" and "model" answers from counsellors.</p>
              <p>Let me start by first saying, I am in a very similar boat as you. I have both parents, brother and sister living together with me. Both parents are 57 and 53. Sister is 18 and brother is 16. My father suffers from schizoprenia but is now like lao ren chi dai, and my mum was also schizoprenic but had since recovered fully. My dad does not wor, not that he doesnt want, but he has the heart but no strength and breath. My mum is currently working as a school cleaner, income: 650 per month before deduct CPF. My sis is studying in poly 2nd year, my bro, just admitted to boy's home recently.</p>
              <p>With a family like this, I believe many will have given up, but not me. My parents provided basic schooling and food for me till I am in JC. From then on, how I survived my dailies is by loans from governement, bursaries and kind loans of 100 or 200 every few months from my uncle and aunty. I survived thru my uni studies by 100% loan from the bank, which I am currently repaying: 36k in total. I did not really work part time in my uni as I was actively involved in CCAs.</p>
              <p>Currently, my expenses are as follows every month:</p>
              <p>Uni loan repayment: 600</p>
              <p>Bills (HDB loan, PUB, Town council, Starhub, Singtel): 1000 average</p>
              <p>Insurance: 240</p>
              <p>Food: 400 average</p>
              <p>Transport: 100 average</p>
              <p>Don't worry, with your current case, if you go to your grassroot MP, you will definitely get monthly assistance from them, 300 per month. If you don't get it, send me a PM, I will advise you how. You need supporting documents, for example medical certs (very powerful) to prove that your mum can't work, your outstanding monthly bills, your pay slip, your mum declaration of divorce/unemployed etc. Anything that can prove your hardship will help. You can also apply for temporary waiver of housing loans and utilities but remember that it is only temporary, you will still have to pay back in the end when you earn enough for your salary.</p>
              <p>Don't worry too much about your investments for now, you simply do not have enough money. Wait for about 2 years or 3 years when your pay increase or you change job. If can, take a part time degree WITH your company sponsoring you. Think of ways to minimise your spendings, take buses, walk to nearest MRT, cycle.</p>
              <p>Times are hard, but if you persevere, one day, you might just get lucky and land into a job which pays you well and things will change for the better like myself currently. Good luck!</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>so what is your salary now?</p>
              <p>Your case is slightly better than mine. My mother is not sick. She is able to work but she does not want to work and there is no outstanding monthly bills. So now you know why applying for financial assistant will not work?</p>
              <p>At the very least your mother is still working despite knowing that her salary is low. I recently recommend a job to my mother salary $1200 before deduct cpf and she don't want, claiming that salary is too low and working hours too long despite knowing that she only has O level and is already 52 years old.</p>
              <p> Plus your sister currently can find some part time job and once she graduate in 2 years time, she will be able to find a decent job as she is a diploma holder and than she will be able to contribute money to the family.</p>
              <p>I don't have any sibilings who can contribute to the family</p>

              <p>If I were you, I will probably be dissatisfied with the answers - the imposition of values, the moralizing. These values are applicable to them and may not be for others.</p>
              <p>Let's look at the facts. Your divorced mother got the house and the kids. In which case she is probably receiving alimony as well as child maintenance for you for a long time. Since you are now working, she is looking towards you for the shortfall in maintenance.</p>
              <p>Ask her about her monthly expenditure.</p>
              <p>Tell her about the government policy that your burdens are your own.</p>
              <p>Tell her you need to look after your own financials too, even more so as your income is little.</p>
              <p>Tell her in this present age, the entire family needs to pull together.</p>
              <p>Determine how much you can afford to give her. Consider this formula: pay yourself the first 20%. Go to funds supermart and choose a good fund. Forget about insurance savings plan in your case as you need ready cash in the event...well, just in case.</p>
              <p>The remaining 80%, give $50 to the church or charity. The remainder will be used for your transport, food, fun (give yourself a reward once every month), your mother's allowance, you and your mother's medishield (must!) and critical illness policies for yourself and mother. Are you a nationalservice man? (sorry i did not read carefully to see if you are a guy or gal). If yes, go to SAFRA and take up their NTUC policy or AVIVA to take up their SAF policy. That is all you need and these policies are the cheapest in the market.</p>
              <p>You need to be comfortable. Your mother need to be comfortable. The best way is to talk it over with your mother, a heart to heart talk.</p>
              <p>Give some money to your father too. He has taken care of you too all these years. He will be delighted because a child is always a child.</p>
              <p>My comments are generic in nature. If it does not apply to you or if it will make more sense if more details are known, then please pm me at my email if private or here if public.</p>
              <p>I wish you the best and hope that your solution will be meaningful to you and your mother.</p>

              <p>so what is your salary now?</p>
              <p>Your case is slightly better than mine. My mother is not sick.
              She is able to work but she does not want to work and there is no
              outstanding monthly bills. So now you know why applying for
              financial assistant will not work?</p>
              <p>At the very least your mother is still working despite knowing
              that her salary is low. I recently recommend a job to my mother
              salary $1200 before deduct cpf and she don't want, claiming that
              salary is too low and working hours too long despite knowing that
              she only has O level and is already 52 years old.</p>
              <p> Plus your sister currently can find some part time job and
              once she graduate in 2 years time, she will be able to find a
              decent job as she is a diploma holder and than she will be able to
              contribute money to the family.</p>
              <p>I don't have any sibilings who can contribute to the family</p>

              <p>If you mum does not want to work, like my dad, then there is no point forcing her. Give her what you can give within your means :) There can't be no outstanding bills if your plight is really so worse off, give it a few months and there will be, naturally.</p>
              <p>My sis is currently working to support herself as she likes to buy clothes, make up, shoes etc. What the home can give her are basics like food and shelter. I do not expect her to contribute to the family, but definitely, it will be nice for her to contribute some.</p>
              <p>I had already given you some advice/ways which had proven to work as I had used them before, the rest is up to you.</p>
              <p>As for my salary, it is rather fluctuating, but it is about 4 times more then what a uni engineer get for a month of work.</p>

              <p>Madpoh,</p>
              <p>I think your mom is also fedup with your grandmother for being so money minded.</p>
              <p>So by refusing to work, she will have no income..that way your grandmother can no longer squeeze money out from her. It's another internal power struggle, nothing to do with laziness.</p>
              <p>I really wonder why your aunt and uncles need to talk to your mother. Since they are not supporting your grandmother, it is not their place to speak to her about income.</p>
              <p>I suggest you let your mother know you have other plans for a savings of your own.</p>
              <p>Considering your meagre income and unstable job situation. It is always prudent to have a savings of your own for rainy days.</p>
              <p>Let her know of your future plans, example, you want to pursue higher educations to increase your income capacity.</p>
              <p>Maybe take up part time classes while you work, and let her know how much those costs.</p>
              <p>Consider negotiating for a lower monthly contribution while you are saving and upgrading yourself.</p>
              <p>Obviously, your mother is not in urgent need of cash now. So don't take it too hard on yourself.</p>

              <p>I would say you should have no worries.</p>
              <p>If people can survive with a sub 1k salary supporting 2 kids in the entire household. I don't see any reason why you are complaining with a pay that above 1k.</p>
              <p>Just $400 to your month every month should do the trick and you'll still have an estimated $800 every month. AND you can live VERY well in singapore with that sum of money. UNless you are those type of people like to enjoy/destroy life (going clubbing, drinking, smoking, pooling, ktving etc.), then it a waste of everyone's time trying to reply to this thread.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IN any case your arguments shows how short sighted you are, planning 5 minutes ahead and not further. A diploma holder can easily get 2k out there right now if you ARE capable. IF you are not getting a sum you think is sufficient, stop blaming things/people around you and start looking at yourself. Why did you not work harder in school (good results = good career prospects)? why did you not save up while in NS(How much can u spend in 8 days out of camp??!!)</p>
              <p>If people can live on $300 just on basic needs (food, books, transport,stationary, handphone, internet). ARE YOU COMPLAINING BECAUSE OF YOUR WANTS and ur mum will be eating into this sum of money for your enjoyment *roll eyes*  </p>

              <p>kakowi's replies are very unpractical and belonged to those
              "ideal" and "model" answers from counsellors.</p>
              <p>Let me start by first saying, I am in a very similar boat as
              you. I have both parents, brother and sister living together with
              me. Both parents are 57 and 53. Sister is 18 and brother is 16. My
              father suffers from schizoprenia but is now like lao ren chi dai,
              and my mum was also schizoprenic but had since recovered fully. My
              dad does not wor, not that he doesnt want, but he has the heart but
              no strength and breath. My mum is currently working as a school
              cleaner, income: 650 per month before deduct CPF. My sis is
              studying in poly 2nd year, my bro, just admitted to boy's home
              recently.</p>
              <p>With a family like this, I believe many will have given up, but
              not me. My parents provided basic schooling and food for me till I
              am in JC. From then on, how I survived my dailies is by loans from
              governement, bursaries and kind loans of 100 or 200 every few
              months from my uncle and aunty. I survived thru my uni studies by
              100% loan from the bank, which I am currently repaying: 36k in
              total. I did not really work part time in my uni as I was actively
              involved in CCAs.</p>
              <p>Currently, my expenses are as follows every month:</p>
              <p>Uni loan repayment: 600</p>
              <p>Bills (HDB loan, PUB, Town council, Starhub, Singtel): 1000
              average</p>
              <p>Insurance: 240</p>
              <p>Food: 400 average</p>
              <p>Transport: 100 average</p>
              <p>Don't worry, with your current case, if you go to your grassroot
              MP, you will definitely get monthly assistance from them, 300 per
              month. If you don't get it, send me a PM, I will advise you how.
              You need supporting documents, for example medical certs (very
              powerful) to prove that your mum can't work, your outstanding
              monthly bills, your pay slip, your mum declaration of
              divorce/unemployed etc. Anything that can prove your hardship will
              help. You can also apply for temporary waiver of housing loans and
              utilities but remember that it is only temporary, you will still
              have to pay back in the end when you earn enough for your
              salary.</p>
              <p>Don't worry too much about your investments for now, you simply
              do not have enough money. Wait for about 2 years or 3 years when
              your pay increase or you change job. If can, take a part time
              degree WITH your company sponsoring you. Think of ways to minimise
              your spendings, take buses, walk to nearest MRT, cycle.</p>
              <p>Times are hard, but if you persevere, one day, you might just
              get lucky and land into a job which pays you well and things will
              change for the better like myself currently. Good luck!</p>
