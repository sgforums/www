            <div class='col-md body'>in forming opinions of a person (esp. on irc/forums), we usually ignore his overall behavior and consider only whther or not he treats us well.  This is unfair since the person's relationship with us might constitute only a minor percentage of his life activity (READ cyberworld <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">).  What we often do, however, is magnify the fault that affects us and minimize or ignore the virtues that affect numerous other ppl.  While it is wrong to do this with respect to others, it is a good antidote against pride for us to do it in forming great opinions of ourselves (heh heh heh... ).  After all, we cheat ourselves with pretenses and lies, and ironically fail to do good ourselves while criticizing others.  Were others to do these things, we would look down upon them, but not when we are the subjects in question.<br><br>We would usually debase/discredit a person easily.  Even a person who until now has been highly commended, will become demeaned in our eyes with the revalation of only one of his flaws or infirmities.  when the tendency to accentuate a person's "unpleasant" behavior (according to one's social ethics) is combined with our opposite tendency to give greater weight to the good in our selves while ignoring our own imperfections, we have a wonderful formula for conceit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just thought that its a good time to bring this up again.....<br><br>And so to add......<br><br>PS:	I wouldnÂ’t say that the following is for flamers since they flame for the sake of flaming (and I can somewhat understand the fun of doing so at times <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> )<br><br>ItÂ’s meant for forumites wishing to participate without unknowingly falling into certain loopholes.  Hope it can be of some help esp. to some of those whom I know.<br>--------------------------------<br><br>Many people take the forum as a venue for voicing out their opinions, sharing views and ideas.  I donÂ’t think thatÂ’s wrong, but I will not agree thatÂ’s exactly right either.  Perhaps we should take it to the next level.<br><br>To get a true Â“discussionÂ” going on is not simply about shooting off your views, forcing your values on others thinking you hold the absolute truth, and putting others down.  The notion of Â“free speechÂ” is often used as a guise for such self-righteousness unfortunately.  Personally, I feel that the most important condition of a discussion is not simply to air your views (of course thatÂ’s required to some extent), but to LISTEN to what others have to say, and try to understand why they think/feel that way, rather than to swiftly crush your Â“opponentsÂ” with your Â“deadly truthÂ”.  This can be often seen in scenarios when 1 or more parties seemingly thought and assumed they are really open-minded, till they get agitated (sometimes without even realizing that) when their ideas were being challenged by an alternative one.  An offered view may not be right, and it may be flawed.  By extending the notion of Â“listeningÂ” however, both parties could probably broaden their perspectives, and discover flaws in their own Â“perfectÂ” beliefs, and perhaps formulate a more ideal one.<br><br>Although with that being a great benefit, the main idea is that while we uphold certain beliefs, it is essential that we are being equally sensitive to others who do not.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Asure (edited 05 October 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Asure:<br><br>We are infinitely egoistic.  For many people, a fair rule in life will be "I will try not to hurt others in my pursuit of life-goals."  Unsaid but clearly illustrated in each case is that "everyone can do whatever they want to just as long as he doesn't step on my toes."  If the whole thing can be summarized into 1 short sentence, what we want to say is "It's mine."  It is my right to do this, it is my right not to be hurt, that belongs to me,  mine, mine, mine!<br><br>Afterall, what is the world if "me" doesn't exist?  I am my consciousness and without this everything doesn't matter.  Thus all our actions, even if we pretend to be enlightened and do it for the greater good of all (see that posession still matters, "our good!") it still boils down to the dont step on my toes rule.<br><br>I repeat, everything else doesn't matter.<br><br>------------------<br>"A compliment graciously bestowed -when ungraciously refused- shall not be repeated again."<br>Miss Mable Hornburry's Guide to An Unperturbed Living</div>
