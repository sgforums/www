              <p>At $1200 you can only get temps to run your "half" projects.....and the person will RUN....Even good employees will not respect the company because he/She was not treated in a dignify way as a human being....</p>

              if sean-daboleh is with HR in the company already. but if he is with recruitment agency jialeh! as you know recruiters want to make money. jobs that stays means no jobs for them. so when you combined a HR and a sales = recruiters always be careful.
              
              project handling? what big MNC? if only simple project phrased as "project" handling maybe okay lah.
              
              like a client wants A4 papers. you received the request and submit quaotation and options.. they review accept one you work on the PO and elivery and sent the papers over later. this can also be simple project handling.
              
              project handling can also be something like a testing equipment. client wants a testing equipment to test their products. they state the requirements and you work with your design engineering team on it. submit the proposal for customer review. once approved the test equipment made and delivered to client. off course you required to tackle all garbbages issues along the way.
              
              construction. starts from land survey and drawings preparation, draft submission and approval to authorities, the building construation all the sheet along the way, commissioning and testing, hand over.
              
              so whcih one type is it?

              here these are engineers job. if you want test and commissioning the title even an assistant won't do. its like protocol. commisssioning needs an engineer's signature, more so some need senior or management signature depends on complexity. 1.2k like i wrote is only for those retail or maybe small not sophisicated 'projects'. pays more than operator fuctory but less than technician junior level. even autocad operators going freelance or for a company get paied like least 1.5k or 1.6k junior and engineers handling everything (cad to coordiantion to supervising test and prep for commisioning) paid at least 2k and up. large oil refinery plant, off shore or machinery land projects 3k up and more also got.

              really has got nothing to do with new old person. cometimes its good to have one person to handle the project. but remember there are many other points to note because you own the project but still need other departments people to help you complete the project.
                      
              if the project always cocks up a new person may solve the problem.
                      
              its the salary. really unless its some retail low ended projects the salary its enough to hire a junior tech, senior operator or experience line leader, inspector, warehouse assistant, admin assistant etc.
