              <p>To talk about investing, you first have to have sufficient base capital such that there is spare cash... It's not just about investing wisely early...</p>
              <p>It's possible, but not easy to achieve all 4 at one go. Perhaps you want to lead a lifestyle like me.... which leaves little time to stone or slack around... 44 hours work week at full time job, plus 20 hours (might go up to 24 hours anytime for this year) for tuition per week</p>
              <p>Free time spent on reading up and researching and deciding on what type of investments, and what type of investment strategies are better for me, enriching on world events to help make better decisions. Also spend time with gf, and occasionally some with family.</p>
              <p>Finally, for the previous week, exercise is Tue 5.30pm, Thu 11.30pm, Sat 11pm, go run about 2.6 ~ 3 km, Mon, Fri and Sun is go gym.... Short exercises, but intense enough to sweat and get tired.</p>

              <p>be contend.. and set ur expectation..</p>
              <p>honestly, rich and happy seldom goes together unless u urself determined how "rich" you want. </p>
              <p>I feel if U ignore the minor things, live within your means, be contend with what you have, you will be really happy..</p>
              <p>once the "I want" comes, even if U rich, healthy,  gf, U won't be happy.</p>

              <p>Just a few tips that I thought I'd offer:</p>
              <p>1) Study hard; it contributes to your wealth-building efforts. Don't listen to the losers out there who lick ass at their studies and dissuade you from succeeding academically. This is Singapore -- an education offers you way more than just employment opportunities.</p>
              <p>2) Cut the crap out and grow up. Got a PSP? Throw that shit away, you're better off using your efforts learning or interacting with people. Like to play WoW? Cut that shit out too. It never did anything for anybody; if you want to succeed, you have to behave like a disciplined person. And stop all that partying crap that drains your wealth and makes you feel stupid. If you want sex, which is basically why guys go to clubs anyway, get a girlfriend. I can assure you none of the idiots who play DotA and WoW is going to make it in life as long as they keep that shit up. Girls, no more Desperate Housewives, XOXO Gilmore Girls and America's Next Top Model. Get your life in order, come on.</p>
              <p>3) Learn how to invest and stop spending money like it's a constant. Saving is a prerequisite to investing. Also, run a part-time business; be creative. Many self-made millionaire entrepreneurs made it online running their business with no employees (plentyoffish.com, craigslist.org, 4chan.org, etc.). Learn from people like them. It's no secret that stocks, real estate and small business are the key engines to wealth generation.</p>
              <p>4) Find a physical activity that you enjoy and do it once or twice weekly. For example, I enjoy gymnastics so I join a cheerleading squad that lets me do my thing and keeps me stuck to a regular schedule. Stop eating all that junk that makes you feel like shit, like instant noodles, crackers, biscuits, etc. Sleep well and drink a lot of water. Never neglect your health no matter what, because your health is a prerequisite to achieving anything.</p>
              <p>5) Keep your social circle wide. Mingle around with people, network and get to know both guys and girls alike. Build up your social skills. With an education, wealth, health and self-confidence, the girlfriend will come naturally. Don't sweat over this aspect of your life; get the other aspects in order first.</p>

              <p>money - invest early wisely. I know for a fact that wages
              alone are not enough, at least in singapore, if you are to lead a
              minimal life. I.e. get house, small car, send kids to uni, and
              retirement. In fact i've seen the calculations before and they
              don't even meet half the requirements. CPF and bank returns are
              pathetic. The only way i can think of to get that extra cash is to
              invest early and invest wisely(early to take advantage of
              compounding, and wisely(duh))</p>
              <p>Happiness - Live by your own standards. Too often i see people
              unhappily preoccupied with what others think too afraid to
              challenge the standards of 'society' that is most of the time
              grossly mistaken. They are more afraid of being alienated from
              other people than being alienated from themselves. The solution of
              course is to listen to your inner signals and judgements more often
              and re-cultivate your autonomy</p>
              <p>Girlfriend - cant advise LoL to each his own</p>

              <p>Define happy. What makes u happy? Everyone has each of their kind of happiness and they do not necessary apply to everyone. U can be rich, have flocks of gf, super fit, yet unhappy.</p>
              <p>After going thru my life till now, I can say that only u urself can define ur happiness. Write down on a piece of paper what u want  and what u want to achieve. This mental achievement is much more better than material success.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: I do not think not having a bf/gf is a big deal. I have seen a lot threads asking what's wrong with the gals/guys cos they are still single now. My point is u dont wait for them to drop from sky, you fight for it. Same goes for being rich and healthy. ;) </p>

              <p>TS, you listed 4 things.</p>
              <p>1) rich</p>
              <p>2) happy</p>
              <p>3) have gf</p>
              <p>4) healthy</p>
              <p>You have to ask yourself which is the most impt thing to you. Some people can be very rich but they are not happy as they are old already. Some have gf but their gf are fat and ugly.</p>
              <p>Some people are poor, unhealthy, no gf but they still lead happy life.</p>
