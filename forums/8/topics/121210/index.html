I guess as a woman we understand, like how I appreaciate my hubby being with me when I need someone when I am feeling down. That someone close and someone you trust and love. I think in the end, there is no way we can say anything about right or wrong of what she is doing, cos no one can understand exactly how she feel  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
