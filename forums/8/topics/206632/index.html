Rouse)<br>Newsgroups: alt.paranet.ufo,alt.alien.visitors,alt.conspiracy<br>Subject: Moon and Mars Bases<br>Date: 24 Aug 93 16:20:45 GMT<br><br>The Germans landed on the Moon as early as probably 1942, utilizing their larger exoatmospheric rocket saucers of the Miethe and Schriever type. The Miethe rocket craft was built in diameters if 15 and 50 meters, and the Schriever Walter turbine powered craft was designed as an interplanetary exploration vehicle. It had a diameter of 60 meters, had 10 stories of crew compartments, and stood 45 meters high. Welcome to Alice in Saucerland. In my extensive research of dissident American theories about the physical conditions on the Moon I have proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that there is atmosphere, water and vegetation on the Moon, and that man does not need a space suit to walk on the Moon. A pair of jeans, a pullover and sneakers are just about enough. Everything NASA has told the world about the Mood is a lie and it was done to keep the exclusivity of the club from joinings by the third world countries. All these physical conditions make it a lot more easier to build a Moon base.<br><br>Ever since their first day of landing on the Moon, the Germans started boring -and tunneling under the surface, and by the end of the war there was a small Nazi research base on the Moon. The free energy tachyon drive craft of the Haunibu-1 and 2 type were used after 1944 to haul people," materiel and the first robots to the construction site on the Moon. When Russians and Americans secretly landed jointly on the Moon in the early fifties with their own saucers, they spent their first night there as guests of the .... Nazi underground base. In the sixties a massive Russian - American base had been built on the Moon, that now has a population of 40,000 people, as the rumor goes. After the end of the war in May 1945, the Germans continued their space effort from their south polar colony of Neu Schwabenland. I have discovered a photograph of their underground space control center there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its quite possible, since Hitler was a big cultist who built large laboratories underground in Germany to do his 'experiments on captives' and 'satanic worshipping'. his men also invented the 'saucer' a type of hovercraft vehicle shaped like a flying saucer which unfortunately didnt work too well. given their technology - they built the biggest long-ranged artillery - this was why hitler was able to conquer so much in so short a time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hitler was heavily influenced by his advisor on the occult realms. Stuff like underground civilisation possessing the power of immortality and powers vastly superior than Earthlings etc are in his belief. He even commission teams to find the ways to enter the underworld and look for all related information to this mysterious civilisation.<br><br>The rocket/missile design and concepts may even be garnered from all those forays into the mysterious realms for all we know. With this mysterious realm he believe to be hosting a superior race, he order the massacre of Jews which pose a threat to his vision of his superior Aryan race. This Aryan race could be his equivalent to the mysterious underground civilisation he has been searching for so long.<br><br></div>
