Yes. Everything you did was wrong. And No, theres is no need for you to eat humble pie. The choice is yours.<br><br>2.  And No, I do not favour her. Everytime I say something that says you are wrong, you take the easy way out, instead of looking inwards at yourself, you push the issue back to me by saying I am taking SC's side.
