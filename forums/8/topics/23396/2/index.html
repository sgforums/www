            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Please understand that your previous posts shows you favour SC more. </strong><br><br>Point me to an example. I have never ever said that she was right or that I defended her.<br><br><strong>If u had asked me to issue an apology, then why don't u ask her to do so too ?</strong><br><br>I am not asking you to issue an apology to me or to anyone for that fact. You said that you wanted to get over it. I suggested that a way was to make a public apology to show that you realise that what you did was wrong and move on. ( As you seem to have implied that you did this because you had no choice, and that you didn't like publishing details on the internet. )<br><br><strong>I am not taking an easy way out, if I had wanted I would not have replied you !</strong><br><br>Frankly speaking, I think you feel that you no longer have a choice but to retort to my statements. I see that you have made yourself very comfortable here and have stopped posting details like before. Thats good. But to continue here, you feel that you must now defend your honour.<br><br>Stopping is one thing, trying to correct the wrong is another.<br><br>Imagine.. a man kills another man. Then he kills the man's wife, then he kills the man's son, then the man's daughter.. suddenly, he realises that he is wrong. He stops killing. Does that mean that he is now in the clear and forgiven. What about those he had already killed ?<br><br>Now before you go all crazy and say that you never kill anyone and for me to stop accusing you of bloody murder. This is just an example to clearly illustrate what I am trying to tell you.<br><br>I hope you get my drift. If not, please don't go crazy, as mentioned previously, I am trying to maintain a sane and intelligent discussion. If you feel that you are not up to it..let me know.<br><br><strong>I did and still do look at this issue at all angles, and I'm not pushing away responsibilities.</strong><br><br>Then stop saying that I am siding with SC just because I say you are wrong. Fact of the matter is, maybe she is wrong too. If you feel happy only if she gets blame too, fine.. shes at fault. Step back..think..did it make you feel better..? Let me know. It helps me understanding your thinking process better.<br><br><strong>I just want everybody involved to be fair and impartial !</strong><br><br>What you want for people around to say that what you did was right. And that you shouldn't back off. And that you are the hero, the champion of the rights of all men who have been dumped and cheated on. When you recieve comments that make you feel that you are right, then its fair and impartial. When comments are made to the effect that you are wrong, the comment becomes unfair and biased.<br><br>Waiting for your feedback and please stop using !!!! unnecessarily.. it has a negative conotation..</div>

In which case, the action meaning the false police report filed by SC to get rid of me. </strong><br><br>Pardon me, but you're beginning to sound like a kid again. I thought you wanted a serious discussion. Just imagine 2 kids in the back of a car, one hits the other and the other hits back. No one wants to apologise, "its your fault!!!", "you say sorry first..!!", "No you say sorry first..!!"....No one wants to admit their wrong doing.. "You say sorry then I say sorry..". This kind of mentality is what leads to war in the adult world. Because leaders with childish mentality wants to be right only...<br><br><strong>The reaction being my exposure of her to the public for her wrong doing ! When I said I needed impartial comments, I meant you should have also asked SC to apologize for what she'd done, besides just asking me to take "damage control mode " on your part. What abt SC ? </strong><br><br>Firstly, I don't think you believe that what you did what wrong. You believe that it was justice. Your brand of justice. While she has falsely accused you in a report, the damage was limited to a very small group. What you did was a 1000 times more destructive. You let the entire internet community into the private moments she shared with you. Now the internet is not just Singapore mind you. No one can predict how far it went.. So the damage you have inflicted on her was many many many more times than what she did on you ( And I don't condone what she did as well, I would be mad if it was me ). And BTW the damage control was not so that it would prove that you are wrong and she is right. Its just a necessary act for you to move on in life..<br><br><strong>Myself and SC are in the wrong, but she was the one who started this mess, and it's right for her to take part in cleaning up the mess operation too ! This is fair to all parties, and not just one party making the first move or vice versa.<br></strong><br><br>Look back at the story I was trying to share with you about the 2 kids.<br><br><strong>MB if you want me to request that past threads be removed, you should also ask SC to retract the false police report filed against me in showing her sincerity for an amicable settlement of this long standing issue. </strong><br><br>This last statement shows very clearly that you do not want to move on.. You want justice and you don't care if you step on innocent people along the way. You want the threads to stay where there are so that you feel like a man. This is the "You say sorry than I say sorry" mentality. Grow up and be the man you say you are.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MB, just to set the record straight with you once and for all, I do not want to start any threads on SC and myself in the first place !<br>I never wanted to publicise this kind of sensitive information on the net.<br>I never wanted to be a "hero" or get any innocent parties involved.<br>Neither do I want to shame SC or her relatives etc.<br>I always believed in giving her a second or even a third chance.<br>Infact, if she had told me her intentions, I would have helped her without a second thought to achieve her objective.<br>But remember, when I myself was jeopardised by this kind of false police report, the consequences could have been worst than what u have described !<br>It's not just a small group of people knowing what happened, but it will be national news had I been charged in court !<br>So, ever wonder what if the police believed in SC story and filed harassment charges against me ?<br>So, will u tell me to sing a different tune then ?<br>Or, you still think I should have swallowed my pride and just forget what she'd done to me ?<br>Sorry man, I am not as forgiving like you if that's the case !<br>It's very easy on your part to make such judgement and tell me to forget about the incident and move on etc !<br>Why ?<br>Because you were never in my shoes, and say your prayers that you were never or ever be in my shoes, as it's not an easy path to walk on !<br>Neither is it childishness for me to expose her in this manner, but I think the solution I had prescribed has to fit the "crime", so she'll think twice before doing that again, and I mean no more future false police report on her part on any other innocent party !<br>Myself and SC will move on, or shall we say have to move on, as we are both hurt in different manners.<br>The future is still bright, and I'm sure we'll find greener pastures to walk on instead of the old path we have taken in the past.<br>So, if you have not spoken to SC, I suggest you have a word with her and tell her what she'd done wrong and tell her never to do that again.<br>You seem to like to mind what's on my end, but I suggest that you be impartial and also tick the other part off for the action she'd done that sparked the reaction from me !<br>It's not the "you say sorry first, then I say sorry" attitude, but what she'd done to me hurt me so much to come to this action / solution, hence, it's fair of me to keep things as they are until I get an apology from her before I make corrections for her !<br>If she thinks that by making a false police report against me to rid me is right, I will just let the threads remain as they are everywhere.<br>I am open to discussions and solutions, and the ball is on SC court.<br>It's her chance to make the first move, not me on "damage control" mode.<br>She started the fire, so, she should be the one bringing in the fire brigade to help put out the fire.<br>Remember  it's not childishness, but in fairness to all, she should make the first move as highlighted earlier.<br>In anycase, I thank you for your interest and participation on this matter and related threads elsewhere.<br>Good day !<br><br></div>
