              <p>that is without a doubt true... i have been to several 'learn hokkien' sites with absolutely no standard basis in their transcriptions during my endeavours of self-learning and found them completely impossible to comprehend without my mom on standby to try and interpret for me with her limited and mostly forgotten knowledge of hokkien spoken with her primary school mates, however i have managed to chance upon some extremely useful chinese-taiwanese online dictionary sites with proper 'pinyin' and even sound players pronouncing every character. unsurprisingly though, another chinese-taiwanese online dictionaries used different 'pinyin' -.- but thankfully, same pronounciations so it didnt really matter that much. however the fact that it was completely in ç¹�é«”å­— and TAIWANESE didnt help me learn local singaporean hokkien. Thus far i am proficient in 'formal' hokkien per say but completely clueless on local hokkien slangs e.t.c with the exception of the common ones like siam, diam, bo pien, vulgarities e.t.c.</p>

              <p><br>to learn to transcribe Hokkien is something which needs learning, patience, training, time, effort, interest</p>
              <p>transcribing using IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) or the popular Taiwanese POJ (PeÌ�h-Å�e-jÄ«) so far are the best and most accurate</p>
              <p>an example of what is transcribe using IPA without indication of the 7-tones of Hokkien is shown here: <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2956/topics/352742">http://sgforums.com/forums/2956/topics/352742</a></p>
              <p>IPA and POJ can capture the unique vowels of Hokkien. They can represent the 7 tones and it's tone-sandhi with clarity.</p>

              <p><br>in standard Xiamen (Amoy) variety</p>
              <p>names of the 7 tones for isolated characters &lt;&gt; contour in the 5-degree scale:</p>
              <p>é˜´å¹³ &lt;&gt; 44</p>
              <p>é˜³å¹³ &lt;&gt; 24</p>
              <p>é˜´ä¸Š &lt;&gt; 53</p>
              <p>é˜´åŽ» &lt;&gt; 21</p>
              <p>é˜³åŽ» &lt;&gt; 22</p>
              <p>é˜´å…¥ &lt;&gt; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">32</span> (underlined means clipped tone, or å…¥å£°)</p>
              <p>é˜³å…¥ &lt;&gt; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">4</span> (underlined means clipped tone, or å…¥å£°)</p>
              <p>be prepared to see works in which the tones contours are intepreted differently (for example é˜´å¹³ as 55, é˜³å¹³ as 35, é˜´ä¸Š as 51, é˜´åŽ» as 11, é˜³åŽ» as 33, é˜´å…¥ as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">21</span>, and é˜³å…¥ as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">55</span>).  you will notice that even though they are interpreted differently, the tone contours remain the same (a level tone remains a level tone, a falling tone remains a falling tone, a low tone remains a low range, a high tone remain in the high range). therefore these little difference are just due to the subjective interpretation on individual authors.</p>
              <p>also be prepared to see works in which it says there are 5 tones or 8 tones.</p>
              <p>works that state there are only 5 tones usually disregard the last two clipped tones (the underlined <span style="text-decoration: underline;">32</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">4</span>) as variations of the first 5 relaxed tones</p>
              <p>works that state there are 8 tones are usually describing the æ³‰å·ž (QuanZhou / ChuanChiu) variety of Hokkien. In QuanZhou dialect, isolated characters has only 7 tones, but the åŽ»å£° words will undergo 2 types of tone-sandhi depending on whether it is é˜´åŒº or é˜³åŽ», therefore in reality there are 8 tones.</p>
              <p>as a practice, I follow the commonly accepted number of tones for the 6 following common languages (or dialects if you would like to call it) that you can find in Singapore:</p>
              <p>Hakka (æ¢…åŽ¿/MeiXian/MoiYen variety) 6 tones</p>
              <p>Hainanese (æ–‡æ˜Œ/WenChang/BoonShio variety) 6 tones</p>
              <p>Hokkien (åŽ¦é—¨/XiaMen/Amoy/E-Mng variety) 7 tones</p>
              <p>Hockchiu (ç¦�å·ž/FuZhou/HukChew variety) 7 tones</p>
              <p>Teochew (æ±•å¤´/ShanTou/Swatow variety) 8 tones</p>
              <p>Cantonese (å¹¿å·ž/GuangZhou/KwongTsau variety) 9 tones</p>

              <p><br>what mancha say is absolutely correct.</p>
              <p>you must immerse yourself into a Hokkien speaking environment to pick out language. just like a baby who donno how to read and write but know how to speak first by listening and imitating</p>
              <p>and also what popmynutsy say is also correct</p>
              <p>singapore/malacca/penang/johor/indonesian hokkien has integrated malay vocabulary which makes itself special from taiwanese and china hokkien</p>
              <p>addressing your query on IPA</p>
              <p>you can find the definition of International Phonetic Alphabet in the internet yourself first.</p>
              <p>i will demonstrate how IPA works beautifully for Hokkien here instead:</p>
              <p>like what mancha said: "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bo ah, le anchua mah si buay kong ay.</span>"</p>
              <p>transcribed in IPA without tones, for Xiamen variety: "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">bo a, li an tsÅ©ã ma si bue kÉ”Å‹ e</span>"</p>
              <p>with tones + tone-sandhi: "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">bo(24) a(0), li(35 or 53) an(22 or 55 or 53) tsÅ©ã(35 or 53) ma(11) si(11) bue(11) kÉ”Å‹(53) e(0)</span>"</p>
              <p>comparing mancha's transciption and my IPA transciption, u'll notice:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>i omitted the (<strong>h</strong>) for (<strong>ah</strong>) and (<strong>mah</strong>), since adding a (<strong>h</strong>) adds another puff of sound which is not needed in this case</li>
              <li>mancha used (<strong>le</strong>) while i used (<strong>li</strong>). it is apparent that mancha is following our standard Singaporean Hokkien variety. if I were to transcribe faithfully mancha's variety into IPA, it would be (<strong>lÉ¯</strong>)</li>
              <li>mancha used (<strong>chua</strong>) while i used (<strong>tsÅ©ã</strong>). (<strong>ts</strong>) represents the dental affricate in IPA. the 2 tildes above (<strong>Å©</strong>) and (<strong>ã</strong>) shows that the vowel is fully nasalized</li>
              <li>mancha used (<strong>buay</strong>) and (<strong>ay</strong>) while i used (<strong>bue</strong>) and (<strong>e</strong>). the symbol (<strong>e</strong>) can take the place of 2 characters (<strong>ay</strong>), which is more efficient</li>
              <li>mancha used (<strong>kong</strong>) while i used (<strong>kÉ”Å‹</strong>). the symbol (<strong>É”</strong>) represents an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"o" with your mouth opened wider</span> while the symbol (<strong>o</strong>) represents an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"o" with your mouth opened smaller</span>. in the case of spoken Hokkien, there is a distinction between (<strong>o</strong>) and (<strong>É”</strong>), however when coupled with (<strong>Å‹</strong>), the distinction between (<strong>oÅ‹</strong>) and (<strong>É”Å‹</strong>) is lost, therefore some authors notate as (<strong>oÅ‹</strong>) for the sake of simplicity. the symbol (<strong>Å‹</strong>) represents "ng", which is more efficient</li>

              <p>Ap0cAlySm,</p>
              <p>I'm a Taiwanese who has been living in Singapore for most of my life. Although Mandarin is my best Chinese language, I also speak fluent Taiwanese Minnan (Hokkien). I've been interested in Hokkien dialect since last year and had been finding time to 'study' it in the hope of advancing my Hokkien.</p>
              <p>Taiwanese Minnan had over the past 20 years fast become the 'standard' Hokkien due to mass propagation of Taiwanese Hokkien drama and Pop Songs. Taiwan has become the center of Hokkien culture, just like Hong Kong's position in the cantonese world.</p>
              <p>Although I speak Taiwanese Minnan, I'm also familiar with local Singaporean Hokkien. Nevertheless, if you want to learn good proper Hokkien, Taiwanese Minnan would still be the prefered one. Singaporean Hokkien has been corrupted to a large degree by many imported Malay words, Teochew and Cantonese such that it's no longer pure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you wish to find a conversational partner to practise or learn Hokkien (free of course), you're free to contact me at jowyh2109@gmail.com . We can meet up and I can teach you Hokkien.</p>

                  fluent Taiwanese Minnan (Hokkien). I've been interested in Hokkien
                  dialect since last year and had been finding time to 'study' it in
                  the hope of advancing my Hokkien.</p>
              <p>Taiwanese Minnan had over the past 20 years fast become the
                  'standard' Hokkien due to mass propagation of Taiwanese Hokkien
                  drama and Pop Songs. Taiwan has become the center of Hokkien
                  culture, just like Hong Kong's position in the cantonese world.</p>
              <p>Although I speak Taiwanese Minnan, I'm also familiar with local
                  Singaporean Hokkien. Nevertheless, if you want to learn good proper
                  Hokkien, Taiwanese Minnan would still be the prefered one.
                  Singaporean Hokkien has been corrupted to a large degree by many
                  imported Malay words, Teochew and Cantonese such that it's no
                  longer pure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you wish to find a conversational partner to practise or
                  learn Hokkien (free of course), you're free to contact me at
                  jowyh2109@gmail.com . We can meet up and I can teach you
                  Hokkien.</p>

              <p>I agree that without a doubt Singaporean Hokkien has been corrupted by other languages, but then, the isolation from China Hokkien has also lead Singaporean Hokkien to preserve older features which are losing ground in respective China Hokkien varieties</p>

              <p>Other than the Minnan (hokkien) experts from China, I would say most of world's experts on Minnan language (hokkien) are from Taiwan. The Minnan (Hokkien) language and culture in Taiwan is of a high standard largely because there is a government-funded culture body devoted to supporting it. Not only is Hokkien taught in Schools in Taiwan, Taiwan also has a flourishing literary circle comprising of Hokkien poets and writers, who write in Taiwanese Minnan language. Of course, you won't miss the flourishing Hokkien media and pop scene from Taiwan.</p>
              <p>Though most Taiwanese are able to speak Minnan, the majority still cannot write in Minnan. It was only the last 20 years in Taiwan that linguists was able to standardize the appropriate Chinese characters used for expressing Hokkien. It would still take more years for the Hokkien language to become widespread in written form.</p>
              <p>Bangulzai, you're probably the only Singapore Hokkien expert I've seen.</p>
              <p>I'm not a linguist or expert on Hokkien, but I'm trying to learn and pick up Taiwanese Minnan.</p>

              </ul>
              <p></p>
              <p>Answer:</p>
              <p>
              </p><ul>
              <li>Apparently, people who have only learned how to write in Mandarin Chinese will try to write as ä½ è¦�å�ƒ but read as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Li Ai Tsiah</span>.<br></li>
              <li>People who have understood and knows Minnan inside out knows that the original characters for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Li Ai Tsiah</span> is apparently æ±�çˆ±é£Ÿ</li>
              <li>ä¸½çˆ±ç”² is the most corrupt version which matches only in pronunciation and thus no meaning unless read out in Mandarin Chinese to approximate the sound<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>
              <p>Dilemma and Solutions:</p>
              <p>I will present the problem if we write as ä½ è¦�å�ƒ or ä¸½çˆ±ç”² (or whatever made-up characters).</p>
              <p>
              </p><ul>
              <li>No doubt ä½ è¦�å�ƒ brings out the meaning in both Mandarin Chinese and Minnan, but it does not bring out the actual pronunciation in Minnan.  A Minnan thus can choose to read it as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Li Yiau K'hik</span> (literary pronunciation of the 3 characters) instead of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Li Ai Tsiah</span> (the pronunciation that we want)</li>
              <li>ä¸½çˆ±ç”² is worst, as both ä¸½ and ç”² has a corresponding Minnan pronunciation of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ley</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kah</span>, thus if one is not smart enough to <span style="color: #ff0000;">guess (<span style="font-weight: bold;">keyword: guessing game</span>)</span>, you can even read it as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ley Ai Kah</span> (which has no meaning)<br></li>
              <li>Therefore, the only solution is to find the original characters (in linguistic terminology is called: æœ¬å­—),  and no matter the meaning or the pronunciation will be correct in Minnan</li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>

              <li>ä¸½çˆ±ç”² is the most corrupt version which matches only in pronunciation and thus no meaning unless read out in Mandarin Chinese to approximate the sound<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Dilemma and Solutions:</p>
              <p>I will present the problem if we write as ä½ è¦�å�ƒ or ä¸½çˆ±ç”² (or whatever made-up characters).</p>
              <ul>
              <li>No doubt ä½ è¦�å�ƒ brings out the meaning in both Mandarin Chinese and Minnan, but it does not bring out the actual pronunciation in Minnan.  A Minnan thus can choose to read it as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Li Yiau K'hik</span> (literary pronunciation of the 3 characters) instead of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Li Ai Tsiah</span> (the pronunciation that we want)</li>
              <li>ä¸½çˆ±ç”² is worst, as both ä¸½ and ç”² has a corresponding Minnan pronunciation of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ley</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kah</span>, thus if one is not smart enough to <span style="color: #ff0000;">guess (<span style="font-weight: bold;">keyword: guessing game</span>)</span>, you can even read it as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ley Ai Kah</span> (which has no meaning)<br></li>
              <li>Therefore, the only solution is to find the original characters (in linguistic terminology is called: æœ¬å­—),  and no matter the meaning or the pronunciation will be correct in Minnan</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Feel free to give any examples from your side for me to expound or explain too, if the above is not being conveyed to you in a clear manner.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"It based on tone sound to learn hokkien in taiwan"</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>all languages learners based on tone and sounds to learn language, starting from babies.   language acquisition is always spoken ones before written ones,  so it applies to all languages including hokkien</li>

              <p>Jiaguwen is both applicable to mandarin as well as hokkien because both languages (or dialects if u wanna call them) utilises the Modern Chinese Script which is decended from Jiaguwen</p>
              <p>Example:</p>
              <p>you can write Jiaguwen for é¾™ï¼š</p>

              <p>if you know how to read Jiaguwen and you know both Mandarin Chinese and Hokkien, you will still be reading it as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lóng</span> in Mandarin Chinese  or  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Leng / Liong</span> in Hokkien without any difficulty</p>
