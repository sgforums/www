              <p>Hmm....</p>
              <p>Uncle do not think that by learning Hokkien up to a fluent level, will satisfy your spiritual needs of searching your roots.</p>
              <p>I more recommend that you talk to your parents, ask them about their roots, and then if possible, look at your family tree line and clan.</p>
              <p>If possible, it will be even better if you plan a trip to China to your father's and mother's ancestral villages.</p>
              <p>I did that when I was in my teens.</p>
              <p>Our family still have some relatives there.</p>
              <p>I dont think if you learn Hokkien language, it will satisfy you or it will achieve a kind of purpose.</p>

              <p>coz most people have not learnt Internation Phonetic Alphabet</p>
              <p>everyone will come up with their own transciption</p>
              <p>it will confuse him in the end</p>

              <p><br>don't worry</p>
              <p>Ap0cAlySm is a clever boy</p>
              <p>he won't be confused</p>
              <p>just that if everyone uses the International Phonetic Alphabet responsibly it can help him truly. if everyone is replying to the thread with fervent and enthusiasm but without some essence, the thread-method learning is gonna confuse him who's transcription is more correct or who's gone wrong</p>
              <p>else it just delays his learning process that's all</p>
              <p>you have to refer to my previous post to speak in that context</p>
