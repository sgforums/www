I think S$72 for personal training is standard...but in most cases, I feel its totally unnecessary (unless you're totally green to the gym, then it may be advisable). Might as well pay me S$71.99 and I'll train you lah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Or....<br><br>- Do some reading (books, magazines, internet).<br>- Go to the gym and see how others do it and copy a bit.<br>- Ask around your friends.<br>- Ask people in this forum (<a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=forum_display&amp;forum_id=1850" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=forum_display&amp;forum_id=1850</a>)<br><br>You see, the ultimate question in this case is.....are you comfortable working out (and being trapped by one-year's membership) in an atmosphere where you will be bombarded by high-pressured sales to buy something?  I guess this is very subjective....but taking up the 2 weeks free trial may be a good idea to get a feel of things.<br><br>Good luck.
