            <div class='col-md body'>Hiya ricardo79,<br><br>I'm sorry, I don't know about corporate memberships.<br><br>I joined Planet Fitness Suntec in 2004 through another organisation (corporate rates).  When I joined the gym, I was given a gym membership card, valid for the year of 2004.  Even if I had left the organisation (which I didn't), I think I would still have had access to the gym for 2004, since I would still be holding the gym membership card.<br><br>Yeah, what I heard was that California Fitness staff try to sell you nutritional supplements.  I don't know if it still happens.<br><br>I'm straight too leh.  From what I've seen, the gays usually go in pairs.  They are not really a bother.....well, at least not to me.  Even gays don't wanna look at me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  OK, honestly the only ONE time when I've noticed them looking at me was in the changing room while I was changing.  Two of them were just sitting there pretending to talk....holding their handphones too.  Maybe they were taking pictures.  But I don't care lah....look and take all they want.  I'll even make friends with them....just that I'm straight.<br><br>I've had many people (all guys) approach me while working out.  As I have an unorthodox way of working out, all they ever asked was "what the hell are you doing?" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  One guy even called me 'sir' ("sir, what the hell are you doing?" ) .<br><br>As for your question about free gym access from credit cards....I suspect that there must be a catch.  Either limited entry, or for a limited period only, etc.  I'm not 100% sure about this though.....<br><br></div>

I have never been to CF.<br><br>There is what i think:<br><br>My feeling is that the env in FF is more "plush" compared with PF and is also less crowded then PF. But I really miss the buzz in PF, which is way is stayed on at PF. FF has "free" workout attire so u don't have to bring ur own... but it is werid when everyone seems to wear the same... like a prison camp like that.. also when the gals wear that loose attire not nice lah... nicer when they are wearing skimpy workout clothes.<br><br>Since u r working in RP and intend to workout 2-3 times a week, it might make sense to join one of the 3 gyms.Clubfit is cheaper for further and i heard is even more crowded.<br><br>For PF, when u turn up at one of the clubs they will give u a club tour and tell u the membership... and then u should be given a 1 week free pass. So in this one week u can turn up and try out all the faciities and classes..... and then decide. On week later, the fitness consultants will call u and ask u if u like to join.<br><br>Do u ve credit cards? Many Cards have free passes like twice a month and so on.. i think the uOB mini card got it.... but i heard that PF have completely do away with this already but i think u can still get free entry into CF.<br><br>So from the abvoe, you can have a feel of all the gyms.....<br><br>If u got credit cards, there might be some which will give good rates... asked the consultants whether got any promotion or link with credit cards or not. can also have inteerest free installment plan.<br><br>One impt thing is to "bargain". i think they are quite flexible...... esp if u look keen to join but will only do so at lessor cost....<br><br>Hope that helps and good luck.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMO, CF has by far the best equipment judging by what I've seen of FF and PF about a year or more ago.  However, CF is probably the worst in terms of personalised services.  If you're into serious gyming, then CF is the choice, but it can get very crowded.<br><br>Chicks-wise, there are only occasional headturners in CF.  I think the chicks prefer the less hardcore, more service-oriented gyms.  There are many quality gays in CF though, if you're into that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if u want to "save" on gym gear... then join FF.

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing i hate about those commercial gyms is that they are so engrossed in the science-thingy of weightlifting that it feds me up, my god.In the past times, people did not bother abt this Sh*T and yet were as strong/stronger than modern people.<br><br>Seriously i feel that in clubfitt gyms, people train more seriously and are much more dedicated.Did you know that in the CDANS strongman competition this year, much of the strongman did not have fancy gyms?They went to neighbourhood gyms like fengshan cc or yishun clubfitt and yet are quite strong.<br><br>I feel that in commercial gyms people are so obessed in clothing and men/women rather than doing their exercise seriously</div>
