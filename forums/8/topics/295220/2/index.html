North indians are fairer and south indians are much darker. thats all. And south indians have got sharper features (personal observation, might be wrong though). I know because my good friend in the army is north indian, and he is dead proud of being one. He likes only north indian girls and all he talk abt is his race.<br><br>Regarding indians not being a pure race, thats only partially true because there are many type of indians, and the indian civilisation being one of the three first civilisations in the world (egyptians and chinese are the other two), there will be pure indians. Certainly, for some races, its not pure cos of land closeness and its not surprising that they are mixed. Nepalese are considered indians in a sense, but they look very chinese, like chinese but dark skinned.<br><br></div></blockquote>north indians aren't pure themselves...they're descended from the barbarians who invaded India...dravidians are the original inhabitants of india</div>
