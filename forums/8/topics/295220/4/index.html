There are scientifically speaking, no such things as Aryan or Dravidian races. The three primary races are Caucasian, the Mangolian and the Negroid. Both the Aryans and Dravidians are related branches of the Caucasian race generally placed in the same Mediterranean sub-branch. The difference between the so-called Aryans of the north and Dravidians of the south is not a racial division. Biologically bo th the north and south Indians are of the same Caucasian race, only when closer to the equator the skin becomes darker, and under the influence of constant heat the bodily frame tends to become a little smaller.

Indian descended from the caucasian ape !? You idiot this race difference is based on the characteristics of facial features(craniofacial anthropometry) and skin tone althought skin tone is by no means a sure way of identifying a persons ethnic group. And have you heard of the out of africa theory. When humans evolved from Homo Erectus to Homo Sapiens they migrated from the cradle of humanity Africa to other part of the world. They then evolved to Homo Sapien Sapien and whilst adapting to their geographic location and external environment they acquired certain features. And ape evolution is like a long way back before.

            <div class='col-md body'>oh wait you do know some stuff... you've mentioned that Aryans and Dravidian are infact Mediterrean sub of europids. Yup that's what Ive always thought. These north indians owe their more caucasoid appareance to mediterrean influence and not Aryan! $hit that they like to spout and be proud of which I find very annoying. Aryan means Indo-European... in layman's explanation blonde-haired, blue eyed, white skinned individuals so white that there's no difference between the regular Aryan and an albino Aryan. and by the way not all north indians are lighter skinned and not all south indians are darker skinned. And do you think by posting some light skinned tamil actresses(oh what the heck! almost always in tamil movies the heroine is lighter than the hero) you can covince people into believing that southies and northies are simillar(which I believe). if you ask me northies and southies are the same cr@p in the same ditch.northies are usually lighter shades of brown and at most wheat complexion and dravidian are darker shades of brown to approaching charcoal black.</div>

Yup that's what Ive always thought. These north indians owe their more caucasoid appareance to mediterrean influence and not Aryan! $hit that they like to spout and be proud of which I find very annoying. Aryan means Indo-European... in layman's explanation blonde-haired, blue eyed, white skinned individuals so white that there's no difference between the regular Aryan and an albino Aryan. and by the way not all north indians are lighter skinned and not all south indians are darker skinned. And do you think by posting some light skinned tamil actresses(oh what the heck! almost always in tamil movies the heroine is lighter than the hero) you can covince people into believing that southies and northies are simillar(which I believe). if you ask me northies and southies are the same cr@p in the same ditch.northies are usually lighter shades of brown and at most wheat complexion and dravidian are darker shades of brown to approaching charcoal black.</div></blockquote>now that's some racist shit right there...'same crap in the same ditch' indeed..and charcoal black indians??OMG..you've never seen a sudanese person have u? And don't think you're a genius too...If you checked my earlier posts I already talked about the first humans coming out of Africa and us being descended from apes is still just a THEORY..not scientific fact</div>
