I didn't say you WERE on drugs. Why take such offence at a statement if it's false? Read your  initial post and see how ignorant it is before trying to flame me. You might want to go whack the idiot who told you that we get tattoos to differentiate ourselves from north indians or if you just came up with that yourself then I have nothing to say.</div>
