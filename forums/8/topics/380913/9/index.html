              <div class="quote_body">The only problem arises when one thinks he is smarter or better
              than another. It is still ok, as it is only in his mind. It becomes
              an issue when he acts it out, by demeaning and humiliating others.
              Regardless if he is a Phd or a mechanic.
              <p>It may stoke one's ego to humiliate others out of pride, but it
              will only create friction, unproductive arguments and even breed
              hatred. No one favours elitism No one can claim a higher
              intelligence than another amongst our own species, for within that
              claim will need evidence to fully support, and who can claim to
              know EVERYTHING?</p>
              <p>Each and everyone of us have our own special gifts and talents,
              be he a Phd or mechanic, which we must never deny anyone of it. It
              is how we USE it for the benefit of the greater good
              that will either enhance our uniqueness, with applause from many
              people or twist it egoistically/selfishly and be spat

              <p>Ladies and Gents</p>
              <p>Thank you for providing inputs, information and data for the
              experiment. A lot of experiments were conducted to study human
              behavior under various conditions and environments. Every
              experiment involved using one or a set of stimulus to evoke a
              respond in the human subject being studied. The earliest study of
              human behavior is probably the Hawthorne experiment conducted in
              1924 to 1932. The experiment was conducted in the area of human
              productivity in a factory by varying the environment in which the
              workers worked in. There were also many studies conducted on human
              behavior on the internet. In this experiment, a “stimulus” was
              introduced into a forum. The “stimulus” was this statement :<br> o “Wrong.<br> They are not the smartest.<br> They think they are the smartest.<br> They behave as if they are the smartest.<br> I have met PhDs and 1st class honours monkeys who cannot solve
              simple problems.”<br> Additional “stimuli” in the form of “repetitive” statements such as
              “compliments”, “more shit please”, etc.. were also inserted every
              now and then, to gauge and increase the number of contribution.</p>
              <p>The following behaviors were observed :<br> 1. Interpretation of the statement above.<br> Note that the word used was “THEY”. I am not an expert in English
              language but I am confident to say that the word “THEY” does not
              mean “ALL”. A lot of the responses from the formers did not notice
              that and went on to take the word “THEY” to mean “ALL”. To them,
              the statement become :</p>
              <p>o “Wrong.<br> All of them are not the smartest.<br> All of them think they are the smartest.<br> All behave as if they are the smartest.<br> I have met PhDs and 1st class honours monkeys who cannot solve
              simple problems.”<br> After reading the first few responses, I said to myself that maybe
              I make a typo error and use “ALL” instead of “THEY”. If so, the
              experiment itself will be of no use. So I went back to the first
              page and check to make sure that that was not the case.<br> Then came the question : “How many…?”<br> I pluck a figure “THREE”. The responses I got from the forumers are
              still :<br> o “Wrong.<br> All of them are not the smartest.<br> All of them think they are the smartest.<br> All behave as if they are the smartest.<br> I have met PhDs and 1st class honours monkeys who cannot solve
              simple problems.”<br> It was pretty obvious that “THREE” does not mean “ALL”. The word
              “THEY” and “THREE” was extrapolated to mean “ALL”. And so comment
              such as “sweeping statement, unfair comment, one bamboo pole hit
              the whole boat load of people, etc, etc, ...” were posted.</p>
              <p>2. Fill in the blanks.<br> A “stimulus” statement was made. This statement does reveal many
              details except that it occurs in a work situation. Information such
              as these listed below are missing :<br> - what is the actual event that happened<br> - relationship between the people in that event, were they
              colleagues at same level or different<br> - if one of them the supervsior, then which one?<br> - was the statement made by some one not directly involved in the
              event, eg HR or people from another department<br> - what happened before and after the event<br> - was the boss aware or involved in the event, any action taken by
              the boss, etc…<br> In the absence of information, forumers began to “fill in the
              blanks” and interpreted their version of the event and made the
              associated comments.<br> The list of interpretations and comments are still being compiled
              and analysed.</p>
              <p>3. Hints<br> Hints were inserted into the forum in “disguised” form to gauge the
              alertness of the forumers as to whether this was an actual case
              that happened. To prevent hints from becoming too obvious,
              “stimulus” statement was attached to the hints eg :<br> “who is making monkey out of who? Read again the post….”<br> The first part is the “stimulus” statement to mask the second part
              which was the hint. The hint was to tell the forumers to read again
              the statement made in the beginning and hope that someone will
              notice the words “THEY”, “THREE” and not “ALL” was used. I could be
              wrong, but I think none of the forumers actually go back and read
              because the subsequent statements made were same as before.<br> There were also other hints, if interested to find out, go and read
              through again the entire episode!</p>
              <p>4. Use of emoticons<br> Emoticons are frequently used by formers to indicate their state of
              emotion. In this experiment, emoticons were used liberally by many
              of the forumers. I have encountered people who use emoticons on
              very post, every statement they made on the internet. I called
              these types of people as “emotional emoticoners”. Such people will
              probably suffer from some kind of emotional stress if they suddenly
              stopped using it. “Emotional emoticoners” were not observed in this
              experiment. Purpose of my experiment is also to try and analyse the
              state of emotion of the forumers when emoticons were used. Does the
              laughing (indicating happy, enjoying, etc..) emoticon really
              represent the actual emotions of the forumer when making that
              particular post? To do that, one needs to look at not just the
              statement containing the emoticon, but also the threads before and
              after the emoticon appear in that particular statement.</p>
              <p>5. Time<br> Forumers who responded are likely to be working adults. Students,
              retirees and people for some reasons who are not working may or may
              not have contributed some comments. 6 Nov, Friday starting from
              7.20am to 7.08pm, total eleven and a half hours, a typical working
              day. Some may start work earlier or later and some may end earlier
              or later. A total of 60 statements were made including the
              “stimuli” statements. Excluding the “stimuli” statements, time were
              spend on reading, rebutting, composing the thoughts and typing out
              the responses. I believe quite a chunk of time was taken up in the
              eleven and a half hours. Too bad that the time spend cannot be
              obtain from this experiment. This is one of the short coming.<br> NB. Bosses don’t like to read this. You people are supposed to be
              working. Not surfing sgforums!</p>
              <p>6. Internet fatique<br> How long before the interest in this particular subject last before
              the thread disappeared into the abyss of sgforums? A fast glance
              this morning, I saw the last post (excluding this one) was made on
              8 Nov 2.53pm. Reponses may continue to come in later so I have no
              answer to this question yet.</p>
              <p>One very clear conclusion from this experiment is that a lot
              (read – I didn’t say “ALL”, <span>LOL</span>) of people
              uses “heart power” rather than “brain power” when subjected to a
              set of stimuli. Fact finding was not exercised. Some personal
              details were reveal which in my opinion is not wise thing to do.
              Bosses and people with bad intention do and often trawl the
              internet for information. You never know…..</p>
              <p>For those who have contributed one way or another, willingly,
              unwillingly, wittingly, unwittingly, I like to say thank you again.
              With this, I wrap up the experiment. Those of you who felt so
              passionate about your beliefs and wish to go on debating, I hope
              all of you will use more of your “brain power” rather than “heart
              power”. Don’t just arm yourself to the teeth; get down to the
              trenches and fight, fight, fight.</p>

              <p>Amusing.  I have to admit that the effort Sheesh has put into this post is impressive.  Nonetheless, given that it's nowhere near fit for publishing, I'll take it as the homemade attempt at imitating research that it obviously is - any second-year undergrad could see how it's so full of holes that a sponge would look like a glass brick next to it.</p>
              <p>Then again, should the educated amongst us choose to have some fun picking it apart, I'm game to contribute.  Intellectual pinata, anyone?</p>

              <p>I doubt if there's all that much of a correlation between being a graduate and being non-entrepreneurial.  Certainly I'm not aware of any figures supporting the claim, but if you have any I'd be glad to take a look at them.</p>
              <p>Surely the prospect of a ready income and steady employment offered by one's chosen profession would be tempting compared to the amount of work involved in starting one's own business.  Given the income-earning years forsaken by the graduates during their years at university, surely the urge to get some income as soon as possible (rather than defer it while a new business gets off the ground) would be understandable?  Besides, we also need to account for the possibility that the graduate might actually have a genuine interest in the discipline studied, and may choose to pursue a career in said discipline.</p>
              <p>Strictly speaking, "smartness" can't be measured, if you take Spearman's <em>g</em> as the defintion of smartness.  For over a hundred years nobody's yet been able to do it.</p>
              <p>As Badz said, the claim of an experiment was made retroactively and given that there's not enough of an underlying rationale for said "experiment", little credence can be paid to the claim.</p>
