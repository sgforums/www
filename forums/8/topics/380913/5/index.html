              <p>I'm one of 7 graduates from a program that took 12 out of 1200 worldwide applicants, each of whom needed to have completed an Honours degree to be eligible for application in the first place.   That puts me in the top 0.03%.</p>
              <p>My clients pay $3500 a day for my services - you can assume it's done willingly since nobody holds a gun to their heads to sign the contracts.  Frankly, I think I'm going too cheap.</p>
              <p>There are 30 people in a country of 17 million who are capable of doing my work, and thus far I've only come across two who've really had anything new to show me.</p>
              <p>I'm not the best by any means - academically, I have at least 6 equals, technically I know that there are two people who are ahead of me, and I undercharge.  That blows your claim about best and smartest clear out of the water, although I doubt there's any disputing that I am the cream of the crop since the scope of that deifintion is broader.</p>
              <p>Right.  I've put my cards on the table.  What about you?  What have you achieved, and where do you stand in the world?  Actually, I'll take a step back - do you have any inkling of where you stand?</p>
              <p>As far as I can tell, you don't even have an undergrad degree, yet you have the unfettered temerity to invite me to collaborate on some absurdly nonsensical topic that is neither horse nor hare, worth not a single red cent.</p>
              <p>In light of that, yup, I'm a gawd-damned arrogant sonuvabitch and I make no secret of how poorly I think of you (in those rare moments when I do actually deem you fit for consideration, that is).  I'd question what your point is, since given our relative positions in the great scheme of things, I'm dealing with you in a perfectly justifiable fashion.</p>

              <p>The grad, phd, 1st honours think that they are smartest people in this world. They have no respect for others. If they really think and believe that they are really that smart, then how come a simple problem they cannot solve.

              <p>Then you start to boast that you are dammed smart, you earn alot, you are super superior over average humans.

              <p>I couldn't really care about being called an arrogant asshole as
              well - sometimes it happens pretty regularly in real life. Being
              called arrogant gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling in acknowledgement
              of my strengths in contrast to their weaknesses. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>So, is it a case of the graduates being arrogant, or the
              non-graduates who suffer from low self-esteem, thus the need to
              deceive themselves so as to lick their wounds of their hurt
              ego?</p>
              <p>Anyway, calling another person arrogant is almost effectively
              acknowledging that that are better than you, and you feel small
              beside them.</p>
              <p>And they still can complain about others being arrogant while
              trying to defend their pride in qualifications, achievements and
              merits.</p>
              <p>The irony..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Spot on - look in the case of this very thread.  It wasn't the case of graduates starting by acting superior - it was the case of someone accusing graduates of doing so and a whole bunch of working-class-heroes hanging their inferiority complexes out to dry in public.</p>

              <p>All humans are monkeys, belonging to same order primates, branching for the same ancestors. I dont think, I need to present you the full 3 hrs lectures, plus papers and references to convince you. </p>
              <p>I thought you are very smart, and should know this fact that even a 5 year old kid knows. So what are you so upset about the "Monkey" word. I dont understand. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You must have take a flight before. Have you look out of the windows and see the world? Do you think that human being are so small, that we are insignificant in this world. Our living life span is only 100 years, which is so short compare to the age of the Earth. The fact is that we are really small and insignificant. Yet you are expressing the attitude of superiority over insignificance.  </p>
