              <p>Pride is important,...but....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Every Phd, Uni grad, A-lvl grad, ITE grad, O level grad, the hardworking production operator SHOULD have pride. This is their ahievements and hard work. It helps and encourages them to be do better.</p>
              <p>The only problem arises when one thinks he is smarter or better than another. It is still ok, as it is only in his mind. It becomes an issue when he acts it out, by demeaning and humiliating others. Regardless if he is a Phd or a mechanic.</p>
              <p>It may stoke one's ego to humiliate others out of pride, but it will only create friction, unproductive arguments and even breed hatred. No one favours elitism No one can claim a higher intelligence than another amongst our own species, for within that claim will need evidence to fully support, and who can claim to know EVERYTHING?</p>
              <p>Each and everyone of us have our own special gifts and talents, be he a Phd or mechanic, which we must never deny anyone of it. It is how we USE it for the benefit of the greater good that will either enhance our uniqueness, with applause from many people or twist it egoistically/selfishly and be spat upon our face by all.</p>
              <p>Again, I stress, i, an insignificant nobody, am only sharing an insight and never claim that my view is right, or impose my view upon anyone, least of all on a Sunday morning. Everyone still have the choice to make their own decisions of which they are fully responsible themselves.</p>

              Ladies and Gents
              
              Thank you for providing inputs, information and data for the experiment. A lot of experiments were conducted to study human behavior under various conditions and environments. Every experiment involved using one or a set of stimulus to evoke a respond in the human subject being studied. The earliest study of human behavior is probably the Hawthorne experiment conducted in 1924 to 1932. The experiment was conducted in the area of human productivity in a factory by varying the environment in which the workers worked in.  There were also many studies conducted on human behavior on the internet. In this experiment, a "stimulus" was introduced into a forum. The "stimulus" was this statement :
              o	"Wrong.
              They are not the smartest.
              They think they are the smartest.
              They behave as if they are the smartest.
              I have met PhDs and 1st class honours monkeys who cannot solve simple problems."
              Additional "stimuli" in the form of "repetitive" statements such as "compliments", "more shit please", etc.. were also inserted every now and then, to gauge and increase the number of contribution.
              
              The following behaviors were observed :
              1. Interpretation of the statement above.
              Note that the word used was "THEY". I am not an expert in English language but I am confident to say that the word "THEY" does not mean "ALL". A lot of the responses from the formers did not notice that and went on to take the word "THEY" to mean "ALL". To them, the statement become  :
              
              o	"Wrong.
              All of them are not the smartest.
              All of them think they are the smartest.
              All behave as if they are the smartest.
              I have met PhDs and 1st class honours monkeys who cannot solve simple problems."
              After reading the first few responses, I said to myself that maybe I make a typo error and use "ALL" instead of "THEY". If so, the experiment itself will be of no use. So I went back to the first page and check to make sure that that was not the case.
              Then came the question : "How many...?"
              I pluck a figure "THREE". The responses I got from the forumers  are still :
              o	"Wrong.
              All of them are not the smartest.
              All of them think they are the smartest.
              All behave as if they are the smartest.
              I have met PhDs and 1st class honours monkeys who cannot solve simple problems."
              It was pretty obvious that "THREE" does not mean "ALL". The word "THEY" and "THREE" was extrapolated to mean "ALL". And so comment such as "sweeping statement, unfair comment, one bamboo pole hit the whole boat load of people, etc, etc, ..." were posted.
              
              
              2. Fill in the blanks.
              A "stimulus" statement was made. This statement does reveal many details except that it occurs in a work situation. Information such as these listed below are missing :
              - what is the actual event that happened
              - relationship between the people in that event, were they colleagues at same level  or different
              - if one of them the supervsior, then which one?
              - was the statement made by some one not directly involved in the event, eg HR or people from another department
              - what happened before and after the event
              - was the boss aware or involved in the event, any action taken by the boss, etc...
              In the absence of information, forumers began to "fill in the blanks" and interpreted their version of the event and made the associated comments.
              The list of interpretations and comments are still being compiled and analysed.
              
              3. Hints
              Hints were inserted into the forum in "disguised" form to gauge the alertness of the forumers as to whether this was an actual case that happened. To prevent hints from becoming too obvious, "stimulus" statement was attached to the hints eg :
              "who is making monkey out of who? Read again the post...."
              The first part is the "stimulus" statement to mask the second part which was the hint. The hint was to tell the forumers to read again the statement made in the beginning and hope that someone will notice the words "THEY", "THREE" and not "ALL" was used. I could be wrong, but I think none of the forumers actually go back and read because the subsequent statements made were same as before. 
              There were also other hints, if interested to find out, go and read through again the entire episode!
              
              4. Use of emoticons
              Emoticons are frequently used by formers to indicate their state of emotion. In this experiment, emoticons were used liberally by many of the forumers. I have encountered people who use emoticons on very post, every statement they made on the internet. I called these types of people as "emotional emoticoners". Such people will probably suffer from some kind of emotional stress if they suddenly stopped using it.  "Emotional emoticoners" were not observed in this experiment.  Purpose of my experiment is also to try and analyse the state of emotion of the forumers when emoticons were used. Does the laughing (indicating happy, enjoying, etc..) emoticon really represent the actual emotions of the forumer when making that particular post? To do that, one needs to look at not just the statement containing the emoticon, but also the threads before and after the emoticon appear in that particular statement.
              
              5. Time
              Forumers who responded are likely to be working adults. Students, retirees and people for some reasons who are not working may or may not have contributed some comments. 6 Nov, Friday starting from 7.20am to 7.08pm, total eleven and a half hours, a typical working day. Some may start work earlier or later and some may end earlier or later. A total of 60 statements were made including the "stimuli" statements. Excluding the "stimuli" statements, time were spend on reading, rebutting, composing the thoughts and typing out the responses. I believe quite a chunk of time was taken up in the eleven and a half hours. Too bad that the time spend cannot be obtain from this experiment. This is one of the short coming. 
              NB. Bosses don't like to read this. You people are supposed to be working. Not surfing sgforums! 
              
              6. Internet fatique
              How long before the interest in this particular subject last before the thread disappeared into the abyss of sgforums?  A fast glance this morning, I saw the last post (excluding this one) was made on 8 Nov 2.53pm.  Reponses may continue to come in later so I have no answer to this question yet.
              
              One very clear conclusion from this experiment is that a lot (read â€“ I didn't say "ALL", LOL) of people uses "heart power" rather than "brain power" when subjected to a set of stimuli. Fact finding was not exercised. Some personal details were reveal which in my opinion is not wise thing to do. Bosses and people with bad intention do and often trawl the internet for information. You never know.....
              
              For those who have contributed one way or another, willingly, unwillingly, wittingly, unwittingly, I like to say thank you again. With this, I wrap up the experiment. Those of you who felt so passionate about your beliefs and wish to go on debating, I hope all of you will use more of your "brain power" rather than "heart power". Don't just arm yourself to the teeth; get down to the trenches and fight, fight, fight.

As a result of this swap, "they" would automatically refer to your personal experience of that limited group of "PhDs and 1st class honours monkeys", and prevent a translation of your statement into a hasty generalization.</p>
              <p>As with most online forums, whereby anonymity is guranteed - a generalization as such would hurt the vested interests of individuals (graduates), therefore a "heart power" motivated response to your "heart power" stimulus is expected.</p>

              <p>Oh, and another point - The tone of this discussion thread. The tone as set by threadstarter, catknight, is more so towards the heart than brains. Note the usage of language that connotes graduates as being arrogant - "screw you ignorant ones, i have higher credentials..". This shifts the focus of the thread from mere academic experience and achievement to values and character building, or paper qualifications that proves intelligence to paper qualifications that proves a "greater being" due to intelligence, resulting in arrogance. As such, the thread will direct users into discussing matters of the heart, instead of matters of the head.</p>

              <p><span class="postbody">A spell at university offers more than the
              chance to indulge in a few years of debauchery. But precisely how
              rewarding financially, is completing your degree?. A new report from
              the OECD, a rich-country think-tank, attempts to measure how much more
              graduates can expect to earn compared with those who seek jobs without
              similar qualifications. In America the lifetime gross earnings of male
              graduates are, on average, nearly $370,000 higher than those of
              non-graduates, comfortably repaying the pricey investment in a
              university education. Female graduates earn an extra $229,000, the
              lower rate perhaps because women are more likely to drop out of the
              workforce to look after children.
              <br> <br>On average it pays well to study: across the OECD countries studied
              a man can expect to make an additional $186,500 in his lifetime if he
              has a degree. In some places, such as South Korea and Spain, the data
              show that female graduates pull in more than their male counterparts.
              In Turkey, graduate's additional wages are more modest and the
              financial advantages of men over women are less pronounced........</span></p>

              <p>Graduates are more risk-averse individuals.</p>
              <p>They prefer comfortable income and stable jobs with minimal
              risks.</p>
              <p>While non-graduates who have more difficulties to get
              comfortable income and stable and hence they have to take risks,
              usually in setting up their own business or jobs that require
              taking risks. Some non-graduates succeeded but many, many
              non-graduates failed.</p>
              <p>Smartness can be measured in many ways and many people view
              smartness in terms of different criteria too.</p>
              <p>As in the case of Sheesh's experiment on the investigation of
              human behaviour, he tricked many graduates with his provocative
              statement and get many people to participate in his or her
              experiment unknowingly. So, is he or she the smartest ?
              Academically, Sheesh is probably not better than Gedanken's
              academic achievement but Sheesh manages to outwit Gedanken.</p>

              <p>What if Sheesh is just doing a last minute desperate 'tactic' to save himself form his inability to bullshit his way out like Gendaken, hence .. the 'experiment' </p>
              <p>How come no one seems to be reading in to <a href="../../../users/237724">donkhead333's</a> reply.</p>
              <p>He didnt even start the thread. Anyone can just claim to be making an experiment.</p>
              <p>Maybe i am the smartest to be able to see through all the bullshit in this entire thread.</p>
