              <p>Corrections! PhDs and 1st honours aren't supposed to come out solutions to simple problem in the first place. Get your concept rights first!.</p>
              <p>Simple problem solution, look for pri school kids, school dropout, ITE, O level, Poly.</p>
              <p>Complex problem such as quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, Fourier transformation, photonics, then look for <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">PhDs and 1st honours to solve. </span></p>
              <p>Different people have different skill sets. So a car mechanics knows how to repair car, his skill sets are not inferior to nuclear scientist who know how to put a thermo reactor. </p>
              <p>Pay depends on the rarity of the talents, for example how many people can sing like MJ, that why his fortune is there.</p>
              <p>Every1 is smart in their own way, just that the SINGAPORE society focus too much on academics.</p>
