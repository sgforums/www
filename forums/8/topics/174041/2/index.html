            <div class='col-md body'>if u know m women play a big part in degrading women themselves. I suggest they try to solve this problem first. Place where has sex tourism and humans trafficking  where law enforcement is not stable , women play a part in  undesirable elements responsible..what has Aware got to say about this?!. I am not against women. But fairness and equality will put everything into place<br><br><strong>Why wasn't woman charged with trafficking in children?<br><br>Letter was published in the Straits Times Forum Section on the 26th of August, 2005.<br><br>I refer to the article â€œWomen Gets Jail For Trying to Smuggle Two Girls to Paris (ST Aug 23; 2005).<br><br>The Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) would like to applaud the efforts of Air France Manager Mr. Chuang Kwong Teng. His sharpness and alertness saved the two Sri Lankan girls, aged nine and 10, from a fate that is horrifying just to think about. Mr. Chuang is a hero for doing his small but very important bit in stopping the trafficking of women and children across borders.<br><br>We are, however, perplexed as to the way in which Madam Kamala Sinniah was brought to justice. She was convicted of cheating Mr. Chuang and of bringing the girls into Singapore under fraudulent means, and sentenced to a total of 20 weeks in jail. According to the ST report, she faced a maximum sentence of 11 years and a fine.<br><br>Why was Madam Kamala's crime categorized as smuggling when, according to the ST report, her role was to hand the children over to a child trafficker in France? Why was she not charged under the Women's Charter Section 141(1) or 142, which cover offences related to the trafficking of women and girls and wouldn't this more appropriate for the severity of  the crime she was found to have committed?<br><br>The trafficking of women and children is an international problem, and a very grave one. If we are to have any hope of curbing it, a concerted effort has to be made at an international level, and that includes us here in Singapore.<br><br>If we persist in defining "smuggling" and "trafficking" on our own terms, we will limit   the role we can play in putting an end to the heinous practice of trafficking women and children. And the case of the two Sri Lankan girls shows that this is a crime that can take place, at least in part, in our own backyard.<br><br>AWARE believes it is time we as a country, align ourselves with the international community on our definitions and refine our processes on this issue of trafficking, especially of children and women. We must be part of the international effort of enlightened countries which have stepped forward to mete out deterrent sentences on traffickers at home and across borders.<br><br>Braema Mathi<br><br>President, AWARE</strong></div>
