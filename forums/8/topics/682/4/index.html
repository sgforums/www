            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore.. let me think .. is singapore good or bad. i have all my memories with singapore. Both good and bad.<br><br>i have some points with me that make me wonder...<br>i had a friend who recently when to Aust to study... before she goes there.. she says she cann't wait to leave singapore.. singapore is so boring and stuff.<br>when she was there..<br>she experience people who look down at her. in whats ways.. not thier skin colors. ( she never face that in singapore.. having friends malays, chinese, indians, japanese, europeans.. make feel that it has been an equal sociaty)<br><br>She hate the transport there.. even want to have a coffee or some food she have to go a long way down to city or at least some distance away ...public transport.. shops close early... so consider no life... she did say it will be good to have a car in aust. cause more convenience ... she say 5 k u can get a car but all very old type.. and to travel from the place she stays to the CITY may take her 1 1/2 - 2 hours! .. just thinking why do we need Cars when we can take a train from 1 end of singapore to the other end just within 1 hour?<br>Instants noodles are expensive 2-3 dollars!! But Bread is very cheap .. (it is so cheap that. if the bread has expired.. they take it to feed the ducks... )<br>Temperture is so cold at this time.. it is thier winter while we are having summer.<br><br>It is not secure at all too ..<br>i asked her again . .so she like singapore nor aust now.. she say SINGAPORE!!! but she does say if she come back she will miss aust for some others things  that u cant get .. but if u have the money just go and enjoy it .<br>this remind me one funny, worst case in year 2000 by another friend who went to NZ ..She having Macdonald .. but the oppside is having a GUN SHOOTING .. Just imagine having bullets flying around u. as for the friend she come back to singapore after 1 mth of schooling in NZ .. she says she hope to live longer. atleast the most if she die in Mac it is from unnatural dealth ( like crash to dealth by hello kitty craze in singapore 2000? Hahaha rather than bullets flying around her)<br><br>We are just a poor, small country ... many other country hate us to core.. cause we are so small yet so well... they can never believe why issit so? they have land they have resources yet they are lost to us... one thing for sure.. msia is very jealous of us... they trying to boom thier KL to be like orchard road to attract people to shop.. people to spend there. but did the people know how dangerous thier life can be at night in there.? i read in paper once that at night the place changes to a place for "Punks' to gather sex, drugs, robbing, fighting.. I do see Punks in singapore too but they are not so dangerous...Aleast in singapore they are so call 'bo ji' ,this people in other place they dont care.. they do what they want .. no money they rob u .. pull u in the dark lanes and who knows what,<br><br>Maybe u go to china as majority are chinese maybe they treat u better .. why( for the money u have to invest) this is the only way they can gather thier resources back.. wonder why china is having a hard time to bloom not that the people are not smart they are smart.  commui$t with the money sign  for them .. compare them to russia u see the country like how come u dont know much about russia? ..<br>but china have a bad land.. drought, flood, earthquake... when they just manage to earn enough thier money have to go to somewhere else to fix it ... the most singapore have Thunder Lighting which struck the trees down and cover the roads. Pipes explode on ground cause the road have a hole.. compare to the damage other country have what we can say?<br><br>I know it suck big time about the money issue.. money is always not enough .. we are tax higher have less money .. cann't buy cars..  cannt afford a house.. but all this we can slowly 'credit' it with our cpf...<br>TO say singapore is a rich country i am not too sure.. but i am sure that..at the age of 50 i aleast have 200,000 to 300,000 dollars ..<br><br>i read many books about been rich how to earn money .. the author keep having a similar line.. saying.. u spend your money on a house trapping your money in there it is not a asset ( your house is not an Assets it is a liabitity to u ) .. but it is not true as i see in 20 to 30 years after u have complete the payment that is your money .. so spend the money u earn by selling it off.. get a smaller house.. u have aleast 200 to 300.. but certianly this is known as a stupid investing..  a person who want to earn more money before 50 will never do that .. hahaha... but aleast this sercure u with this idea of u do have money...<br>some people wonder.. where does all my money goes.. but actually look around u ..those u have is your money .. even kids nowadays have alots of assest...  your phones, your cd player.. your computers. but of course everything depricated.. but why bother even your life depricated .. at the end of 70 to 90 years old what can u do? or  another words  u want to do things?<br><br>Singapore is not that bad afterall lah ..<br>if u feel stress take a break .. it is part of life mah .. everyone in the world is doing thier part.. as a human .. some how we are set to .. work sleep play eat ..<br>if u really dont like this life.. then choose to be a fish or a dog or a cat..<br>maybe u have a different life.. and maybe at that time u can come to the forum and tell us about it.. OPS u cant hor.. ? hahahahaa<br><br>just my stupid suggestion ... hahahaa<br>sorry for my bad english .. !!! who ask me to stay in singapore for so long!<br><br>------------------<br>Pride, Envy, Gluttony, Lust, Anger, Greed, Sloth<br>Faith, Hope, Charity, Fortitude, Justice, Temperance, Prudence</div>

Just a thought though...</blockquote>i think they should serve in whatever role they're suited to. as in, if they're pesA, then do combat roles, etc. then those physically weaker men and women would serve in less physically intensive roles, and those men and women who are more physically fit would serve in combat roles. if what the experts say about men and women's physical fitness is correct, then it would naturally result in less women and more men in combat roles, and vice versa for non-combat roles. it certainly makes more sense that way right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>they shouldn't be confined to clerical or nursing jobs, as i'm sure some would wanna chiong sua also right?<br><br>just take israel for example. one possible reason their military is so formidable is that everyone is involved, because women have to serve as well. sometimes i think a lot of women in singapore take the freedom and security they have for granted, cos they never had to pay the price (NS) for it. not only that, they still say we discriminate against them, etc. when LKY first started NS, he initially wanted to copy israel, and have both men and women serve NS, but because at that time singapore was still developing, it was not economically viable so they decided against it. if the reason they did not require women to serve was economic, then surely they should reconsider having women serve NS in this day and age? what do you think?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Thinking of migrate? Go ahead then!!<br>Some more give all kinds of reasons like: stressful..high living cost..expensive petrol etc etc. Hey, don't tell me that you are so WEAK until you have no choice but to escape from reality?</blockquote>Well, if migrating was really so simple and beneficial, I think a lot of Singaporeons would have already done so.<br><br>The problem is weighing the pros and cons and deciding if the pros outweigh the cons. And even if they do, is it worth the trouble? People who think of migrating obviously would think of....for example as you mentioned, lower living cost and cheaper petrol. They would also obviously think of lets say, the lack of security, racial discrimination, and most probably the whole process of uprooting themselves from Singapore where their friends and family are.<br><br>What I'm trying to say here is that at the moment, the push factor for Singaporeons is present, but that push factor isn't strong enough, which causes the dilemma of whether to migrate, or not. This wouldn't really be called escaping from reality...I think its more of being aware of it, right?<br><br><blockquote>What make u think that other country is good? Wake up. Maybe those country are less stressful to live it, but don't tell me u never feel uneasy to become a 2nd class citizen? U think all countries treat all races so fairly like S'pore?</blockquote>Well, I don't know about others who think of migrating, but I know that I definitely did not mention that. I'm actually very well aware of the drawbacks of migrating, and I have taken it into consideration, which is precisely why I haven't made a decision yet. Not to mention (as I mentioned earlier), that I'm still a student and in no position to migrate even if I wanted to.<br><br>Also, most countries do not make specific laws that promote racial discrimination, Singapore and most other likely candidates-for-migration included. Racial discrimination is something that happens very naturally with people. The point I'm trying to make is that sadly, racial discrimination is present everywhere you go, and Singapore is not the exception.<br><br><blockquote>If u're just a weak soul who can't take stress, then u're not qualify to be a proper S'porean. S'pore is a land for the strong-minded...not for those who are faint-hearted.</blockquote>Nice attempt at asserting your nationalism and elitism, but what you just said makes no sense. Citizenship (by birth, which I am) in Singapore is a compulsary birthright, not a choice you can make and not everyone is made equal. If you are truly a strong-minded person who can take lots of stress, then I applaud you. In any case, don't try to hold everyone else around you to the same lofty standards you hold yourself to, and try to learn some humility. Elitism does your social life no good, and racial discrimination can actually be seen as a form of elitism.<br><br>[This message has been edited by chamenos (edited 30 May 2002).]</div>

Yes, such policies do put a strain on our pockets.3 - 5% Gst... disgusting...<br>(And it correspond to the NSF payrise immediately AFTER my ORD this may 25...)<br><br>But I do believe the government have their reason for doing this. BTW, by analogy, my father (government of family) used to put a strain on my money income b4 NS. I had to look for alternative sources of incomes by working during holidays and such. Oblivious to me, he had a couple of investments and insurances policies in stalled for me which will be matured in the near future. And all these money will come into good use for my university and career(if applicable). He had something IN STALLED for me. The government have policies solely for ppl of the country too... but they are always invisible or intangible to us.<br><br>The government likes to bait talents in. These Uni foreigners will definitely return to their country heading MNCs or bigger scale cooperations or head governments blahblahblah... Having spend his/her tertiary education here, he/she is likely to be in favour of Singapore as they are more familiar to this country. Ok i dunno whether this point is valid... but i feel attracting talents to singapore is important for us.after all our main resource is human and brains and a healthy network of conglomerates capable of injecting revenue into singapore. These competition will be 'temporary'. when they leave Singapore... they no more pose a 'threat' so to speak. Yes... unless they remain in Singapore. As Singaporeans!!! But if they do they will be already part of our big Singaporean family and we shouldn't consider them to be competition?<br><br>Regardin the point that Singapore is a fine country but not to the extent that we should be paying such a high price for the living conditions... well i guess its all from a personal point of view. Go to Hong Kong (yumyum paradise!!) and you'll see how worse off the middle class ppl are... (of cos the rich ppl will have no problems precisely becos they are talented or have a high market value. However if u can earn that you wun have a problem living anywhere)<br>The grass is always greener on the other side... (as travis puts it...haha) Since you're here why not chew on whatever grass you can find and innovate to grow more if there are not enough? If land is too small we go upwards and grow multi layered gardens for more grass. It all depends on how willing one wants to work. If there is a greener pasture.. by all means give up everything you have here and migrate! Its your choice! Its Singapore!</div>
