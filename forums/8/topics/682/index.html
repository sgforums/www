            <div class='col-md body'>Many people said that Singapore is a wonderful place to stay in.Safe and stable country. Yes it's all true to a certain extend.<br><br>What the government not know is that they are helping the rich and not the poor even though they kept saying the changes is made in the benefit of the poor. (MY FOOT!!!)<br><br>Pt no 1:Reduced tax<br>Who affected? the rich got to save lot's of money because of their high income.The poor who never got tax = zero effect. Where's the benefit?<br>Increase GST to cover this lost. Who affect? All INCLUDING the poor. Conclusion who suffer? The poor because they need to eat too.<br><br>Pt no 2:Foreign worker<br>Though most Singaporeans won't do those 'dirty' jobs and want high pay but at times like this why do the government allow 'experts' from other countries to work here if they can meet the low requirements set. When Singaporeans went overseas to work, the government says talents are being lost. They don't know find ways to keep these talents. Don't they know the root cause?<br><br>Pt no 3: COE<br>What is the purposes of COE? to control the number of cars, right? Then why do they release more COEs when there's ERP? Do ERP control the number of cars? I don't thunk so.<br>If you discourage people from using cars, don't you think you should lower your public transport cost in order to attract poeple to use them? BUT no way.... the fare just keeps going up and NEVER comes down.<br><br>Think about it.<br><br>If I had the chance, I'll give my talents to a country who will in turn returns to me with a right benefit.</div>

Well, suggestion is to learn from the foreigner working here treating this place as a working place to earn off big buck to enjoy elsewhere. Once rich, you can invest and migrate to other 3rd world countries and come back here to work as PR.</div>

They think that life is good and peaceful under them with so many housing upgrading without looking at the underlying high cost that they are paying for. They are Looking at the surface and can't help feeling complacent.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 27 April 2002).]</div>
