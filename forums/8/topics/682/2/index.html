If there will not be enough space on this small island, why do we see more and more golf field and club house building up? You mean SAFRA club house and golf field cost less and take up few spaces as compared to the much needed HDB flats for singaporean couple to settle down? With more golf field and club house, more baby will be produced to curb the population problems that will ultimately lead to singapore's doom?</div>

You know that as long as you stay within its enclosure, you will find comfort in numbers, where you have your friends and do things that you are always familiar with. True. Assurance gives comfort.<br><br>But is it any fun? More often than not, I hear people whining about their life, how they wish they could strike out and do the big things, migrate, etc. if they could. But after whining, they just go back to lead life like they always do. Why? The safety net again. Most wants to be sure they do not cross the border and fail while doing out of the norm. Afterall, its the most secure to do what your parents and your friends have done... that is get the degree, get job, marry, get the flat and later, 2 kids.<br><br>But think about it. Where's the fun. What's the point of going out to do something when you knew the result already even before you start. Remember this. Half the fun of every new thing you try is going to come from not knowing what the results might be. Life is not a shuttle run to pick the blocks, its suppose to be a marathorn to an unknown destination.<br><br>So go ahead and do it if you wish to. Migrate if you think you can do better elsewhere. Find a new job. Start a business. The achievers do not procrastinate. They just believe wildly in something and just strive ahead.<br><br>You grandfather did, by taking the first boat out of China 50 years ago. He saw China crumpling.<br><br>Now its your turn.</div>
