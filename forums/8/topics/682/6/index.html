            <div class='col-md body'>I think we should just stop complaining and learn to appreciate the government.<br><br>some points to mention:<br><br>-Singapore has a good education system that we locals don't make full use of (don't blame the govt when we are wasting their resources)<br><br>-the country will not be drained of resources if we migrate bcos there are lots of foreign talents desiring lower wages willing to work here. no one will really care if we leave.<br><br>-dun condemn the PAP, without them a small country like singapore would not have been able to progress till today in 37 yrs.<br><br>-i think we should examine the reasons behind govt policies b4 condemning them. Why would a govt want to invite retaliation from the public? Obviously, knowing consequences of their policies, they still have to implement them to benefit the economy in some other way.<br><br>-it might be true that the government is increasing income inequality. but by reducing income taxes, the government could be trying to encourage people to strive and aim for the higher income brackets. The government could also be trying to attract foreign investment which is what we need to stimulate the economy. This will eventually benefit the economy as a whole.<br><br>-i think the government is not stupid. they have their reasons for their actions. So, I feel we should not just look on the surface and think in the long run. Do not be so ready to put down the people who gave us our comfortable life today. Do not be ingrates.<br><br>-Singapore has 91% house ownership rate. Highest in the world. The government makes sure all of us have a roof we can call our own. Do you know how heavily subsidised is the house you are living in? High house prices is not the govt's fault at all. Blame the high demand or our own high National Income for this high cost of living. But isn't that what we should desire? Would you rather live your life sloppily draining away funds by taking govt aids and living in a tiny house eating potatoes everyday?<br><br>Stress can move people.

Do you have any idea how much foreign expats are paid here?  Apparently you don't or your definition of foreign talents are blue collar works or those white collar workers in the lowest climb of the ladder.  And you said that no one really care if the local talents leave?  Do you prefer foreign talents that are here to make money and leave or local talents that have nested interested in the country and whose roots are planted deeply?<br><br>I am not saying that we shouldn't invite or attract foreign talents.  There are numerous reasons why we should do that.  But enough said, get your facts correct first lady before you make sweeping statements.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All in all, Singapore has no natural resources. So manpower comes in. With an educated workforce and 'obedient' citizens, it is easier to control and administer concealed suppression using direct and indirect methods. But as more singaporeans begin to venture abroad for further studies or work, our insights and perspectives changed. There is a also saying, 'The grass is always greener on the other side'. It is sometimes hard to balance between the pros and cons when oneself is biased.<br><br>Lotsa factors and considerations to discuss. But gerenally I can sense that it is demoralising to stand up straight and call a country home when the people it housed are unsettled and indirectly oppressed by the many regulations that its consitution came up with.</div>

We have come very far despite being very tiny and without natural resources. It's typical that costs of living will rise with the development of a country. I can't think of any First-world country which enjoys low costs of living. Just that Singapore being small makes the situation harder because we don't have enough land, hence the law of economics determine that the demand for land exceeds supply of it which gives rise to high prices.<br><br>In fact, we should be proud of the fact that despite starting off on the same footing with our neighbours, we have achieved far more than they have in the past few decades. This alone shows the difference in leadership and policies.<br><br>Why talk about the British? They abandoned us when we needed them most. We only have our forefathers to thank for the nation's progress.</div>

Why would a govt want to invite retaliation from the public? Obviously, knowing consequences of their policies, they still have to implement them to benefit the economy in some other way. </strong></blockquote>benefit the economy? more like benefitting the rich, to be richer, and the poor to be poorer, ppl wif average income of 1k++ are SUFFERING like no tomorrow... obviously, the policies are benificial to them, b4 they inplement, if they think in WHOLE of sg community, perhaps things are much more different, and perhaps many of us will not have this "condemning" attitude...<br><br><blockquote><strong>-it might be true that the government is increasing income inequality. but by reducing income taxes, the government could be trying to encourage people to strive and aim for the higher income brackets. The government could also be trying to attract foreign investment which is what we need to stimulate the economy. This will eventually benefit the economy as a whole. </strong></blockquote>reducing tax, increase GST, overall, we still spend MORE than we earn... in case u didn't know, it's very hard to strive and aim for higher income brackets because the ppl higher up, dun move, we cannot move... how many times have u heard of ppl waiting to be promoted for.... 10 ~ 30 yrs, and never did get anything??<br><br>yes, gd foresight for getting foreign invesments, but what measures are taken so that they remain in sg?? i needn't say, what happened to 1 of the major shareholders in sg's port??<br><br><blockquote><strong>-i think the government is not stupid. they have their reasons for their actions. So, I feel we should not just look on the surface and think in the long run. Do not be so ready to put down the people who gave us our comfortable life today. Do not be ingrates. </strong></blockquote>we are not looking at the surface, we look BENEATH it... we are not putting down anything, hey, what happened to freedom of speech? and who are ingrates?? society is like that, society is cruel, if u dun understand, experience it urself.<br><br><blockquote><strong>-Singapore has 91% house ownership rate. Highest in the world. The government makes sure all of us have a roof we can call our own. Do you know how heavily subsidised is the house you are living in? High house prices is not the govt's fault at all. Blame the high demand or our own high National Income for this high cost of living. But isn't that what we should desire? Would you rather live your life sloppily draining away funds by taking govt aids and living in a tiny house eating potatoes everyday? </strong></blockquote>did u noe, many of the home owners actually sign up MAJOR loans or make use of their CPF until they are "literally broke"??? sure, we all have a roof above our heads, but at what price? and what causes high standard of living? may i ask?? and govt. aids, WHERE DOES ALL THE MONEY FOR THAT COME FROM??<br><br>think.... and go figure...<br><br><blockquote><strong>Stress can move people. Learn to take things Positively!</strong></blockquote>this is the ONLY thing i agree wif u<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
