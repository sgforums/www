            <div class='col-md body'>Guys,<br>it's not easy to be a good government. If you think the government is so bad now, cost of living so high, you think you can make the people feel you are a good leader and cut the cost of living significantly if you were the ones running the country ?<br><br>It took SM Lee a life time to build this nation. And can you imagine how much more difficult it was for a country the size of a pimple on the world map, and with no natural resouorces ? Remember the time when people said Singapore just won't make it ... Today, we still survived .... So don't give up.<br><br>The thing with our people is that we complain about this and that. But very few of us would step out and volunteer their services to better our place. I think our neighbour are laffing their heads off when they are bombarding us with lots of complains and threats, but yet our people obediently queue up to make their way across the causeway just because things over there are cheap.<br><br>Haiz ..... The problems in a country is not solely on the prt of the government, it's also on the part of the people in the country.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Singapore govt are taking things too hard and fast. Making the society so stressful and the cost of living so high. Fair enough, we Singaporeans living on this island have no other resources other than manpower, but that doesn't mean we have to exploit it. The govt are exploiting the people, overworking them, and not granting them enough space and time for their own private lives. Note that we are a nation of humans, not robots. All I can say is we should not have broken off with M'sia. If we as an island by ourselves need to depend a lot on the neighbouring countries and foreign visitors and trade stuff to survive, why then did we break off and claim we can survive on our own?!</div>
