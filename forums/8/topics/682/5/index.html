            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Anyway regarding your second point on the issue of getting girls to chiong sua...well..that would required lots of time such as to change ther mentality of the people around..although it is very difficult to do..but it is possible..ur example of israel is a good example..anyway..what i meant was..not just confining girls onto just clerical jobs and logistice...but more of making it compulsory for them in that field..but if they are willing to go into combat..like one of my firends..then by all means go ahead..then at least..we are able to keep the number of guys going into those vocations to a minimal...</blockquote>Well, actually I thought one of the major problems would be the mindset that most people have, and that is the case actually. But after I read that book where LKY said that he wanted to have everyone serve NS, it made me re-think how big a factor the mindset that people have about women serving NS is. If it was viable in all other aspects except the economic one at that time, then surely it would be viable now I think.<br><br>Then again, I can complain and whine all I want here but in the end there's nothing much I can do. It would be refreshing to see the women MPs rallying for more equal rights rather than special rights for women. I don't seem to see them asking for women to serve NS, or addressing issues where men are discriminated against instead of women, and instead harp on other less-significant issues.

They definitely can't treat foreigners the same way the treat Singaporeons; they have to give foreigners a pull factor to come work in Singapore, and these benefits are it.<br><br>But yea, it definitely takes a very forgiving and easy-going attitude and lots of money to stay in Singapore.

Lets say you spend 20,000Y to get to town from the airport, but would it still be expensive if you lived and worked in japan and earned 2000,000Y a month?<br><br>But yea....people should weigh the pros and cons and try to look at the bright side before being so quick to complain.</div>
