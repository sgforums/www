            <div class='col-md body'>dear God,<br><br>it has been a while since i last confessed. i ask for Your forgiveness for iÂ’m about to sin. &amp; the worst thing is i donÂ’t think iÂ’m going to be remorseful about it, please prove me wrong, Father. iÂ’m not only going to sin but i think iÂ’m going to like it too. i know that it is not a sin to be tempted, but to give in to that temptation, thatÂ’s when i cross the line. i really tried very very hard to keep my nose out of other peoplesÂ’ businesses, but well, youÂ’ve blessed me with a heart that whenever i see injustice, i can no more ignore it, than it was possible for You not to love us even when we rebel &amp; have been rebelling since You created us. i pray that You will look upon me favourably for this particular sin when my time comes for me to account to You for my deeds.<br><br>you know, some weeks ago, i discovered a forum &amp; have been so obsessed by it that it is almost becoming the god in my life, but luckily for me, you pointed out the errors of my ways &amp; i was suitably chastised &amp; iÂ’m grateful for your correction. as youÂ’re well aware, iÂ’ve been looking for a man to love all my life &amp; iÂ’m of marriageable age, if not past it, i thought maybe i will meet my true love in cyber space. so armed with such a desire, i went about profiling the forumites to decide who are the ones i want to correspond with &amp; see maybe if we can Â“clickÂ”, you know what i mean. i spotted quite a few, among whom twinkle is one.<br><br>he impressed me with his command of English, you know how it is with me, just as a sincere &amp; humble heart moves you, a mastery of this language moves me too. as usual, You like to play with me, within days of identifying those whose net personality i like, i found that all of them are younger than me &amp; it took me quite a while to get over it. but get over it, i did. thank you.<br><br>so again i return to the forum with a different mind set now, no more boyfriend/hubby hunting, just make friends &amp; enjoy the experience of broadening my mind through the exchange of ideas &amp; opinions. i have learnt a lot from these forumites &amp; i hope they would have learnt something from me too.<br><br>oh, iÂ’ve digress again but you donÂ’t mind, do you? iÂ’ll now tell you the reason why iÂ’m going to sin. i was attracted to twinkle at first because of his caustic wit, he reminds a little of myself. but as time passes, i definitely find that weÂ’re not that alike after all. *phew! wipe perspiration away* thank you again.<br><br>heÂ’s tactless, undiplomatic, sarcastic [overly so], defensive, too full of himself, mostly negative traits (well negativity is all i could see) &amp; the worst crime of all, he doesnÂ’t take good advice. where was it that you said Â“whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but he who hates correction is stupid?Â”  &amp; Â“he who heeds discipline shows the way to life, but whoever ignores correction leads others astray.?Â” oh, i remember now, they were in Proverbs 12:1 &amp; Proverbs 10:17.<br><br>you see, he has been hounding Kitty mercilessly for ages in this thread, i know that You advised in Proverbs somewhere that iÂ’m to keep my nose out of it because Â“Whoever corrects a mocker invites insult. Whoever rebukes a wicked man incurs abuse. Do not rebuke a mocker or he will hate you; rebuke a wise man &amp; he will be wiser still; teach a righteous man &amp; he will add to his learning.Â” but papa, how could i not when Kitty tried her best to ignore him but he wasnÂ’t willing to let it go? &amp; well, why did You allow me to like Kitty? i mean a flame or two or even a few is okay after all *ashamed look*, iÂ’m no saint, iÂ’ve flamed people before, but Daddy, we are talking an <strong>enormous</strong> amount of flaming abuse here, surely i would have committed a bigger sin if i just stayed away.<br><br>yes, Kitty is naughty, i know that but i also know that sheÂ’s willing to take other peopleÂ’s advice, just that sometimes she likes to win, no matter what &amp; sometimes thatÂ’s her downfall, well she has her youth as an excuse. huh? please tell me that again? oh yeah *suitably abashed*, i know that this could be my downfall too, my this intense desire to win, but papa, what iÂ’m going to do is not about winning, iÂ’m trying to help twinkle be a better person.<br><br>that poor twinkle has got so many facts wrong that if i donÂ’t set him straight, who will? &amp; my good name will be besmirched. *thinking silently in my heart, &amp; thus, so will Yours*. dear Father, you have to know that iÂ’m doing this because of Your command to love my neighbour as i love myself.<br><br>so, though i may slip into sarcasm from time to time [i havenÂ’t conquered that part of my nature yet &amp; i promised that iÂ’ll try my very best to overcome it] &amp; appear cruel but iÂ’m being cruel to be kind. i pray that You will forgive me for this transgression for iÂ’m trying to save one lost  &amp; misguided sheep.<br><br>in Jesus Christ name i pray. amen.<br>colette<br></div>

There is nothing to resist. It just never occurred to me, because there are more apt decriptions around. To call her 'la chienne' would be more fun than calling her bitch outright, because you'll probably hear noises coming out of HK's head as she tries to work that out (hiak!) Of course, you would not accept this explanation, because you are hell bent in picking fault with me.[/quote]<br><br>twinkle, letÂ’s be frank with each other, weÂ’re both highly intelligent people. perhaps it has never occurred to you before to call HK a bitch but once that idea planted itself in your mind, you just couldnÂ’t resist &amp; to show off, you purposely called her the bitch in French. &amp; donÂ’t delude yourself that iÂ’m hell bent in picking fault with you, darhling, iÂ’ve barely started.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by twinkle on 28 Mar, 9.37 am:<br><br>Collete, you've come in too late. I've stopped harrassing a week back. I only came back to find out who the imposter was. Go and check the dates of the postings. Your uprighteous huffing and puffing is irrelevant because it's overdue. Too bad       <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </blockquote>twinkle, get my name right please, itÂ’s common courtesy, itÂ’s colette, single Â“lÂ”, small Â“cÂ”, iÂ’m not so fussy about whether itÂ’s a capital Â“CÂ” or small Â“cÂ”, but i donÂ’t like people putting letters that are not supposed to be there.<br><br>gee! am i to be grateful that you stopped harrassing her since 20 Mar? when you have been flaming her since 28 Feb?  *humourless laugh* my righteous huffing &amp; puffing is irrelevant because itÂ’s overdue? darhling twinkle     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">, the minute you came back on 25 Mar to harass HK, you lay yourself wide open to any possible criticisms. and oh, iÂ’m definitely righteous. irrelevant? you would wished i were.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by twinkle on 28 Mar, 9.37 am:<br><br>For a while, I came exactly with fun in mind, which you claimed that people should. Did I get upset when people swore repeatedly at me? </blockquote>how can you justify getting angry if HK swore at you when it was you who started the whole flaming thing? this is like a pot calling the kettle black. *derisive laughs* just to refresh your memory, this is your first post in this thread:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by twinkle on 28 Feb 2000, 12.28 am:<br></blockquote></div><div class="quote_body">hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha..........<br><br>Why don't you post up your photo and WE decide whether you're pretty enough for us to want you?<br><br>Even if you are pretty, little can make up for your foul mouth and childishness.<br><br>Sorry, I think I'll pass....</div></blockquote>this is akin to you entering a retail shop, inspecting its wares, found them wanting &amp; criticizing loudly within hearing distance of the owner/seller, how do you think theyÂ’ll react? hmmm, what? just because as a customer, you think youÂ’re always right &amp; the king? hello? kindly please grow up! when you enter the retail shop, you have a choice whether you want to buy or not, similarly, the seller has a right to refuse to sell to you too. common courtesy dictates that you do not criticize while still within earshot of the seller. *shakes head*<br><br>the tone of your message which you have employed is clearly offensive unless youÂ’re on good terms with the addressed party &amp; they know that you meant it as a joke, but from the way things are going, i think youÂ’re definitely not a friend.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by twinkle on 28 Mar, 9.37 am:<br><br>I had more fun coming up with funny replies and laughing at HK.

It's her vanity and egotism. Please lah, she goes around thinking that her e-mail add is worth fighting for and boasts that she has the biggest boobs among her friends. What a joke! If she offers to sleep with the guy, then maybe lah. If her breasts are so big, then she should prove it by letting us have a good look. hahahahaha......</div></blockquote>ah! *sucks in a deep breath &amp; lets it out again* yes, this was when things got ugly for you     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Â’coz this post pissed me off &amp; i began tracking you. *crazed grin* call me sick but suddenly, i found that sometimes in the dead of the night, when i canÂ’t sleep, iÂ’ll suddenly think of you. oh yes, this also brings to mind of my luv for Only4Lamer and yes again, reading this brings back unpleasant memories, i really felt for Kitty then.<br><br>well twinkle honey, youÂ’ve gone far too personal here. just because a gal says that she has big boobs, sheÂ’s to <strong>prove</strong> it to you, meh? thatÂ’s like telling the bank, you have so much money here, come give me some.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>[quote]Originally posted by twinkle on 4 Mar, 8.17 pm:<br><br>All this talk about judging and moral high ground is rubbish. Firstly, you told me not to judge and called me putritanical at the same time. And secondly, as somebody once put it, excuse me while I take the elevator down to your level. Behaving politely and being sensitive to the context you are in is not a high requirement. It's the basic. You don't say lodly, 'Good riddance to bad rubbish' in a funeral do you? FYI, I swear when I mad as hell. But I always make sure that the people around me won't be offended first. more insults, but thatÂ’s not the point. i was intrigued by this statement of yours: <strong>Behaving politely and being sensitive to the context you are in is not a high requirement. It's the basic.</strong> so, why didnÂ’t you practise what you preach?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by twinkle on 28 Mar, 9.37 am:<br><br>Secret obessession with HK? Oh please, an episode of X-files is more likely than this happening! If I really liked HK, I would have snapped at y2care's attempt to bring us together or insisted on having her e-mail address. What an incredible joke! Sorry to disappoint you but this is not a movie, comic book or romance novel. Been watching/reading too much of these.</blockquote>protesting again twinkle sugar? i took the trouble to read some of these posts again &amp; one thing struck me when i happened to look at the dates, *yikes* did you know that you posted 15 posts to provoke Kitty gal into reacting alone on 28 Feb? &amp; if i include the other 2 posted shortly after midnight, thatÂ’s a grand total of 17! in one night! *smug smile* thatÂ’s what i call obsessive if you profess to dislike HK so much. strange how you showed your dislike &amp; disgust. for most people, they wouldnÂ’t be bothered to talk to the person in question. now, now, now, arenÂ’t we getting a little judgmental here? you barely know me, how would you know what i read or watch? *tsk tsk tsk*<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by twinkle on 28 Mar, 9.37 am:<br><br>As I've mentioned in another thread, I will let the imposter go. You obviously don't bother to keep track before you hurl accusations. Again. Nit picking, mon cherie?</blockquote>*wounded look* me hurl accusations before i get my facts right? *sobs* &amp; then *miffed look* excuser moi?, when i want to flame somebody, i always look for reasons to justify it, if itÂ’s just because iÂ’m bored &amp; i want to have some fun by making other peopleÂ’s lives a misery or just simply because the other party pisses me off, God would never forgive me. i would not forgive me and darhling sugar twinkle, before you accuse me, why donÂ’t you spend some time reading my post? after all, i spent a fair bit of time on that baby, just for you, you know. *winks* well, to make your life easier for once, iÂ’ve posted a partial paragraph here, for the full text, search for it &amp; read it at leisure. flame me if you must, but nothing disinterests me as fast as someone who doesnÂ’t do his homework to check out the other party. *leery smile*<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by colette on 27 Mar, 9.35 pm:<br><br>i know that you may say that itÂ’s easy for me to write this as iÂ’m not the person involved, very true. i can understand your anger but please do spare a thought for this personÂ’s future, iÂ’m happy to read in your other thread a while ago that youÂ’re willing to let the matter rest. </blockquote><blockquote>Originally posted by twinkle on 28 Mar, 9.37 am:<br><br>Gosh Collete, for somebody who is against boasting, you sure aren't shy of enumerating your language skills. Irony, isn't it?</blockquote>*surprised look* twinkle! that was not boasting! that, my darhling twinkle, was a <strong>veiled threat</strong>. *shakes head, thinking to myself apparently over-estimated twinkie* &amp; i thought you were highly IQed.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by twinkle on 28 Mar, 9.37 am:<br><br>Well, for me, it's not the language (i.e. Hokkien) per se. It's the kind of thuggish behaviour that follows it. If a desire not to be associated with this behaviour is called snobbish, so be it. Racist? Go check the dict (sorry can't offer mine       <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ) Have I passed any denigrating remarks about racial characteristics? Language and race overlaps, but are not one and the same. Shouldn't somebody of your erudition be aware of this?</blockquote>twinkle, twinkle little star, how i wonder ... *pai seh pai seh* got carried away, somehow, i over-estimated twinkleÂ’s IQ &amp; suddenly i have a passion for kiddy songs.<br><br>trying to worm your way out of this? you see twinkle, words are very powerful, even more so when words are the only thing that you can use to convey your feelings &amp; thoughts. words can edify, encourage, seduce &amp; inflame, etc etc etc ... of all human emotions possible to be conveyed via words, you chose only to inflame &amp; belittle. why or why? *bobbing my head as i ponder upon this* again to refresh your memory:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by twinkle on 25 Mar, 7.58 pm:<br><br>My postings are always laced with sarcasm and wit. I've a sauve customer (hiak!), je parle francaise, you'll NEVER catch me speaking in Hokkien (so low class, like sinking to the level of ah lians like HK! YUCKS!!!!!!).</blockquote>now twinkle darhling, if you intend to brush up your flaming skills by sparring with me, i suggest that you come prepared &amp; check your facts first. i especially dislike people who thinks that they are oh so so higher than others. and a little tip, i would suggest that you check out my flaming credentials before trying to best me, for if i dislike a person, very seldom does he gets to best me at my own game.<br><br>again for your record, i posted this:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by colette on 27 Mar, 9.35 pm:<br>this sentence offends me although iÂ’m not a Hokkien, in fact i think it would offend the entire Hokkien clan. it just shows that youÂ’re the worst kind of snob and for your information, i do speak Hokkien, in fact Hokkien has the widest range of obscenities. well, hereÂ’s one ah lian who can speak Hokkien, Teochew &amp; bits of Cantonese and proud of it. and twinkle by the way, this ah lian also speaks &amp; writes English beautifully.</blockquote>excuse me again, did the word Â“raceÂ” even appeared in my post to you?<br><br>*blows air towards fringe* oh, i will be busy this week, especially tomorrow, have a few hot dates that will keep away from home till probably midnight, so if you should not hear from me tomorrow, i just want to state for the record that it is not iÂ’m afraid of your flames, just give me time &amp; iÂ’ll come running back to you, i promise twinkle dear. i do have to work too, youÂ’re not the only one with a job.     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>actually, i thought if a flaming session were to be declared between you and me, it would be challenging, boy, was i wrong! this will teach me to let my hopes get so high in future. i had tons more fun flaming Only4Lamer than i had here today, at least i get to flirt outrageously then too.<br><br>flamingly yours,<br>colette<br><br>ps: i didnÂ’t want to engage in a war of words with you, i have better things to do. after i discovered that iÂ’m equally talented flaming &amp; flirting, i prefer flirting. i offered you some advise, true, i admit sometimes there were veiled sarcasm in my post, but thatÂ’s like what is good for the goose is good for the gander. in fact, numerous people have pointed out your shortcomings but like an ostrich with its head in the sand, you simply refuse to see it, admit it and change for the better.<br><br>sadly, youÂ’re also a hypocrite &amp; i pity you. why do i say youÂ’re a hypocrite? because from reading your posts, i can infer that you treat people differently, making use of them to suit your own ends.<br><br>seriously, if you intend to climb the corporate ladder, you have better learn some diplomacy &amp; tact, for even if you climb to the upper echelon (if ever   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) one day, youÂ’ll never know who youÂ’re going to meet on your way down. and contrary to what you think, most people can spot a hypocrite a mile away. yes, iÂ’m getting personal here, but if you could control your hot temper for a moment, youÂ’ll realize that iÂ’m doing it for your own good. no doubt you would come back with some inane line like Â“if i have friends like you, who needs enemies?Â” or the like.<br><br>to reconciliate or to continue flaming, itÂ’s your call.<br><br>------------------<br>Fools mock at making amends for sin, but goodwill is found among the upright.<br>~ Proverbs 14:9<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 29 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>fucking twinkle shit,<br>u keep rambling on and on abt how freaking successful u are. but u are just some loser living in your own fantasy world. u say ure some executive working in some big shot company? Bullshit.<br>I have noticed that some of ur post are in the afternoon, real executives work during that time.<br>Real executives wont tok abt their A level grades, just like jc students wont tok abt their PSLE scores.  The fact that u mentioned abt A levels tells me that u havent been to university yet. I suppose ur application into Uni got rejected huh. FUCKING LOSER.<br>Real executives wont bother abt some Ah lian girls that they dont even noe; they got much more important things to care abt. The fact that u keep on returning here and spending so much time each time u visit implies that you have nothing better to do. Executives are much more productive than that.<br>And writing good english is NOT second nature to u. Looking at the long time lag between ur previous post (&gt;20min), U have obviously put in much time and effort into writing that simple post. 5 min is all that is needed to write that.<br>U often edit ur postings. A sign of insecurity and a lack of confidence.<br>Also, u claim that u come here to look for the imposter. USE UR FUCKING BRAINS U FUCKING STUPID MORON. U actually think that u can find the imposter here? I really pity u.<br>U do not have to lie abt ur life. We do not mind abt ur background and will not look down on u, so pls do not look down on ur own life and try to create a virtual one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Been looking at the recent exchange between twinkle and gang.. and I totally agree with megadeath's reply.<br><br>Twinkle is a dick sucking piece of trash who probably gets fucked in the ass for a living. As for his sweet girlfriend, has he gone for the sex change operation yet or do the both of you take turns fucking each other up the ass?<br>The way you brag about the qualifications really make me sick... do you think you're the only one around who is a university graduate? You really are a piece of shit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This thread have gone way too long... Well IMO twinkle MAY BE lying about his career, studies, blah blah blah... but does he really have to proof it? Anyone can say he is so and so.. it's up to the person who is reading to decide whether to believe it or not. BTW, some people simply finds enjoyment/satisfaction in argument. Well, they spice up everything and then, people (including me) well post our opinion in just as a form of "seeking attention" and basically, they will support the side which THEY THINK is rite. Insults flying around one another and vulgarity is normal in a more uncivilised message. They will go all out to prove that they are rite and they wanna WIN. Who wouldn't? Well all I wanna say is that this thread ROX~ I love seeing people shooting one another.
