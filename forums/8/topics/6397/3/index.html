Hmm, can I attempt an analysis on your Cancerian quality? (I am very well acquinted to them)  Cancerians do not talk about their feelings or what is bugging them.  However they want and appreciate someone who is there for them, just because he/she is there.  They are actually gentle creatures but they learn to act tough because the world seems unfriendly to someone with great sensitivity and inherent desire to please like Cancerians (ooops, sorry, I shouldn't say this in the open, should I?)  In their bluster Cancerians may seem like a flippant and perverse person but if one is close enough to observe them when they let down their guards, one may be treated to a sight of a wonderful soul behind the facade.  Once you earn a Cancerian's trust, you'll get him/her for life and there's no way he/she is going to drop you for another passing stranger.<br><br>Wah, writing this makes me miss my darling Jade  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Darling, I'm coming!!!!!<br><br>------------------<br>Have you ever started dating because you're too lazy to kill yourself?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After all this little 'heated' discussions above,i feel dat Twinkle's pts in the argument convinced more to his side.....but it seems dat most ppl in the thread are directing their aggressivness at Twinkle....anyway gd job on the argument Twinkle..but i am sure u can make it better sorta to perfection....of course not forgetting in the nice little way of urs<br>okok okok here is my pt of view<br>like what Twinkle said...he neva mention anything sorta compare in terms of education...and (NOT MENTIONING ANY NAMES)so stop behaving like some sore losers down the road who keep bringing out their weak points and make the other party look like he is boasting and suaning other ppl who is weak in dat aspect......another pt...and this is the ironic one....(ONCE again not mentioning any NAMES) in the EYES OF THE SUCKER....Everyone seems to be a sucker to him....so who is the sucky one????....i did heard someone arguing abt someone called Ngkaihoe....hey not knowing him does not mean a big thing and knowing him doesn't make u BIG either....anyway it seems like the person using his name may have his reputation at stake...anyway i seen ngkaihoe photo before....he seems like a real cool dude....i will certainly draw a clear line between those using his name and the real him..Someone may be a real nice guy...but oftenly there r always ppl used their names and make a stain on their reputation.. anyway let me first apologise to the ppl out there who would not agree with me and to those who think they r the ONEs i mentioned Even when i said Not mentioning any names....Get the deep and true meaning behind it guys?Saying sorry to ppl need not be agreeing with them and what izzit got to lose when u r sincere in saying a sorry?It can resolve conflicts...so whats the thing dat is holding u back to be friendly to others....its juz anger and 'FACE' at work...Learn to overcome this and convince ppl in a nice little way and not in a bad nasty way...i am here not to make any enemies but if u guys treat me like one and flame me by calling me a sucker or someone who sux or other nasty things u could think of...then i have nothing to say....(Look for the true meaning behind things)<br></div>

(see? i'm so used to it i actually click on it). the real question is, how you want to treat it. shrug your shoulders and say 'c'est la vie' or throw in your two cents worth? if its the latter here are a few responses you might like to try out.<br><br>1. for a romantic approach -<br>"Hey Kitty, can you go get yourself laid properly and spare us this freaking preening??"<br><br>2. if you prefer a more commercial edge -<br>"Hi there Kitty! I'm selling lives. Would you like to buy one?" (may be applied to io as well)<br><br>3. or if you're into neurology -<br>"Kitty, if ever an intellectual thought were to enter your head you'll die from headache."<br><br>you see, its all about how you want to handle it.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>I can resist anything but temptation.<br><br>Oscar Wilde</div>

I was hoping it would be something more like a free lunch, or some new clothes, new computer parts or something.<br><br>Anyway, lets talk about a story about my friend M.<br><br>M loves to swim and one day M and her family went to FAntasy Island at sentosa. M, being the adventurous person that she is, went to the subarashi (the very high water slide) and took the mat and swooshed down.<br><br>"That was fun!" she though - and she proceeded to climb the subarashi again<br><br>"okay this time, superman style"<br>Andagai she swooshed gracefully down the subarashi.<br><br>M, feeling excited went up again and went down the slide superman style. Unfortunately, the mat gave way and she was sliding down without a mat! It would be fine if ths was a normal slide, but this was a water slide and the force of the water pushed against her swimming costume and pushed it so that she exposed herself!<br><br>M was very embarrased as there was a lifeguard staring at her. M felt like dying.<br><br>And you know what? We are bringing M to Fantasy Island again this Sunday!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Harlow, have I been saying that I'm better than anyone else here? HK was the one who boasted that she got A for PSLE (yeah, big deal...) and insisted to know what I got. I've never said that anybody here is stupid, it's their insecurity that made them infer it.<br><br>But I admit I am having fun harping on HK's 'achievement'. Since she thinks it's so great, then we should give it the attention she wants, shouldn't we?<br><br>BTW, this place is the first that I know celebrates vulgarity and poor personality. What a joke!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We're nto celebrating vulagirty or bad personality...It's just that i think that Kitty has a whole character to herself...She doesn't define herself to any of our standards,..and that, in itself, speaks volumes about her character....whether it is tolerable is up to the individual but frankly speaking kitty is a very nice girl.  When you just look at the fatc that she swears and curses, then thats's all you'll see....<br><br>I also curse and swrear...sometimes even in totally wrong situations..but ok what.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"If only you have met her...." this is a constant refrain. Does that mean that once you have met HK, you should accept everything about her? Even the bad parts? What a stupid argument.<br><br>Firewire, it's alright to swear in private. But public areas are totally different. Swearing is being insensitive the people around you. Yes, you enjoy it but others find it offensive. It's like verbal littering or pollution. There's a reason why social rules exist- so that you don't infringe on others even as you enjoy the utmost freedom to do whatever you like.<br><br>And swearing reflects bad self control. Yes, HK has a lot of character- BAD CHARACTER. I hope you are not encouraging the young and impressionable in this forum to pick up the bad habit.<br><br>It's not just HK's vulgarity that's offensive. It's also her egoism, vanity, and childishness.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What am I trying to achieve? Well, I'm just trying to show HK the error of her ways. If you think my comments are harsh, wait till you go to the real world and face the music. Unlike school, nobody has time to baby you. And they can do worse things than to criticise you, like sacking you for bad behaviour or refusing to promote you. And you can't network because nobody wants to hang around such a low class person. Forget about making any deals if this is the case. If you enjoy being a social pariah, go ahead.<br></div>
