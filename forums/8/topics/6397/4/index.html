            <div class='col-md body'>HK:<br><br>Like you said, fair and just, keeping neutral and being objective.*smiles* But I think that rather than being bother by the arguements why not you carry on with the competition? I am sure it has gather enough publicity already. Show others that you can be mature and a nice lady. Action speaks louder than words.<br><br>Twinkle:<br><br>I think that everyone is unique, you <strong>may be</strong> of high morals and on the upright side of society. But understand this, everyone has a dark side, and of course we do not celebrate them, but rather emcompass them, for it is what makes us unique. To be able to accept a person for what they are is most admirable.<br><br>I for one thing have no conflicts with you before, and do not wish to have, but I would not like to see you jump into conculsions so fast. We forumites are a bunch of nice people and a big family, we flame each other abit here and there but all in the name of fun. It is an exchange of ideas, but we discuss about subjects not attack someone's personality. Should we not be open and accept other? What is a disscussion if the door to your heart is closed? Hope I dun offend you with this, but I think you are only lowering yourself to the levels of HK(which you set yourself), when you argue with her on being childish and vulgar.<br><br>By looking through her past post and putting link to them, is it not childish to argue this way? In the first place do you know what those posts are about? And the reason for her replies? I do not, and thus I do not judge. As for being vulgar, I do not see the difference when it comes to sarcasm. Only it is put in a more civlised way, but it is just as rude.<br><br><blockquote><br><br>If you judge people, you have no time to love them.<br><br>Mother Theresa<br></blockquote>I hope that this will provide you with an insight to how we view each forumite, you included.<br><br>IO:<br><br>Hey, dun rub it in, even though she is your gf, I think you should still take a neutral stand on this. But ultimately I do not thin that HK is at fault or what, maybe just a bit not so tactful, but that's the way she is.<br><br>Maya:<br>Great that you still see the point of the thread.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong></div>

Isn't that something very basic that we all expect??? Little value seems to be put on BGRs nowadays. That's really sad.<br><br>Callan, you've shown yourself not to be objective. HK has behaved badly, telling me repeatedly to "Fuck off". And she wants to flirt around even though she has a bf. But you don't attach a single ounce of blame to her in your comments. I think you and the rest are being really blind. Ultimately that's going to be bad. You're encouraging HK to go on as before. People are going to despise her. Is that what you want?

The outfit I was wearing made me believe I was sizzling. Stood at a queue. Heard a nice voice behind, turned back just slightly. Saw a cool guy - chap A. His hair was all gelled and spiked up and he talked in an American accent, what am I talking about, he was an american. Acted cool, ordered the food. Sat down.<br><br>Chap A was with chap B. I could swear IÂ’ve seen the latter before at some music store, you know, the cool Tower Records staff kind. Ate my onion rings.<br><br>Halfway, noticed Chap B noticing me. Since he was not the target Â–and he was so cool! - I pretended like I never did notice him noticing me. Out of the corner of my eyes I saw him nudging Chap A. Yippee.<br><br>Ate with a feeling of being watched, though actually they rarely looked at me again. Keep affecting an air of cool sophistication but it was hard to do since the burger was too heavy for me. Had a scary feeling that the top was a little bit too tight and unsightly after-meal bulges might show up.<br><br>In a quandary. Finally decided to go. Wondered if I should clear my tray. Decided against it since they were definitely looking at me and I was so scared. Why? Because I felt outcooled. I could never hold a decent conversation with those types, though they fascinate me. So I was prepared to leave in a huff of indifferent air, again, acting cool when I felt least so. Stood up, they were really looking at me andÂ….<br><br>My ankle gave up on me. Almost fell, but they noticed and their eyes widened with amusement, they must have thought I was tripping on something, serve the snobbish chick well! Actually my left ankle could turn very weak after a prolonged cross-legged sitting. Anyway, couldnÂ’t quite meet their eyes, fairly ran out of the place.<br><br>Dumb!

And I was the type who likes to rummage through stuff.<br><br>So one day I saw this carton full of things for sale then a guy approaced me and asked<br><br>"Excuse me, where are the deodarants" I was a little puzzled but pointed to where the deodarants are supposed to be at.<br><br>And I continued with my rummaging. Then another woman asked,<br><br>"Sorry where do you keep bla bla brand shampoo"?<br><br>I was extremely puzzled but answered anyway "I think its over there"<br><br>The last straw came when there was another woman asking me "Where are the perfumes?"<br><br>I was really really puzzled and told her "I don't know anything! I'm just a student!"<br><br>And she gave me an incredulous look and said "I'm so sorry!!
