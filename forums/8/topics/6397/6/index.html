N ya, not to forget, putting words into other's mouths to make his posting more interesting n at the same time, make it easier to defend himself. Licker, really nuthin much for you to read his postings lah. Go spend ur time on something much worthwhile. Ah... saying abt picking on ppl's statement reminds me of something... i really want to luff when he says "bigotry runs real deep here"... dun u ppl juz agree wif me? Didn't want to say anything else abt him. My temper is bad but my intolerance is juz as high. But when he offends my dear, it's the end. But still i maintain my cool. Hey... quik quik... say ur trademark comment... contradicting myself... *PUKE* N i believe he got more attention than me. N we can be assured dat he's trying hard to attract loads of it when he mentioned dat he enjoys the flaming here too much to leave this place. Hiak.<br><br>Adrian : wat reply? which one? N no lah... angry for wat? Me c liao also dun bother to reply. I'm not as petty as some ppl here. N oh... sup kia is ppl juz like u-know-who-is-it. Observe him n u'll know wat it is. Exactly the same.<br><br>Erriegal : Dun wori. We all know who's the real baby here.<br><br>Firewire : U know wat? It's so great of u to sacrifice urself. Not many of the ppl here would want to waste their breath on ppl like him esp. when he said dat ppl here can't seem to know wat's wrg wif them n onli wants to prove themselves correct. BWHAHAHAHAHA!!! Hmmm... or maybe he's juz trying to demostrate to us wat it means.  :p<br><br>Mr Hata_san : U 2-headed snake!!! KI SI LAH!!! Oh no... i juz spewed a hokkien expletive again. Ha. Wat can u do? Flame me loh. I know i know, u want to say i getting big-headed coz ppl defending me rite? *yawn* Can tell wat he wants to say b4 he actually says it. Ppl, get my point? Hahaha!!!<br><br>Wow... so impressed!!! Does that means u can find plenty of willing parties? Ppl, food 4 thoughts... "do u ppl think he'll go n go abt his partners' faults in bed?" ? Makes me wonder... hmm... Oops... i believed i juz did wat Adrian said. Me juz crossed the line of intruding his privacy. Hey sorry ppl, the topic dat i juz posted is now closed.<br><br>N i think he n Wizard deserves each other too. Both r the u-know-i-know type. Dunwan to say so much abt them. Too much things for me to list. Me will type till chiu sng. Somemore, i dunwan to be like him... say ppl wat wat wat. N i still remember wat one of my teachers shared wif me...
