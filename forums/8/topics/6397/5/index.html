            <div class='col-md body'>Firewire,<br><br>you're one person whose postings I have long decided to ignore, unless it is addressed to me.<br><br>One hint. You often contradict yourself:<br>"I'm not trtying to flame you..hope you understand that..."<br><br>"Seriously speaking...you would be much happier living with the Amish.."<br><br>"Did you know that when you go out, if you do,..."<br><br>Second hint. You never consider the issue properly before shooting off your mouth. I know you like to portray yourself as a breaker of conventions. But you never look into why conventions are there in the first place. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.<br><br>Third Hint. You like to champion underdogs. Maybe for whatever reasons, you feel like one yourself? Anyway, the point is, the underdogs are despised for a good reason sometimes. To champion them blindly makes you a bigger clown than they are. It reflects more on you than on them. Consider carefully whether they have behaved badly before you take sides.<br><br>Geez, I'm really losing my patience with you. For your own sake, please give more thought to your postings before you press the send button. I'm sure I'm not the first to tell you that some of your postings suck. Big time.<br><br>Okay, now back to your points.<br><br>As I've mentioned before in one of my postings (do you even bother to read or do you just want to win the argument?), I don't care if HK swears privately. I don't care if she swears among her friends, to their great delight and amusement. IT'S NOT THE SWEARING PER SE.<br><br>What is really annoying about this brat is that she swears about everything and anything, provoked or not. Go check the links in my previous message. What does this say about her?<br><br>(If you think it's mean of me to put links to her messages, then it implies that you think I have exposed some shameful secret of hers. But this kiddo here revels in it. She thinks she is real cool. Really reflects her emotional maturity.)<br><br>She does not respect herself enough to behave in a civilised mannner. How can she expect others to respect her? Respect is won, not given.<br><br>Besides she swore "Fuck you" repeatedly to me. How do you like it if she does that to you? Answer me this. Callan the self-righteous sure didn't bother to answer this question. He is too busy playing up his fantasy role of an honourable knight because he never was one to start with.<br><br>And again and again, I repeat that it is not just her vulgarity that's offensive. It's her vanity and egotism. Please lah, she goes around thinking that her e-mail add is worth fighting for and boasts that she has the biggest boobs among her friends. What a joke! If she offers to sleep with the guy, then maybe lah. If her breasts are so big, then she should prove it by letting us have a good look. hahahahaha......<br><br>All this talk about judging and moral high ground is rubbish. Firstly, you told me not to judge and called me putritanical at the same time. And secondly, as somebody once put it, excuse me while I take the elevator down to your level. Behaving politely and being sensitive to the context you are in is not a high requirement. It's the basic. You don't say lodly, 'Good riddance to bad rubbish' in a funeral do you? FYI, I swear when I mad as hell. But I always make sure that the people around me won't be offended first.<br><br>[This message has been edited by twinkle (edited 04 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TWINKLE!..AS I have stated, I was making an observation only...one dotted with my own opinions of those observations...and I really do think you'd have fun living with the amish.<br><br>...and yes...Kitty has screamed many vulgairties to me many times...I really dun care...i'm really not that sensitive to take it seriosuly.  Besides that she was really carfeul to not swear in front of me when i first got to know her.  So what does that say? At least she knows enuff civility to be curteous and polite to people she dun know and never met before when confrontign them in real life....<br><br>The only person who seesm to be firing off crude remarks is you twinkle...Frankly speaking....and that can be corroborated by many people....heh....<br><br>Anyway your judgement of people makes me think that you are somehow better than the rest of us.<br><br>Why is it that a girl cannot swear and curse?...even if it's at inappropriate times or situations....????  Many people do the excat same thing...<br><br>...and her egoism and mannerism?.....<br><br>pal, we are on the net...most people here role play....Personally I find that Kitty is fun to reply to because she has witty remarks...even though some of them are crude...but have a sense of humour...I know that most of what she says to people she says in jest onli so I dun really take it to heart.....<br><br>Anyway I give this benefit of doubt to everyone here...<br><br>The only people I dun giff this benefit of doubt to are people who think that they have morale high ground...that somehow their way is the only way..that everyone must conform to something...<br><br>Convention is set by small minded people who have no vision for like minded people who cannot think for themselves. Convention is there to show you what can be changed.  It isn't there for yout o follow.  Some people break it out of their own personal reason and some break it in an attempt to change it....but either way they show a willingness to be something other than...<br><br>Why conform just because this set of rules say so...obviously we aren't talking about laws here, but speaking about it in social context....<br><br>of cos we would liek to have polite people all the time..but it takes many types of people anyway...just because you kenna by someone dun mean that they are a bad person...you may not like them but no need to go to such extents to make things worse...<br><br>Anyway I'm sure I contradicted myself again...but hey...I'm human...I'd prefer to live my life as best as I can...and that measn not having to keep going back over my own tracks to make sure that i haven't broken everythign i belief in...everythign is flexible..to an extent...be rigid and...well...guai guai...that;s all i can say<br><br>Please lah...you judge so much and make it sound as if people cannot judge you also...as if you were above all this childish things...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you for confirming how bigoted this place is. When you guys argue, it's not about whether the points I made are valid, but because the person in question is your friend.<br><br>Award for today goes to.... erriegal... for being so articulate:<br>twinkle..this is for you....~!@@##$%%#@$%^ and more...<br><br>So you're bascially saying that Firewire is still wrong but I support him anyway? That sure accounts for the 'baby' in your title.<br><br>Firewire, don't embarass yourself more can? Contradicting yourself just shows up that you don't use your brain. Or do you have one to start with?<br><br>You can't even explain the contradiction I pointed out.<br><br>"The only person who seesm to be firing off crude remarks is you twinkle"<br><br>Oh really? So 'fuck you' and 'chee bye' are not crude remarks????<br><br>You keep saying that I have a moral high ground. So what is so 'high' about my moral high ground? Or is it because you don't have a moral ground to start with?<br><br>I think that I am better than anyone else? How is that ever shown in my postings? You have not shown any examples at all. And please lah- you tokd me not to judge and you judged me by calling me puritanical. You've lost any form of credibility possible. Oops! You don't have any to start with    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>"Why is it that a girl cannot swear and curse?...even if it's at inappropriate times or situations....???? Many people do the excat same thing..."<br><br>The answer is so obvious! I can't belive you can't see it. Because it's rude and offensive. So do I have a right, just because I'm annoyed at you, to say, "Firewire, I really think your brain is smaller than your dick! And just as floppy!"<br><br>No, right? Yes, I am offensive in the examples I use. But this is my way of showing how offensive I find HK. It's incredible that you can't see the obviousness of how crude vulgarities are.<br><br>You talked so much about convention. But it's so one-sided that it is easily argues that the reverse is true. So ALL convention is small minded? Convention also applies to saying 'hi' to your friends when you meet them on the street, you know?<br><br>BTW, you said "Many people do the excat same thing..." when arguing that vulgarities are acceptable. You have the exact sheep mentality that you condemn.<br><br>I think it's tiring to go on and on about what I think about HK. I've made that abundantly clear. Who knows? She may have her good points. But it's so clear that you're biased when you argue that your points not credible. HK has never done anything wrong, it's all Twinkle's fault. Really meh?<br><br>As usual, IO is his articulate self. I don't even bother to reply because he's shown himself to be less than believable. Soon, you'll join his ranks Firewire.<br><br>[This message has been edited by twinkle (edited 05 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Twinkle: Basically how this works is if you have big boobs and u look good (even if u don't u can still pretend to be here), u will have all the guys barking for u, drooling and boot-licking away. These guys think with the other head, are completely ruled by testosterone and have no qualms about trading in their dignity. If u are crude, they call it having a personality. If you post dumb messages, they call it "fun" messages. If anyone declares war on u, he/she is also declaring war on them.<br><br>Be the better man (we know u are) and just let the pussy be. I know u aren't having much fun arguing with these lowly mongoloids like io and firewire.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*sees wizard and twinkle wearign white robes and pointed hoods carryinf placards....*<br><br>..whahahhahahahaha.....like i said...Moral high ground.<br><br>By what rights do you have to condemn anyone in the first place.  If you don't like someone just say you don't like them and leave it at that.<br><br>Wizard..and Twinkle.  Now I can say: I don't like u two.<br><br>Benefit of doubt has been waived.  Nobody here(nto that I know of anyway) thought that you were any lower or less human than anyone else....but apparently the way you two seem to go at it, we are less than acceptable to your standards...which is fine actually...but don't need to go to such extents to explain yourself..we know we don't live up to your judgements..and frankly I think we don't care.  Life is too vast for us to worry about how you two are feeeling.<br><br>Anyway, you are wrong in saying that people here only defend each other on the grounds that they know each other and are friends..Totally untrue for most people..Of cos maybe some do, but the majority don't.<br><br>I belief that errigal is supporting me, not because I am her firend, but because I am fighting for something other than myslef.  I'm not defending anyone, but I defend a person's right to be who they want to be...crude, vulgar, or otherwise....<br><br>But sorry I can't and won't defend peoplewho think that they are above us.<br><br>we commoners live life differently from all you high court jesters. Life for us is much more carefree...<br><br>Courtesy is good.  Being nice is good...but it's not good all the time....anyway i dun think i want to explain the nuances of net politics to you as you take it as real.<br><br>You see twinkle...in real life...most people don't go around cursign and swearing at people they don't know...it's quite rare.  And that's good...but people do swear...So your saying that swearign and cursing shouldn't be done in public?....<br><br>Just liek people shouldn't smoke in public?  Women also shouldn't wear revealing clkthes in public...for that matter women shouldn;'t be in public at all....<br><br>get my drift?..same train of thought.<br><br>If you can't tolerate people who smoke and find that everywhere you go people are smoking..what would you do?...stay home for the rest of your life?...live with it man...<br><br>and it has nothing to do with convention.  It has everything to do with accepting that people are going to do what they are going to do no matter what anybody says or does.<br><br>I think that maybe your first replies were aimed at hurting kitties rep...but subsequent ones degenrated to mere purist points of view...then it has now moved to become "I am better than all of you mongrels"..<br><br>But hey ok lah..if you really think you are..but I'm haiving fun living like a mongrel...and i can seriously tell you...you would have a hard time trying to find fault with my poersonality, character or civility...but hey...if you take net talk as real life then that's your perogative anyway...doebns't mean they are all like that.<br><br>Just as sure aas i am that you are nto as judgemental about people in real life...I could be wrong but hey...i won't presume to make you out to be some evil person in rel life....but your net persoanlity leaves even mroe to be desired than kitty's net personality....<br><br>*wansai carries his rusted cane and hobbles off intot hte sunset weartign peasant clothing*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wizard,<br><br>this is the best proof that looks count over personality. If there are any other arguments about this issue, let this thread be the reference.<br><br>Firewire,<br><br>"I'm not defending anyone, but I defend a person's right to be who they want to be...crude, vulgar, or otherwise....<br><br>But sorry I can't and won't defend peoplewho think that they are above us."<br><br>Well done! What a classic line! And you don't even realise the contradiction and hypocrisy in your statements. Thank u for confirming your inability to use your brain.<br><br>You've also conveniently side stepped all the points I've raised. Why? Can't answer them is it? You can't substantiate all your talk about moral high ground. Anybody who disagrees with you is a self-righteous person. You contradict yourself so much that it is either (1) you have no brain or (2) you are a hypocrite. And you are a apologist of all kinds of undesirable behaviour, like swearing and drug use. And you repeat your points without any variations to shed light on the matter. You just want to win, not to explore the issue. You are the most close-minded person I know who has claimed to be liberal.<br><br>If this is what makes you a sentinel in this place, I give up on it. Biogotry runs real deep here.<br><br>Hello Kitty has got all the attention she desired. The people here have shown what they are really like. Twinkle here decides that he has wasted enough of his time.<br><br>[This message has been edited by twinkle (edited 05 March 2000).]</div>
