            <div class='col-md body'>Morning to you..Twinkle!<br><br>I'm wondering to myself whether should I continue to reply? I know that I'll contradict myself about the topic "Most Interesting Reply Gets My Email Address!!!" if I carried on. I'm also not looking for that "pot of gold" at the end of the rainbow...or should I say "thread".<br><br>I know that I'm not a good mediator..I didn't said I was. Neither did I took side of the arguments. But, somethings  you got to knows is that I'm quite "close" to some of them in here. It is through this kind of interactions..that I took in the good and the bad of each individuals in here..likewise..I to them. As I mentioned..no-one is perfect so is Kitty. But..one thing I likes about her..is her's "natural" self. She don't hide behind a "veil" to pretended to be a character in here. U knows..the "goodies" type. No offence intend here to the rest. Anyway..her usage of "vulgarities" in here..seems humourous to me. Don't take it too personally..and the wounds would rubs off us. About the usage of the word "perogative" I would like to remind you that "rights" or "mandate" are elected-given, not self accorded. The natural parents of the spoil kid  have that "perogative" to discipline the wayward child..anything more..it became an abuse. My advise from a professional to another is..don't change what can't be done by oneself. Follows the wind..you'll live happier. If you can't win them..why not join them? A friend won is better than an enemy made. Think it over...good day to you all.<br><br>That's me..Tommy F14 supersonic....away!!!!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello!<br><br>I see that calm has prevailed. Now is time to answer some of my buddies questions. IO..firstly..I thank you for your warm welcome. Feels nice to be wanted...hahaha. Congratulation goes out to you for being the Lover of the Official Cat here.<br><br>Kitty..you brought my mother into the picture. It was a compliment and I thank you for that too. You forgotten that I was brought up and cultured by my late Grandma..hahaha. Tsk Tsk..honey..you really lost that Loving Feeling.<br>What brought me in here?..well the answers is all over the room. The cries of a Feline in distress. I just couldn't stand and look. You told me you are all for Human's Rights..me too..Animal's Rights...hahaha..just joking. All the best to you in your future endeavours here.<br><br>Lastly...Y2Care. You not only brought in my mother, but my father into the picture by calling me son of the Gun. Hahaha.....that's okie with me. The last time I heard you are quitting? You left behind a poem that *rock* the thread..and you are quitting?<br>Like I told you..you lack that self-confidence in yourself. This time round..I didn't push you onto the horse. It was you who climbed up and jumped down when the heat is ON. Well..that is your "perogative". Hahaha..sound familiar?<br><br>I just hope it is not a Calm before a STORM.<br><br>That's me..Tommy F14 supersonic..away!!!!!!!!</div>

Mister Twinkle, got that?<br><br>Also, I personally feel that making friends are always better than making an enemy. This personal attack thread had gone too far. Much too far. Isnt it time this should be closed for good?<br><br>This thread was not started wif ill intentions. It is you, Twinkle, who started your super flaming session here, who ruined this thread. Can't u treat this as just any other thread and continue wif your life?<br><br>How much pounds of fat will u lose by replying to this your-so-called-stupid topic wif your neverdying flames?<br><br>Or do people PAY you to flame her? Wat will you gain?<br><br>Kitty may be a bitch as you had said, most of us in this forum will not know. But u <strong>MAY also BE AN IDIOTIC FOOL TAKING ESCTASY EVERYNITE AND TYPING STUPID MEANINGLESS FLAMES DIRECTED AT KITTY</strong>. We will also not know.<br><br>Kitty may not be FIT for a friend to you, Twinkle. But she is a friend of ours, including mi and the regulars at the old SGGirls chatroom.<br><br>And incuring the wrath of her indirectly also incurs the wrath of her friends.<br><br>------------------<br><strong> Shit is the essence of life...
