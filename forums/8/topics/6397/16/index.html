            <div class='col-md body'>Now I know that the imposter is one of HK's friends. Nice ploy- to try to get sympathy and set me up at the same time. Otherwise, why is she so reluctant to reveal something as simple as when it happened? And that imposter had the same limited vocab she has. I would't put it above her to pull such a stunt. Look at pooooooorrrr y2care. She didn't care about hurting his feelings just to get a scrap of attention for herself.<br><br>Oh well, at least people are smart enough to tell it couldn't have been me. Only somebody as dumb as HK can make the claim that the imposter sounds like me.<br><br>Megadeth, you speak exactly like IO. Nobody has matched his foul mouth except you and HK. Speaking of that fella, what a little sissy he is, abandoning his girlfriend like that. Either that or he is a greater sissy for not daring to criticise somebody under his own name  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And you have 8 postings so far.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hypocrite? Am I? Was I?<br>I term the character no better than the "double-headed snake". Of course, the latter is more venomous in its "vocation". I said "kinda like you" in a sense admired your pragmatism and your use of English in your rebuttal. I came across some of the so called creame de la creame  of the Forum..and I really can't comprehend their "Powderful England". As a layman... I rather settle for a 50 word retort anytime.. than to go through the "hassle" of figuring out what they are trying to"impress" on us. Beside you..I will like to name two whom I also look up upon. They are Rinoa and Lexelle.(Sorry Kitty..I didn't put yours here..I dun intend to start another fracas..hahaha).<br>Criticise? I'm frank in my opinion and judgement. I try not to step on other's toe..and if I did..I'll always apologise. Words are "cheap" and I dun mind saying "I'm sorry" if it can cool tempers.<br>And I be very frank on you. Twinkle..you are crusading for a "Lost Cause" by starting your flaming here. It'll only jeopadise your "standing" in the social and working life..not to say this Forum. If that's is the way you reacts to every individual that came in to "peacekeep"..I'm wondering how you perform in your Board's meeting.I can only say that your tempers gets the better of you.<br>For the thing that you asks for..I'm sure Kitty could provide you the time since the date was on Tuesday...just give her a little more time. Sincerely..I still kinda like you. Friend? It's not impossible..but there is still a "gap" to be bridge.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tommy, my oh my oh my, what a hot temper you've got there  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>My aggressiveness and persistence are exactly the reasons why I have done well at work. Of course, I'm also savvy enough to know how much to push. People are willing to put up with my crap as long as I'm of value to them.<br><br>And my wit and sarcarsm are exactly what draw women to me. Too bad, bad guys do win  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If you want to think of me as a loser and outcast, by all means do so. At the end of the day, I'm still a happy man with a satisfying job, bunch of tennis pals, and a sweet girlfriend. Nothing you guys can say will change any of that. Living well is the best revenge. Except of course I don't have any vegeance to wreck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To be frank, I don't really care about this forum. It has become so trashy, people here are so obesessed with oral sex and peering through schoolgirls' uniforms for a peek at their bras. And there's hardly any moral ambiguity; everything is either black or white. People here don't seem to have any sense of humour too. Reading their posts is getting very tiring, can't imagine going into an IRC chat with them. Social standing here? This is meant to be a joke right?<br><br>(Disclaimer: My comments about this forum is very generalized and does not apply to everybody)<br><br>Tommy, it's nice of you to offer friendship. At first, it felt like the plasticky stuff you get from industry functions. I hope you know what I'm referring to. But I'm willing to offer you the benefit of doubt now. Losing your temper makes you a more real person (Hiak! No offence though). Friends? Okay, but no more of that gooey sentimental stuff please. I get more than enough of that from my girlfriend.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>twinkle<br><br>true, from my memory (who has time to re-read the three hundred over posts?) you never did call Hello Kitty a bitch but whatÂ’s this? *eyes widening slightly* youÂ’d rather call her Â‘la chienneÂ’? excuser moi, monsieur, isnÂ’t that Â‘the bitchÂ’ in french? why do you demean yourself calling Hello Kitty that now when you have resisted all this while? and er, do we look like we care if vous parlez tres bien le francais?<br><br>i canÂ’t help but think that youÂ’ve carried this grudge against Hello Kitty too far. true, in the beginning your advice for Hello Kitty was good, as gals, we shouldnÂ’t be seen mouthing vulgarities left, right &amp; centre, but as days passes, your attacks became more personal &amp; it does not reflect well upon you. in the beginning, you impressed me with your good command of english &amp; civility but of late youÂ’ve descended into the mentality of needing to have the last word. in fact, iÂ’ve read Hello KittyÂ’s responses about ignoring you but like a bull dog with a bone, you refused to let go &amp; provoked her even when she has done nothing to you. so what if her intelligence is not as good or as high as yours? do you think she cares? do you think we care?<br><br>we know that youÂ’re highly educated &amp; holds a great job, so why canÂ’t you be a bigger man &amp; let Hello Kitty has her fun. after all, this is her thread, you can abstain from participating if it pisses you. no one is holding a gun to your head to make you contribute to this thread. let me just ask you a question, if you see a girl in real life spewing vulgarities, would you go up to her &amp; tell her off? or if you know a female acquaintance who spouts obscenities every five seconds, would you tell her off? you would? good for you. and if she still persists? would you try again? you would? what a good friend. but the point is would you have let it disintegrate into this?<br><br>this is a public forum, we come here for fun, to relax &amp; to read about other peopleÂ’s views, note the word Â“other peopleÂ’sÂ” , it implies that people donÂ’t think alike, if youÂ’re not happy with their views, fine, posts your views but is there a need for you to attack the person mercilessly? for twinkle, thatÂ’s what youÂ’ve been doing. true, Hello Kitty is no angel but most of the forumites know that, many a times, i'm amazed at her vulgarities, but i donÂ’t judge her &amp; even if i did, i kept my opinions to myself. as Hello Kitty has requested several times for you to leave this thread if youÂ’re not happy with it, i think you should. yes, thereÂ’s your right to your freedom of speech thing, well, Hello Kitty has hers too. if you want to flame her, by all means go start a new topic &amp; let other like-minded forumites join you &amp; if Hello Kitty wants to defend herself, sheÂ’ll visit you in that thread.<br><br>but as i see it, twinkle, it would seem that flaming Hello Kitty is a secret obsession that drives you. i wonder if perversely, youÂ’re indeed smitten with Hello Kitty &amp; donÂ’t give that crap about you would rather be doing ... or die first that kind of reply, you know what they say about protesting too much. and if youÂ’re not enamored with her, why this constant need to keep in contact with her almost daily via the posts even if theyÂ’re flaming posts. why? Why? WHY? do feel you a void in your life if you donÂ’t flame her almost daily &amp; hoping to get her rebuttals to you in response?<br><br>*bracing myself* yes, i think i may have made myself an enemy here &amp; if you should feel the urge to flame me in french, let me advise you, donÂ’t bother. Â’coz i donÂ’t know french all that well. flame me in plain english, it will do &amp; if youÂ’re wrong, iÂ’ll rebut you, but if youÂ’re right, iÂ’ll graciously accept your flames.<br><br>and regarding the person who impersonated you in the irc, yes, what he did was very wrong &amp; i hope he/she will have the courage to own up &amp; apologize to twinkle. but twinkle, i think you should be magnanimous enough to forgive him/her and as for your threat to sue him/her, i would hope you wonÂ’t carry it out. in order for you to get the information required so that you can sue, i think youÂ’ll have to make a police report &amp; certain wrongdoings, once a police report is made, you may not have the right to drop the case even if you wanted to later and it will proceed as a case of the state against civilian. why destroy the future of this forumite when all he/she did was have fun at your expense? i know that you may say that itÂ’s easy for me to write this as iÂ’m not the person involved, very true. i can understand your anger but please do spare a thought for this personÂ’s future, iÂ’m happy to read in your other thread a while ago that youÂ’re willing to let the matter rest. just a suggestion here, perhaps next time, should you discover someone else impersonating you, it would be best if you post it without fingering anyone first, youÂ’re not doing yourself or anyone else a favour when you point a finger without solid evidence to back up your claims.<br><br><blockquote><strong>My postings are always laced with sarcasm and wit. I've a sauve customer (hiak!), je parle francaise, you'll NEVER catch me speaking in Hokkien (so low class, like sinking to the level of ah lians like HK! YUCKS!!!!!!).</strong></blockquote>this sentence offends me although iÂ’m not a Hokkien, in fact i think it would offend the entire Hokkien clan. it just shows that youÂ’re the worst kind of snob and for your information, i do speak Hokkien, in fact Hokkien has the widest range of obscenities. well, hereÂ’s one ah lian who can speak Hokkien, Teochew &amp; bits of Cantonese and proud of it. and twinkle by the way, this ah lian also speaks &amp; writes English beautifully.<br><br>just to share a quotation with you but i havenÂ’t got a clue who said it: A man is known almost as well by the words he uses as by the company he keeps. Choose both from among the best.<br><br>take a deep breath &amp; keep your cool. bye!<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 27 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>******<br>you'll NEVER catch me speaking in Hokkien (so low class, like sinking to the level of ah lians like HK! YUCKS!!!!!!).<br>******<br><br>Hi Twinkle! Correct me if I'm wrong, but is not "Ah Lian" a Hokkien term? Sorry, but here's confirmation that "ah lian" is indeed a  origination from hokkien. You will not find the term in English dictionaries. So have you sunk to the SO CALLED depth of H kitty, whom I assume you do not have a good impression of? Hmmm... Do not fret, cos she is not the yucky low class being you have made her out to be. And neither are you, since based on your above mentioned quote, you have proved to be on the same level as her. Unless of course you beg to differ?<br><br>BTW, are you by any chance a chinese? If so, aren't you ridiculing the cultural roots of your own race? Are you suffering from inferior complexity of being one? Or is it because of hokkien vulgarites? If that is indeed the case, doesn't English too has its fair share of vulgarites? I think its all depends on the individuals utilising the language. English can be just as crude when in the wrong hands. Otherwise, any other particular reasons why in your opinion Hokkien is classified as inferior?<br><br>And if you are not chinese, are you by any chance a racist?<br><br>*******<br>Anyway, don't you guys notice several discrepancies between me and that imposter? My postings are always laced with saracsm and wit. I've a sauve customer (hiak!), je parle francaise,<br>*******<br><br>Sarcasm, definitely I agree with you. Wit and suave? Ermm...<br><br>Twinkle, everyone can make so called witty (those nasty and crude comments) comments. Its only we choose not to. It doesn't make you smart or a winner when you do. And your probably the only one who thinks you are. Please dish out logics, not insults. Is that all your capable of?<br><br>*****<br>The imposter not funny or cool.<br>*****<br><br>Agree wholeheartedly. But IMHO, neither are you.<br><br>*****<br>I'm going to report both to StarHub and the police and screw that wimp good. I've checked, this is classified as criminal, not civil.<br>*****<br><br>This is definitely not a criminal case. Which quack lawyer if any did you consult?<br><br>Criminal case - Robbery, rape, murder, theft etc...<br>The state police press charges. Victims if any, not involved in any legal expenses. They are to turn prosecution witness for the police.<br><br>Civil case - Examples like your case.<br>Any court proceedings expenses paid for by the individual. You have to sought your own lawyer and pay for any expenses since you are the one pressing/pursuing your own charges. Seriously, no state police in their right mind would pay for your law suit. Overall a time consuming and tedious process. Would have been a criminal case if it involved things like unauthorised internet account access, hacking.....<br><br>***<br>Net impersonation is persecutable under Singaporean laws (Re: David Tan case).<br>***<br><br>On what grounds are you suing him/her? Impersonation? The only form of impersonation in this case was in the form of your nick TWINKLE. Sad to say your chances of winning this case if you do decide to pursue is virtually nil. Well, there are miracles.(Miracles like bribing the judge, but not advisable in Singapore                         <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ).<br><br>Of course, you would have had a strong case if the imposter gave out any personal details, forms of reference or hints relating to your actual name, phone number etc or personal particulars in order to create the impression that you were involved. Furthermore, you risked being counter sued for maligning the defendant if you lose your case. In other words, you are in a disadvantageous postion as your personal ident was never compromised in any way whatsoever during the course of impersonation. Defamation? How can there b defamation when solely your nick info was involved. So you gonna sue him for Nick impersonation/defamation? Duh!<br>Net impersonation is persecutable under Singaporean laws?<br>Yes definitely true, but this would only apply in the latter example.<br><br>And of cos you would win the case either way, if the so called imposter was........ YOU?( possibly the only way you are ever gonna taste victory.)<br><br>Would you fight a losing battle?? *shrug* Up to you. Well, just letting you know what your immersing yourself into. If you do intend to file a lawsuit, do consider the repercussions. Think I'm spouting nonsense?Any doubts? Need verification? Please refer to your own lawyer. That is the best proof. Support your arguments with valid explainations?<br><br>Anyway, whats your prob, seems like you and the imposter are birds of the same flock. Somehow, you two share some sort of a strange abusive fetish for hello kitty. Now you've got a comrade!<br><br>Whatever your argument might be,I think its quite clear to the rest who is making sense.<br><br>*********************************<br>Oh well, lemme dig up the name of the bitchiest producer in TCS first....<br><br>y2care, you're in luck. I've dug up the name for you.<br><br>If you're in the entertainment line, you'll know who the influential 'dear daniel' in TCS is lah. No need for me to tell you at all. Please go and do some blowing exercises before you meet him hor?<br><br>Y2Care, go flip ST Life! and 8 Days. That Daniel is always quoted on some TCS stuff. He was in the news a few weeks ago. C'mon, are you sure you're in Showbiz? How many Daniels are there in TCS who are gay and high profile? If you don't bother to do your homework on the industry, how can you ever hope to make it big?!<br>*********************************<br><br>Twinkle, if anyone is liable to a lawsuit, don't you think its you?<br>Hope Mr Daniel doesn't come across your postings. I chalenge you to submit your comments to Mr daniel within 24 hours. (sounds familiar?)You are scandalising and ruining one's reputation. Not to mention your less then flattering<br>remarks.... Please dun make accusations based on rumours. Any solid evidence to back up your claim or is it based on the so called hearsay "truth". Not everything you hear is true. You have really made it too obvious.<br>An to whether it holds true is not important, as<br>you are just as liable as the imposter if not more to a lawsuit due to scandalising.<br>Yes, you can sued for scandalising.<br><br>********<br>So far, novbody has bothered to tell me when this IRC chat took place. Nobody is interested to catch the fella, is it????!!!<br><br>Or was it one of you, trying to get me into trouble? I wouldn't put you below that.<br>********<br><br>You think we NEED to get you into trouble?<br>You underestimate yourself.<br><br>**************************<br>Now we have finally unmasked how sincere HK is in her desire to offer her e-mail address. When a suitor gets serious, what does she do?<br>**************************<br>Like Spy previously stated, I had her email ages ago. And to think you thought I was serious??? Wahahhahahahah! You are so __________ (feel free to to put in most appropiate adjectives. And there are aplenty.)  Sorry, maybe my intention wasn't too conspicuous.<br><br>Love poems??? Hahahha. It was done tongue in cheek. Most would have realised it. Unfortunately, you failed to see the light side of it. Its just for fun. Why? Personally, I find Kitty pretty fun to dee siao                         <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. (no, I'm not ashamed of using Hokkien.) Is that why you like flaming H kitty?<br>All the while, this has been nothing but a game between kitty and me. Heard that? A game?<br>Ever heard of having a bit of fun? She knows it, I know it.  And if you have any doubts, too bad, up to you to believe. I have made myself clear here and do not wish to make further clarifications.<br><br>********<br>Tsk tsk, HK and her usual brainless self! How am I supposed to track down the fella if I don't have the details of when he committed the offence?<br>Gosh, somebody should rob you. You'll run to the police station and say, "Help, somebody robed me! I can't remember anything that happened but you must catch him!" Like they are psychic or something. Duh?!<br>********<br><br>Twinkle, has it again occured to you, that you are the victim, not kitty, and you are the one running to kitty, totally clueless, pleading for the time when the irc conversation took place. NOT KITTY. You are the CLUELESS ONE. Not kitty. U need the info, not her.<br>And she is under no obligations to satisfy your queries.<br>You are the victim of impersonation, Not HER.<br><br>"Help, somebody robed me! I can't remember anything that happened but you must catch him!"<br><br>"Help, Somebody impersonated me! I do not know who nor the time it took place!<br>But I must catch him!"<br><br>Twinkle, see the similarities? To borrow your quote, Yup, Kitty can't remember when it took place. Sorry, but how to help you? Like you think Kitty's psychic or something? Duh!<br><br>*********<br>And I've never called HK 'bitch' in ANY of my postings. Go check! I'll call her a toilet bowl anytime.<br>*********<br><br>So did you or did you not call H kitty a bitch in french like what colette said?( thanks colette for your info) If you did, you have been contradicting yourself throughout.<br><br>I have made myself pretty clear here, and shall not be involved in any more verbal wars with you whatever your reply.<br><br>My next reply?? Maybe for the sacred 400t/ 500th posting if there is one. (Dun think so, and hope not. Just to drop bye and say hi) Bye twinkle                         <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> (no hard feelings), and the others                         <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by y2care (edited 08 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gosh, I'm gone for a little while and that's so much action. If I am the attention seeker you guys make me out to be, I would be so thrilled   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Ariana, obviously, you have missed the point of the exchange. When I bring up my 'A' level qualifications, it is to show that it is no big deal, just like it is no big deal to get an 'A' for PSLE. It's such a joke that somebody can claim the latter- or any academic result- as an achievment! But then again, you ARE trying to nit pick, so you'll bring up anything, won't you?<br><br>Well, I've never asserted that I'm superior to everybody else because of my grades or job. If you want to assume, it's fine by me   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It doesn't take much to be superior to somebody who cannot finish her sentences...., ...., ....... (hahahaha!) Perhaps, I should answer you in your preferred mode next time, like this ......., ......, ..... (hahaahahahah)<br><br>You inflamed instead of cooling things down. It wasn't the comment about rabid. It's the comment about asking me to stop. I had already done so. The purpose of coming back, which you are again unable to realise, was to find out who the imposter was. Some help you are!<br><br>If this brings out the worse in you, it really takes very little to do so   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>P.S: Ohhh.... baby, I luuurrrvvvee being called a bastard. I'm a naughty boy, spank me! Hahahahhaahhahhahahahaha........<br><br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>Colette,<br><br>I did not *resist* calling HK a bitch. There is nothing to resist. It just never occurred to me, because there are more apt decriptions around. To call her 'la chienne' would be more fun than calling her bitch outright, because you'll probably hear noises coming out of HK's head as she tries to work that out (hiak!) Of course, you would not accept this explanation, because you are hell bent in picking fault with me.<br><br>Collete, you've come in too late. I've stopped harrassing a week back. I only came back to find out who the imposter was. Go and check the dates of the postings. Your uprighteous huffing and puffing is irrelevant because it's overdue. Too bad   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>For a while, I came exactly with fun in mind, which you claimed that people should. Did I get upset when people swore repeatedly at me? If this is the case, I would have killed myself during Army! I had more fun coming up with funny replies and laughing at HK. Call it my kind of entertainment if you will   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Are you going to object? Don't forget, you yourself claim that everybody is entitled to their own kicks, like HK and this stupid thread.<br><br>Secret obessession with HK? Oh please, an episode of X-files is more likely than this happening! If I really liked HK, I would have snapped at y2care's attempt to bring us together or insisted on having her e-mail address. What an incredible joke! Sorry to disappoint you but this is not a movie, comic book or romance novel. Been watching/reading too much of these.<br><br>As I've mentioned in another thread, I will let the imposter go. You obviously don't bother to keep track before you hurl accusations. Again. Nit picking, mon cherie?<br><br>Gosh Collete, for somebody who is against boasting, you sure aren't shy of enumerating your language skills. Irony, isn't it? Well, for me, it's not the language (i.e. Hokkien) per se. It's the kind of thuggish behaviour that follows it. If a desire not to be associated with this behaviour is called snobbish, so be it. Racist? Go check the dict (sorry can't offer mine   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ) Have I passed any denigrating remarks about racial characteristics? Language and race overlaps, but are not one and the same. Shouldn't somebody of your erudition be aware of this?<br><br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>y2care,<br><br>what's the point of coming back to embarrass yourself? You're repeating Collete's points, don't you have a mind of your own? No wonder your song (or poem? can't be bothered to remember) is so stale.<br><br>You obviously don't know a single bit about the law. What is defamation, can you even tell? It's not just about making damaging comments, but FALSE damaging comments. It's true that Dear Daniel is gay and bitchiness is considered opinion/fair comment. Too bad   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And Internet law is different from real world law in certain instances because of the problem of tracking. You know nothing about law, your pretensions are laughable!<br><br>If you insist on believing that I'm that Twinkle in IRC, go ahead. No skin off my nose. It doesn't take away the fact that somebody else hates HK too. Actually, come to think of it, that imposter is doing me a favour. He's harassing HK when I am not free or cannot be bothered to do it myself. Gosh, you're right, we should be buddies!<br><br>**************************<br>Now we have finally unmasked how sincere HK is in her desire to offer her e-mail address. When a suitor gets serious, what does she do?<br>**************************<br>Like Spy previously stated, I had her email ages ago. And to think you thought I was serious???<br><br>Oh, so you weren't a suitor and you're not serious? So why did you say that you are intrigued by her and ask her to dum IO? Gasp, you attempted to be a third party.
