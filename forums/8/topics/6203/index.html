            <div class='col-md body'>Last time, i post in the forum that i like a girl very much.She hasnt been calling me for 5days already. before she called me everyday one.so yesterday, i called her and she seemed very happy. "kelvin, happy v.day" Then i told her to call me at 8.00pm.Then, i drove to her house with 11 roses(6white+5Blue) and a box of chocolate(her favourite).  AND then i wait at her void deck and intend to pass the roses to her.  By the time she called me, i can give her a surprise.  I reached there at 7.45Pm.  Who knows her line was engaged and her line was free at 9.30pm.  I called her and she said she's busy.  Then i Blaf her that i was now at her void deck and i wanted to pass a card to her. She said she called me later. Again, at 10.30 her line was engaged.  I called her at 11pm.finally her line was free but no one picked up. i called one minute later, the line was engaged.  At12am, i called again, her sister picked up and said she's not at home.But then she has no bf and i think her sister is lying.  I think i'm gonna to give her up even though i love her very much....Previously she said she liked me, one month later she said actually she got no feelings for me...Sadly, why am i the target of failing to get hitch.  Think i'm not going to fall in love again.  Again, i have sleepless night and i was thinking..i really like this girl very much and she knows...why is she playing so hard to get?  I'm not a bad guy after all.  God bless me!</div>
