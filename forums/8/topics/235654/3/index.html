Not that I ever want to be romantic to you anyway, because even if I were a faggort, I won't want you.<br><br>Similarly, you've never seen me, so ugly or handsome, you have no idea. Reminds me, you used to say you look like a Bollywood star or a caucasian. It was under one of your other many clones, but still you all the same, it was you.<br><br>My language skills are fine in case you don't notice. But I think it's just because I highlight the kind of jerk you are, hence you find me offensive. Tough luck for being such a jerk in the first place. You're also an utter disgrace of an Indian.<br><br>If you reallly are getting married, I pity the poor unfortunate girl.</div>

Ang Moh are great simply because they are good communicators. They associated well with strangers, chat with them and bringing some smile in otherwise another boring day in life. Because of this smile or pleasant interruption in life, we tend to feel good about them and thinks that they are great. Of course, this mindset have negatively influence us in thinking that they are great in every other field.</div>
