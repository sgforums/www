However, the tears and emotional outbursts that were expected never came, much to the relief of Singapore Discovery Centre general manager Jordan Woo.<br><br>Yesterday morning, he broke the news to 35 of his 80-strong staff that they had been retrenched. He deemed the move "inevitable" due to the centre's year-long closure for renovations, which began on Monday.<br><br>The centre is a not-for-profit organisation since its inception in November 1996.<br><br>Col (NS) Woo said: "We won't be collecting any revenue for quite some time and, since January, we had given strong indications during meetings with the staff that we would have to downsize certain jobs. I feel for them, because this affects a person's livelihood. But I'm pleasantly surprised that they took it in their stride in a mature and professional manner."<br><br>The move came just after the Ministry of Manpower announced that retrenchments in Singapore had eased in the third quarter of this year, marking a fifth consecutive quarterly decline amid an improving job market.<br><br>Most of those affected were front-line workers, such as maintenance engineers and ticketing staff from the operations and facilities-management departments.<br><br>Rumours of a major retrenchment exercise had been floating around since the start of the year, as the centre counted down the days to its $25-million overhaul. The exercise, said Col (NS) Woo, will save the centre around $1 million a year in salaries.<br><br>As part of its $500,000 severance package, those who have served three years or more were offered 0.75 month's pay for each year of service, in addition to a pro-rated annual wage supplement.<br><br>The 13 staff who had less than three years of service did not receive a payout but were offered the pro-rated AWS. All 35 were also entitled to exchange outstanding leave for cash.<br><br>In addition, the centre had arranged for the retrenched workers to attend a one-day course on resume-writing and interview skills. Col (NS) Woo also said the centre was working with the Association of Singapore Attractions to identify suitable jobs for those retrenched.<br><br>Facilities specialist Budiman bin Said, 30, one of those retrenched, said he knew it was "only a matter of when" before the announcement came. He said he had already lined up another job at a printing firm.<br><br>The centre's marketing communications director, Mr Charlie Tay, said there was a possibility that those retrenched would be welcomed back to the new centre when it reopens in December next year.<br><br>"It would depend on our needs and requirements. The new exhibits are going to be high-tech and interactive. So, we need people who are IT-savvy," he said.<br><br>After they gathered their belongings and said their goodbyes, staff walked out of the Upper Jurong Road attraction for the final time into a waiting taxi.<br><br>The centre had arranged for each of them to be given a complimentary ride to a destination of their choice.<br><br>Mdm Lilian Tan, 42, an operations host with the centre for eight years, was sad to leave her friends, but put on a brave front. She will start hunting for another job after taking a short break.<br><br>"I don't want to leave, but I have no choice. Colleagues and management have treated me very well here. And if the centre wants me next year, I'll be happy to come back."</div>
