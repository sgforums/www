            <div class='col-md body'>yeah man, like many of them said, there might be reasons behind it that we dunno... it could be that the guy is really a bastard, or that the mother had really done sometime damn wrong...<br><br>it's not correct to say that u shd never  raise ur voices or be rude to ur elders just because they are ur elders. people who have nice and caring parents will nv understand the pain and sufferings encountered by those who are ill-treated by their parents since young... will u still expect these people to be nice and filial to their parents? no way!<br><br>the thing is that it's not good to pass judgement to matters too quickly... we nv know if we are blaming the wrong party sometimes...</div>
