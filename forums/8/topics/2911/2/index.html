            <div class='col-md body'>I was thinking over the "relationship" that has so often been brought up.<br><br>I suppose God exists, ONLY if you believe he exists. The same goes for any other religion. This belief has to come from oneself and can never be forced upon. This relationship can be found if you WANT to find it. It is a personal quest that only the seeker can understand and appreciate at the journey's end.<br><br>I guess that is what Riona, juls and Fadingstar meant when they brought it up.<br><br>Thus, all religions, when stripped down to the basic core all point to the same thing - coming to terms with oneself and the world that one lives in. Everybody will reach the same destination, its just a matter of which path you choose to take.<br><br>So in this respect Science can never replace Religion, as Science defines how we see the world; Religion defines how we feel about the world.<br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wrong<br>if God is that so call powerful<br>then He doesnt need us to believe him @ all.<br>Eg. Remember the time when ppl believe that the world is flat?? and when they thought that they are @ the centre of the universe?<br><br>Even you and I, such weak creatures are able to survive just on food and not ppl's trust. Why is it that God has to survive on our beliefs??<br>I don't think that our faith and beliefs and his 'food'. Since he is God he doesn't even need food @ all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>I'm just speculating. No one can ever guess what the so call God is thinking. We are almost like God, becoz we are so unpredictable, our human race is very flexible, we can be GOD.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>yeahyeah SPECUALTION!<br><br>------------------<br>Death is Forever<br>I am Dead<br>therefore, i am Forever</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I find it hard to commit to a religion.<br><br>Jasonnex, you talked about the higher good and subjective good. How do we differientiate between the two?<br><br>And how do we know that the words in the bible are from god, not fallible men like ourselves? As I remember it, one of the saints (is it St. Paul?) hated women and advocated prejudice towards their treatment in the bible.<br><br>Is it also possible to believe in the religion when you don't agree with some of its teachings?<br><br>And do you really have to go to church to be a good follower of god? Isn't it enuff that you hold his sayings close to your heart and follow them?<br><br>These are just some of the issues I've been grappling with. Would appreciate any feedback. Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ForeVer:<br><br>Hmm...what I am trying to put forward is that God needs us as much as we need him. But first let me put forward the notion that I am using the word &lt;God&gt; to refer to a higher power, an entity whose actions are incomprehensible to us. Please note that it is not specific to any particular religion.<br><br>Humans by nature are very insecured beings who need assurances in life. In life, we find assurances in the form of our friends and family, people whom can support us through times of difficulties. But certain events are beyond us, and moral support can only bring us that far.<br><br>Have you ever been confounded by a situation that is way beyond your control? Where the only thing you can do is to wait helplessly and watch? It is times like this where the best thing you can do is just say a prayer and hope for the best. Even as a non-follower of any religion, I do find myself doing that when faced with such a situation. It is a form of assurance knowing that my prayer may be heard by a higher power and that I have done my part to alleviate the situation, even though in actual fact I have done nothing. The prayer may mean noting in practical sense, but it does make me feel a lot better.<br><br>Thus a follower of a religion would be able to find strength to tide over a crisis, as he/she will feel the &lt;God&gt; of their religion will look after them as they have devoted their faith to Him.<br><br>Perhaps you can say &lt;God&gt; is a manisfestation of our race to counter our inner insecurities. Thus whether He exists to us or not depends on how much we believe in Him. That's why you always hear people say that &lt;God&gt; is present within each individual. It is up to us whether we want to accept Him.<br><br>Just a thought about religion from a psychological point of view, hope nobody was offended by it.<br><br>P.S: Your mention of a race being &lt;God&gt; does open an interesting point for discussion.<br><br>bochup:<br><br>Thanks! Hope to read your views soon!<br><br>purr:<br><br>I understand what you mean.<br><br>But even as freethinkers, I believe that we do have our own sets of beliefs, else we would have joined one of the more mainstream ones already. But as long as our set of beliefs harms no one and does no evil, I do not see why we should not live with it. Its what we do while we are living that counts, since what happens after life cannot be proven.<br><br>But our perception of life will change and do not be surprised that you will accept what you once denounced. In the meantime just be tolorent of other's beliefs and keep an open mind. We are all searching and will find the answers someday!<br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br><br>[This message has been edited by Bravehart (edited 22-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>phew... another thread to screw my mind...<br><br>I'm quite lost about what I wan to say, will just write whatever that comes to my mind... will not be responsible for any wrong spelling okie! "England" not powderful mah...<br><br>Firstly, about Buddism... thru' my years(about 10 yrs already) of trying to understand this religion(or study as claimed by my christian frens), I felt that it is not important for people to burn joss sticks or the papers, etc. This are just some of the "gimmicks" to keep people closer to the religion, much like the idols of gods created for people to worship.<br><br>The idea about Buddism is to bring about peace of mind in human beings, and the idea of those chants are mainly to help any believers keep their minds away fm any evil thoughts or spirits...<br><br>Another step forward is what Forever says, that is to reach a stage in which you will be in paradise after life. But that I've discussed with my fren(the thoughtful one lah!) as to how they can achieve it?<br><br>Thru' the study of Buddist scripts and "chan", which is another field of life taught by Buddism. What we were thinking wa sthat maybe human by their own power may NOT be able to attain the god-ship that religious aspire to for all its followers, but maybe, the idea of "wu"(nothing) can bring our spirit to another level of nothing that we skip the cycle of reincarnation and remain in another dimension of the universe, or even jump out of the whole system and really become nothing, which means we will cease to exist in the universe altogether, while the rest of the human still hv to go thru' one after another of the cycle until they attain the nothingness, or when any destruction day come.<br><br>But nobody can really tell us where will we be come judgement day, and maybe the souls of most of the humans will just continue after the judgement day to become some new form of organism, or go thru' another dimension to become a new form of life altogether(and bring destruction to another planet??!!).   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Me not free again... goin for Christmas on Ice at Indoor Stadium. Continue later. At the moment, I'm reading a book on what people perceieve as an evil practice, Witchcraft. The lady author "Sybil Leek" claims to be a witch herself, and claims that Witchcraft is a religion and hv been misunderstood by the public, and misrepresented by many who claims to be the diciples of this practice. She claim that Witchcraft is more of White magic rather than the spiteful black magic where people use to curse people. Will be back with more...<br><br>maybe will post tonite or tomorrow... bye!<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming? Like asif I care.....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>everything i have to say has pretty much been said already in one of those long essays up there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>what i personally believe is, that there's a god out there, and that all the religions, are simply different routes to the same destination. which is to get to him. i believe that you don't have to pray, you dont have to go to church, you dont have to burn joss-sticks everyday... all you have to do, is believe. and he would know. all the above-mentioned actions, are simple little rituals, for people to feel closer to god, to feel a more solid sense of security in their belief. it's like, "i do this, that's why i believe in him." personally, i feel that god always knows. you can go to church every sunday, devote an hour a day to praying, volunteer at all your local charities, but if you do it with a 'holier than thou' attitude, if you do it simply to lord over others, or so your place in heaven would be guranteed, he would know.<br><br>but in the same way, some believe that simply being 'good' isn't enough, because you'll never be as good as Him. which is what i think nexxie means by the 'higher good' and 'subjective good'. no matter how disciplined you are, no matter how strong your will, you're bound to fall sometimes. and it's impt in times like this to have faith in Him.<br><br>well, i've pretty much been rambling on and on for quite a while now.. i hope someone can find some sense in what i said.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
