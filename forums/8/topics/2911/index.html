            <div class='col-md body'>This topic came about during a regular "talk cock" session with some friends. Perhaps we have been watchin too many shows like "End of Days" and "Stigmata", but somehow one event led to another... Just wondering what some of you out here might think about it.<br><br>Freethinkers, such as myself, often say, "I believe only in Science". Now, believing in something also has the implication of putting faith into it; in this case trusting explainations based on logic and resoning. For Science, we state a theory and attempt to prove it correct using quantified methods to explain and analyze.<br><br>Similarily, the basis of any religion is faith in its teachings. Unlike Science, the teachings of the Religion are not questioned; they are accepted. Refusal of acceptance is branded heretical and is seen to undermine the faith of the religion.<br><br>Thus, it is reasonable to say that Science can be an alternative to Religion, since both provide somthing for us to believe in.<br><br>Every Religion has its own version of the genesis of life; Science has a version also. Armaggadon is foretold in every religion; Science, by its nature does not foresee the future, yet it has given us the tools of destruction capable of bringing about the End. Religion is always in our hearts when we go about our daily lives; Science is everpresent wherever we go and whatever we do.<br><br>Religion once explained what Science was not advanced enough to do so; But with rapid advancement, Science is now starting to explain what Religion once did. The beginning of a reversal of roles perhaps?<br><br>Just thinking out loud....<br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa Heartilly here..haha! Using someone's com to reply cos I din bring my lab-top for my holidays...<br><br>As far as religion is concerned, it is never a none or all law.In the deepest innermost heart of each individual, there is a "God". It all depends who u want to have a relationship with, and who you really believed and have faith in it.<br><br>In terms of Science, religion has also has its influence and placings. Just as it is philosophical, it is something so mystifying. I am not sure about other religion much. But as a christian myself, Christianity is more than a religion, it is more of a relationship than just a religion. So in all the bits and pieces combining to gether it is like a jigsaw puzzle...You have to take patience to see the whole entire picture.<br><br>It is never easy to understand what a religion means cos different ppl got different perceptions and opinions. I respect others religion  like others wanna respect mine...<br><br>If you wanna se  proof...Jesus Christ did exist in the history...Then what do you think What A.D and B.C is all about? Maybe if someone knows more, please enlighten me...<br><br>------------------<br>!Don't Worry, Be Happy!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Religion and science are but different perspectives on a single plane. And reconciling scientific truths and biblical facts isn't impossible. The Bible presents the Truth in a metaphorical, often poetic manner. But through honest science we learn of that same Truth in a far more complex, defined and concrete way which ultimately leads many to understand how biblical text conceals universal secrets that we have only come to relate to with a sound scientific foundation.<br><br>Religion and science are gifts from God, both are intertwined and both are interdependent. Religion introduced God into Man's life aeons ago, but science manifests itself later as the key for mankind to understand what He does and how He works.<br><br>Nevertheless the majority of us are always believing in one and dismissing the other -- which is tragic 'cos true enlightenment only comes with an abundant knowledge from both arenas. Teachings from sacred religious worlds and secular scientific realms converge on the same plane of Truth and if we are so blind as to look only at a facet of it we will never be able to embrace it wholly.<br><br>It is only when we finally analyse, understand and RECONCILE the meaning of life and the worthiness of existence brought forth via Bible and test tube that we can really declare 'We know'. Until then we're all lost sheep led by equally lost shepherds.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In about AD 523, the papal chancellor, Bonifatius, asked a monk by the name of Dionysius Exiguus to devise a way to implement the rules from the Nicean council (the so-called ``Alexandrine Rules'') for general use.<br><br>How Dionysius established the year of Christ's birth is not known.  Jesus was born under the reign of king Herod the Great, who died in 750 AUC (THERE WAS ALREADY A WAY OF CALCULATING YEARS), which means that Jesus could have been born no later than that year. Dionysius' calculations were disputed at a very early stage.<br><br>According to the Gospel of Luke (3:1 &amp; 3:23) Jesus was ``about thirty years old'' shortly after ``the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar''. Tiberius became emperor in AD 14. If you combine these numbers you reach a birthyear for Jesus that is strikingly close to the beginning of our year reckoning. This may have been the basis for Dionysius' calculations.<br><br>Dionysius (wrongly) fixed Jesus' birth with respect to Diocletian's reign in such a manner that it falls on 25 December 753 AUC (ab urbe condita, i.e. since the founding of Rome), thus making the current era start with AD 1 on 1 January 754 AUC.<br><br>Dionysius based all his calculations on AUC and fixed the starting of the BC/AD on wat he BELIEVED to be the year when christ was born.<br>=============================================<br>*AUC (ab urbe condita, i.e. since the founding of Rome)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As a foreword, I'm not claiming that I know it all. I'm learning as much as anyone out there but juz thought I'll add in my two cents worth.<br><br>Personally science can only explain that much.  Do feel free to offer more information on why u think otherwise. I want to know. I mean it's like we know that seeds would produce trees and plants but where does the first seed or tree come from?? Hmm.. reminds me of "which is first - chicken or egg". There should be something or someone who created that, rite?<br><br>It would seem that religion in this thread is talking about Christianity. Why not Taoism or Buddhism, Islam or anything for that matter? Is it because of the views which many think of it as extreme?<br><br>Being a Christian is not juz Christian by name. If it was that easy, a lot of people I know would have a very much easier life to lead. To me, if u say that u're a Christian but yet u act like a jerk, that to me would already show that u're not really the Christian that u profess that u are. Being a Christian means that u have to lead a Christ-like life and that itself is difficult to do.<br><br>There are people that I know of who are Christians by name and basically it even seems that Christianity is a status symbol. It seems more "cool" to proclaim urself Christian than any religion (personal view.. dun be offended anyone!). But very often these are the very people who act in ways which sometimes are worst that a unbeliever. But it's unfair to judge the belief by the people that u have seen around u. Juz as there are "black sheeps" in Christianity, there are "black sheeps" too in others. Why is it that no comments or whatsoever has been made abt them?<br><br>What's the objective of going to places of worship? In comparison to the countless suffering and all, anything would seem mild in comparison but is it any course to dismiss their importance or value? And before I get caught up with myself, let's not go into discussion of why are there suffering in the world if God/Buddha/Allah (among others) is good. If I call myself a Christian (or any religion for that matter), go to places of worship, act very holy-moly, and then go spit or laugh at people who are dying, then I am a jerk. I'm pretty sure that there are pple who wld agree with me but I feel that having a divine presence in one's life would help u to empathise more with the people who are suffering. (prepared for disagreement   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br><br>Personally I dun believe that juz anyone who believe in a religion would go automatically to heaven. In this aspect, Rinoa has said it in that it is more than a religion we're talking abt. It's a relationship, as simple as that. There're verses in the Bible that seems to imply that people who thinks that "I'm a Christian but in actual fact I'm a jerk" would not necessarily go to heaven. But dun go around quoting me on this, as I've said, I'm still learning.<br><br>This is going to be my last comment. Feel like philosophy stuff. Anyway, giving thanks before food is not juz giving thanks. It's also blessing the people who have prepared the food, regardless directly or reaping the harvest.. anything. For me, it is precisely because I didn't "work" for it (as in manually?) that I thank Him for even giving me the food in the first place. And for the people who have worked so hard. If I dun eat juz because I didnt work for it, I wldnt be here rite now. I dun know if the analogy is correct though.<br><br>Horkay, I shall stop. But before that, remember these are juz my personal views. Dun get too worked up!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by juls (edited 21-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1)watz the use for believing in a religion when u're rite down rotten to the core?<br>claiming u're christian when u behave like a jerk, and all? I know many of these idiots and they dun seem to know what the hell they're doing.<br><br>This is what we call basal human hypocrisy. I don't believe all Christians go to heaven by virtue of their belief either. It takes more than just "I believe in Jesus Christ that he saves my soul and cleanses away my sins" to really be in the full picture, but mainstream churches want you to believe that as long as you proclaim Jesus' name, you automatically have a place in heaven. That sorta makes the entire process so simple and straightforward and unless you're as straight as a fundamentalist you shan't buy that =) Ultimately, what truly counts to us Christians is that we incorporate sincerely and wholeheartedly His teachings into our daily lives.<br><br>2)watz the OBJECTIVE of going to church or temples to worship and sing songs when there are millions who are dying out there and needy who are suffering?<br><br>I think I told you and others before... I find it amazingly strange too why to this day we're still conducting 90% of church sessions with hymns. People bounded by tradition still think God is some vain, narcissistic figurehead who needs people to carry his balls and that the more you carry the more He'll grant your prayers. Many Christians have come to realise that helping people in the fashion Mother Theresa is the true way of Jesus. So apart from the hymns and the rituals they've been doing lotsa social work, selling flags, raising money for the poor. A minute spent in voluntary, meaningful work for your fellow men beats a whole day pronouncing How Great Thou Art in church.<br><br>3)watz the use of being religious as long as u are good?<br><br>Your good isn't good enough  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> People tend to think that with proper discipline and all you can BE GOOD. But thing is, we're humans. We're fallible. God is all GOOD -- the basic assumption of any religion (else, how do you define good and bad, we have to base on something or someone that is GOOD before we can derive other degrees and magnitudes of goodness). So what makes you think we can be like God? So how good you should be is never clearly defined unless again you're comparing with some possibly flawed human yardstick. Therefore we need someone, someone higher and mightier than us to lead us into the real good, rather than the subjective good. Note that St. Peter was inclining towards the subjective good when he didn't want Jesus to die. (Matthew 16:22-23) But Jesus saw that this subjective goodness isn't for the real, divine goodness, which is that He has to die to save the world. And at that very moment he identified Satan who is speaking through Peter. So you see, subjective goodness based upon human charity and compassion can actually deviate from the real thing.<br><br>4)will one who does charitable deeds and not believe in any religion GO TO HELL???<br><br>"Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way as you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you." (Matthew 7:1-2) So you see, it is not for anyone to say who goes to hell. You may be a priest all your life but if God decides, on some reason, that you should go to hell, be it. It's not for us to say who goes to heaven, who goes to hell, who goes to purgatory, who remains on earth, who gets reincarnated and who gets destroyed. Such divine judicial thinking is not for Man to undertake.<br><br>5)will one who believes wholeheartedly in a religion go to heaven just leading church-going life?<br><br>Again, you should look at the entire picture. Don't get too blotted up by a few black sheep around you. Make religion a personal thing -- your one-to-one with your Maker in heaven, rather than a social affair that thrives on human competition and sometimes even sin.<br><br>6)What's the use of praying before a meal when if U did not work for it in the first place wouldn't be there?<br><br>It's like thanking God for His gentle ruth that you shall never go hungry because you love, trust and believe in Him. At the same time you also pray for those who are hungry around you. Don't question why you have food while your friends in sub-Saharan Africa are without. It's all part of a mystery similar as to why God allowed evil to exist that we have never quite known.<br><br>7)Should one just believe the bible just becoz IT is the bible? Why not believe in the Quran? Why not believe in Taoism? Why DO u believe the things u believe? What if there were 6 versions of the bible, how would u choose?<br><br>There are more than just 6 versions of the Bible. The universal thought is that religion makes us better people. You can have Biblical/Jewish doctrines, Quranic theories, Taoist/Buddhist dogma and Hindu teachings but the most important thing is to raise yourself to a higher level with religion.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">Why should there be a divide between Catholism and Christianity? The existence of different teachings? Why is one practice conducted with Bishops, popes and all and one without? It's not just about faith, its about how one interprets it.<br>Why should one have faith in something &amp; believe it existed?<br><br>The divide goes a long, long way back, when some Catholics begin protesting the Roman hierarchy which was in the Middle Ages corrupt and even diabolical. Thing is, unless you're really into theology and stuff, it's irrelevant now. Conflicts between people because of religion or even between sects is simply so tragic. It's misplaced faith and misconstrued reason to believe in one's religion so strongly you start imposing it on others, calling everyone who don't see eye-to-eye with you heretical. Religious wars are almost always borne out of intolerance and sad to say, even after 5,000 years of human civilisation and religious explosion, we still have that primal, exploitative nature in us to resolve differences through mindless violence and carnal bloodshed. It's time for humankind to bridge the gap between religion and self, to understand that an organisation doesn't make a religion, but you yourself and God.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm...did not expect to get so many response, I'm a little lost in the sea of words liaoz...<br><br>Perhaps the problem these days lie in the fact that some people in Singapore do take their religion a little too lightly. Christianity is fast gaining popularity here amongst youngsters and nowadays, some Church's services here seems more of a communal gathering session rather than a sacred religious ceremony. I accept the fact that religious institutes have to make adjustments in order to evolve with modern society. But sometimes I do wonder if too much of tradition is compromised at times, resulting in the significance of certain ceremonies being diluted.<br><br>Anyway, to Rinoa, Jasonnex and juls: I applaud you people for your faith in your chosen religion. May nothing cause your footsteps to falter from your path and I'm sure you people will be rewarded for your devotion to Christianity.<br><br>To people like Bangster, named and me: I think we can start preparing our souls for eternal existance in limbo, which I believe should be no paradise...<br><br>But back to the original topic. One reason I believe why people still hold religion in awe is the Afterlife. What happens to us when we leave this world?<br><br>If you think about it is not a really pleasant thought knowing that one will sleep for eternity. Religion does give solace for such worries - Buddhism offers Nirvana; Christianity offers Heaven etc etc. In this sense Religion does provide a satisfactory answer, something Science can never offer.<br><br>Perhaps, as Jasonnex and ngkaihoe pointed out, science and religion will work hand in hand to unlock the mysteries of our existance. But somehow I feel that certain things need not be, and are never meant to be known. That's why the search for an answer often leads to more questions. We can never get the answer, but the search for it defines us and this is reward enough for mortals like you and I.<br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br><br>[This message has been edited by Bravehart (edited 22-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>gee....a sudden flurry of replies to this one. wonder why. anyways, since it's easy to get lost in the maze of all these replies, i shall limit myself only to the original post and offer ONE (rather simplistic) perspective on the issue at hand. since i am no expert in the details of a particular faith, i shall leave all of that to the posts that appear above me. they seem to have thot abt these things more than i ever will. but i wonder how many ppl are actually reading these replies. ah well.....<br><br>let's start the way all good story books do.....once upon a time. once upon a time, ppl lived in a world different from the one we live in today. the world they lived in was one where science and religion and what have you were not separated. in fact, there prob wasn't the notion of science at all, at least not the way it is conceived today. ppl had a close r'ship with the earth they lived on and wondered about the heavens above. they postulated a spiritual realm and heavenly beings different from you and i. it was a world of harmony with the environment and a world where the human spirit was less divided and more at peace with itself. things were simpler back then.<br><br>now even in those days there were all these natural calamities (droughts, famine, and so on), and at some point ppl began equating these calamities with heavenly beings. "did i somehow anger the gods?", they may have asked themselves. and so rituals of atonement and sacrifice began in the hope of appeasing these insatiable gods (maybe gods of the earth, of the river or whatever, gods responsible for particular parts of nature). things went on like this for long periods of time, where ritual became an impt part of ensuring good harvests, successful births and a peaceful and prosperous existence.<br><br>slowly but surely, the notion of good and evil was born. gosh, why are we having such bad luck wif the crops this year? we must have done something "wrong". quick! what do we have to do (what do we have to do "right") to chase all this misfortune away? more sacrifices? more attention to rituals? what is impt abt this period of time, however, is not the myths or the beliefs or the legends. it is the way ppl SAW the world and reacted to it. it was a spiritual world, a mythical world, a magical world. there was no sobering effect of cold, calculative science.<br><br>i don't know how it happened, but apparently one of the first signs of a mono-theistic religion came from the philosophy of the persian prophet, zoroaster or zarathustra. there was still nature worship at this point in time, but the focus was on the worship of a single God. This god (which they called Ahura Mazda - yes, i know it sounds like a car) the zoroastrians credited wif creating the world and the lesser dieties.<br><br>the basic idea, however, is this: that there were many gods and goddesses but some were preferred to others. eventually the idea of a single, all-powerful God emerged and this mono-theism is the basis of the three major religions of the western world, viz, Judaism, Christianity and Islam.<br><br>but what functions did these religions serve? well just abt everything. it taught ppl how to think abt the world, what was "true" abt the world and how to act in the world. religion was, quite simply, the whole interpretation of the world.<br><br>my thesis (or rather my opinion of how things turned out) is this: that there is a direct correlation between what we "know" and how we "act". remember this now, cos it is the crucial point. human beings are often such that we will only "act" in a certain way if we "know" a certain thing.<br><br>and so you have the core (and the psychology) behind the major religions today. they offer you a story of how the world began, what it is like and how it will proceed (this corresponds to what we yearn to "know"). and then only if you buy (or more neutrally, believe) the cosmogony presented, will you then be prepared to "act" in a certain way.<br><br>the basic themes of religion follow thus: there is the original sin or suffering in the world. basically, all this sin and suffering is your fault. now if u carry on this way, there will be a certain ending for you. so if u don't want to end up that way, you better do this and act like that and think like this. so there we have the two crucial components - there is the story (what u need to "know" and believe) and then there is the "act" (which you better do if u want salvation. whether this means that religion is ultimately based on fear and self-interest and preservation, i leave that to you).<br><br>these two crucial components correspond to two major facets of human life - our search for "knowledge" and our modes of "conduct and behaviour". there is a third component served by religion - the "spiritual". this corresponds to our search for the meaning of life. it differs from the quest for knowledge in this impt respect - while knowledge seeks "clarification", the spiritual caters to our need for "edification". the "spiritual" is related to our complex of emotions and feelings.<br><br>okay, now i drag in science. under its own quest for the "truth", religion (in particular Judeo-Christianity) ironically planted the seeds of its own demise.<br><br>in the quest for the "truth", the methods of science were born. now science, and not religion, serves our need for "knowledge". but then what have we done? "God is dead", Nietzsche said, "and we have killed him".<br>how have we killed him? with disbelief. but why do we now not believe? because, i venture to conclude, we have taken away the source of that belief. we have replaced the religious story abt how the world is like and have placed our faith in science to tell us a new story. now the link between "action" and "knowledge" is broken. why should i "act" in a religious manner if the basis for that action (my "belief" in a religious world order) has been shaken and replaced by a scientific, rationalistic faith? from now on even right or wrong actions have been secularised. and, in the spirit of the Enlightenment, now even human actions are seen as being more appropriately ruled by "reason" (as compared to revelation), in the same way the world is revealed to us with the incisiveness of scientific logic and reason. this weakening of the basis of all human action, this attack on the religious bed-time story is responsible for the current sorry state of religion in the modern, scientific world.<br><br>unless u are quite a creative interpreter, the scientific, darwinian picture of the world cannot be reconciled with any traditional religious doctrine. there is still the possiblity of a God even with science around. but that God cannot be the same one as is told by the major religions of the world.<br><br>I am not saying that science is right and religion wrong. I am merely giving my view of why there is an obvious decline of religious sentiment in our time. Why knowledge and action are now secularised and humanised.<br><br>You only need to go thru the basic problems in the philosophy of science to realise the limits of science. Yes, I believe science is a faith like religion, but of quite a different kind. We have perhaps too much faith in what is measurable and quantifiable, and omit the value and importance of what is not discoverable by science. Why do we think that all there is in the world can only be discovered by our five senses and by human reasoning? Even scientific predictions rely on notions of inductive reasoning that cannot guarantee us the truth. The prime example is that, inductively, the sun has always risen every morning. But what makes us think it will rise again tomorrow? There is no absolute certainty that it will. We just have faith that it will because of past exp. Same problem for cases of causality. If this doesn't make sense to you, well it doesn't matter. You need a full course in the philosophy of science to appreciate the problems and the limitations of reason for discovering the "truth".<br><br>Even key notions and assumptions of science vary such that it no longer is the case that we "discover" reality but that we "create" it. For those interested, read Thomas Kuhn. He'll tell you how the history of science progresses according to revolutions in thinking. from the Newtonian science to the theory of relativity, how we see the world has depended on our basic assumptions abt that very world. It seems as tho if we change our assumptions, we can create a whole new reality. That's how we moved from a Newtonian concept of space and time as absolute to Einstein's view that it is flexible, malleable and changeable according to your frame of reference. so do not be deceived abt it. there are limits to human reasoning and science, just as there have been limitations placed on what religion can tell us.<br><br>To recap, there are three main areas that religion used to take care of - the realm of "knowledge and truth", the field of appropriate "human conduct and action" and the domain of "spirituality". The first two areas have been thoroughly humanised. but there is still the third (and we have forgotten abt this third domain). My  view is that our relentless pursuit of science and technology on the one hand and the capitalist mode of economic production on the other, have led to a spiritually impoverished state of affairs. Human beings aren't meant to live means-to-ends according to practical affairs only. We aren't meant to pursue riches and success at the expense of our spirituality. The human animal has lost its sense of the meaning of life. It stands in dire need of some form of edification and comfort. With the cold, calculative progression of science has come an emptiness and hollowness in our relation to the world, in our understanding of life. And I believe it is the place of religion (religion as the third domain - the domain of spirituality) to fill this void. As someone rightly pointed out, religion is abt a "relationship" to a self or being higher than us, bigger than us. It does not matter if reason cannot prove the existence of god. In fact the whole relationship of having to believe the "story" first before you act in a certain way should be challenged. Why should knowledge be primary? In matters of religion, the "relationship" is what is impt and primary (and sacred). I believe there is a place for religion even in the world of science. Because science cannot give to you the meaning and the purpose of life.<br><br></div>
