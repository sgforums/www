            <div class='col-md body'>MLM biz is good. but try not to fall for the hype about "best in this. ..", "best in that ...". 95% of MLM company don't last more than 10 years. so choose wisely.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is some info on Nature's Sunshine linked to the SynergyWorldwide.<br><br>==========<br><br>Nature's Sunshine Malaysia was operated under a franchise for quite a while now. The franchise has now been terminated and over 5,000 distributors of Nature's Sunshine Malaysia are now lost, no products, no company and are looking for a solid home to bring over their networks.<br><br>Nature's Sunshine is a very old company in the USA, actually the<br>beginnings of Enrich Int'l. Quite similar products to the old Enrich.<br><br>I feel really sad for those that have spent years building their networks and failed to check out the company fully, to see if the 4 Pillars were there to support them. Like what Eddy says - in NM, you don't fail, but the company fails you.<br><br>This is the second franchise to be terminated by the principals in USA. The first was Shaklee which happened late 1990s or early 2000s.<br><br>I hear that Nature's Sunshine has just opened up in Singapore.<br>Please advise your friends, to stick with the top 10 Global MLMs.<br><br>I am proud to be in the networking company I am in.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like ppl dun understand MLM. It's difficult to work in Singapore. Anybody who has been in the industry for more than 1 yr will know dat. Only winners are the bosses of the company. Many success stories but so many untold truths about these successes. I can be top achiever in any MLM company if I want. N I can also generate a big group of downlines. But at wat cost? If really wanna do business then do it the correct way. Want quick buck but at the expense of others, how to do business? Singapore so small everybody will know whos who. N when it comes to money who will have conscience when it's greed dat's the driving factor behind MLM? U think u really care about ppl who use the products or how much u make? Touch ur heart ppl. It works becos of greed. Materialism. N we become slaves to our own greed. So silly n sad. Would u do it if the product can really help ppl but u make peanuts out of it? Life is short but we should enjoy how we live it. Do not make a misery out of ppl who believe in us. How many times can we do it?<br><br>Wanna make money just have proper planning. Do not be manipulated by ur own greed. Find out the truth about ppl who make quick bucks. The percentage of failures n success. Of course they'll tell u about those who give up. But think deeper again. Then when u realise it one day.<br><br>I made money in MLM but i made more without MLM. I did learn a lot during the seminars but we need a little wisdom when it comes to deciding on wat we should do. Nvr let greed n temptation be ur driving factor. I made lotsa mistakes in MLM but I did make money. But it wasn't worth it.<br><br>Try it if u want but look ard. How many successful businessmen in Singapore are from MLM? N how long can u sustain this business?</div>
