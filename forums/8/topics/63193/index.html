            <div class='col-md body'>I can't believe it... I just return from work and the thread is close...<br><blockquote><br><br>let me ask u smth.. look at your table. its made of wood yes? its got interesting useful design yes?<br><br>yet how can u compare that table with a tree? a living breathing thing, which respond to its surrounding, able to replace dead branches, and leaves produce air and so much more wonderful things than the table<br><br>if you believe that that table is made by someone, you obviously haven't seen in your life. is it so hard to believe, that the tree, which was made much more uniquely and is so much complicated, has also a designer? </blockquote>OKie, why do u believe tat everything need a specific designer ? Can't tree just happened naturally, due to years of evolution and councidences in time ? Then let me pose tis question. U see a tree, it has nice leaves and if there ever was a designer, he must be more special than mere trees. Then who is the designer of the designer of trees ? In other words if everything need a designer, then God must have a designer in turn tat design him too isn't it ? Then one may ask again who is the designer of the designer of the designer ? This kind of argument has no end. However one can be sure tat the answer will trace back to mere coincidence. It is not done by any exquisite design by anyone, it just happned naturally.<br><br>Then there is another wrong with your argument again. Suppose there is a designer for Trees and Human, how do u know tat the designer take in the form of your God ? There is a chinese folk story about Nu Wa, who form human through clay and she breath in life thus made human. Why can't the designer take tat form ? As I have said before, someone with just faith alone cannot distinguish wat is right and wrong. There are a group of people who believe in the story of Nu Wa more than God in creating human. Certainly u can't prove them wrong either.<br><br><blockquote><br>basically, how much do you know about this world? 20%? 50%? let me give u, say u smart enuff. u know 70% of this world. what if. God is in the remaining 30%? </blockquote>As said, wat if the rest of the 30% is something else. True, science cannot explan everything now. But does tat means we give up and just devote our time to religion ? It just means tat we have to keep improving on science, keep improving on our knowledge of the world. We shouldn't just give up and look for a convenient answer<br><br>I cut off the paragraph from a website for your readings<br><br><blockquote>As we learn more and more about the nature of the universe, we discover conflicts with what has traditionally been taught by religion. For example, some people still believe that the Earth is less than 10,000 years old, in spite of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, because of their interpretation of the Bible. If strong scientific evidence surfaces which is contrary to the prevailing religious view, open-minded believers will adapt their beliefs accordingly, but many fundamentalists refuse to accept scientific evidence. This is the cause of conflict between science and religion.<br><br>The area of science that seems to cause the most discomfort for fundamentalists is evolution. The simple fact of the matter, however, is that evolution, including speciation or macro-evolution, has been directly observed.<br><br>Physics describes the universe in terms of relatively simple concepts (general relativity, quantum field theory, etc. As we learn more and more physics, the structure of the universe, in some sense, seems more and more simple. But theists postulate that an infinitely complex god is necessary to explain the universe. (The conscious human mind is the most complex thing that we know about. Since God is suppose to be omniscient, he must be infinitely more complex than the human mind.) The theists' position just does not make any sense. It replaces the question "How did our simple universe get here?" with the much more difficult question "How did an infinitely complex god get here?". The principle of Ockham's Razor (more parsimonious or simpler explanations are more likely to be correct than complex explanations) cuts God out of the picture. Einstein once said that "the more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature." In other words, the more a person understands about the workings of the universe, the more he or she is aware of nature's simplicity, and the less likely he or she is to believe in gods. That's why 93% of the members of the National Academy of Sciences (USA) are nontheists. (The 93% figure comes from Edward J. Larson and Larry Witham: "Leading Scientists Still Reject God." Nature, 1998; 394, 313.)<br><br>Although a majority of scientists don't believe in God, they are usually the first to admit that we do not know everything and that there will always be unknowns in science. Many theists see these gaps in our knowledge as reasons for believing in God. The argument usually boils down to this: "We don't understand something, therefore God must have done it." Today's version of the argument is often "We don't understand how the universe got here, therefore God must have created it"; years ago it was "We don't understand thunder, therefore the thunder god must have done it." But is saying "God did it" really an explanation? No, it isn't. An explanation is a description of something we don't currently understand in terms that we do understand. Theists will usually admit that they don't understand their god, saying things like "God works in mysterious ways". Well if we don't understand how God does something, then "God did it" is just about meaningless. We will never have all the answers, but postulating an infinite god and pretending that this provides the answers is just irrational. It is much better to have the intellectual integrity to simply admit that we don't yet know.<br><br>A fairly common example of the god of the gaps fallacy described above is the argument that since we don't understand where the dimensionless constants in the equations of physics come from, and since carbon based life could not have evolved if some of the parameters varied by a small amount, a god must have chosen the parameters to produce human life. In addition to being an example of the god of the gaps fallacy, this argument is wrong for several other reasons. For example, it assumes that the dimensionless parameters are fundamentally arbitrary. In other words, it assumes that the parameters cannot be predicted with a more fundamental theory. But in string theory, for example, all dimensionless parameters are expected to be predictable.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>do you actually believe the earth is million of years old, when there are scientific findings that contractict this statement?<br><br>scientific findings that coincidentally aligns with the bible's timing? for example, the great flood of noah we all heard about?<br><br>fossils and stuff, all supports the great flood theory. instead of the die, and million years of dust crush it to make a fossil.<br><br>there are still enough water in the form of ice, and other states, to completely flood the earth one more time<br><br>and korean vessel researches have detertmined that the ark of noah based on the bible's description of design, it is possible for it to float and withstand against strong currents and tidal waves and house living things. </blockquote>I give doubts to the Korea studies tat Noah Ark according to the bible can house it. Here are some of my doubts<br><br><blockquote><br>And of <strong>every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee,</strong> to keep them alive.</blockquote>U know how much different kind of animals, insects, fowls, beast are there in the world ?? As described, all species of animal will come in a pair. Let me ask u, do u know how many different species of dogs r there in the world ? There r over 100++ different dog species in the world ! There is the boxer, the chihuahua, the dingoes, the terrier, the bulldogs etc etc. How many different species of Elephants r there in the world ? There is African elephants, the India elephants, the Asia elephants etc etc. U think tat the ark, built on such dimensions can hold so many animals ? Frankly I totally don't believe the Korean studies and I want to see their exact research on such matters.<br><br><blockquote>And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. </blockquote>Tis problem is made worse by the fact that they have to prepare their food too. How long do the flood last ? Hours ? Days ? NO ! It LASTS FOR WEEKS ! (40 days to be exact) Wat is the weather then ? IT WAS RAINING like there is no tomorrow, a near PERFECT storm, one tat human never laid their eyes on from tat time till now. The deck will be flooded by water then,  the ship being tossed like toys. With such a heavy weight, can the ark survive ?<br><br>Secondly, the technology of ship building tat time is very poor. They don't even know the physics of buoyancy then. The ark is not made of steel with strong weld but made of gopher wood and nails. Can people at tat time capable of making such a big ship out to hold the animals ? U know wat is the scale of the job ?<br><br>Wat is the statement tat tells the earth is not millions of years old ? Show it to me, I really wanna take a look at it.<br><br>Talking about fossils, why u do not believe they exists ? U know why does scientist say the fossils r millions of years old ? They r using the carbon 14 datign method, and it was believed to be accurate. I believe your infomation will hit on the assumptions tat the level of carbon 14 in Earth may not be constant. However the key word is "may not" and it is now still highly believed tat the level of radiation from carbon 14 is nearly constant at <strong>any time </strong>on earth. And dating of fossils can be done using other isotopes like Uranium -235 (half-life = 704 million years), Uranium -238 (half-life = 4.5 billion years), Thorium-232 (half-life = 14 billion years) and Rubidium-87 (half-life = 49 billion years). Thus if u r not convinced tat carbon 14 is an accurate method, then u may want to try Potassium 40 (half life 1.3 billion years) instead.<br><br><blockquote>and what? years ago, people believed the world was flat? when its already documented that the earth is round. </blockquote>U know why does people say earth is flat and not round ? U know why does people say tat it is the earth tat revolves around the sun before ? They r not science. They r said by someone called Aristotle. He believe tat if u can explains why thing behave in a certain way, without offering proof, then it is correct. It is due to him tat science has stop progressing for many years. Know anyone called Galileo Galilee ? He is the first person who has proven tat the Earth rotates about the sun. Wat happened to him ? Due to religion, he was placed under house arrest for the rest of his life. Why ? Because the sacred Scripture tells us that Joshua commanded the sun to stand still, and not the earth. U wanna know more about Flat earth ? Read tis websites<br><br>http://www.id.ucsb.edu/fscf/library/RUSSELL/FlatEarth.html<br><br>Of course there r some interesting points from tat website as well<br><br></div>

Since it was Aristotle, like you mentioned, who said that, so the Scripture is innocent.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Science stopped progressing, but when exactly did science start? In my view, Aristotle gave us more useful things [in other areas like philosophy and logic] than shit. The scientific methodology and empiricism doesn't arrive until Francis Bacon and people like John Locke. The thing we call science came into existence around the Scientific Revolution in Europe.<br><br><blockquote>Know anyone called Galileo Galilee ?

No-one shall stand between us.<br><br><blockquote>Because the sacred Scripture tells us that Joshua commanded the sun to stand still, and not the earth.</blockquote>I think if Joshua wrote "Earth stand still", ancient readers would have scratched their heads.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> To them, Earth was never a planet in our modern sense of the word.<br><br>I agree with you the Catholic Church commited a big mistake then. But I think that should not be a factor in evaluating Scriptural truth, and by extension the truth of the religion itself.<br><br>Sun standing still or earth standing still, it's a fact that we still use the geocentric perspective when describing celestial objects. We still say sunrise sunset don't we?</div>
