First, if u traced back history through the family trees written in bible, u will realise tat the time between now and then is no more greater than 10,000 years. 10,000 years is a very short period of time for evolution tat extensive. Thus there r still many species of living things on earth then. Noah's Ark still cannot hold such a great number of animals. Note tat they have to prepare their food and dispose of their waste.<br><br>I believe tat a cell eventually evolved into a mudskipper which eventually may evolved into a cow. However the evolution was not immediate. The mudskipper <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> first evolved into a aligator, then evolved into lizard then evolve into dog then evolve into cows. Tat is all lives come from a cell which gradually evolved into the many species of living things on this earth<br><br>Now I got a question to ask ? Do u believe tat human was evolved from some other living things ? Or do u believe tat one moment there is no such living thing called Human and the very next moment human appears from don't-know-where<br><br>Another interesting question I have read about adam and eve. They weren't ashamed of being naked before they ate the fruit of wisdom. They doesn't knwo wat is good or evil then. After they ate the fruit, they became very conscience of their nakedness and try to hide it. Question, why does God want them to be naked in the first place since it is inherently bad to be naked ? After eating the fruit then they realised it is bad to be naked then they cloth themselves up.<br><br>Lets say it is over the hills of Mount Everest. The volume of water needed will be incredible. The polars ice caps, even if it all melted will not even be enough at all. The approximate calculation for the volume of water is 4500 MILLIONs of cubic kilometres of water. And it is suppose to fall within 40 days, thus it is 220 metres of rainfall every day over entire planet. On heavy rainfall, a few cm is considered a lot.<br><br>There r more amazing facts about the impossibilities of Noah ark in ta page. Please please read them if u r interested.

Bible did state something like, one day in heaven is hundreds of years of human times.  Personally, I am more incline to believe that the "seven" days of creation is probably millions of years on earth. At least, the account of creation follows a practical series of events happening: night and day, land and sea, flora and fauna, animals and finally humanoids. Bear in mind that the Bible was written many years ago where such scientific knowledge may not be accessible.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Not sure if it is all that possible to evolve a mudskipper to a cow 'cos it would involve an intricate amount of adaptation beyond what one's eye can see. It would be an entire overhaul of the living being's anatomical system for that to happen. A mudskipper, inherently will still be using it's gills to breath as oppose to a nose as in a mammal.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> No where in the Bible did it state that Adam and Eve looked like Mr and Miss Universe. It is entirely possible that Adam looked exactly like the Peking Man.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Nudity itself means nothing to anyone without the knowledge of good and evil. The Garden of Eden was a place that was void of this knowledge. In a sense, it was an Utopia where a lion can be foraging with a lamb, ie, everyone gets along with everyone.... Having eaten the fruit from the tree of knowledge, emotions may have entered and perhaps may have resulted to lust which makes nudity "bad". Just my personal theory.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Not sure if the flood even reached the top of Mt Everest. Would have frozen the entire troop of travellers in the Ark. That would have made the Ark as the first refrigerated vehicle in history. Flood may have just wiped out most of all habitable land on earth.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> Cannot answer whether humans just pop-up on earth or did we come from a single cell organism over millions of years. Would also not want to comment on information gleaned from websites that are inherently atheistic. Which ever way one's opinion swings, to accept that a chance event resulted in the diversity of living beings we see on earth is at best, extremely ludicrious.<br>Someone once stated something like: if you give 100 monkeys 100 typewriters, eventually one will write up a Shakespeare.... I really, really want to see this.......<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Whether one believes in the Christian God or not, at least one can adopt the spirit of Abraham when he looks at the stars and wonder about the Creator.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> One interesting opinion about creation is that: among all the millions of planets in the known universe, it is probable that one planet by chance had a chain of events that led to creation. Would we say then that among all the suitcases in the world, it is alright that one of them may just contain a dead body?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> As with any issue in troubleshooting, repeatability of a test is critical, ie, it may be possible for one specie to evolve to another over a period of time, but to have this being repeated with the diversity that resulted to what we have in the world demands an explanation beyond chance. In the thoery of evolution, the least it was able to prove was that life is not random, there is a sequence and there is a plan by someone or something.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since probabilty is mentioned, lets talk about probability<br><br>For creation, one must take note of something... We got an almost infinity time, from infinity sites, from infinity reactions tat can have started life and etc. How much time is it from past till now ? Few billions billions billions year perhaps. How many atom site r there for posible reaction per second ? Few billions billions billions atoms colliding with their neighbouring atoms per second. How many reaction r there per second ? Probably another few billion billion billion to the power of billions reactions per second for these few billion billion billon of years. (Sorry for all the billions used  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) Hence I believe tat although the chances is very low, there r so many reactions per second tat one will result in wat we see today.<br><br>Lets say your monkey example. Suppose there were a few billions monkeys. And these few billions monkeys just type in random on the keyboard. Lets say they type billion keys per second and they do tis for another few billions years. Do u think some where in some passage written by these monkeys will be a full bible written out by them without any spelling errors ? Although the chances is very close to zero, the number of chances taken is actually infinity too. U get wat I am trying to say ?<br><br><blockquote>Not sure if it is all that possible to evolve a mudskipper to a cow 'cos it would involve an intricate amount of adaptation beyond what one's eye can see.

U probably believe tat God created some few hundred of species initially which evolved into the few hundred millions of species now.<br><br>However I got to ask, why can't a mudskipper evolved into a cow ? Although there r many overhaul of their bio system to achieve tis. Note, the starting of life till now is probably 3500 millions years. How much is human history ? Lets put it at most 10,000 years. Tat period of time is already hundreds of thousands times more than recorded history by human. Tat long period of time will result in drastic evolution of living things.<br><br>And period where Noah's flood occurs can be found not by using heaven time but by earth time. Bible linked historic building of cities and people in it, and these accounts aren't greater than 10,000 years again. Accounts like Nimrod can be traced to historic times. Refer to tis website<br><br>http://www.cwd.co.uk/babel/nimrod.htm<br><br>Thus the city stated in Bible is mere 5000 years ago. Say each of the son stated lived for 1000 years (Tis is consider a lot comapred to human lives and lives in Bible like Noah etc)  Noah -&gt; Ham -&gt; Cush-&gt; Nimrod. Thus we place tat it started off in 10,000 years. 10,000 years is again, little for evolution<br><br><blockquote>Nudity itself means nothing to anyone without the knowledge of good and evil.

Then doesn't tat means they already know wat is good and evil then ? And I got to ask why does God punish the whole population just for 2 gardeners ? Woman is already present before birth of Adam, why does God still wanna take a rib out from his body to make eve ? And adam and eve and its decendents knew about wat is good and evil, the rest of human does not, so why does God still wanna flood the land and killed the ignorant ? Why does God feel tat we should be punished beause we knew wat is good or evil ? If we do not know, we will be commiting evil acts like killing each other isn't it ? Is tat good ?<br><br>I didn't make up the height of the water level... I took it out from bible again. It is under genesis 7.19.

I think he was featured in the excellently filmed documentary on our human ancestary in discovery or NGC. Try arguing with him not me. It is from a scientific point of view not religious and my mention of long enough is not based on your 3, 4 years it can be 10 000 years.<br><br>As for the curse upon other living things I can't find the verse supporting this statement. Please enlighten me which verse is it? The only creature which was cursed is only the snake. Genesis 9:2-3 where fear of human was only mentioned not curse. Not sure which translation you used? I really don't remember any other place about curse was mentioned for the creatures of the earth except humans.<br><br>If there was such a verse then I'd think that because creatures of the earth came under the domination of man. Therefore, when the top gets it, the bottom gets it as well. There has been many school of thoughts where demons came from too. One of which I believe the earth went thru' 2 floods. First flood occured in Genesis 1:1-2 where Lucifer fell with the rest of his host and the inhabitants(bible didn't quite mention who they were) of the earth perish under the flood who became without physical form. These were all taken charge of by Satan.<br><br>Though I seem to be defending the bible, you'll be surprise about my thoughts of the old testament.

I guess like most of the forumites (this the correct term??) here, I too have questions. There are many parts of the Bible that do present themselves in a very difficult light. I have also heard many preachers attempting to explain or justify their beliefs. There are websites that are in direct conflict with the atheist links that had been quoted. Such websites explain from the Biblical standpoint the apparent conflicts in the Bible.

There will always be the clash of egos in the guise of divine revelation. But I prod on, because of my faith in a God.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>For the reply on the climate changes the skin tone of a person is from a scientist who did the recent study on DNA(can't remember his name). I think he was featured in the excellently filmed documentary on our human ancestary in discovery or NGC. Try arguing with him not me. It is from a scientific point of view not religious and my mention of long enough is not based on your 3, 4 years it can be 10 000 years. </blockquote>Hmm...I don't know man... if it is 10,000 I guess he meant by evolve bah... Man will evolve to suit the environment it is exposed to.<br><br><blockquote>As for the curse upon other living things I can't find the verse supporting this statement. Please enlighten me which verse is it? The only creature which was cursed is only the snake. Genesis 9:2-3 where fear of human was only mentioned not curse. Not sure which translation you used? I really don't remember any other place about curse was mentioned for the creatures of the earth except humans. </blockquote>Okie, before Adam and eve folly, pregnancy is suppose to be a breeze. Man do not have to labor or work and neither will he die. I believe tat to be the case for all animals too. After Adam and Eve, not all Man, eat the fruit, they suffer the above consequences. Presently, doesn't all living things face problems such as labor, death and pain in pregnancy too ? I guess they r being again punish for sins committed by other people... And if the top-down approach is true, it doesn't seems fair to me. It is like if 2 people did something wrong, all human in the whole world + animals + birds + living things had to suffer for it. It is like if 1 singaporean commit murder and all singaporean had to face the death penalty with him. It doesn't seems fair.<br><br>Aiii... if u talk about faith, I can only say it once again it doesn't seems to be logical. In fact most religious argument will eventually lead to the believers using faith as a shield against logics. I believe I had written something about it before but I will just put down the website about faith here again.<br><br>http://freethought.freeservers.com/reason/faith.html<br><br>Since God have given us a mind to think, why don't we use it to reason than just believe faithfully ?<br><br><blockquote><br>This commonality with other moral codes can be explained as God putting the laws in our heart</blockquote>Actually if u ask me, these r basic laws for a harmonious society. Thus people just get aware of them without any divine intervention.<br><br>Secondly, if God did put those laws into our hearts, I can surely say he doesn't practise wat he preach.<br><br><blockquote>SIX: 'You shall not murder.' </blockquote>If u talk about murder, no one in recorded history has done a more brillant job than God itself. The combined death committed by Hitler, Saddam and other mass killers is a pale comparison of the number of people killed by God. Though tis may seems harsh, but it is just wat the bible described.<br><br>First, he started the idea of death because Adam disobey him (I mean if your 3 year old toddler disobey u, will u punish him severely ?)<br>Second he killed off nearly all the animals and human during the flood<br>Third he killed off the dinosaurs and don't told anyone why<br>Fourth he killed off all the first born of all egytians in moses story<br><br>In fact if u read on, u will find tat he not just commit mass murder, he loves to discriminate people and punish in a group, not just the guilty ones. Tat is even if u did nothing, he still will punish u because of the act committed by others.<br><br>U know about Job ? He is faithful and loyal to God, yet he still can distrust him and killed off all his family members. (I know about the ending, I am not talking about just him, I am talking about his initial family members) How will u feel if u r the dead family members ? I mean u commit nothing and u still die just to satisfy his curiosity.<br><br>I don't know... those who had read the bible will know tat he will not hesistate to give the harshest of punishment to people. I prefer the non violence ways of Ghandhi than one tat rule with iron fists and gave grave punishment.</div>
