            <div class='col-md body'>Why wanna stop tis thread ?<br><br>I think a lot of people out there still do not believe in evolution.  I will be just writing more stuff about evolution here...<br><br>Basically evolution has started off many rounds of debate and spuns off many unbelievers to evolution, even though there is over whelming facts tat it is true. The school of biology and animal studies had already been teaching such theories in textbook. The reason is simple. They do not believe tat Man came from apes. In christian context, Man were suppose to be created by God. And most of them will just give a simple argument tat "Why will u believe u came from a monkey"<br><br>Well, it is something we have no choice, like the parents we r born from. Why r u born from your present parents ? It is wise to talk about truth than talk about choices when we want to talk about history.<br><br>First thing first, we have found tons of fossils of ancient Man. Meaning they look like a hybrid between Man and ape. And from scientific test they are revealed to be many hundreds of thousands of years old. This ape men appears to have already use basic equipment, like stone axe and have already used their hands and fingers other than walking. Frankly, no animals have been observed to have these qualities other than the human being. I believe u all had heard such "ape men" being uncovered time to time isn't it ? Isn't tat the strongest evidence tat evolution exists, and tat human undergoes evolution too ?<br><br>Second thing to prove evolution exists. Tat is mating between animals and human. It goes by the rule the survival of the fittest. One must have heard stories of animals being attracted to their mates by special characteristics such as winning a fight (ex stag. One with better strength and endurance get to mate) colours and appearence on them (ex peacocks. Better colours means better gene) and speed race (certain species of bird. The more agile and faster birds get to mate). For human it isn't any different too. People tend to choose their partners tat look better.<br><br>Why do living beings have such behavior ? Survival of the fittest ! The stronger or one tat is a better "survivor" get to mate, thus reproduce thus genes get carried down time. Tat is the beauty of life, all species of living things get to improve with time. It is not static, tat a tiger can only get as strong as tis or as fast as tis. And a tiger may not have started like tis too. Its humble beginning may have started off being as small as a kitten<br><br>Thridly, how do u answer the fact tat island countries, like Australia and Madagascar have many species of animals tat couldn't be found throughout the world. Take note tat there is a strong scientific belief tat the continents formed one huge plate when earth is formed aka The Continental Drift Theory. Meaning, long long ago, the world is all joined togther. Thus the animals r free to move around the planets then. However the earth breaks into pieces and drifts into the locations now. Thus why does the animals on these islands now became so vastly different from those of mainland ? They all started out the same, but due to evolution, they have changed into the forms they r now.<br><br>Lastly... I think it is more likely tat life started off from a single species that evolved into so many living things wat we r seeing today. If u don't believe in evolution theory, tat probably means u believe the day before there r no living things, the very next day suddenly all these few million species of living things suddenly appears. Note the change must be very fast since there animals tat eat only meat and they can't go hungry right ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A question for those who believes in bible and not in evolution theory...<br><br>According to bible, Man started off from a single couple, Adam and Eve.<br><br>Now, in present times, there are many races of Man around isn't it ? There is the caucasion, the orientals, the negroes etc. And it is true tat only caucasion mate with caucasion can reproduce a caucasion. There r no other "mixing" of races tat can produce such a pure caucasion.<br><br>So how does a single couple produce the different races of Man now ? If there is no such things as evolution, then how can it happened ?</div>

The only logical reason I can think of is incest. They practise incest back in the olden days. About the different races you mention, ever heard of the Bible story about building the Tower of Baal? Well human try to reach the sky and get punished with different languages and I guess different color skin too.<br><br>There are a lot more questions but I have yet to get answer. Too tired to repost again. To be in that religion, blind faith is required. Their logic is accept their big F first and then the answers will come to you in the most surprising way.

            <div class='col-md body'>Damn me but i find u guys damn interesting.<br><br>Firstly, lemme explain for the Christians why Men would be separated by language and race.<br><br>Nim'rod, great grandson of Noah, a murderer of cattles and men, told the people to build a city and a tower to scale the heaven for glory , but not for God. And thus, God made them speak different languages so they eventually argued and stop the construction.

Stop making Non-christians look like fools.<br><br>Here I speak again as a freethinker, for the non-christians, Those who were one, were made divided by God's will and the word of God will be lost in wisdom of men alone. Which Bible holds the truth in which you men had believed? Did you read the jewish bibles or the muslim qurans before you judged whom they worshipped as devils? Have you touched and understood why people stand on different beliefs before you approached and strongly repute their thoughts? How many times must I hear from you to judge someone, and curse them for not believing you and your religion to the depths of hell. Aren't we the brothers and sisters in which the bible say? Then why do you speak in a tone that fouled men so much as to bring despise from the non-believers?

It gives me the impression of a big monopoly company swallowing up the new rival companies. Why wanna create chaos and disorderly among human ?<br><br>Yes human race is very powerful. We were made in the image of God (spiritual image). Our ability as a united people can give us power above beyond the demonic forces. Satan was not even created in His image. Their desire to reach heaven was not just a height factor but a spiritual factor. In fact the building they erected could not even touch the sky. They wanted to reach the heavenly to overthrow God as satan did. Lots of innocent children and adults were sacrificed to attain these spiritual heights. I believe the separation were more redemptive purpose rather than fear on God's part. Imagine if we were of one heart in our present time, we'd have  destroyed the Earth with all the nuclear energy. So...maybe division and friction among countries may be a blessing in disguised.<br><br>When you study the bible, we must look at the historical settings.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, not sure what's the argument about, but sorta catch a bit here and there..<br>Religion is something very personal, and everyone has different perspectives towards it. Though we may disagree with one another's religions, we've to respect others' wishes and not criticize or voicing unpleasant remarks about it. And one should not preach about religion to others, especially if they're of different religion from yours.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>It is also a well known fact that skin colours changes with the climate we live in and stay long enough. </blockquote>Tat is a wrong concept... Tanning it to be darker doesn't mean their skin colours had change. If u ask a negro and a caucasion to live in singapore all their lives, their skin colours will still remain very mch the same as before. The Indian in singapore, who had their ancestors tat came over from india to singapore many years ago had decendents very close to their counterparts in India. Likewise for chinese and malays.<br><br>And the difference between races is not just about skin colours, there r other differences as well like colour of hair, eyes, size, shape etc.<br><br>And again I have to say why Human is split into different categories. A "pure" caucasion can only be reproducd by a "pure" caucasion couple. Same as to other races. There is no other combination tat can produce caucasion. This is a test for determining whether is tis species a pure breed or not.</div>

No need to go to war about it.....<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">I am probably one of the few Christians who accept the evolution concept. While living things change (evolve) through adaptation of living environment and conditions, living things do not EVOLVED by jumping species, ie, a fish will not become cow. Eg, while a mudskipper is able to breath outside water, it can only do so for a short period of time and it remains to be a fish. However within an animal group, eg canines, there may be newer breeds coming out or evolving because of its environment.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">The issue with Noah's ark is that do not envisioned all existing animals in that floatation device. See the individual's ultimate grandparents eg grandparents of all cats, or grandparents of all dogs. The entire concept of fitting animals in the ark becomes possible.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">The thoery of human races stems from the offspring of Noah: Ham, Shem and Japheth who were the great grandparents of the three major races: Caucasians (white men), Mongoloids (yellow skins - Chinese, Red Indians etc) and Negroids (black men).<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">Don't believe that Adam and Eve were the ONLY living beings on earth. They were special only because they were created in the spiritual image of God. As Cain was banished from Eden and left to be a wanderer, he met up with the other humans living on other parts of the earth and procreated.<br><br>Good thread, keep it up, but politely please..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okie, at least someone believe in evolution, and used it to explain the possibility of different races on earth and the possibility of Noah's Ark not sinking.<br><br>However there is something worth taking note here. First, if u traced back history through the family trees written in bible, u will realise tat the time between now and then is no more greater than 10,000 years. 10,000 years is a very short period of time for evolution tat extensive. Thus there r still many species of living things on earth then. Noah's Ark still cannot hold such a great number of animals. Note tat they have to prepare their food and dispose of their waste.<br><br>I believe tat a cell eventually evolved into a mudskipper which eventually may evolved into a cow. However the evolution was not immediate. The mudskipper <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> first evolved into a aligator, then evolved into lizard then evolve into dog then evolve into cows. Tat is all lives come from a cell which gradually evolved into the many species of living things on this earth<br><br>Now I got a question to ask ? Do u believe tat human was evolved from some other living things ? Or do u believe tat one moment there is no such living thing called Human and the very next moment human appears from don't-know-where<br><br>Another interesting question I have read about adam and eve. They weren't ashamed of being naked before they ate the fruit of wisdom. They doesn't knwo wat is good or evil then. After they ate the fruit, they became very conscience of their nakedness and try to hide it. Question, why does God want them to be naked in the first place since it is inherently bad to be naked ? After eating the fruit then they realised it is bad to be naked then they cloth themselves up.<br><br><blockquote>26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.<br><br>27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.<br><br>28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</blockquote>Secondly, Men have been created before Adam and Eve according to genesis 1, done on the sixth day. Thus before Adam and eve there already r humans and women. So why does God punish the whole population of Man for which only 2 people r guilty only ? And why does Adam eating the Fruit of Good and evil means the other people on earth also realise the difference between good and evil ? However They didn't eat the fruit and they aren't reproduced by them isn't it ?<br><br>About Noah's, please read tis website for many facinating facts.<br><br>http://www.abarnett.demon.co.uk/atheism/noahs_ark.html<br><br>One of them I am enjoying is about the water level.<br><br><blockquote>19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered. </blockquote>Lets say it is over the hills of Mount Everest. The volume of water needed will be incredible. The polars ice caps, even if it all melted will not even be enough at all. The approximate calculation for the volume of water is 4500 MILLIONs of cubic kilometres of water. And it is suppose to fall within 40 days, thus it is 220 metres of rainfall every day over entire planet. On heavy rainfall, a few cm is considered a lot.<br><br>There r more amazing facts about the impossibilities of Noah ark in ta page. Please please read them if u r interested.
