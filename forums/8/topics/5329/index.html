            <div class='col-md body'>A year has passed since the fateful day.....i still remember the sweet days i did not cherish....I met this gal and my first thought abt her is "Wow!what an angel!" and i kinda of like her but i juz kept denying it by telling myself is juz another of my wild dreams...as she was older than me.....but the feeling juz grew stronger and one day finally i decided to ask her out for a moive on a Christmas day....and we watched Titanic...i sorta of kinda of feel that she had the same feeling that i have towards her and i rem we first hold our hands halfway thru the movie...i simply cannot believe it....as everything seems too fast and she was older than me...i mean kinda of strange for gals to like younger guys.<br>She was always very cheerful and caring type of gal...i rem when i was seriously sick she stay by my bedside throughout the nite and she sorta of carry me to the doctor by letting me lean on her as at that time i was too sick to walk.....at the beginning part of our relationship i really show care and concern for her....all those little things like fetch her home and give her a potrait of Romeo and Juilet on Valentine Day...The sweet moments does not last long......<br>At the later part of the relationship,i started to have the feeling of being 'tied down' and i wanted to feel free to roam around once more...i still liked her very much and neva like another  gal is juz dat i dun like the feeling of being tied down.I am not like those possesive type of guy whom restrict their gf in a lot of things.I give her total freedom...she can juz do whatever she want to do and at the later part of the relationship i neva page her anymore i mean i neva really show care and concern in actions anymore but my love for her neva changed.Every weekends she would juz come to my house and we will go out...on one ocassion she told me that a guy liked her very much and is wooing her.....i know that i neva really treat her very well compared to what she did for me and i tell her that if she thinks dat if the guy can really give her happiness ,she can juz leave me for him but pls let me know...she cried and told me that she neva like dat guy and she certainly would not want to leave me......<br>One day i was playing my favourite game and i was very near to the end of that game after a few weeks of playing.She sorta of came forward and bugged me for a while and in a fit of anger i shouted at her,"Can't u SEE i am playing?Stop BOthering me!"...(i really regret doing that).....her eyes were filled with tears and she juz sit there keeping silent for a while and she give me a light kiss on my cheek and said ,"i gotta go....bye..."I neva expect that was the last time i see her and i neva thought that is was really the end of the relationship....weeks passed and i neva even bother to call her as she would usually go to my house during the weekends..i mean if i call her is sorta of admiting that i was wrong and its a man pride.The feeling of missing her juz grow stronger and stronger a month later and i started to ask her to patch back but she rejected...i thought she would accept as she told me she still like me very much and thats why i asked her to patch back...and it really embarrassed me when she rejected....i feel kinda of angry and i juz told her "Fine!"...its the man pride at work again....i neva even bother to ask her why she did not want to accept ...later i found out that actually at that time when i sorta break with her...the guy who is wooing her came to console her and she started to treat him as a sub....the reason on why she rejected is that she feel guilty towards to the guy if she patch back with me and that is the factor is holding her back...<br>Now presently she is together with him and i heard dat the guy is sorta of very possesive type and was restricting her a lot but the gd thing is that he was real caring towards her ...fetch her back dat sort of things....anyway i am not in any position to say anything now...during a period of time i thought that by having the idea that she was leaving me for another guy is an unfaithful action but dat does not make me feel better either ...the more i have this idea i will feel more guilty towards her....sometimes during the nites...i really missed the feeling of hearing each other heart beats to sleep by hugging each other tightly.Everytime the tune or the song of "my heart will go on" will make me think of her...thoughts of her taking care of me and the sweet moments.I neva had the chance to say a sincere sorry to her and i know whatever i did will not make up for what she did for me......<br>Sometimes i feel that the the guy who is her bf now is real lucky as before that he is juz her irc friend who came to know the love problems she was facing and console her  when she was sad and that earns him what he had today...sometimes i kinda of jealous of that guy as maybe without him we would already patch back but most of the fault lies on me ....i neva really cared and missed her until i lost her.....<br>So Guys what i am i trying to said that is Really LEARN frm my mistake .....cherish ur gf well dun wait till the time u lost her and u started to cherish her it may be too late......<br>Anyway any suggestions on how shd i repay her back and say a sincere sorry to her?<br>I always have this wish that one day when i waked up in the morning she would be sitting juz beside my bed and greet me with a sweet Gd Morning...juz like Rose had a dream on which she would reunited with Jack on the sunken Titanic.........but i know that my little wish of mine would neva become a reality...................................</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mystery...<br>First ask yourself if you were even to get to her...will u cherish her?No point getting her and not knowing what is going to be in store for her.If you can't give her happiness, let her go. Dun be selfish as to hold something just becos you are lonely or becos she has been good to u.I always tell my guy friends if u like her gal who wants commitment love and attention, dun get into the realtionship unless u know what u are getting into. Love is not a hide-and-seek game.<br><br>I dunno how old are u, but sometimes age play a part. Cos I know, I have been thru the same thing and I also kinda regret it now cos he is so nice and almost to perfection of a bf and prospective husband, but sometimes u should ask yourself if u deserve such a nice gal. If not dun go on trying to probe into her life.You say that she still like you, and she dun want to be treating her current bf unfairly. But tell her love is not a symphaty act, you have to love becos u REALLY know what is all about, or she will be hurting the gal in the long run.<br><br>I suggest u do some soul-searching before u know what u really want.Once u have decided, ask her out to have a heart-to-heart talk and settle it.No use having this knot in your heart and regret.Since u think she has feelings for u, you now sit down and think what u really want,and dun disappoint again...<br><br>If you really want to know what true love really is, read my thread in "A Special Kind of Thing"<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i agree with Rinoa that it does depend on how old u are... if u are still young, dun worry... there are TONS of fishes in the sea... but if you are old (meaning u want to find da one and get married) then maybe you should have a heart-to-heart talk with her. No use living ur life in regret.. actually, we all live with regrets, like not being able to go to ur dream university or cases such as urs, but hopefully they teach us how treasure our future opportunities better... dun worry... be happy... wooo wooo ooo oooo.. dun worry be happy! many unexpected things can happen...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for sharing your story.<br>I can't think of a better way to say sorry than a private chat.<br><br>However, I wouldn't try to hope for too much, maybe because I'm a pessimist. When you say sorry, you should say sorry because you mean it. If after some soul searching you find out that you are saying sorry because you just can't bear her with some other person, then don't bother doing it. Offer your honest and sincere friendship and don't expect too much. You can only do so much, the rest is up to them.<br><br>That is a personal point of view, so do think about it. All the best!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Wow, That was a great love story you know even better than the "Titanic". It really touch me. I can't teach you to forget your regrets, your suffering or pain. No one could. I think, if you wanna say sorry to her. Just called her up and just say it...It'll feel better cause you know...when your life has pass you by and when you look back to this point in your life...you'll know that you won't have too much regrets because you did what was the one thing you wanted to do. You have to do that something which was the only thing you didn't do...And it's simply no use just playing the memories over and over again in your head. Once you called her and did what you had to do...You could finally have that weight off your shoulders and you won't feel the pain anymore when you remember her...because I think nothing really last forever...except in our memories. And I think that's what really count. And take that pretty picture of her and all the good times you have and remember it...Cause it's gonna be there in your head for the rest of your life. But this time, hopefully, without too much pain...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Really sorry to hear that...You know what? Sometimes I just feel that relationships nowadays are just like Titanic.They are going to sink to the bottom sooner or later when they hit the iceberg. People don't usually cherish what they have. As for me... I have regrets too. *Sighed* Probably she married and have kids by now. I can only just watch her from a distance and wished her she'll be happy always.<br><br>But don't just dwell in the past. Where there is life, there are still a lot of chances out there! Don't be a Titanic, be an ice-breaker!Cheerio!!<br><br>[This message has been edited by takumi (edited 27-11-1999).]</div>
