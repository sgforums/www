            <div class='col-md body'>Subject: Lessons for the Corporate Life.<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; Corporate lesson 1<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing her shower<br>&gt; when the doorbell rings. After a few seconds of arguing over which one<br>&gt; should go and answer the doorbell, the wife gives up, quickly wraps<br>herself<br>&gt; up in a towel and runs downstairs. When she opens the door, there stands<br>&gt; Bob, the next-door neighbor.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Before she says a word, Bob says,' I'll give you $200 to drop that towel<br>&gt; that you have on.' After thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel<br>&gt; and stands naked in front of Bob. After a few seconds, Bob hands her $200<br>&gt; and leaves.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Confused, but excited about her good fortune, the woman wraps back up in<br>&gt; the towel and goes back upstairs. When she gets back to the bathroom, her<br>&gt; husband asks from the shower 'Who was that ?' 'It was Bob the next door<br>&gt; neighbor,' she replies. 'Great,' the husband says, 'did he say anything<br>&gt; about the $200 he owes me?'<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Moral of the story: If you share critical information pertaining to credit<br>&gt; and risk in time with your stakeholders, you may be in a position to<br>&gt; prevent avoidable exposure.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Corporate lesson 2<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A priest was driving along and saw a nun on the side of the road; he<br>&gt; stopped and offered her a lift, which she accepted. She got in and crossed<br>&gt; her legs, forcing her gown to open and reveal a lovely leg. The priest had<br>&gt; a look and nearly had an accident. After controlling the car,he stealthily<br>&gt; slid his hand up her leg. The nun looked at him and immediately said,<br>&gt; 'Father, remember psalm 129?' The priest was flustered and apologized<br>&gt; profusely.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; He forced himself to remove his hand. However, he was unable to remove his<br>&gt; eyes from her leg.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Further on, while changing gear, he let his hand slide up to her leg<br>again.<br>&gt; The nun once again said, 'Father, remember psalm 129?' Once again the<br>&gt; priest apologized. 'Sorry sister but the flesh is weak.'<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Arriving at the convent, the nun got out gave him a meaningful glance and<br>&gt; went on her way. On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to<br>&gt; retrieve a bible and looked up psalm 129. It Said, 'Go forth and seek,<br>&gt; further up, you will find glory.'<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Moral of the story: Always be well informed in your job, or you might miss<br>&gt; a great opportunity<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Corporate Lesson 3<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A sales rep, an administration clerk and the manager are walking to lunch<br>&gt; when they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out in a<br>&gt; puff of smoke.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The Genie says, 'I usually only grant three wishes, so I'll give each of<br>&gt; you just one.'<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 'Me first! Me first!' says the admin clerk. 'I want to be in the Bahamas,<br>&gt; driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.' Poof! She's gone.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In astonishment, 'Me next! Me next!' says the sales rep. 'I want to be in<br>&gt; Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal<br>&gt; masseuse, an endless supply of pina coladas and the love of my life.'<br>Poof!<br>&gt; He's gone.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 'OK, you're up,' the Genie says to the manager. The manager says, 'I want<br>&gt; those two back in the office after lunch.'<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Moral of the story: Always let your boss have the first say.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br></div>

This is really cute!" He offered to get it for<br>&gt; &gt; her, but<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;she hesitated &amp; replied, "No....it's okay..." He shrugged his<br>&gt; &gt; shoulders &amp;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;moved on to look at something else. Meanwhile Sufen stood rooted<br>&gt; &gt; to the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;spot, feeling very miffed.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;His Interpretation<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I offered to get the bear for u but u said u din wan it<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;What She Means<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Of cos I wanted the bear, u IDIOT!! I din give u a firm<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;"no", did I?? U would insist on getting it for me if u were<br>&gt; &gt; sincere abt<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;the offer!<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Scenario 2<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Cheryl &amp; Kenming were at a jigsaw puzzle store, &amp; his was abt to<br>&gt; &gt; pay for<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;a brand new 2,500 piece set for himself. Suddenly, Cheryl held out<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;another box &amp; asked, " Do u think I should get thus puzzle? It's<br>&gt; &gt; so nice,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;but it's expensive...." "Well, u can always wait for the next<br>&gt; &gt; sale, he<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;replied. She refused to talk to him for the rest of the evening &amp;<br>&gt; &gt; the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;next 2 days. She continued to ignore him regardless of how many<br>&gt; &gt; times he<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;apologized. " So, what do u want me to do?" he asked in<br>&gt; &gt; desperation. "I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;can't tell u what to do, can I?" she answered.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;His Interpretation<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I thought u were seeking advice on whether to get that jigsaw<br>&gt; &gt; puzzle, so<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I gave u my suggestion. U were really angry &amp; I din know how to<br>&gt; &gt; make up<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;for it. So I chose to apologize anyway, but u continued to be<br>&gt; &gt; angry<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;regardless of the no. of times I said I was sorry. What more am I<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;supposed to do if "sorry" isn't enough?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;What She Means<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I was hinting that I wanted this jigsaw set, &amp; I was hoping you'd<br>&gt; &gt; get it<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;for me. I'm fed up b'cos u're so 'blur' u can't take a hint. If<br>&gt; &gt; u're<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;genuinely sorry, u would make up for ur mistake by going back to<br>&gt; &gt; that<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;store &amp; getting that puzzle for me.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Scenario 3<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Terence &amp; Mealanie were out on a date. Slightly b4 dinner time,<br>&gt; &gt; she<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;casually mentioned something abt a nice little French restaurant<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;nearby.....When dinner time came around, he asked her what she<br>&gt; &gt; would like<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;to have for dinner. "Anything" she replied. They ended up in a<br>&gt; &gt; foodcourt<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&amp; she did nothing but to sulk over a bowl of beef noodles.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;His Interpretation<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I asked u what u wanted &amp; u said "anything". I thought u really<br>&gt; &gt; din have<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;any preference, &amp; were leaving the decision up to me. So I<br>&gt; &gt; suggested the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;foodcourt &amp; u din object.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;What She Means<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I really want to have dinner at that French restaurant. That's why<br>&gt; &gt; I'm<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;telling u how good it's supposed to be. I just din want to say it<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;directly b'cos it's quite an expensive restaurant.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;***********************************<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Scenario 4<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;It was 2am. Faizai &amp; Rina had had a good time at a disco &amp; decided<br>&gt; &gt; to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;call it a night. As they were hailing for cabs, Rina said, "It's<br>&gt; &gt; quite<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;late now, I wonder if it's safe....." "Of cos it is" he assured<br>&gt; &gt; her. They<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;took separate cabs home, &amp; she turned him down the next time he<br>&gt; &gt; asked her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;out on a date.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;His Interpretation<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I thought u were just asking for my opinion as to whether it was<br>&gt; &gt; safe to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;go home at that hour! I wouldn't have minded sending u back if I'd<br>&gt; &gt; known<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;u'd wanted me to, but u seemed so self-assured &amp; independent.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;What She Means<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I think u should be sending me home at this hour. If u had been a<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;gentlemen, I wouldn't even have needed to drop that hint!<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;*************************************<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THREE LITTLE WORDS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN ONE'S LIFE<br><br>There are many things that we can do to perk up and strengthen our interpersonal relationships. Yet the most effective involves the saying of just three words. When spoken or conveyed, these statements have the power to forge new friendships, deepen old ones and restore relationships that have cooled. The following three-word phrases can enrich every relationship.<br><br>I'll Be There:<br>If you have ever had to call a friend in the middle of the night, to take a sick child to hospital, or when your car has broken down some miles from home, you will know how good it feels to hear the phrase:<br>"I'll be there."<br>Being there for another person is the greatest gift we<br>can give. When we are truly present for other people, important things happen to them and us. We are renewed in love and friendship. We are restored emotionally and spiritually. Being there is at the very core of civility.<br><br>I Miss You:<br>Perhaps more marriages could be saved and strengthened if couples<br>simply and sincerely said to each other "I miss you." This powerful affirmation tells partners they are wanted, needed, desired and loved. Consider<br>how ecstatic you would feel, if you received an unexpected phone call from<br>your spouse in the middle of your workday, just to say "I miss you."<br><br>I Respect You:<br>Respect is another way of showing love. Respect conveys the feeling that another person is a true equal. If you talk to your children as if they were adults you will strengthen the bonds and become close friends.<br>This applies to all inter-personal relationships.<br><br>Maybe You're Right:<br>This phrase is highly effective in diffusing an argument and restoring frayed emotions.<br>The flip side to "maybe your right" is the humility<br>of admitting, "Maybe I'm wrong".<br>Let's face it. When you have a heated argument with someone, all you do is cement the other person's point<br>of view. They, or you, will not change their stance and you run the risk of seriously damaging the relationship between you.<br><br>Please Forgive Me:<br>Many broken relationships could be restored and healed if people would admit their mistakes and ask for forgiveness. All of us are vulnerable to faults, foibles and failures. A man should never be ashamed to own<br>up that he has been in the wrong, which is saying, in other words, that he is wiser today than he was yesterday.<br><br>I Thank You:<br>Gratitude is an exquisite form of courtesy. People who enjoy the companionship of good, close friends are those who don't take daily courtesies for granted. They are quick to thank their friends for their many expressions of kindness. On the other hand, people whose circle<br>of friends is severely constricted often do not have the attitude of gratitude.<br><br>Count On Me:<br>A friend is one who walks in when others walk out. Loyalty is an essential ingredient for true friendship; it is the emotional glue that bonds people.<br>Those that are rich in their relationships tend to be<br>steady and true friends. When troubles come, a good friend is there indicating you can "count on me."<br><br>Let Me Help:<br>The best of friends see a need and try to fill it. When they spot a hurt they do what they can to heal it. Without being asked, they pitch in and help.<br><br>I Understand You:<br>People become closer and enjoy each other more if they feel the other person accepts and understands them. Letting your spouse know in so many little ways that you understand them, is one of the most powerful tools for healing your relationship. This applies to any relationship.<br><br>I Love You:<br>Perhaps the most important three words that you can say. Telling someone that you truly love them satisfies a person's deepest emotional needs; the need to belong, to feel appreciated and to be wanted. Your family, your friends and you, all need to hear those three little<br>words."I love you."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HOW TO TELL IF A GUY IS A Virgin<br><br>A very 'straight and honest' girl is going to Kuala Lumpur. Before<br>&gt;&gt;She left, her mother gave her some advice.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Daughter, when you're in KL and if you're looking for<br>&gt;&gt;a match there, you must take note of the following the requirements<br>&gt;&gt;Mother set for you.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;You must find a man that is 'faithful', not 'spendthrift' and must<br>&gt;&gt;Be a 'virgin'. With this advise from her mother, the girl went to<br>&gt;&gt;Town.<br>&gt;&gt;After some months later, she came home to her kampong to get her<br>&gt;&gt;mother's blessings to marry. "Mother, I've met my match following<br>&gt;&gt;your<br>&gt;&gt;instructions. My future husband is faithful because when we went<br>&gt;&gt;out for<br>&gt;&gt;a<br>&gt;&gt;holiday one day, he took care of me specifically even though there<br>&gt;&gt;were<br>&gt;&gt;so many prettier girls around. Isn't that being faithful?".<br>&gt;&gt;Her mother nodded in agreement. "Then, since the day was getting<br>&gt;&gt;late in<br>&gt;&gt;the night and rain was pouring, my boyfriend decided that we stay<br>&gt;&gt;the<br>&gt;&gt;night at a<br>&gt;&gt;hotel. He also suggested that in order not to spend too much, we<br>&gt;&gt;shared<br>&gt;&gt;one<br>&gt;&gt;room only. Isn't he not spendthrift guy?" For the second time<br>&gt;&gt;her mother nodded her head in agreement, but with a little concern.<br>&gt;&gt;"And finally mum..., I know he is a virgin". "How did you know he<br>&gt;&gt;is still a virgin?" The mother asked with repidition. "Mmm....his<br>&gt;&gt;'that<br>&gt;&gt;one' is new......still wrapped up in plastic, mum</div>

When they opened the lid , they found a letter on top which read as<br>follows:<br><br>Dear brothers and sisters, I am sending our mother's body to you since it<br>was her wish that she should be cremated in The compound of our ancestral<br>home in Tung Shin .

It seemed a little strange, but I ignored<br>&gt; &gt; it.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; However, when the busboy brought out water and utensils, I<br>&gt; &gt; noticed he also had a spoon in his shirt pocket, then looked<br>&gt; &gt; around the room and saw that all the staff had spoons in<br>&gt; &gt; their pockets.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; When the waiter came back to serve our soup I asked, "Why the<br>&gt; &gt; spoon?"<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; "Well," he explained, "the restaurant's owners hired Ernst &amp;<br>&gt; &gt; Young Consulting, experts in efficiency, in order to revamp<br>&gt; &gt; all our processes. After several months of statistical<br>&gt; &gt; analysis, they concluded that customers drop their spoons<br>&gt; &gt; 73.84 percent more often than any other utensil. This<br>&gt; &gt; represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per<br>&gt; &gt; table per hour.  If our personnel is prepared to deal with<br>&gt; &gt; that contingency, we can reduce the number of trips back to<br>&gt; &gt; the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; As luck would have it I dropped my spoon and he was able to<br>&gt; &gt; replace it with his spare spoon. "I'll get another spoon next<br>&gt; &gt; time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to<br>&gt; &gt; get it right now." I was rather impressed.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; The waiter served our main course and I continued to look<br>&gt; &gt; around. I then noticed that there was a very thin string<br>&gt; &gt; hanging out of the waiter's fly.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Looking around, I noticed that all the waiters had the same<br>&gt; &gt; string hanging, I asked the waiter, "Excuse me, but can you<br>&gt; &gt; tell me why you have that string right there?"<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; "Oh, certainly!" he answered, lowering his voice. "Not<br>&gt; &gt; everyone is as observant as you. That consulting firm I<br>&gt; &gt; mentioned also found out that we can save time in the<br>&gt; &gt; restroom."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; "How so?"<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; "See," he continued, "by tying this string to the head of you<br>&gt; &gt; know what, We can pull it out over the urinal without<br>&gt; &gt; touching it and that way Eliminate the need to wash the<br>&gt; &gt; hands, shortening the time spent in the restroom by 76.39<br>&gt; &gt; percent."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Okay, that makes sense, but . . . if the string helps you get<br>&gt; &gt; it out, how do you put it back in?"<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; "Well," he whispered, lowering his voice even further, "I<br>&gt; &gt; don't know about the others, but I use the spoon."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Subject: The Female Brain-Girls It's time to laugh<br><br>In the hospital, the relatives gathered in the waiting room, where their<br>family member lay gravely ill. Finally, the doctor came in looking tired<br>and somber. "I'm afraid I'm the bearer of bad news," he said as he surveyed<br>the worried faces.  "The only hope left for your  loved one at this time is<br>a brain transplant.  It's an experimental and very risky procedure, but it<br>is the only hope at this time. You will have to pay for the brain<br>yourselves".<br><br>The family members sat silent as they absorbed  the news. After a great<br>length of time, someone asked, "Well, how much does a brain cost?" The<br>doctor quickly responded, "$5,000 for a male  brain and $200 for a female<br>brain." The moment turned awkward. men in the room tried not to smile,<br>avoiding eye contact with the women, but some actually smirked. One man,<br>unable to control his curiosity, blurted out the question everyone wanted<br>to ask, "Why is the male brain so much more?"<br><br>The doctor smiled at the childish innocence and explained to the entire<br>group, "It's just standard pricing procedure. We have to mark down the<br>price of the female brains, because they've actually been used."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Emperor's Seeds<br><br>An emperor in the Far East was growing old and knew it was time to choose his<br>successor.  Instead of choosing one of his assistants or his children, he<br>decided something different.  He called young people in the kingdom together one<br>day. He said, "It is time for me to step down and choose the next emperor. I<br>have decided to choose one of you."<br><br>The kids were shocked!  But the emperor continued. "I am going to give each one<br>of you a seed today. One very special seed. I want you to plant the seed, water<br>it and come back here one year from today with what you have grown from this one<br>seed. I will then judge the plants that you bring, and the one I choose will be<br>the next emperor!"<br><br>One boy named Ling was there that day and he, like the others, received a seed.<br>He went home and excitedly told his mother the story. She helped him get a pot<br>and planting soil, and he planted the seed and watered it carefully. Every day<br>he would water it and watch to see if it had grown.<br><br>After about three weeks, some of the other youths began to talk about their<br>seeds and the plants that were beginning to grow. Ling kept checking his seed,<br>but nothing ever grew. Three weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks went by. Still nothing. By<br>now, others were talking about their plants but Ling didn't have a plant, and he<br>felt like a failure. Six months went by-still nothing in Ling's pot. He just<br>knew he had killed his seed. Everyone else had trees and tall plants, but he had<br>nothing.Ling didn't say anything to his friends, however. He just kept waiting<br>for his seed to grow.<br><br>A year finally went by and all the youths of the kingdom brought their<br>plants to the emperor for inspection. Ling told his mother that he wasn't<br>going to take an empty pot. But honest about what happened, Ling felt sick to<br>his stomach, but he knew his mother was right. He took his empty pot to the<br>palace.<br><br>When Ling arrived, he was amazed at the variety of plants grown by the other<br>youths. They were beautiful-in all shapes and sizes. Ling put his empty pot on<br>the floor and many of the other kinds laughed at him. A few felt sorry for him<br>and just said, "Hey nice try."<br><br>When the emperor arrived, he surveyed the room and greeted the young people.<br>Ling just tried to hide in the back. "My, what great plants, trees and flowers<br>you have grown," said the emperor.  "Today, one of you will be appointed the<br>next emperor!"<br><br>All of a sudden, the emperor spotted Ling at the back of the room with his empty<br>pot.  He ordered his guards to bring him to the front.  Ling was terrified. "The<br>emperor knows I'm a failure!  Maybe he will have me<br>killed!"<br><br>When Ling got to the front, the Emperor asked his name. "My name is Ling," he<br>replied.  All the kids were laughing and making fun of him.<br><br>The emperor asked everyone to quiet down. He looked at Ling, and then announced<br>to the crowd, "Behold your new emperor!  His name is Ling!"  Ling couldn't<br>believe it. Ling couldn't even grow his seed. How could he be the new emperor?<br>Then the emperor said, "One year ago today, I gave everyone here a seed. I told<br>you to take the seed, plant it, water it, and bring it back to me today. But I<br>gave you all boiled seeds which would not grow. All of you, except Ling, have<br>brought me trees and plants and flowers.<br><br>When you found that the seed would not grow, you substituted another seed for<br>the one I gave you. Ling was the only one with the courage and honesty to bring<br>me a pot with my seed in it.  Therefore, he is the one who will be the new<br>emperor!"<br><br>If you plant honesty, You will reap trust<br>If you plant goodness, You will reap friends<br>If you plant humility, You will reap greatness<br>If you plant perseverance, You will reap victory<br>If you plant consideration, You will reap harmony<br>If you plant hard work, You will reap success<br>If you plant forgiveness, You will reap reconciliation<br>If you plant openness, You will reap intimacy<br>If you plant patience, You will reap improvements<br>If you plant faith, You will reap miracles<br><br>But<br><br>If you plant dishonesty, You will reap distrust.<br>If you plant selfishness, You will reap loneliness<br>If you plant pride, You will reap destruction<br>If you plant envy, You will reap trouble<br>If you plant laziness, You will reap stagnation.<br>If you plant bitterness, You will reap isolation<br>If you plant greed, You will reap loss<br>If you plant gossip, You will reap enemies<br>If you plant worries, You will reap wrinkles<br>If you plant sin, You will reap guilt<br><br>So be careful what you plant now, It will determine what you will reap<br>tomorrow.<br><br>The seeds you now scatter, Will make life worse or better your life or the<br>ones who will come after. Yes, someday, you will enjoy the fruits, Or you<br>will pay for the choices you plant today.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Y do men pee stand up<br><br>Seems God was just about done with creating the universe but he had two extra things left over in his bag so he decided to split them between Adam and Eve. ��He told them that one of the things he had left was a tiny thing that would allow the owner to pee while standing up. "It's a very handy thing," God told them, "and I was wondering if either one of you would like that."<br><br>Well, Adam jumped up and down and begged "Oh, give that to me! I'd love to be able to do that. It seems just the sort of thing a man should be able to do. Please. Please! Pleeease! Give it to me." On and on he went like an excited little boy.<br><br>So Eve just smiled and told God that if Adam really wanted it so badly, he should have it. So God gave Adam the tiny thing that allowed him to pee while standing up and he was so excited. He whizzed on the bark of a tree and then went off to write his name in the sand, laughing with delight all the while.<br><br>God and Eve watched him for a moment and then God said to Eve, "Well, here's the other thing and I guess you can have it." "What's it called? Eve asked. ��"A Brain," God said.</div>
