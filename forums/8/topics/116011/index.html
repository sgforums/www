            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Friends,<br><br>THINKING of buying new toiletries such as towels for the coming Chinese  New Year???<br><br>Remember the circulated email about this old ah pek, selling towels @Chinatown Complex (the big market at Pagoda street...where currently all the Chinese new year stalls are situated).... hence while shopping for Chinese New Year goods, why not just drop by his stall...<br><br>* For those who have no idea....in short...this ah pek appeared in one of the Channel U TV program, featuring him &amp; his 2 retarded daughters...apparently, selling towels has been his livelihood &amp; as been providing for his 2 grown up daughters...Besides household chores, he has to wash his daughter's clothes &amp; bedsheets as they are not agile enough to go to the toilet...... he was offered the government financial grant where he is entitled to claim $240 per month but was rejected by him...reason being that he feels that he is still capable of supporting himself &amp; was fortunate to have his own small stall.... hence,he wanted the $$ to be channelled to other people who might need this $$ more<br>than him.*<br><br>That program was about 2-3 years back. The last time i visited him, he was wearing a very old T-shirt, greeting me with smile when i approached him to buy towels. But on 18 Jan 2005 when i went to the stall, he was seen sitting<br>on a wheelchair, looking sickly &amp; senile....his hand seems to be swollen &amp; unable to move....(looks like stroke) an uncle who is helping him to mann the stall commented that the ah pek is not in  good health &amp; he is just helping him...despite of his health, he still insisted to be at his stall everyday. Though he is unable to serve  the customers, he will still sit on his wheelchair &amp; be by his stall...<br><br>I would like to take this opportunity to urge everyone of you...esp on this joyous occasion where happiness &amp; joy is filled along the streets of pagoda, DO look out for this ah pek who is at this small, un-noticed corner at the Chinatown Complex....i went there at ard 8pm &amp; he is still there....his stall unit number is #01-186 ( if you forgot, just ask around the other stall holders abt this ah pek with 2 retarded daughters..) Help him out by buying his towels......Even though it is just a $1 hand-towel.....and trust me, you will not feel that it is a waste of time, going all the way to his stall just to buy towels..... you never know, be it $1 or $10 (for 3 big towels).........a small charitible act would definately help to boost this old pek's wish to maintain this stall &amp; ability to support himself till the end of his time...<br><br>Please circulate this msg around.....as i know a lot of people would surely make the trip down to Chinatown to enjoy the ambience of lunar new year ..............By drop by..... you never know YOU will just make a difference to his small earnings for that day.............*<br><br>May God bless you with luck &amp; health in the coming lunar new year*<br><br>Many Many Thanks to You !!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The store is at the side of the building.<br><br>I was there once to buy towels from him.<br><br>I think he's really losing out to other vendors selling similar items. He has a small variety compared to others, and when I was making payment, I noticed the amount he charged me for the large amount of towels I took seemed to be quite little. Don't know whether is it his price is lower or he was a little blur already. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>It's a sad sight, really. I always see him holding his daughter's hand, making their way to the Chinatown market building. I wonder what'll happen to his daughter in future... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

There's a building called New Bridge Centre. It's gray in color and it's just behind a bus-stop. On it's left is Lucky Chinatown.<br><br>To get to the market stores in the building, you just need to keep walking in the building (in the direction of Smith St) and the first store you see should be one selling towels, pyjamas, and cushion covers.<br><br>I'm not sure how to get to the store cos it's like a maze to me there... I always keep walking till I get to the place I wanna go to. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
