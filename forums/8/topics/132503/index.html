Now we have very good school for the autistic kids as well.. I guess it's better they start learning to mix around there.. Cuz we can't imagine their fear in a bunch of normal kids. Once they can be more sociable and open up, maybe a transfer to a normal school would be a better turning point for them..<br><br>But sadly, some parents can't think for nuts, they just care about their 'faces' only.. so die die put their children in normal school and cause even bigger trouble for the kids, themselves, and others. I'm not saying autistic children are troublesome, everyone has problems here and there too, so it's better not to worsen them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, It's hard to see this issue as whole, to me it all depends on the indivdual kids. Different conditions will have a different effects. Some kids may require lots of attention from many facets. Though they may see themselves in their own worlds, let not foget they are human beings filled with feeling, they can feel who are the ones who come &amp; goes &amp; who are the ones who showered their time &amp; concern to them.<br>An Autistic child may not always be autistive, we should not see them so pessimistic. They learn as they grow. Study in a special school that cater to the needs of the Autistic children is just like everyone living in their own paradigm, unable conmensurate with each other, however on the other side, there's a higher chance if they are to join normal children in the school, a higher chances of their recovery.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Teachers just throw them some stuffs to keep them busy... like coloring books and so on... and continue teaching their normal students... no one tells them what and how to behave.. i wonder how they learn?<br><br>I'm not lookin down on these autistic children..frankly i feel very sorry for them, no one wants to be born in that state... however, i believe that children with such disability , at least, should be given some special attention and education before joining the real world, if not, it'll be too late to cultivate their mentality when they're older, and if they continue behaving this way.. I'm afriad the society may not be accept them, the outside world's cruel.<br><br>These children aren't like normal kids who can socialise themselves...and we shouldn't be there hoping a miracle will happen (by letting them mixing with the other kids) and not doing anything at all. How can a teacher handle 40 kids ( little monkeys they call) and an autistic kid at the same time, while trying to teach??<br><br>A friend of mine visited an Autistic school for a job interview  a couple of months ago. She told me their classes consists of less than 10 kids each, one teacher and one teacher assistant. These teachers have to undergo specialised training to handle these kids. Look, you have 2 specialists looking after 5 children there... and in a normal school, it's just a teacher looking after 40 students, how much attention do you think she/he can provide the autistic kid? If autistic kids do not need that much attention, why do Autistic schools plan their classes so small, with 2 teachers?</div>
