LOL  . they could just do it at home......only noob go mac to download. </div></blockquote>You are assuming too many things, matter is not that complicated actually.<br><br>You assume there is an admin monitoring the network, eyes never leave monitor. You assume police askes the admin to help or the admin is an advocate of copyright laws. You assume the admin can stop me from leaving mac until police arrives, does he has the right to restrain other people's activity? Erasing mp3 and softwares take only a few seconds.<br><br>Actually, my method is foolproof one, unless I'm damn suay, then I will be busted.<br></div>
