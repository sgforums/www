( I think its supposed to be 5 years or so now though.)<br><br>Since biologically speaking, females last about 7 to 9 years longer than a male does, so if you wanna die together, get a gf/wife that's 7 years older than you, or vice versa.<br><br>But if you think you're girlfriend's old, here's something to shock some of you.

( I think its supposed to be 5 years or so now though.)<br><br>Since biologically speaking, females last about 7 to 9 years longer than a male does, so if you wanna die together, get a gf/wife that's 7 years older than you, or vice versa.<br><br>But if you think you're girlfriend's old, here's something to shock some of you.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, seeing as how "thinking" affects things like "behaviour".... how does immature thinking not lead to immature behaviour? I think "thinking" encapsulates "behaviour". Sorry about all the "" shitty things but just to be a bit less ambiguous. E.g. someone who's thinking is immature =&gt; behaving immature.<br><br>Anyway, this talk of poly lecturer + poly student reminds me of when I was in high school in Melbourne. I was in boarding school and this weird ass hongkie fella had this thing for the dai lok mandarin exchange tutor. She used to give all students of mandarin special one-on-one sessions to perfect the spoken skills -- I guess his were a bit more special loh! Hehehe. To be corny, I guess there wasn't much distinction between aural and oral when those two got together in her little office. =) YUCKS MAN! EEEYERR!!!!!<br><br>Anyway, that was like over 4 years ago. I don't know if they're still together now (shudder) but maybe it was love?? He left school shortly after that. That would be around the same as sec 4/5-ish? I guess some of you sentimental types would be thinking "How can you criticise this couple? You weren't there, you have no idea what emotions brewed and what type of connection they had... their love might've been pure and true!" Well, see, thing is is that I KNOW this fella. He's kinda gross and horny and stuff. And picturing him and the dai lok mui tutor.... I'm sorry. Forgive me. *blehhhhhh*<br><br>------------------<br>_________<br>B16A-EG6<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No, I'm not kidding.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Of course, the status between them is no long that of the student and the lecturer, since the guy is working now, but they DID get together when he was still a student.<br><br>Besides, she's one of those who ages really well. She's like, in the late 30s or so I think, and she looks like she's 26. So you can say that he's a really lucky guy, in a sense. I bump into them pretty often when I go out, and they're still together, and their relationship is one that I really admire.<br><br>Their relationship is totally mental. You can literally tell that the two of them just LOVES the other's intellect and personality. (of course, there's definitely physical attraction somewhere.....) And sometimes, the discussions they can go into makes my brain ache from trying to comprehend the depth.<br><br>Plus the fact that I've never seen them do anything more than just hold hands makes them an even more impressive couple. I mean, normal couples try to sneak a kiss to each other on occasion, but these two don't even do it !!<br><br>Sigh.... some people have all the luck.... how many people get together just purely because of their intellects and characters ?</div>
