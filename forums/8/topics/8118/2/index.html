            <div class='col-md body'>Such is the prevalent dilemma in relationships. I guess it was a lot easier when we were all cave dwelling hunter-gatherer-procreators i.e. bloody animals. I guess some people still are; guys going around screwing girls that cannot keep their legs closed. Ugh.<br><br>Anyway, who knows what you're getting when you see someone walking down the street? We can only "know" so many people in a lifetime beyond just "hi/bye" and "yam seng"; what're the chances of actually coming into contact with that somebody? Sure, go out, meet more people, meet as many as you can. Maybe you're increasing the probabilities be it by some insignificant amount.<br><br>Then there comes the point where you're too disappointed, too exhausted. There's no more enthusiasm and you become like me! Passive and reliant on the quasi-pseudo-psychokinetic-funkadelic powers of the universe to somehow create that moment where you and he/she meet.<br><br>EH! I've been waiting damn long already!

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i feel that independence and maturity are not dependent on age, they're inherited as well as nurtured. of course being older does help but if the older person has lead a sheltered life compared to a younger person who has life's responsibilities, trials and difficulties thrown on him/her from a young age, i would say that the younger person will turn out to be more independent and mature than the older person, unless of course the younger person happens to be a moron.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>generally, i feel that in the older gal/younger guy relationships, a lot of compromises and hard work are required and the relationship will be harder to sustain than the norm. a lot will depend on the 'frequency' of the two people involved, not forgetting the objections that are most likely to be raised by the guy's parents and societal expectations and pressure, the fact that gals age faster than guys (will he still love me when i'm old &amp; crinkled and he's still in his prime with all those nubile young babes throwing themselves at him?), other considerations will be the issue of raising a family and expectations of their future.<br><br>for example, if the marriage takes place when their ages are F28/M22, they can still start a family as the gal is still within the childbearing age, but if the marriage takes place when they are F33/M27, it's highly risky but not impossible, should the couple tie the knot at F38/M32, well the guy must be prepared that he may not have children. the bright side would be that the gal won't be so lonely as women tend to outlive men generally, so marrying a younger man does seem to make some sense. well, it would seem that it's almost becoming a trend these days for such relationships going by the articles in Female, Her World, etc, etc<br><br>------------------<br>Passion for life is everything.
