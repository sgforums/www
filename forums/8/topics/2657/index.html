            <div class='col-md body'>To have a model look, voluptous body and face features that capture the hearts of men is desired by most woman. But I realise one basic thing is beauty serves a different defination in all Humans. Like me, I think "Wu Qien Lien" is full of charisma and charm but guys thinks otherwise.<br><br>Of course, if u are born with triats like those above, like what others would comment is thatyou are born "blessed" and "lucky".I take pride in how I look cos it is me. If I am not going to show confidence in myself, no one would. Personality, and external beauty makes up one human being. How many times woman will say to herself,"O dear I have gained one kilograms, it is time to diet..." And they are not even plump. Society have forced woman to be conscious of their outlook appearance. Flipping through fashion mags and catwalks on the stage of Milan, Kate Moss lookalike sashaying across the stage seems like an eyesore to me...I was like.."You call this figure??" Man must be blind to think like that then. And because of the misconceptions that the media is feeding the woman so called "myopic" fashion norms, they thought that THAT figure is the ideal.<br>I guessed for ppl like us genetically having a high metabolic rate are envied by many for the fact that we can eat and not get fat. I have to agree that it is a blessing but to those out there it is has been scientifically proven each of us have a body set point, which determines the number of fat cells in the body. So even you were to "successfully" shed a few pounds, if u are not going to persist the usual dieting for a long period of time, the set point in your body will "tempt" you into eating, thus resetting the original set point. The set point is not easily change once u are a full grown adult.<br><br>So after all the dieting, one will come to the conclusion that "Oh bother!I knew that it is not working...What the Heck!" and they start gorging themselves with food...It is so torturous and yet true.<br><br>So gals, be happy of what you are and maybe try to build up more skills like cooking, voluntary work or activities to manifest the capabilities of ur very worthy self.<br><br>------------------<br>When you can feel light in your life, you have found Hope.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 06 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was amused when I started reading posts, and a few thoughts came to me, but I was glad that I was given some time to think of what to write.<br><br>In the words of Jack Nicholson in "As good as it gets", to visualize women, just think of men and take away reason and accountability. I think this works for some women who are basically irrational. Notice I use some and not all.<br><br>Then what about women that are intelligent? Well, it occurred to me that Bertrand Russell's letter to his lover, Lady Ottoline (who was a married woman and they have sort of a letter-writing affair, very close to a cyberlove affair), he said something which goes along these lines,<br><br>"I wonder if it is the lack of intellect as you say, that makes so many women worry too much over small things. I don't think so, I think it is the triviality of soul - they really care about little things than about big ones... I think that is one of the cynical lessons one learns in regard to most women, that they care more (or as much) for small things than for great ones. I don't think it is intellect that is lacking but proportion in desire."<br><br>Still at the end of the day, I would say that men and women just have different perspectives and ideas about the opposite sex.

            <div class='col-md body'>Prodigal<br>When u say that woman who are meticulously particular about minute things..are not being not intellectual but lacking proportions in desire, what are u actually implying?<br><br>Intellectual woman are not bound by only brains..but also personality. So an intellectual woman can be very schizophrenic and being very unreasonable. And otherwise, woman who are not as intellectual may make good housewives...Seems like u are looking for a perfect woman....which seems rare...but possible...<br><br>Maybe man can tell us woman what they really want?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, Rinoa Heartilly<br><br>What I meant is that even if we have intelligent women, they can give up big pictures for small things because to them, these small things matter more to them. It is something that guys who want to seek intelligent women, because it is just the way women works.<br><br>What Man wants, is a understanding and caring woman who could see to their needs, just as women looking for men who can grant them security and love. It is a like a key and lock, the correct combination would get a couple out of the population... Intelligent women are only preferred by some men, namely me...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I love the postings here   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Ahem, from my place, it seems that the guys and the girls are talking about different things from different planes.  i don't know, maybe if I read them again...<br><br>Why is this question asked?  Are all women supposed to want the same things?  I'll even go as far as to say that the waxing and waning of the feminist movement is caused by the insistence that all women must want a set of somethings when actually different woman wants different things.<br><br>Say in the 50's, women agreed they wanted equality in marriage, being taken seriously in the office and being unchained finally from the kitchens.  This was well because finally women gained greater freedom.  But when some went to say that it's not alright to befriend men anymore, suddenly it's not cool to be a feminist.  Why?  Because not all women want to do away with men.<br><br>Now women found themselves able to do what they want to do.  In my opinion, at least in some parts of the world, there are no pressing issues that might unite the women to fight for a common thing.  Some may conclude that now women do not know what they want anymore when actually women do not have something in common to shout about  anymore.  As for individual woman, it really depends on the person whether she knows what she wants or not.  In this sense it applies to men, too.<br><br>------------------<br>Sticks and stones may break my bones....<br>but whips and chains excite me.<br><br>[This message has been edited by MayaJade (edited 06 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my quest to understand the fairer sex I need a few clarifications.<br><br>Rinoa:<br>Â“Intellectual woman are not bound by only brains..but also personality. So an intellectual woman can be very schizophrenic and being very unreasonable. And otherwise, woman who are not as intellectual may make good housewivesÂ”<br><br>Hi. Hmm, so are you saying that the lack of personality in a woman will make her less of an intellectual since you seem to advocate that an intellectual woman is a dichotomy of brains and personality? I agree with your second sentence but IÂ’m just wondering how you came up with the third sentence. Thanks.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Tet:<br>I think there is a difference between being intelligent and being an intellect or intellectual.<br>Â“A "bimbo" who cares abt her looks is an intellect in clothes, fashion and makeup tips. She has that power to think and reason the concept of what to wear and how to make herself looks good.Â”<br><br>Is this not a display of fashion sense, or skill or developing an aesthetic eye more than being an intellect on clothes? Would you then say that the chicken-rice seller who makes the most gorgeous chicken-rice, yummy, is also an intellect?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>FireWire:<br>Â“men want one thing...<br>men want women...it's as simple as that..just take a look at the very reason why men do what they do..all the little asnwers arrive to this conclusion...in the final analysis of it.Â”<br><br>Urm, do you want to elaborate on this? Are you saying ALL men want women, and all that men have EVER done throughout history has been solely for the attainment of women? Could you give me an example? I.e. draw a genealogy from specific original action to the final attainment of women, and show how the attainment of women was the progenitorÂ’s original intention.

            <div class='col-md body'>Tet,<br><br>Oh no, I'm not saying that a fashion conscious person or chicken rice seller cannot be intelligent. Nor am I saying intelligence is measured by academic gauges alone. I just think you are confusing the terms 'intelligence' and 'intellectual'. Both have vastly different etymological connotations.<br><br>There's a distinction between having intelligence and being an intellectual. You seem to equate specific skills and talent with the personality of the intellectual, i.e. being an intellectual is not just about having intelligence nor does being intelligent qualifies one as an intellectual. Historically intellectuals have been the avant-garde of society. The term comes with certain connotations because the lineage of engagement of the archetypal intellectual include the artistic, political and philosophical spheres. Being a predominantly western notion, left and/or right wing intellectuals are most effective in a particular strata of class, usually the upper middle classes or bourgeoise which provides an economic continuity for them to engage in discourse, or in Marxist terms the non-producing class.<br><br>Cheerio!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>I desire to go to hell and not heaven.

            <div class='col-md body'>After reading all the replies, I just want to put it very simply, that all your arguments mounts to nothing but one point. It does not matter what is the ideal person you are searching, because you can list down all the qualities from number 1 to 10, and see whether person fits it. At the end of the day, you realize that you could just find someone who doesn't fit the bill, and yet you still love the other person. It is this thing called x-factor and it is why some women could give up their nice boyfriends for jerks. Love is something that cannot be rationalized, because humans justify their actions regardless of responsibilities by their freedom.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I like the way you think colette. i think that it all boils down to fate or God if you are a christian. you can have a million ideas of what you want in a man or woman and then throw them all away when someone somes along and steals your heart away. or maybe you will never find "the one" and settle for someone that is "below standard" right?<br></div>
