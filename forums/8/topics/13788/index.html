            <div class='col-md body'>There are many religions in the world, but in the end, people only choose one. For some, they choose not to believe. Imagine this. 1 in 3 people in the world are Christians. 1 in 4 are Muslims. This makes the world's Christian population at 2 billion. For non-believers, how is it that you form the minority, that 2 billion people on these planet are believing in a nonexistent God? Surely these people aren't fools? It'd be ridiculous that churches were made and services conducted in His name if He never existed. God is omnipresent and omnipotent. Do you not believe in the great flood? How is it, that fossils of fish were buried found at the tops of mountains in the Himalayas and Andes? Is that not evidence of the great flood? And, those of you who say that the Bible contradicts Science. The Bible doesn't contradict Science. Rather, they go hand in hand. Take the First law of thermodynamics for example. It states that "Energy cannot be destroyed or created" Everywhere around us is energy. I am energy, so are you. The fact is that, energy used to be creatable. That was in the days that God made the earth, in those 7 days, energy was made from the grace of God. But remember, God said that he would stop at the end of the 7 days, and from then forth, energy could no longer be created or destroyed. Thus, the first law of thermodynamics should read,"energy cannot be created or destroyed NOW".<br>I have given explanation and insight into the scientific basis of the Bible, and its occurences. Perhaps you may be sceptical. But, why not just take the step of faith and embrace the lord with me?<br><br>Do I sound convincing, yah? More than ol' fisherprice?</div>

I'm glad you pointed out to me that it is a mistake to regard the 2 billion figure as a meaningful statistic. After all, you did reiterate the fact that that the  Roman Catholics, Greek Orthodox, Protestants, Pentecostals, Latter-Day Saints, Seventh-Day Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses shouldn't be considered part of the mainstream. I agree with you. So the 2 billion figure is a trifle misleading, as I was trying to point out to chokky (who, incidentally enough, was the one who produced the statistic).<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>As for my taking scientists as gods. Well, I've never worshipped any scientist before, so I don't really understand what you mean by that.<br><br>"If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself." (Galatians 6:3)<br><br>Your last point is that the Roman Catholics altered the Church's beliefs. That is an interesting point that I'm sure every Catholic holds against Protestants. The Catholics see themselves as mainstream, while the Protestants also see themselves as mainstream. The two-china syndrome, perhaps? What's even more curious is that both claim that their scriptures are divinely-inspired.<br><br>Which brings us to another matter.<br><br>If, by your argument, we must (necessarily) break down the 2 billion figure, the Roman Catholics would still come out tops at having a fellowship of about 1,043,000,000.<br><br>Now, going by chokky's line of thought, a majority would naturally mean that whatever the majority is following is the truth. So do you agree with him now?<br><br>[This message has been edited by yidd (edited 26 February 2002).]</div>

In another way you are rest assured and feel safe by looking at the number of believers - the more believers, the more safer you feel.<br><br>However, In one of the account of Noah in Genesis, his family was the only one who stayed with God while the rest of the world at his time strayed from God. Noah's faith for God did not die just because his family was the only one in the whole world who trust God.<br>Which I think is one reason why only Noah's family was the only family saved by God from the great flood.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 26 February 2002).]</div>

That's why I always try to keep an open view when it comes to different religions (except cults). I just cant stop posting when I see people insulting God and the Church.<br><br>by the way, what is chokky trying to say here? In the other posts that he posted, I think he posted against God. or did i see wrongly??<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 26 February 2002).]</div>

Again this figure is not meaningful if you consider Shinto and other Chinese religions that have Buddhist elements as not mainstream.<br><br>By the way, your earlier definition of "begotten" is wrong.

            <div class='col-md body'>aiya, all of you should take a breather from the normal run-of-the-mill religions and look at alternative ones. how about worshipping Chu Mei-Feng for example?<br>It has been well documented, and recently well publicised that many leaders from Christianity and Buddhism(in Europe and Thailand) have been secretly having trysts or been having relationships that they aren't supposed to have. You know, priests are supposed to have a better understanding of religion than commoners like me, although I must say that i have a reasonable knowledge of the holy bible. Maybe when you reach THAT stage of faith, then you realise what it is all about and decide to, uh, forge new relationships?</div>
