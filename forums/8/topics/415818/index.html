              <p>Why is there little development in Sembawang? The only development I see is the building of park connecters. Other towns has big shopping malls, large transport hubs and sport complex.  Sembawang has no expressway connecting to it, a very very small bus interchange and also a very small shoping mall. (The other shopping is also small and very "ulu".) And if you want to go swimming, you have to go to either Yishun or Woodlands. And the nearest expressway is at Woodlands (which is far). You might say Sembawang is a new town. What about Sengkang?   they are building new HDB flats, new hospital. And has a big bus interchange, have LRTs and connected to expressways. Even punggol has a bigger bus interchange and connected to expressways. Being taxpayer, I would to have what offered in other new towns.</p>

              <p>Er wait? This kind of thing very hard to say one, maybe top housing agents or some rich land prospect companies can tell you.</p>
              <p>Eg i'm living in serangoon, super lousy interchange. Then 7 years back NEL started running, then circle line. Plus now got a damn big mall across the road now nEx or something.</p>
              <p>Anyway can track here, http://www.ura.gov.sg/student/planning_areas/sembawang.htm, and i'm sure the people at speakers corner got some stuff to say too. cheers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway i think punggol is able to get all the 'nice' stuff is because they are just recently established few(?) years back, while places like yishun semb admiralty, quite old le.</p>

              <p><br>Why do you need to go public swimming pool and swim and get yourself infected with all sort of diseases?</p>
