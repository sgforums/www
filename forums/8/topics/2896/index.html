            <div class='col-md body'>Yah, i saw it too. I stayed ard Orchard until 4plus, those foreign workers( dunno from india or blangadesh or some other country) were walking up and down the street.<br>The street  wasn't very crowded then but they still keep pushing ard like what forever had said. I saw walking behind them when i saw one of them bumping into a lady. He bump his arm against the lady's chest. Its quite clear from the way he bump into that lady that he did it on purpose however there is still the element of doubt so i was like 20% thinking its an accident and 80% thinking he did it on purpose. But thats not all, he repeated the same act on a girl walking behind the lady( i think the lady is the girl's mother, i think it was a family outing). By then it was very clear that its not an accident. The girl exclaimed aloud that its not an accident. The girl and the lady were obviuosly offended but sad to say, no one did anything to help the girl.( juz wondering is Singaporeans too passive?) My frens and i were pissed off, but we didn't do anything. Should we have interfered?<br><br>Well i was very disappointed by the way things was carried out. It was too crowded, yah juz look at taka, it was obvious that the place was exploding with ppl. There isn't any space to move at all. I'm not surprised that someone actually fainted. I felt very sorry for that girl mentioned by forever. Things are very different in other countries. Last yr i spent my christmas in S.Korea. The security was definitely much better. Places where ppl can receive medical treatment can be found at regular intervals. Ppl there are allowed to have as much fun as they want but at the same time no one is allowed to break the law or carry out an indecent act. Sick ppl can received medical attention immediately. Yah we have police walking ard to maintain order, but juz look at them. They look more like a group of ill-organised ..... who looks so blur. Are they volunteers who are not properly trained. And yah there were too few of them too and they dunno when to intervene and when not too. In korea, police are stationed at every 20 metres or so. They positioned themselves inconspicuously, so that ppl will not be intimidated by their presence and at the same time allowed them to make sure that nothing goes wrong. There were regular patrols too. Yah, they were better trained too. Well u might think that this might be very anti-climax( thats what i thought too at the beginning), but the atmosphere there is definitely much better. U can really feel the festive mood there. Ppl, esp the girls, can party as much as they want without having<br>to worry abt their safety. Well, the way celebrations in singapore is really below par, maybe organisers have their difficulties<br>but its really below par<br><br>Mind<br>sorry abt the length.....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mind... a part of the police are VSCs and they undergo training too... their job is mainly to show police presence and prevent fights and stuffs. U cant expect them to keep a lookout for ppl bumping into other ppl's chest... moreover running up and down the streets is not illegal... wad can they do to those ppl? It's hard for police to ensure law and order on such celebrations... as even the crowd is not cooperative.. if the crowd can be more organised... i think such incidents won't happen too. There are too few police doing patrol... but what to do? I guess they also wish to celebrate christmas as much as u do... rather than volunteering themselves on a eve of christmas.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah its really crowded over there. I saw quite a no of families out there. Christmas... its suppose to be a happy occasion esp for the children. But none of the children i saw there was smiling. They were looking so solemn and to a certain extent frightened. Yah they were holding very tightly to their parents. I think they are intimidated by the huge crowd. Yah the parents are also holding onto their children tightly too, so crowded, very easy for the children to get lost. Give the lack of police there, no help or info counter.... Once the children get lost, thats it. It will be hard for the parents to find the children. Think of the trauma they, esp the children will be going thru.....sigh... Yah the children are all so small size, its very easy for them to be trampled upon... dangerous....<br><br>Mind</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ay people can u all like stop being a bunch of racist. Actually u cant blame the foreign workers(Thai, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Sri Lankan, Indonesian, etc...) because they didnt start the "mayhem". Want to blame someone, blame the ah-bengs, ah-lians and the malay mats. I was there the whole time, and I felt that they were the one that started all this. The whistling, the moshing, the body surfing, the climbing on anything that they can climb on, etc.. All the pushing and shoving started when there was like this "human train" going on. Everyone joined in and it got out of hand. But wait a min, we also have ourselves to blame. Y were we there in the first place?<br>Well its quite sad to see many girls being molested and stuffs. I guess many guys enjoyed themselves though. I really pitied the families with small children. Most them were there to check out the lights, shows, etc and rite after the show at Taka ended, chaos reign! Sad case man. Just hope such things dont occur again and I wonder y arnt there any newspaper reports on it.<br>Anyway to make things clear, I was with a video camera and not film camera.<br><br>Peace,<br>SpookyKid<br><br>I look at this world and see no understanding</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey ForeVer, I don't know if u can still remember how that guy (who was cupping his gf frm behind to prevent her from being 'cupped') looked. But that's what my friend did to prevent any 'harm' to come to his gf. I was standing quite close by. But it was total chaos with those bloody indians and blangas pushing and shoving, i'd doubt u remember how that guy looks. There was a gal wearing black standing beside me and cursing with me too. I dunno if that is u foreVer...<br><br>I was really fustrated. It was the worst christmas i've ever spent. It's like saying 'Fuck lah... Merry Christmas. Fuck man! Stop pushing! Merry Chirstmas.' Sigh, Christmas is supposed to spread<br>goodwill and here we are, 'Fuck man! Merry Christmas! Na beh Chee By! Merry Christmas...'<br><br>The 1st swearing Chirstmas in human histroy!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ya, I was there, and it was like "oi, xiao ay! mai tu leh." but i guess the foreign workers are a big bunch of people all of us should be wary of. They hang around in big groups, go for some cheap trill, touch here touch there, and stayed the whole nite at Orchard to catch bus and mrt first thing in the morning.<br>it sucks. "torn night" is never the same with these people around.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi...I was also down at Orchard Rd on Christmas eve..I must admit it was very croweded..and people spilled over onto the roads...one of the driving lanes was taken over by humans...but it's something that should be expected...It's Christmas...and how many places can people go??? Everyone will just flood to Orchard to get a feel of the festive mood...and the crowd makes up part of the mood...guess those who want to go there should be prepared...and girls should just be more careful...I was part of the human crowd and I walked behind my bf to protect myself...maybe we can keep all these in mind when we go for any millennium celebrations....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry I wasn't there but I kind of had the feeling that it was like this over at Orchard...But on Xmas, shouldn't people be homw with their families in the first place???  For those poor grls who got molested....Uh...sorry to hear it...really, but it's to be expected at street parties or a lot of parties of any type...It's sad and shouldn't be tolerated, but it happens and saying that it shouldn't and pushing blame to people doesn't really do anything but make us feel better...<br><br>I feel that this Xmas is really chaotic...wherever in my whole life have I ever heard of or seen such a Xhristmas....I have a feeling that it is a prelude and pre-excitement to the millenium as it is being touted up big-time by the media and everyone else....Xmas this year is basically just a stepping stone for Jan 2000...while I distinctly remeber that Xmas in previous years were about itself...it was self-contaiend and didn't really have that pre-new year anxiety/anxiousness/excitement...<br><br>Anyway, that is my last 5$ worth of words...sorry to everyone who got molested and had a bad family outing that day....but just a word to everybody here:<br><br>Expect that Dec 31 will be hell...expect to be molested and groped and tossed around...be careful and have someone around you trust to protect you...I was just thinking about it yesterday...500,000 people all in one area...and so many things can happen to grls or guys...just be careful...It won't be such a fantastic moment...you will find that you are more pissed off on that day than you are excited for the new year 2000....<br>sorryt o be the wet blanket, but bettre to warn people who are naive than to not warn them....so heed the warning and be careful once again.....but of course enjoy urself as much as the crowd will allow you to...and believe me it will be difficult to have fun with 500,000 people crushing you...:-)<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 26-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha, shucks... and I went home 10.10 on train that night.<br><br>now I'm stuck with the curiosity "if i was there"<br><br>is it that bad? so no space wan meh? then come down to KL ler!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> plenty of space... and I don't think people here celebrate with so much cussing, not any at all actually...<br><br>What I've noticed when I was down is sg was that, so many girls were having thick makeup , bad ler of course, what happen to natural beauty anyway. And most of them dressed up (not that I have a problem) but some of them wearing what seem to me like erm, clothes more fitting for prom nights or something, but that was just 2 girls, better not sound like generalizing. One girl that really caught my eye was the girl working at house of condoms. but thats it i guess.<br><br>Althou I never spent my nights there at happening places, meaning I was only around orchard etc morning to evening, so I guess I didnt see much, I mean, I didn't see as much ahbengs as I expected altho I did see a handful. BUT I did see a lot of lians :p<br><br>Anyway my trip was really tiring, so much walking and got lost so many times (the last time I was in sg was 3 years ago) but I survived anyway. Better drive down the next time...<br><br>I must say that, the road layout in singapore is really good, mostly straight roads... flat and no potholes too! and the mrt is swell.</div>

Y were we there in the first place?<br>doesnt make sense right?<br>no ones there... who'll be watching the damn SHOW?!<br>Orchard Rd has always been the busiest area.<br>where else can u find the christmas lights?<br><br>haha jeff my friend saw it, i always have the tendency not to see such 'happening' scenes.<br>anyway, its just a case of one-thing-leads to-another, no one ask for all those nonsense, things just happen.<br><br>*sigh*<br>dont wanna look @ this thread anymore<br><br>k now happy millenium<br>u guys all take care<br><br>------------------<br>Death is Forever<br>I am Dead<br>therefore, i am Forever</div>
