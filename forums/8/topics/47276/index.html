            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>You are Wolverine!<br><br>Name: Logan<br><br>POB: Canada<br><br>Mutant Power: A healing factor which rapidly heals most garden variety wounds and slows his ageing. Logan also has three claws protruding from each hand, these claws are part of his skeletal strucure and were coated with Adamantium during his abduction by the Weapon X Project. Wolverine also has enhanced senses of smell and hearing.<br><br>Breif Bio: Logan's past is twisted and detailed. He has been an operative for the CIA, a samurai in Japan and fought in many wars. Sometime before he joined the X-MEN he was abducted into the Weapon X Project, a secretive branch of the Canadian Government that experimented on mutants with the aim of producing super soldiers. They laced Logan's bones [including his claws] with an alloy known as Adamantium, the strongest metal known to man.<br><br>Since joining the X-MEN, Logan has ruffled the feathers of many of his teammates, most noteably Cyclops and Angel. Wolverine and Jean Grey [Cyclops' wife] have some kind of unspoken love thing going on, which causes further tension between Logan and Cyclops.<br><br>Wacky Plotline: Wolverine once had his adamantium ripped out by the villain Magneto, he barely survived and started reverting to a more beastial state. Then along came Genesis [that's Cable's evil son, not the band] who tried to give Wolverine back his metal so he could serve as a horseman to Genesis' master Apocalypse. Unfortunately, the process was interupted and instead of having his Adamantium returned Wolverine turned into a beastlike creature with no nose and shitloads of hair.<br><br>Wolverine slowly reverted back to his human form over a couple of months, after which Apocalypse kidnapped him, returned his adamantium, brainwashed him and sent him to fight the X-MEN as his horseman of death, of course with the help of his teammates he broke free of Apocalypse' brainwashing.<br><br>other characters you could have been:<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are Cyclops!<br><br>Name: Scott Summers<br><br>POB: USA<br><br>Mutant Power: Scott Summers is cursed with powerful Optic blasts of kinetic energy that fire every time he opens his eyes. He must wear a ruby quartz visor to control them.<br><br>Brief Bio: Longtime leader of the X-MEN, husband to Jean Grey, brother to Havok. Scott Summers is all these things. Cyclops is a natural leader, but lacks social skills. The first mutant to be trained by Professor X, Cyclops has had more than his share of trials and tribulations.<br><br>His life is one of the wackiest plotlines in X-MEN history, so i'll just move on.<br><br>Wacky Plot line: Cyclops dug Jean as soon as he saw her, but it took time for him to build up the courage to approach her, he eventually did and they became and item, but then on a return trip from the moon, the interstellar entity known as the Phoenix took Jean's place [unbenowst to her teammates] and put Jean in suspended animation under the sea. The Phoenix masqueraded as Jean for a while, but ended up committing suicide on the moon.<br><br>Then a clone of Jean [created by Sinister] turned up calling herself Madelyne Pryor, Scott fell for her and they had a baby [Nathan Christopher Summers, Cable]. Then the original Jean returned and Scott got back with her. This drove Madlyne Pryor insane, she developed godlike powers, tried to take over the world and was eventually killed by Jean [nasty!]. It gets better:<br><br>Scott's son was infected with a techno-organic virus, so they sent him into the future to be cured, which was, unfortunately a living hell thanks to Apocalypse. Scott's kid was adopted by the Askani sisterhood who brought Jean and Scott into the future to raise him [in some other people's bodies]. Nathan Summers grew up to become Cable and traveled back in time again to kill Apocalypse before he controlled the earth, meeting his dad who is actually much younger than him in this time.<br><br>Recently, during an extremely convoluted plotline, Cyclops ended up being merged with Apocalypse whilst thwarting his attempt to obtain godlike powers. Eventually, as they always do, Cyclops fought off Apocalypse' control and rejoined the X-MEN.
