            <div class='col-md body'>Hail the second class citizen..<br><br>As one who has done my duty as key personnel in active NS and after ORD for another 15 years, we are nothing more than a second class citizen in our own country..<br><br>Laws here favour the white man foreigner..<br><br>When white man knocks down a local in a car accident, he gets off with a fine that he can easily pay off.. Remember the french bank manager who ran down the young cyclist who saved up for many months to buy a hand massager for his mother who was suffering from arthritis? The bank manager(a FT), who was DRUNK while driving, got off with a $25,000 fine, suspension of driving licence and no jail.. if the reverse happened, the local would be banned from driving, fined and jailed..<br><br>If a white man is charged with drugs posession, the government will lower the pure content to below the death sentence, jail the person for one year, so as not to offend the westerners who don't have death penalty.. if the offender is a local or from a poor country such as bangladesh, sure hang..<br><br>Recently, reuters reported government will allow foreigners to demonstrate during the world bank meeting next year, people who support questionable causes like PETA.. but locals with genuine grievances like high costs of living and high unemployment cannot protest, will be tortured by ISD or jailed a lifetime like sentosa chia, or sent to IMH like the Boon Suan Ban fella who wanted to claim back the $1.3 million that he said the CJ owed him.. The guy was sent to IMH! Not seow also treated as seow!<br><br>The government heavily tax locals through the high costs of HDB.. Most bought the 4-room flat for almost $200,000, when it costs less than $40,000 to the government, based on the costs of developer's bid plus 50% divided by number of units.. the government then builds all these fancy buildings to attract foreign investment, give them tax breaks and ready pool of guinea pig human test subjects for foreign biomedical MNC..<br><br>The government invests in billions of dollars overseas, and in white elephant projects like the esplanad but cannot use the INTEREST on the reserves to help the locals..<br><br>Everyday there is an average of one jump suicide, according to a friend of mine whose sister is in charge of the news hotline.. How about those who swallow tablets, cut wrist, hang etc etc.. The newspapers remained silent because they are all government controlled and they are afraid to show the real picture.. Mediacorpse only shows sharon au acting stupid and Mark lee as Ah beng, but beneath all this lies the inconcealable truth, that all is not well in singapore..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The govt says 'we do not want to promote a gay lifestyle.' They say it's 'unnatural' or "we are an asian society and are very conservative".. "We should uphold certain morals or asian values". Gays are now targetted and blamed for the risen AIDs cases..<br><br>On the other hand, the govt is mulling buliding a casino.. They no longer use excuses like 'we are an asian society and have to uphold certain asian values' or 'we are asians and we are a conservative lot'..<br><br>It seems to me that the two issues - gays and casino - run along similar principles.. That (according to the govt) we should not promote 'undesirable behaviour'.<br><br>Yet, the govt has adopted one standard for the gay community and another for the debate on the casino..<br><br>If a gay lifestyle is 'undesirable', then I am sure many singaporeans will also agree that a gambling or gambler's lifestyle is just as undesirable..<br><br>But of course the thing which makes all the difference to the govt is : MONEY!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with the gay issues being dealt here locally.<br><br>In my opinion, gays are not to be judged by the way they are although literally their behaviour is unnatural and undesirable.<br><br>However, one should also not look at them in a light where by they're the ones to be discriminated or detested, or the ones that REALLY need "help".<br><br>Think about this, there're 1001 reasons why many gays become the way they are - gays. And every gays have their sad or abnormal beginnings. Some may be abused, tortured, or hurt in many ways. I'm not siding with the gays either.<br><br>In fact, they are people who long for acceptance and love in this world by people around them. The reason they refuse to change is also partly because how society treats them and looks at them.<br><br>In life, we either love &amp; accept a person that causes him to change; OR, we condemn them that leads them to a road of dead ends.<br><br>That's all I have to say for now.<br><br>S.H.I.N.<br></div>
