I rather be a simple person. Try doing this on TV and to all her friends and see where she ends up ulimately. She's just relying on her strength of her friends and her fans to continue such bullshit. If she starts "being herself" to everyone including her friends let's see how long she can be herself. Nobody can be themself truely in this world pal. U either must be a reckless young punk who thinks you are forever young and powerful or an attention-seeker by being "yourself".It's easy to be "someone" else on the net rather than being herself. And because of her arrogance, she is hated. I repeat again no matter how intelligent you are, u r still like everyone else - a human.</div>

She did not do all these to go on tv. she did not expect to appear on newspapers or magazine. Her diary got torn by her ex bf(i think) and she just wanted another outlet to write her journal. is that too much to ask for?<br><br>If she wanted to be someone else, she can play a sweet, demure gal, every guys dream, yet she chose to be herself, discussing sexuality, blatant b!tching and the such.<br><br>Xiaxue is very well known, all her friends know who she is. Assuming she is a totally different person in the blog and in person, don't you think her friends would realise that? Xiaxue is a pen name, but she proudly displays her real name and picture on the internet. Would you like to do the same? I'm of course assuming that your real name is not FartSniffer... Now who is the one trying to be someone else on the net?<br><br>Her writing skills are not the best, but it is one of the best. I enjoy reading essays written by ppl who have a different point of view, preferbly in good english, not because i'm a bigot, but because good english gets the point across. It also helps if the content is interesting.<br><br>An irony that stands out in this conversation, you are manifesting your arrogant side by judging her, are you not? so do you hate yourself?</div>
