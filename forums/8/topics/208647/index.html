            <div class='col-md body'>This story goes like this:<br><br>G starts work in AXC company. She is to take over the duties of C, who resigns quite hastily. She only has a day to handover things to G. The boss (an ang moh) is mostly overseas. The sales manager teaches G some things but it is mostly G who learns most things by herself as ahe is mostly alone there. Within 2 weeks she had picked up most things.<br><br>However the boss seems to be very favourable of C who has left and during a speaker phone conversation with the manager he seemed to  make unfair comparisons between G and C.<br><br>Unknown to him who thinks C has done a excellent job til she left, her work was all good on the outside but rubbish on the inside. G found that she had made so many silly mistakes: missing documents, double/triple filing, never update on latest reports (which is very important), and many more.<br><br>Resign or stay or <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By saying "unknown to him" you are already implying that the boss doesn't really know what had been going on, so he made those comments based on ignorance rather than personal favouritism. So G can just submit a report pointing out previous faults and solutions, and see what the boss says or does. If he's still unappreciative then reflect to higher level or just quit.</div>

Quite ok, but the pay increment after 3 months probation should be quite good..but if the boss continue to think this way of G, i dun think she will get that good increment. However, C who had done rubbish had a super super high increment (this is told by the manager) as the boss thought her work is perfect</div>
