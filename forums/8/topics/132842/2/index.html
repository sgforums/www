            <div class='col-md body'>Think he should stop doing music for  those trash like Lord of the Rings and ancient epic history  or arthouse movies and do more futuristic commercial "sell hotcakes" like  his music  in the 90s..the type which has a lot of computer sound and effect can dance in discotheques and pubs.but the joker had gone off track now doing things like stage musical and historic  movies...<br><br>I Remmeber the 90s soundtracks of his Love birds, Jeans, Kabhi na Khabi, Daud all had millenium feel.<br>the one called Kabhi na Khabi had one song which is very advanced future feel...cant remember but the sound really funky and futuristic ..best was Daud - 100% Futuristic. Bac then when u enter a Indian pub and u hear a fast Indian  song playing with fantastic sound effects, 99.9% it is a Rahman song.<br><br>He had spend too musch time in western territory trying o impress the british classical music scene<br><br>I think its time he started bucking up as "rahman imitators" all over the country India had spung up and their composing styles have a uncanny resemblance to him. They are following the trend he started int he 90s and filling the "void" absence  left by him after 2000...The music industry in India is becoming increasingly competitive and the threat of MP3s. In some interview i read, he said the 90s brand of music he made is superficial, easy for him to do and now he had evolved to "greater things"&gt; seriously he should stop talking about such spiritualistic views and give what the audience wants- His good old trademark techno and pop scene in which he started giving hit after hit sellout soundtracks . <strong>I guess all the ARR music lovers out there dont expect the humps and bells whistles of the 90s now, He has long been done over with it though he says he will still do commercial stuff in the future</strong> b His recent releases didnt make the mark as they were all classical or historic stuff:<br><br>Warriors of Heave                     (Chinese motion picture)<br>Bombay Dreams for Andrew loyd webber                       (Western Musical)<br>Swades (Hindi Bollywood)<br>Kisna the Warrior Poet              (Hindi Bollywood)<br>Bose - the forgotten hero          (Hindi Bollywood)<br>The Rising                                  (Hindi Bollywood)<br><br>Event though they had that trademark "3d sound effect feel",  The prob is the Indian audience is not very appreactive of his "new style" which only gains recognition in the international scene, not in India, Singapore and Malaysia where 90% of all modern Indian music lover grew up  in  the ARR 90s music..Wrong time for him to make a "switch"..So far the only one looking forward to is Lord of the Rings. He hasnt attempted any Irish or scottish middle earth music yet, just bits and pieces here and there in his past songs</div>
