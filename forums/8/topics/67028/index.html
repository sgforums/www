            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;After 21 years of marriage, I discovered a new way of keeping<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;alive the spark of love. A little while ago I had started to go<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;out with another woman. It was really my wife's idea.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"I know that you love her," she said one day, taking me by<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;surprise.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"But I love YOU," I protested.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"I know, but you also love her."<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The other woman that my wife wanted me to visit was my mother,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;who has been a widow for 19 years, but the demands of my work<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and my three children had made it possible to visit her only<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;occasionally. That night I called to invite her to go out for<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;dinner and a movie.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"What's wrong, are you well?" she asked. My mother is the type<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of woman who suspects that a late night call or a surprise<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;invitation is a sign of bad news.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"I thought that it would be pleasant to pass some time with<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you," I responded. " Just the two of us."<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;She thought about it for a moment then said "I would like that<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;very much."<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That Friday after work, as I drove over to pick her up I was a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bit nervous. When I arrived at her house, I noticed that she,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;too, seemed to be nervous about our date. She waited in the door<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with her coat on. She had curled her hair and was wearing the<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;dress that she had worn to celebrate her last wedding<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anniversary. She smiled from a face that was as radiant as an<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;angel's.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"I told my friends that I was going to go out with my son, and<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they were impressed," she said, as she got into the car. "They<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;can't wait to hear about our meeting".<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We went to a restaurant that, although not elegant, was very<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;nice and cozy. my mother took my arm as if she were the First<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lady.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;After we sat down, I had to read the menu to her. Her eyes could<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;only read large print. Half way through the entree, I lifted my<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;eyes and saw Mom sitting there staring at me.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A nostalgic smile was on her lips. "It was I who used to have to<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;read the menu when you were small," she said.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"Then it's time for you to relax and let me return the favor," I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;responded.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;During the dinner we had an agreeable conversation, nothing<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;extraordinary but catching up on recent events of each others<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;lives. We talked so much that we missed the movie.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As we arrived at her house later, she said "I'll go out with you<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;again, but only if you let me invite you". I agreed.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"How was your dinner date?" asked my wife when I got home. "Very<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;nice. Much more so than I could have imagined," I answered.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A few days later my mother died of a massive heart attack. It<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;happened so suddenly that I didn't have a chance to do anything<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for her.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Some time later I received an envelope with a copy of a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;restaurant receipt from the same place mother and I had dined.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;An attached note said: "I paid this bill in advance. I was<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;almost sure that I couldn't be there but, nevertheless, I paid<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for two plates - one for you and the other for your wife. You<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will never know what that night meant to me. I love you."<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;At that moment I understood the importance of saying, in time:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"I LOVE YOU" and giving our loved ones the time that they<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;deserve. Nothing in life is more important than God and your<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;family and friends. Give them the time they deserve, because<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;these things cannot be put off  'til "some other time". Someone<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;once said "I've learned that, regardless of your relationship<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with your parents, you'll miss them when they're gone from your<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;life. I think this is true with your in-laws, grandchildren,<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sisters, brothers and your friends. Anyone that means something<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to you - you should spend time with them and let them know how<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;much they mean to you as often as you can</div>
