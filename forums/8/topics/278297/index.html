We make a reasonable and responsible effort to communicate the cost and frequency of our messages to prospective clients.  As a commercial enterprise we have to assume that a consumer that requests our product does so only after making a reasonable effort to understand the nature and cost of our product.  This is one of the responsibilities a consumer is entrusted with. Nevertheless, and as a safeguard, the welcome message we sent to the phone repeats this information. It informs a new client that they have entered into a subscription arrangement, and it details the costs involved. The instructions for leaving the service are clearly stated, as is our web site address where all essential information can be found - such as contact information for our customer service department.<br><br>Our records, which can be confirmed by your mobile service provider, show that our welcome message was delivered to your phone immediately after you sent us the subscription request.

It cost $3 a ringtone. After that they repeated sending me the same messages every week. I did not know that they will continue to charge me even if I never download anything from the message. As such, I simply deleted the messages from my handphone.<br><br>I received my starhub bill on 5th september 2007 in which they charged me $30 for 10 sms that they send to me from the period of 9th august till 5th september. Only than did I know that I was being charged $3 per sms irregardless of whether I got downgrade anything from the sms. I immediately send them a sms to request to terminate the service.<br><br>I called starhub immediately and they gave me this number 68364430 to call to talk to the MW mobile services.<br><br>I tried calling them but nobody answered and so I went to starhub today to enquire about this matter. They tried to contact MW mobile services too but nobody answered the call. Starhub told me they will handle this matter and will get back to me but have not done so.<br><br>I called MW mobile services again and this time they answered, but they did not want to do anything about it. They say that the service has been terminated on 5th september but I must pay the $30 and ask me to call this number 8001011971 saying that this is the number which I should call if I want to request for a waiver of charges. When I called this number, they told me to email info@celdorado.com to request for a waiver of charges.<br><br>I did as I was told and send them a email. I received a auto reply saying that they will contact me within 24 hours of receiving the email. After that I called 8001011971 again after about 12 hours later when they did not reply me. They told me to call another number 8001011650 to enquire about this matter. I called this new number and he told me that he will look at my email and contact me again within today but he did not do so.<br><br>As such, I feel that they are simply pushing the responsibility away and wanting me to pay for the $30 which I never download anything.<br><br>I will like to request for your help in settling this issue.<br><br>Kindly feel free to contact me at 9-------.<br><br>Thank you.<br></div>
