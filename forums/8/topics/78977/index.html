Some felt it more than others...some don't even feel it until the later stage in their lives. Think about it, life is fair...and every bitterness will only make you stronger and able to cope better with your future lives. Eventually, when you finally felt the bitterest of the bitterness...you will no longer feel it anymore. You will feel so lost and empty in your heart, no happiness, no sadness and no love.<br><br>Then you will start to feel strong about yourself and regain your  confidence about life and the people around you including those who once tried so hard to make your life miserable...that you will no longer need to feel insecure and fear about anything...even death.<br><br>That's when you will really treasure life itself and realised how short life has left its time for you.<br><br>Do not feel bitter about not being able to gain the love of the girl you like. Instead, let her know that you once loved her...go and let  her know if you still love her. You got nothing to lose anyway...remember, you only live once. Who is the loser if one of you dies tomorrow?<br><br>Do not put too much attention to the people around you and how they behave. There is simply no way that you can control them. Think...people has their own troubles and worries and characters, perhaps you caught them when they are having a bad day? Instead, put more attention to how you behave to others and yourself and be honest about it.<br><br>Take my advice, the way to let other people make you feel happy is to feel happy about yourself first...then others will slowly get influence by your happiness and affect you with their happiness.<br><br>"Be yourself, cos whatever happens...nobody can take that away from you." <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

They dare not take responsibility for their own failures, examine why they're not performing as well as others, and improve themselves.  Let's take all your examples.<br><br>When you say you underachieve, that obviously means u know you're capable of much better.  Then all the more u should put in more effort, work hard, work smart.  When you're passed over for promotions, sit down and honestly examine the reasons why, and not blame others for not giving u chances.  Perhaps your colleague is able to maximise efficiency and conribute value-added work.  Perhaps you're passed over because u dun display the right employee attitude and hence not performing optimally.<br><br>When u say people dun give u enough recognition, perhaps you're expecting too much reaction from a small effort.  Perhaps you're not give enuff contribution to warrant the great amount of recognition you're expecting.  And perhaps you're contibuting a lot, but you're also giving even more negative contibution.<br><br>But then again, there are indeed somethings that are out of your control, where good effort and attitude may not necessarily mean success.  One best example is the area of love and relationships.  Although most of time a person with a good attitude and character who puts in effort usually gets his/her desired partner, but there's is a unnervingly large minority of cases where the results point the other way.  But pls do not lose heart.  My advice is very cliche, you've probably heard it a thousand times, but still it's the old advice that works: dun give up hope, cuz when u fall down and u dun try anymore the chances of success is definitely ZERO.  get up after u fall down, stand and fight again, despite the odds, despite the pain, at least u know there is still a chance to win!<br><br>Finally the last thing u mentioned.  True, sometimes we're put a much more disadvantaged starting point when we're born in modest families, and u see your friends living in large 3 storey bungalows with attached swimming pools and basketball courts.  It's perfectly understandable that you're not happy with this.  People often console themselves by saying the poorer are happier, but that's not necessarily true.  You can complain when you're a child when your classmate goes to america and europe for holidays but your parents only bring u to JB and batam.  But when u grow up you shouldn't complain anymore, cuz when you're older you now have the ability to improve yourself and carve out your own future.  You should constantly seek to become better, and set targets to surpass.  Do not blame anyone if u don't perform well enough eventually and when you're 40+ yrs old, your own children start to wonder why their classmates' daddies are so much richer than their own daddy.  Go borrow more books to read today.  Go attend some upgrading courses.  Think smart and above others.  Give 100% when others are only giving 80%, and then give 120% when the others are giving 100%.  Life will be very busy and hard when you're young, but that's the only time u have to push yourself to achieve.<br><br>Just remember this:  You're responsible for your own tomorrow.  Have the guts to work for it.</div>
