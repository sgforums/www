            <div class='col-md body'>As a Liverpool fan, this fact doesn't bother me much, much to some people's utter disappointment. To break down and cry, or jump down the Westin, if that's what you were waiting for, sorry for the disappointment. Liverpool fans possess this things called brains and rationality. I mean, even as a Liverpool fan, I didn't expect Liverpool to do this well from the early part of the season. With a freshly assembled team, 4th is a good position to be in already. A champion's league position, well, that would be a bonus, but since that is not possible this year, we will just have to wait next year. European qualification is already a very good result already. The baby has learnt to walk before he has learnt to crawl, can't really be disappointed if he can't fly as yet right. At least Liverpool's performance this year had sent out a stinging signal to everyone else, Liverpool is the team to watch out for next season.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't fret... after all Liverpool has surpassed many people's expectations this season. Not many would have expected a team with so many new players in the line-up to have done so well. Kudos to Houllier.<br><br>Also.. the once leaky defence, famous for it's many blundering errors have been transformed to become the league's tightest defence! Applause...<br><br>I'm sure next season will definately be an exciting one, with arsenal and liverpool challenging for the league title, while Man U will be faltering behind maybe not even in the top 3, I mean... their luck have to run out soon right?

A team of "mediocre players" having been able to win 6 EPL titles out of the last 8 years is indeed "lucky', at least in the Liverpool fans' eyes. To me, Liverpool is the most successful English team, based on histories, but the last decade belongs to Manchester United, so, please give them credit due to them. Next season may be a different story, who knows, but let Man Utd fans enjoy this moment, and stop putting us down.

Just like some team was banking on a second European championship in a row, but what happened? Maybe it is a different level of game altogether, but you do get my point. As a fan, I am already very pleased that Liverpool will be one of the English representatives in Europe next year. After Houllier's summer shopping (very hot on the heels of Karembeau at present) Liverpool will definitely launch a serious attack on Manchester United next year, with the likes of Leeds and Arsenel. The dip will definitely arrive someday, Liverpool used to be the supremo, and now is the revamped team, who knows what will happen to Manchester United (especially after Ferguson retires after next season). So advice, ManU fans, enjoy while it lasts, relish the thought of being champions, when they are finally down, don't be fickle and switch allegiance to other clubs.<br><br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the match I saw yesterday was dubbed 'terrifying' by my cousins.. the fans of Bradford..made them touched.. especially the part where they ran out of the field in Valley Parade even when the final whistle was blown..shows the spirit of the fans of Bradford..<br><br>but wat I cant stand is how Houllier boasted about his 50 million pounds strike force..but seeemed that in the past 5 matches..they din score any goals yet..even with his 4 best strikers on the field..Heskey, Owen, Fowler,Camara..none of them managed to net in a goal..<br><br>I begin to doubt his 11 million pound striker Heskey whether is he worth that amount or not..<br><br>anyway.. my heartiest congrats to Bradford City to still stay in top flight and Wimbledon to be relegated. lets hope Bradford City play as well as they did against Liverpool in their last match of the English Premier League..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> FnU  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>------------------<br>Magic -- Ekin</div>
