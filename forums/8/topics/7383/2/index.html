When Blackburn won the team, there are so many people wearing their jerseys, like wise for Leeds or the Kevin Keegan era of Newcastle. When Everton and Liverpool dominated in the 70s and 80s, many fans had switched to support them. Of course, most had remained loyal, but there may be a significant number of "fans" switching allegiance when they are in a slump in the last decade. Likewise, I had supported Man Utd since 1990 or so, I may not be a die-hard fan, but most of us do not put down other teams unless provoked. Do not judge all of us as glory hunters, as u'll never knows what will happen in the future.

You wouldn't be surprised if you had seen who the starting line-up was. Seaman, Adams, Petit, Bergkamp, Vieira, Henry were all rested (gosh!!!) and introduced to the starting line-up were the likes of youngsters Rhys Weston, Ashley Cole, and first-team unfamiliars Vernazza, Malz and the long-forgotten Davor Suker. Therefore, this team is really an experimental side, with Wenger not wanting to risk any injuries for the Euro trip to Denmark. With the second spot sealed and no other motivations to work towards, I guess it is totally expected. Don't you agree?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But one thing, with the likes of Winterburn, Keown, Adams, Dixon, and even Bergkamp aging, new blood is required to maintain Arsenel as a force to reckon.<br><br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TNP, 15may..a certain Mr. Edwin has this to say...<br><br>[quote] <strong>I HATE to kick a man when he's down. But in Liverpool's case, I'll make an exception.<br><br>Just let me repeat the scoreline from its final league game of the season: Bradford 1 Liverpool 0.<br><br>No top-three finish in the English Premiership, no Champions League place next season and no Liverpudlians thumping their chests to claim how Liverpool has once more returned to greatness.<br><br>Frankly, they could have saved themselves a lot of grief if they had read my articles over the past few months.<br><br>A couple of months ago, after Liverpool had beaten Newcastle 2-1, I said its then second position had more to do with luck than strength, and that all Liverpool deserved was a trip to the Uefa Cup.<br><br>After watching Bradford beat Liverpool last night, I've got only one thing to say. Damn, I'm good.<br><br>Liverpudlians hated me because they thought I was just talking out of my hatred for Liverpool, not realising that I had seen the signs of Pool's decline even then, and understood its success was built on shaky ground.<br><br>Don't believe me, believe the facts. While Manchester United talked about getting its 100th league goal of the season (which it didn't, thank goodness, otherwise we'd never have heard the end of it), Liverpool scored barely half that, 51.<br><br>Of the top 10 teams, only Aston Villa has scored fewer goals. But then again, Villa doesn't boast of a Â£50 million ($130 million) strikeforce. Pool does. That's almost Â£1 milli on for every goal Pool had scored in the league this season.<br><br>SHAVING STRIKER OWEN<br><br>I sensed something was wrong with Liverpool when Michael Owen reappeared on the scene sporting a goatie.<br><br>Now, while I'm not one to say if it looks good on him, in the past, the clean-shaven Owen had defenders fearful of his skill and pace.<br><br>In last night's game, defenders Andrew O'Brien and David Wetherall, who scored the winning goal in the 13th minute, kept Owen quiet. No doubt Owen lacks match fitness, especially after his long injury, but the goatie is a sign that he may no longer be the clean-cut role model who thrilled the world in France during the World Cup.<br><br>You see, and I hope I'm wrong here, it's almost like the teenager has begun to sport an attitude. Suddenly, he is going in for hard, and sometimes dirty, tackles, forgetting the shimmying runs that took him past opponents with a simple push of the ball.<br><br>I hope Owen rediscovers his form in time for England's campaign in the Euro 2000. If I were England manager Kevin Keegan, I'd quickly start a national campaign called Shaving Striker Owen.<br><br>And how about those long shots from Patrik Berger? In the first half of the season, he was putting in almost every long shot.<br><br>Luck, said I. Skill, cried Pool fans, while calling for my head at the same time. Berger's skill must have deserted him in the last five games, for he has been blasting those shots sky high, as though aiming for a three-point conversion in rugby. How do your feet taste, Liverpudlians?<br><br>Mocking aside, the harsh truth is that Pool has played below par in the final five games of the season. It's not just that it has lost three and drawn two that surprised people, but rather the way it surrendered its second spot.<br><br>Take last night's game. Bradford obviously didn't possess the skill Pool had. It couldn't stroke the ball around as stylishly as Pool could. But it had the bigger desire to win.<br><br>Thanks to Southampton beating Wimbledon, Bradford stays in the top flight, and no one can deny that it deserved it.<br><br>BIGGER DESIRE TO WIN<br><br>Wetherall's headed goal in the 12th minute hides the fact that despite not having more possession, Bradford had all the better chance. Substitute Isiah Rankin's chip late in the game went narrowly wide to keep the last few minutes interesting.<br><br>Yet, Pool, aside from an Owen effort cleared off the line in the first half, never looked like scoring.<br><br>The worst thing, for Liverpudlians anyway, is the Reds can't hide behind the excuse of injuries, as it had almost its full squad to select from.
