Not as ez as u think to get a top 5% in poly. Last time my course beast student also cannot get a place in the Uni in spore hence u know how hard to get to Uni in Poly. In the end, need to fork out parents or ur hard earned money to go oversea to get a degree</div></blockquote>i dun think is hard entering uni from poly. in my sch now, abt 35 - 40% of the cohort is frm poly lor, which is abt 600+ poly freshies entering my sch. i wld say is a large amount... with the openin of the 4th university n the raising of the no of places in uni for poly students, i feel is easier to get into uni now as compared to the past...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

We cannot say which is better for who but rather what individual prefers and his or her limitation's the call.<br><br>I agree strongly that the English language has to be your forge, the same for the Chinese lanuguage for those who intend to take up language related streaming or course both in Uni and JC. At Polytechnic, report writing is also covered in Engineering discipline and that is where some engineering or techical English were taught to the students. Bearing in mind that JC, pre-university are something like a higher secondary in the beginning. Most of the subjects covered in thhe first years are secondary related - science, arts, language. This areas are usually not fully explored in the secondary days and much are to be learned. However, Polytechnics were build and are there to train up engineeering students since the earlier days of Singapore the various Engineering positions were in high demand and fall short of candidates.<br><br>So now you will see (but not limited to) many Diploma holders in the enginnering field as compared to A-level holders. Only by going to University will A-level holders earn a better and higher position in the Engineering field.<br><br>*sigh* but i wonder why we even bothered to study so hard...so many engineers out there no need diploma and A-levels orso can bian jia everday.<br><br>btw i still feel Polytechnic better, unless engineers prove me wrong once i get the report from QC-ing 2 gals...1 from poly in tube and hips hugger while the other one from JC in uniform....hehehe hohoho hahaha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> <img src></div>

The subjects, friends and teachers were great, but the system wasn't for me.<br><br>Poly Life is for you IF you're the kind who can be independent, ready to grow up faster and learn more of the shit that working adults receive on a daily basis.<br><br>I agree that GP is damn important. Some of my JC mates swear the heck out of it. A few other PRC mates are constantly having problems dealing with it.<br><br>But for anyone looking to enter poly, give a shot for Mass Communications.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GP is important if you wan go from JC to local Unis. At least a B3 and above else you gotta take a English Proficiency test to certify your ang mo can or not. If fail that test, you gotta then take a module on top of your faculty modules and muz pass else cannot graduate also.<br><br>So GP is very important in Uni, no GP even if u pass all other modules you still cannot graduate. With ang mo, later next time go outside work for govt better easier to enter.<br><br>PS. Nowadays every1 also is a Uni graduate so I guess ang mo alone cannot survive now. Hmmm......</div>
