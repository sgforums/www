            <div class='col-md body'>I personally have nothing against poly ppl. Having just finished JC, if given a second choice, i'll still go jc instead of poly. Firstly it is easier to enter uni. Not confirm, but from my school itself, 95 percent made it to local uni. Poly to uni you have to be realistic. From what i heard, it is only the top 5 percent of the cohort, don't forget some ppl who originally were eligible for JC would make up quite a large part of the 5 percent.<br><br>Ppl can say that u can go overseas unis after poly. But the qn i would like to ask: are the universities recognised in sg? If u intend to work in sg, it would be better to get into  a local uni unless of course u are talking about those elite universities. Likewise, how many ppl meet the cut to enter foreign elite uni from jc, not to mention poly.<br><br>Thirdly, statistics may show that diploma cert holders have higher pay. True indeed, but if u are talking about professions high in demand like law or medicine, no offense but the bulk of the students are from jc. I'm not saying poly ppl dun make the mark in such professions, but statistics prove likewise.</div>

Not as ez as u think to get a top 5% in poly. Last time my course beast student also cannot get a place in the Uni in spore hence u know how hard to get to Uni in Poly. In the end, need to fork out parents or ur hard earned money to go oversea to get a degree</div>
