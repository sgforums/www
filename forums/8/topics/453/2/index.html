            <div class='col-md body'>If you want to engage in serious discourse, then cease your middle-finger wavings and that foolish "everybody keep long hair" crap. Maybe then people will start taking you seriously for a change.<br><br>You obviously don't realise the most simple, basic reason. One of the best values that schools can inculcate if you see it in the correct light. It's one of the reasons for having uniforms in the first place. Uniformity. It's not how you look; it's what you do that matters.<br><br>Plus, you failed to address my query on your idea of self-confidence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i still felt that school should emphasize more on a student academic performance instead of his/her outer appearance.....for secondary school.....they require male students to keep their hair above their eye brow which i felt is really too much....some ppl. with a bit longer hair will look much more nicer which maybe really will boost his confidence....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Great! So students should be able to dye their hair neon yellow. They should be allowed to wear 20 huge earrings if they so desire. They should be allowed to display their dragon tattoos. All in the name of giving students confidence! Oh, DaGreatOne! You're not so great after all. You got no ambition, you don't look far. You aim so low. Why aren't you asking for abolishment of the last vestige, the school uniform, instead?<br><br>Obviously you just don't get the idea. It's your kind of childish preening, looks-oriented mentality that the uniform and strict discipline is meant to discourage. The school is trying to teach you something - something you're reluctant to learn. Go think about it a little.<br><br>By the way, which school are you from? Just curious.</div>

If that's the case, then that's precisely the reason why the rule is in place. Don't see the logic?

            <div class='col-md body'>Right. You started out arguing for a change of regulation, but ended up bitching about enforcement in your last post. Totally separate issues. Please make an attempt to be consistent in your arguments.<br><br>Up to now you're still evading all the big questions that have been repeatedly asked but not answered.<br><br>1. Do you know the reason behind the rule in the first place? If you do, please explain it, and proceed to tell us why you find it unacceptable. If not, just admit that you haven't been thinking about it.<br><br>2. What is your justification for your stand? If you're still clinging on to that 'confidence' thing, then I expect you to answer the outstanding queries regarding the issue. What constitues acceptable to boost a student's confidence, and what does not? Where do you draw the line? Aniki Jin's hairdo? Neon yellow hair? 20 huge earrings? How about doing away with uniforms altogether?<br><br>If you prefer to ignore those questions, then kindly come up with something better, or live up to that statement you got in your signature.<br><br>I have one final question. Why should you deserve that privilege?<br><br>By the way, if you think that your cheap little insults can win you any arguments, do know that it merely reflects your own failings and weaknesses. At the end of the day, you still have not properly articulated your case.

And as said before, girls with long hair <strong>covering their eyes</strong> also can concentrate, why only boys cannot?<br><br>2) Aniki Jin's hairdo draws the line. Takashi Sorimachi (as in BeachBoys) that kind should also be the same, but he let his fringe down. If he combs like Aniki Jin, then should be OK. And That's it! No big earrings or exaggerated stuff.<br><br>3) If girls can enjoys the privilege, I don't see why boys cannot. "Nan Nuu Ping Deng"?

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Totally wrong. You haven't been reading. I've given you so many hints, but you just don't get it. Unfortunately your school has probably lost sight of the real reason. And so have you, obviously. Think again.<br><br>2. Gee, now this makes no sense whatsoever. Since your justification is to boost a student's confidence, why do you draw the line at long hair then? Oh, right, because YOU want to keep long hair. So it's important to boost your confidence, but not important to boost another student's confidence by allowing him to wear earrings. Isn't that a little selfish of you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>3. Absurd and irrelevant. Your logic is similar to this equally bad one : since girls don't serve NS, why should guys? Nan nu ping deng what.<br><br>You don't bother to think before spewing such nonsense, do you? Haven't your teachers ever taught you how to argue coherently? If you're seriously intending to challenge your school, you better come up with something much, much better than what you've got.<br><br>If you're still wondering about the answer to question 1, fear not. You're almost there. It's very closely related to question 2.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha! Quisling, since you know the reason, why don't you tell us? You dunno rite? Buahahaha!<br><br>2) Different people have different ways to boost their confidence. For me, is long hair. I didn't say <strong>everyone</strong> must carry big earrings. Your peabrain is screwed up man.<br><br>3) Well, since guys serve NS, then <strong>why shouldn't girls?</strong><br><br>*chuckle* Don't make me laugh lah. Your arguement are all referring to what I say, no original stuff of your own. Oh I get it, mine are too <strong>Great</strong>, and puny tomato like you needs guidance from me.<br><br>You very "sia sway" man.<br><br><strong>hahahah!</strong><br><br>------------------<br>Know Your Role, AND SHUT YOUR MOUTH!</div>
