            <div class='col-md body'>Boy, you're still so self-centred you completely fail to see the gaping holes in your own logic.<br><br>You have got a serious problem with reading and understanding simple questions. So let me break up the question into small parts for you.<br><br>Your whole argument is this :<br><br>You want to keep long hair, because it boosts your confidence. You think that is reasonable.<br><br>Some other male students may want to wear earrings or have neon yellow hair, because it boosts their confidence. You think that is NOT reasonable.<br><br>Kindly explain why. Please explain why some other people don't need their confidence boosted, but it's so important to boost YOUR confidence.<br><br>Look at my reponses in another light, dear boy. I'm helping you out here. If you intend to challenge your school based on the kind of arguments you've presented here, then you will fail. Horribly. And you will make a laughing stock of yourself. So try to gain something from this exchange by seeing the holes in your own logic. I advise you not to laugh too soon. You may be choking on it very shortly.<br><br>As for the reason which you claim I don't know, I will tell you very soon. I just hope you can see it for yourself first, and not have to wait for me to spoonfeed you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think small earrings are fine, but you said, <strong>"20 big earring"</strong>.

In fact, MANY boys would like to have long fringes. Just by taking away 1 simple stupid rule, the government is helping a lot of boys in Singapore to gain some self-confidence and do well in studies, isn't that good?<br><br>(If you don't understand the above, let me say it in another way. It is not "so important" to boost my confidence. But for many other boys as well. You're saying as if I'm taking on some <strong>big</strong> rule, but in fact, this long hair rule is a <strong>small and stupid</strong> one.)<br><br>Of course my arguement don't hold water, that's because all my arguement are <strong>solid</strong>.<br><br>Tomatoes...*sigh* I believe your parents are shit in the soil so that they can give nutrients to you to help you grow into a stupid puny tomato.<br><br>------------------<br>Know Your Role, AND SHUT YOUR MOUTH!</div>

Why the hell would schools care how u look like if u can get 8 distinctions for ur 'O's !?! Its mainly the results they are after ... seen too many teachers who care next to ZERO bout students.<br><br>Actually, during my 'O's premlims, I was asked wat school rules I would change if I could for Eng oral, 1 of them was boys should be able to have centre parting n LONGER hair =P dunno bout my score though LOL<br><br>Actually, its not so much the hair length issue that I care about but how those ppl say one thing and do another. There was a spot check in the JC I was in, and I had just cut my hair the week before, my fringe was just at my eye brow. (WITH gel dat day somemore) That freaking guy didn't even look at me for &gt;5 secs and 'shortlisted' me. God damnit my hair at the side was not even touching my ear ( more or less a general rule ). All this crap talk about 'we want to treat u like adults ...', as long as its neat why the hell would they want to interfere with another 'adult's' hair !?
