            <div class='col-md body'>A priest wanted to raise money for his church and on being told that<br>there<br>&gt; was a fortune in horse-racing, decided to purchase one and enter it<br>in the<br>&gt; races.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; However, at the local auction, the going price for a horse was so<br>high<br>that<br>&gt; he ended up buying a donkey instead. He figured that since he had it,<br>he<br>&gt; might as well go ahead and enter it in the races. To his surprise,<br>the<br>&gt; donkey came in third!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The next day the local paper carried this headline: PRIEST'S ASS<br>SHOWS.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The priest was so pleased with the donkey that he entered it in the<br>race<br>&gt; again, and this time it won.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The paper read: PRIEST'S ASS OUT IN FRONT.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity that he ordered<br>the<br>&gt; priest not to enter the donkey in another race.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The paper headline read: BISHOP SCRATCHES PRIEST'S ASS..<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This was too much for the bishop, so he ordered the priest to get rid<br>of<br>the<br>&gt; donkey. The priest decided to give it to a nun in a nearby convent.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The paper headline the next day read: NUN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The bishop fainted. He informed the nun that she would have to get<br>rid of<br>&gt; the donkey, so she sold it to a farmer for ten dollars.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The next day the paper read: NUN SELLS ASS FOR $10.00.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The Bishop nearly had a stroke, and he ordered the nun to buy back<br>the<br>&gt; donkey and lead it to the plains where it could run wild.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The next day the headlines read: NUN ANNOUNCES HER ASS IS WILD AND<br>FREE.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The bishop was buried the next day.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A manager from Kentucky Chicken arranges to visit the Pope. After<br>receiving<br>&gt; the papal blessing, he whispers, "Your Eminence, we have a deal for<br>you.<br>If<br>&gt; you change The Lord's Prayer from "give us this day our daily<br>bread...."<br>to<br>&gt; "give us this day our daily chicken....", then we will donate $500<br>million<br>&gt; dollars to the Church".<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The Pope responds saying, "That is impossible. The Prayer is the Word<br>of<br>the<br>&gt; Lord and it must not be changed."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Well," says the Kentucky manager, "We are prepared to donate $1<br>billion<br>to<br>&gt; the Church if you change the Lord's Prayer from "give us this day our<br>daily<br>&gt; bread...." to "give us this day our daily chicken...."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Again the Pope replies, "That is impossible. The Prayer is the Word<br>of the<br>&gt; Lord and it must not be changed".<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Finally, the Kentucky guy says, "This is our last offer. We will<br>donate $5<br>&gt; BILLION to the church if you change the Lord's Prayer from "give us<br>this<br>day<br>&gt; our daily bread...." to "give us this day our daily chicken...." and<br>then<br>he<br>&gt; leaves.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The next day the Pope meets with the College of Cardinals to say that<br>he<br>has<br>&gt; good news and some bad news.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "The good news is that the Church has come into $5 billion." the Pope<br>&gt; announces.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "And the bad news is that we are losing the Delifrance Account!"<br></div>
