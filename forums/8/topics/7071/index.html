            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Method 1</strong><br><br>Listen and pay attention. Simple as that, the problem with us man is that we seldom listen, no I am not saying that we have shorter attention span. But rather I am pointing in the direction of just listening and empathising with her. You do not need to find a solution for her problems, unless she ask you to solve it for her. You might think that by being so, we guys are not showing initiative, but trust me on this, we are showing respect, by trusting that they are not so stupid and have the ability to take care of themselves, a misconception many man have of woman. Just let her let off some steam, just let her complaint, all you need to do is listen, and empathise by sharing similiar situations you have had with her, but not the solution. She will find you a different man from the rest.<br><br><strong>Method 2</strong><br><br>Let her be special, do things that you would never do for another gal for her. And let her know subtlely. Say if you never give flowers to girls, then give her a stalk of rose on your date with her. Pay special attnetion to her, be sensitive, feel her every emotion, and be there behind her, when you are needed, made her your queen.<br><br><strong>Method 3</strong><br><br>Surprise her, and make it often. Be the sugar and spice in her life, bring her out to an exotic place for dinner, spomewhere she never went before. Appear at her office door, at the most unsuspecting time, with some ice-cream. Make sure you are alway interesting, by exposing your different sides to her, it will help to keep her interested, she will not find you boring.<br><br><strong>Method 4</strong><br><br>Be yourself, be what you truly are. For you can win her heart by playing actor, but you will most probably not keep it for long, if all you have is a facade. Let her like the real you, not the prince in shiny armor you dress up as. Let her see your ugliest moments, share your faliures with her, this way you are more real, and that is something mature woman look out for.<br><br>----------------------------<br><br>Whatever that was shared above would not be entirely accurate, as everyone is different, and that of course includes woman. So be sensitive, be observant, and use that brain of yours. She is up to ou to understand ultimately.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How come only guys are answering in this thread? To be honest, I had a good laugh reading this. You guys have such a strange idea about women, must come from watching too much movies  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Could I offer my opinion as a girl?<br><br>Littleman, do you mind if I ask what matters close to the heart would be? Yes, girls are more emotional creatures. But unless they are close to that guy or is attracted to him, they would not go around spilling their guts out to him on intimate or emotional matters. Well, at least for most girls I know. It probably worked for you because the girl had a good impression of you to start with. Such advice could backfire badly if the girl doesn't like you.<br><br>BTW, are you related to Belittled? I have the impression you are, because you guys have expressed interest in the same kind of topics (in different threads, like about virginity for instance), your opinions are very similar and your matter of writing and quoting are very similar in various postings. Perhaps it also has to do with the word "little" in your name  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You are a photography ethusiast right?<br><br></div>
