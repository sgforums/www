Singapore initially did well in an online clicking contest but we have fallen behind due to immense pressure from larger nations.<br><br>Their clicks may blot out the sun, but we Singaporeans will show them we are even more boliao! We will not back down from participating in this battle, brothers! Sisters who click well also welcome!<br><br>Go to clickclickclick.com and Click!<br><br>Note: looks like their server is currently down, maybe we click them until spoil liao. But never mind, when their server is up again, go forth and click for Singapore!</span></div>

What nobody certainly went around doing was going to other people's forums to rub that in each other's faces. We all knew the name of the game, how it was played, and had no reason to look down on those who were not it using the mouse scripts for by any measure.<br><br>Even our interaction with the Norwegians, while passions ran high had a sign of mutal respect... we all intended to win this the equal and fair way to see which side was more determined to get to the top.<br><br>So what's different here? What's different here is that the game is no longer the determination and resources of each side versus the other. What happened is that more or less the server was locked out from play to the Singaporean side, through Estonian spam or whatever other reason that we can only guess at... and left one unable to answer.<br><br>In which case, that Estonians getting in the most votes would be inevitible, however the become the ugly Estonian and think that's a matter of celebration by distrupting the forum of a foreign country with their little empty victory dance is quite a discusting thing to go with. If you want to click with them, by all means.<br><br>Unfortunately, just like ugly Singaporeans throw the face of Singapore, these dudes do the same thing here.<br><br>So yes, unless they want to try otherwise, they don't really deserve any sympathy here.<br><br>Are ALL Estonians like that? I hope not but they better speak up soon. But I've yet to see a culture in which one thought winning by unfair means was a reason to gloat... even we accepted our win over Thailand in the Asean Cup as a very lucky thing and not due to any inherent superiority (in fact we admitted that the Thais were superior in skill and style).<br><br>So the question remains... do the Espersians think that raining down arrows in SgSpartans unable to return fire is really a feat to jump around with glee at? Or do they suppose that true glory can only be found in true battle when spear meets shield?<br><br>At least the Norwegians proved themselves not to be cowards in this game and a foe if we are defeated by, would lose xin fu kou fu.</div>
