              <p>LTTE has lost the rebel war to SRi lankan military recently, so its highly likely that these 2 sinister characters are on the run. The fact that these <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2 look like common indians</span></strong> means they are able to disguise better and they are trained and expert escape artist. <strong>They run a whole terrorist nation in North east SRi lanka with their own government, law, police and military, the only one of its kind,   known in the world is both fascinating and shocking</strong></p>
              <p>Vellupillai, is responsible for the  massacre and genocide  murder of 4000 people in Sri Lanka fo his ethnic struggle, involved in transnational crimes like piracy, smuggling, arms dealing, robbery, terrorism ect. They established the best , most funded, complex and well organised  terrorist organisation in the world - LTTE,</p>
              <p>Beware of these people!, they are more dangerous AND A DIFFERENT CALIBRE than ideology driven Mas Selamat. They are true born and bred criminals WHO HIDE IN THE SHADOWS FOR DECADES.  They do not hesitate to kill.</p>

              <p>Vellupillai is a founder and military strategist, but his aide pottu amman is a much more dangerous fellow who is his energy</p>

              <p><strong>Why Pottu Amman must be captured alive</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2009/05/why-pottu-amman-must-be-captured-alive.html">http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2009/05/why-pottu-amman-must-be-captured-alive.html </a></p>
              <p>By Sandeep Unnithan<br><br>(May 11, New Delhi, Sri Lanka Guardian) His real name is Shanmugalingam Shivashankar, but the world knows him by his nom de guerre 'Pottu Amman'.<br><br>Loosely translated from Tamil, it means 'uncle of the tilak fame', a reference to an incident decades ago when he swooned after slashing his arm to apply a tilak on the head of a Sri Lankan Tamil leader.<br><br>The shadowy, ruthless intelligence chief of the LTTE and the virtual number two in the organisation after Prabhakaran, Amman is also the head of the notorious Black Tiger suicide commandos.<br><br>An Interpol red corner alert lists the 47 year-old native of Jaffna as 'very alert and a master of disguises'. And this is where Amman's capability lies: subterfuge rather than in guerrilla warfare. He was handpicked by Prabhakaran for his abilities in planning assassinations of practically anyone who stood in the way of the LTTE's rise as the sole representative of the Sri Lankan Tamil cause.<br><br>That included Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 in which he emerged the key planner and executor and President Premadasa in 1993. Over the years, Amman became the most ruthless intelligence chief of a terrorist group anywhere in the world.<br><br>Now, with the Lankan forces closing in around the fast shrinking No Fire Zone, analysts say it is vital that Amman be captured alive. While Prabhakaran is vital for the resurrection of LTTE once again, capture of Pottu is vital for those who are trying to eradicate LTTE's vast intelligence network both at home and abroad.<br><br>There is credible evidence of LTTE links with India's Naxalites—LTTE IED—making videos have surfaced in Naxal-hideouts. Amman would know the extent of the terror outfits global reach.<br><br>"Apart from Prabhakaran, he is perhaps one leader who is probably in the know of all nuggets of information relating to the entire operation of the super secret organisation," says Colonel Hariharan (retd) former intelligence of the IPKF in Sri Lanka.<br><br>In fact, until lately, only one photograph of the reclusive intelligence chief had emerged. Little is known about his personal life though one source says he is married and has three sons, the oldest of who is 21 years.<br><br>"Sri Lankans would be looking for Pottu much more than anyone else because he had been controlling the foreign intelligence network operations of LTTE and that in turn would be linked to the LTTE's sizeable resources and assets overseas. So I am sure SLSF would like to capture him alive. He would also know about the LTTE linkages with Islamist Jihadi groups, Maoists, and ULFA insurgents and probably PKK," Hariharan says.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">By C. Bryson Hull and Ranga Sirilal</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">COLOMBO (Reuters) - The Tamil Tigers conceded defeat in Sri Lanka's 25-year civil war on Sunday, with some staging suicide attacks to try to repel a final assault by troops determined to annihilate them.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">President Mahinda Rajapaksa had already declared victory over the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) the day before, and the military said the bulk of the fighting was over by the time the rebels said they had been beaten.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">Even though there was little doubt about the final outcome of Asia's longest modern war, sporadic battles were still being fought late on Sunday and no one was willing to predict when the last bullet would be fired.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">"We are doing the mopping-up operations," military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said. "Suicide cadres are coming in front of troops in the frontline and exploding themselves."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">Rajapaksa was due to make a formal victory announcement in parliament on Tuesday morning, but already flags were flying, people were dancing and lighting off fireworks in celebration.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">The last act was playing out in what the military said was less than 1 square km (0.5 sq mile), where the LTTE carried out suicide attacks on Sunday before troops freed the last of 72,000 civilians who have fled over four days.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">LTTE founder-leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran's fate remained a mystery, although military sources said a body believed to be his was recovered and its identity was being confirmed.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">The LTTE, founded on a culture of suicide before surrender, at the last minute issued a statement from its diplomatic chief saying: "This battle has reached its bitter end."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">"We remain with one last choice -- to remove the last weak excuse of the enemy for killing our people. We have decided to silence our guns," said Selvarajah Pathmanathan's statement, posted on the pro-rebel www.TamilNet web site.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">Pathmanathan, who is wanted by Interpol and was for years the LTTE's chief weapons smuggler, said 3,000 people lay dead and 25,000 more were wounded.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">Getting an independent picture of events in the war zone is normally a difficult task, given both sides have repeatedly distorted accounts to suit their side of the story and outside observers are generally barred from it.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">PRABHAKARAN'S FATE</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">Government forces on Saturday took control of the entire island's coast for the first time since war broke out in 1983, cutting off any chance of escape for a militant group whose conventional defeat has been a foregone conclusion for months.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">The military has in less than three years captured 15,000 square kms (5,792 sq miles) the Tigers had controlled as a quasi-state for Sri Lanka's minority Tamils.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">There was still no confirmed word on the fate of Prabhakaran, who built the LTTE into one of the world's most violent armed groups through hundreds of suicide bombings and assassinations, which earned it a terrorist designation in more than 30 nations.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">"They are taking the body for checks to confirm it is the real Prabhakaran," a military official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Four other military sources confirmed the account.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">Nanayakkara denied Prabhakaran's body had been found, and that checks on a corpse were being carried out.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">The cataclysmic end to the war came after the government rejected calls for a truce to protect civilians, and the Tigers refused to surrender and free 50,000-100,000 people the United Nations and others said they were holding as human shields.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">Each side accuses the other of killing civilians, and diplomats say there is evidence both have done so. The U.N. rights chief on Friday said she backed an inquiry into potential war crimes and humanitarian violations by both sides.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">A wave of diplomatic pressure from the United States, Britain, France and the United Nations last week, including threats to delay a $1.9 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan, appeared to come too late to stop the final fight.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">POST-WAR BOOST</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">Sri Lanka's $40 billion economy is struggling with depleted foreign exchange reserves, shrinking export revenues for tea and garments, rising import costs, a declining rupee currency and a balance of payments crisis.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">Rajapaksa's government is counting on victory in the war to help boost the economy and renew economic growth that for years had been among the highest in south Asia.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">The Tigers have warned that their conventional defeat will usher in a new phase of guerrilla conflict targeting Sri Lanka's economically valuable targets, an indirect threat to a tourism sector the government hopes can be boosted after the war.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">Rajapaksa kissed the ground after he returned home early on Sunday from an official visit to Jordan, state TV showed.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">The Tigers have answered earlier battlefield losses with suicide bombings in the capital, Colombo.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">Prabhakaran began his fight for a separate state for Sri Lanka's minority Tamils in the early 1970s, and it erupted into a full-scale civil war in 1983 that has killed at least 70,000.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">Tamils complain of marginalisation at the hands of successive governments led by the Sinhalese majority, which came to power at independence in 1948 and took the favoured position the Tamils had enjoyed under the British colonial government.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px;">An Indian foreign ministry official said there was no immediate reaction to the report of the Tigers conceding defeat.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The gruesome brutality and wanton destruction that the LTTE has unleashed in its campaign to create a separate Tamil Only state in Sri Lanka is sustained by funds generated abroad by extortion from Tamil expatriates, and from trade in arms, narcotic trafficking, smuggling of illegal immigrants and moneyÂ  laundering.<br><br><br><br>This site contains some graphic pictures of LTTE massacres of innocent civilians carried out in the name of Tamil Liberation and self determination.

Read the Full Report.<br><br><br><br><br><br>The LTTE have been feeding the world with lies about discrimination against Tamils in Sri Lanka. They would make you think that Tamils cannot live among the Sinhalese and Muslims, but 52% of the Tamils live harmoniously among the Sinhalese and Muslims outside of the Northern and Eastern provinces the LTTE are claiming for their 'homeland'. As a percentage of the population, there are more Tamil Doctors, Lawyers, Government Officials and Top Civil Servants than any other ethnic group in Sri Lanka. Statistics show that the Tamil people in the country have always been among the most privileged minorities in the world.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Sri Lanka has been the home to the Sinhalese for over 2,500 years and Tamils started arriving about 1,000 years ago from India. Although invading Indian Tamil armies have controlled parts of Sri Lanka for short periods, there has never been a Tamil Homeland on the island of Sri Lanka. Historical documents prove this, but Tamil separatists are trying to re-write the history of Sri Lanka in order to justify their claims for a monoethnic 'Tamil homeland'.<br><br><br><br><br><br>There were thousands of Sinhalese and Muslims living in harmony in the northern areas of Sri Lanka, before the LTTE commenced its campaign of terror. The LTTE has ethnically cleansed the northern parts, and most eastern parts of Sri Lanka of Sinhalese and Muslims by killing most of these families and driving out the others. Populations of entire villages, both Sinhalese and Muslim have been hacked to death by these terrorists.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Sri Lanka News LTTE Terrorists Tamil Terror LTTE Terror Terrorism 911 Terrorists World Terror Terrorism i the world Sri lanka terrorist problem LTTE Terror Tamil terror<br>Â <br>Â</p></div>
