            <div class='col-md body'>I think the question should be "Will higher education IN SINGAPORE hamper the entreprenuerial spirit?"<br><br>Here, the educational system rewards rote learning rather than independent thought. If you have people who can't think for themselves, how do you get entreprenuers.<br><br>Got a classmate who's a straight As / Dean's list student. But I'm totally embarassed by him. He can't make conversation at all becos he only thinks about sex and nothing else outside the text books. Sigh. I'll die of humiliation if he gets first class honours and everybody thinks he's the best that will ever come out of my faculty.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>purr - at least he can talk abt sex. imagine if even that was beyond him. it's prob nature's way of ensuring the proliferation of the bookworms.<br><br>okay, not to say that i'm defending the scholars, but you have to understand that they are bonded to the govt for at least 5-6 yrs. some even up to 8 yrs. by that time, they would have established themselves in a different line of work altogether (prob an administrative line) and the initial enthusiasm to be entrepreneurial would have waned. there have also been quite a few scholars who have received offers from their univs overseas or other companies to do further research or to set up start-up companies. but they have to return to serve their bonds in the public (or private) sector. some even have difficulty getting their bonds transferred to NUS or NTU where at least their research talents can be further honed and put to good use.<br><br>but i think the biggest hurdle is risk-aversion and the unwillingness to accept the possibility of failure. i think we need to educate our students in such a way that makes them think not only independently but also imaginatively (and creatively - tho that's a really overused word). we need to stir up their passions and not just tempt ppl with monetary rewards.  and we need an environment where different ventures and different ways of thinking and doing things are not only accepted but expected. there is more than one way to make a living and the sooner ppl embrace the unknown and the unconventional, the more others will be encouraged and heartened to follow suit.<br><br>ultimately, it's abt encouraging you to do what you want in life and not just what society expects of you (e.g. be a doctor, be a lawyer, be an engineer, cos that's where the money is and that's what will get you ahead career-wise. if we all think like this noone will want to pursue their dreams and noone will discover their true calling in life). and if you don't pursue your own interests and dreams with a passion, then i think you cannot have a truly entrepreneurial society.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Darn! And I was hoping that these bookworms would die out. Kekekekekekekekekek.....<br><br>My point is just this- why do Dean's lists only comprise of people who are smart academically? It really shows up the educational system's priority. Unless the universities start prizing people who are experimental, creative, and not afraid to take risks, then we won't have many entreprenuers.<br><br>There should be some space in the curriculum for us to be entreprenuerial and opportunities for us to be graded on that. No use for the govt to talk and talk about entreprenuership and still do nothing about it.<br><br>Or maybe, we should just the complete opposite direction. Forget about revamping the curriculum; just dun place so much emphasis on paper qualifications. They are for show only, especially in the digital age. It's time that this change is noted.<br><br>BTW, I beat the dean's list guy once, even though I'll probably end up getting a second lower when I graduate.

            <div class='col-md body'>I shall split this discussion into 2 parts.<br>First, the educational system in Singapore.<br>Second, the title chase.<br><br>The educational system in Singapore focuses heavily on paper chase. From the beginning of the educational ladder, the kids have been stuffed with infomation to memorise; any attempt to dare think differently is met with scornful rebuke from the teachers. How many times have we heard "If you want to do well, you better listen to me"? Did the eduactional system ever give the students the space to be creative? How many times students got slammed for having unconventional ideas? And how many times did the teachers give them the chance to express their opinion freely? And I'm not even mentioning the word "encourage".<br>Reminds me of a word, "concept". Many can memorise definitions, but how many understood ?<br>Instead of spending more time explaining the concept to students, many teachers encouraged the students to "practise more" on tutorials that are largely based on ten-year series.<br>Does that line "once you get the hang of it" sounds familiar?<br>Predictable. That's our system.<br>In this sort of environment, how many dare to be different? Different in their approach in solving the problem. How many dared to risk their future, their career when the term "paper chase" keeps lingering in their minds? Imagine yourself crashing at one of the major exams? The system is not so forgiving. There are many cases of Singaporeans topping overseas universities but yet not even eligible for our local ones. Why?<br>If your teacher tells you that your method of solving the problem is wrong, "because your method is different from mine", how are we going to develop new and better techniques?<br>People fear to take risk as the psychological blow was dealt early in their life. It makes people unwilling to take risks, and you can see this situation in everyday life.<br>The future generation of teachers grew up in such an environment, and their teaching style would most probably remain, predictable.<br>Education seems to be a homogenous product, lacking in variety.<br>This environment points towards the failure of cultivating any entrepreneurs.<br><br>On my second point, I'm referring to people who prefers to do in depth research in their own field. Their ultimate goal is gain fame and recognition from their fellow peers in their own field. These people devote their lives to their own field, and it's their own interest and choice to take this career path. They have little interest in entrepreneurship, hence you seldom find them in CEO positions.<br><br>A point to add, what fadingstar said is true. Scholars that are bounded would find their inital enthusiasm for entrepreneurship waning by the time they completed their bond. How many dare to risk their stable career jobs when they are in their thirties and have a family to look after? How conducive is the environment that we're living in for the entrepreneurship spirit to grow?<br><br>fadingstar:<br>I don't know, but I find that the idea of "teaching students to be creative" hard to buy. Comments?<br><br>Another point, when kids are nurtured in such an environment, it's hard to expect them to have an independent thinking when they grow up. I've known many who take up courses not knowing what they really want in life. When pressed for an answer, replies like "'cos it's in demand", "'cos it pays well", "'cos it's a general degree and I should be able to find a job somehow", and even more absurd ones like "peer pressure" and "family pressure". Our society has too many expectations; even the bandwidth of our thinking is restricted.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ocean - in reply to your question abt whether it's possible to "teach students to be creative", i would say yes and no. but mostly "no" because the kind of imaginative thinking i'm thinking of cannot be taught in classrooms. there is a mini-industry out there right now devoted to teaching ppl in both the public and private sectors how to "think creatively". i've attended two such seminars. one was by Edward de Bono himself. these guys will, of course, tell you that you can cultivate or learn certain techniques so you can "think out of the box". and to a certain extent, they are useful tools. leaving aside the question of how often you're actually ever going to use these techniques (whether in meetings, discussions or in your own personal time and endeavours), i think one thing good abt these courses is that they reveal (and often drive home the point) how one-track minded we've all been and are capable of being. we then have a better appreciation of the genius of true ingenuity, imaginative flair and unwavering determination. but these approaches to "creativity" are quick-fix solutions. for over-the-hill managers trying to appear contemporary. and, more charitably, to get ppl out of the rut of thinking too narrowly, since they were brought up that way in the first place.<br><br>but what i mean by educating our students to be more imaginative requires much more time and patience. and can only be achieved if you start from young and then provide the requisite environment for their learning and exploration. infact it should be "educating our young to be more imaginative" and not just our students cos i think the family plays a role too. ideally, i think this should be the situation that singaporeans growing up should find themselves in. they should, firstly, be exposed to as wide a variety of ideas and influences as possible. singaporeans often live too sheltered lives and have a lack of real-life experiences from which to learn. this increased exposure is not only to teach the child vital skills of social interaction or to kindle the interests of the child, but more importantly, to increase the likelihood that he will get in touch with and find something he appreciates, enjoys and hopefully develops a passion for. too often, ppl grow up without a single passion or dream or yearning that they can truly call their own. ask ppl what they want to be when they grow up, and the majority will tell you, if they are candid, that they don't really know. that they will go out there and "see how". all this is well and good. and in fact prob necessary. but i think the sooner you discover what you really like and what you're good at, the more likely you're going to pursue that dream, and maybe to be more entrepreneurial. this is not to say that you can't be entrepreneurial at a more mature age. but in many cases i believe, if you ain't got it in you to begin with, you ain't gonna have it later on either, esp not in your later years when security is often more impt than experimentation and adventure. but if you've always had that dream....then it's a different thing. but it has to be a dream coupled with the ability to see it through. so the first thing is to expand the scope of possible influences and experiences so that ppl will have a grter chance of finding themselves.<br><br>secondly, whichever field a person ultimately chooses, there should be adequate pathways to realise that interest and that passion. guidance and mentorship are crucial here. but what is prob most impt is to develop a sense of inquisitiveness and wonder and constant questioning and experimentation within the field of interest. at the institutional or national level, the best u can do is prob to supply the systems and infrastructure to nurture that talent or interest. whatever it is, this stage of development should aim at independence of thought and a love for learning (abt everything, not just your own textbooks). there is no place for apathy and inaction if you want a nation of innovators and entrepreneurs.<br><br>and finally (prob the toughest thing to do) what is needed is to change the mind-sets of the ppl. i think that if u want to encourage imaginative and entrepreneurial thinking, not only do ppl have to be more open to the ideas and life-styles of other ppl, but also to the fields in which these ideas occur. that is, value should be placed on ideas that go beyond the economic or scientific or the technological. to me, it is silly to say i want to encourage u to be innovative but only if it has some economic value to the nation. the notion of "value" has to be cast in a wider sense. perhaps s'pore has too small a population base for this. and so that is why our initiatives have to take on the form of "singapore inc.". but the essential message should be: "worth" is not reducible to economic value only. this kind of thinking will free ppl from the evaluations they feel threatened by if they were to do something different from everyone else. and creativity and innovation often come from the courage to be different. a truly creative person can be so in any discipline or field of interest.<br><br>but maybe i'm talking here not just of entrepreneurial potential but of being the best that we, as singaporeans, can be. i think if u encourage ppl to pursue their dreams and their passions, then everything else will follow - including encouraging the entrepreneurial. my only lament is that the way we are proceeding now, we may end up with a notion of "worth" and "value" that is too market-based and market-driven. even if we succeed in making a name for ourselves in this arena, i fear that it will be to the detriment of other (non-economic) aspects of life and to our definition of what would be considered worthwhile pursuits. and these other aspects can't be resolved by simply bringing in more arty-farty plays and musicals or, worse still, buying entire sports teams and other personalities from overseas and making them PRs just so we can be "number one" by some specified date in the next millennium. you have to start off, i believe, by encouraging a culture of respect towards the interests and talents of all our citizens, whichever field they may be inclined towards and find themselves excelling in.<br><br>hmmm....hope i haven't mixed up too many concepts and ideas. do let me know if i have.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>fadingstar:<br>Brillant illustrations again. Glad you brought up the point on manufacturing "products"(referring to the limited variety of "workers" from our labour market) for "Singapore Inc". Yes, the educational system right up to tertiary level still focuses mainly on courses that will churn out "labourers" that are of "economic worth". The end result of such machine-manufactured products? Machine-like, robotic working force.<br>Getting a robot to be creative or innovative? The reply would be: "I'm not programmed to handle such complicated functions. Try pressing another key."<br><br>I've to agree with you that we should start nurturing the kids from young. The encouragement to be bold and creative is important, slamming them for unconventional ideas will not only kill their interest, but also the child in them. After all, kids are supposed to be inquistive.<br>On your point of "to develop a sense of inquisitiveness and wonder and constant questioning and experimentation within the field of interest", I think I should correct it a little.<br>I think it's important to still keep a child's mind when we're researching into our field of interest, 'cos once we get into our "adult" stage, our interest would have waned; the inquisitiveness and will to question would have been lost, and this will most probably result in stagnation of our progress. Hence, to "develop" should be corrected to "keep". As long as we remain as children in our fields, we'll continue to probe and wonder.<br><br>On your point on "mind-sets of people", I would say that people are realistic. If there's no job opportunity for their interest, they would have to look after their rice bowls first. After all, survival comes before interest. If you've nothing to eat, your body has no energy to function, how are you going to pursue your interest? Hence, job opportunities have to be created for the different fields for people to pursue their interest, else we're back to square one again.<br><br>We've digressed a little from the topic, but we're getting a little closer to the root of the problem. Entrepreneurship is a specialised field itself, and it's certainly not something that can be taught on textbooks. To put boundaries on it would simply kill the spirit.<br><br>(Another whim, how come the child is so brave? 'Cos he doesn't know of the dangers he's facing and hence dares to be daring?)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>During my Degree course, which was damn hard as hell, we learned quite a bit by not learning the normal way....<br><br>We had Australian lecturers and the local ones we had were very western in thinking although very asian in value....<br><br>The one thing that I can rememebr them telling my class was that we as designers and being in the creative field can never progress if we dun have experiences in our life...WE must go out of our sheltered lives and experience the world in as much of it's entirety as possible for us...travel, read, travel, talk,...whatever, as long as you can attain experience form outsiode of your own world/life as of present....True creativity and innovation comes from the expericencs that we face...It's our reaction to what has happened to/in our lives.  Without constant experience, we start to get narrow in thinking and creativity can also become very narrow and becomes a set of personal laws written in stone than anything else....<br><br>and Singaporeans, sad to say, live very sheltered lives.  It's difficult not to...even the government likes to "look" after our affairs for us...and so do our parents, and so do our teachers....and everyone has the answers but you....Star, and  Ocean are right on the money...<br><br>God, can't You guys just shuttup and let other guys sound smart for once?????...:-)hahaha:-)<br><br>And of course the Education system has so much to play in it all, but it has been said so eloquently already so i won't say it again....mainly because I can't...hahahah:-)<br><br>no...Singapore cannot produce entrepeneurs...the ones that do come out are the ones who are probably the exception tot he system....so it might go to show that you can't teach people to be like that...you can give them the tiools I guess, but what if you force those tools down someones throat(as the education system often does), then what?<br><br>I dun know...It's so difficult to teach people to get qualities that are so immaterial...creativity?...entrepeneurship?..exactly how does one teach it....As Star has said, it seemed more to be quick fix solutions than anything else....nothing super concrete...but I'm sure that if ever we have papers that claimed that we have a degree in entrepeneurhip, Singaporeans would be in awe of the person and hire him on the spot..."wah got entrepeneur papers what...."  Iy just might become something based purely on economics and nothing else....I think you can't teach these things...you can only teach it to those who already have the aptitude for it.<br><br>When i say aptitude, it includes people who have genuine interest and passion for something and not just those who are naturally gifted or talented in this area...<br><br>aiayh,...I sound klike so much rubbish next to these two...aiayaoh!!! I stop already...:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dunno whether its true or not, but somehow i feel that those ppl who have the talent are somehow stamped out of our education system.<br><br>But to say a fair word, our education system is not that bad, its is juz lacking the creativity part. Can creativity be taught? Yes it can, it depends on how u define teaching. To me, teaching is not juz abt teachers/tutors  teaching us, it can include parents or enviroment teaching us. Who cares whether creativity  can be taught in sch or nurtured outside or whatever so long the creativity part is instill in us can liao.<br>Again another fair word, creativity is impt but so is gaining knowledge. Some professions requires lots of creativity but some dun.<br><br>Anyway juz wanted to ask, hows is the bus ad course in nus? gd or bad?<br><br>Mind<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This may be off tangent to everything, but i was just skimming thru some of the posts, and i read the one by fadingstar abt being bonded by the govt for 5-6 years, and i was thinking, the singapore govt is really really damn SMART! Dampening the spirit, supressing the urge to think differently, being lulled into a false sense of security... they seems to have it all planned, sometimes i wonder if what george orwell had in mind when he wrote 1984 is hapenning, concealed only by little euphamisms here and there... Anyway, i shall not elaborate further lest i sound anti-govt *waves the s'pore flag*<br><br>Anyway, the bit about "teaching creativity" i don't think that's really possible. You cannot teach them to be creative, you can't point out 'Oh this &amp; this is creative' and 'that and that is not'. You can cultivate &amp; encourage, but you sure as hell cannot force someone to be creative, which is why i think the education system  has done the wrong thing cos they have stifled these seeds of creativity waay back in primary school by forcing everyone to be "THE SAME". Same answers, same methods, same this same that...  the fact that some people have emerged unscathed is a miracle actually...<br><br>The fact that the terms 'Higher education' and 'entrepreneurial spirit' are antagonistic is indeed very sad, maybe we're in some kind of a stalled revolution cos there is this great need for more people to dare to venture out on their own, but the people and the education system are lagging behind...<br><br>I find it strange that our society now sees "setting up your own shop" as being of less worth/value than going into civil service/law/medcine/engin. C'mon we ARE the society of entrepreneurs, our forefathers were mainly involved in trade, business, commerce etc etc. They came here practically penniless, borrowed money, braved the odds, took chances, and hey! most of them made it! Why has this now stopped? Its practically in our blood! Why the change? Tan Tock Seng would have never made it rich as a civil servant!<br><br>ok, this may not be as comprehensive to you guys, so my apologies, i tend to think faster than i write/type as a result get really muddled here and there... anyway, HAPPY BOXING DAY! (how did that come about anyway??)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ocean - you're right. "develop" should be corrected to "keep". there was a small article in the papers yesterday abt isaac newton and his life. it ended with a quote, presumably by newton himself, and i think it drives home the point quite well:<br><br>"I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore....whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me."<br><br>firewire - c'mon man! you're the one we look to to supply us with your great wealth of experience....both east and west. your views are always welcome. and always enriching.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>A little off the topic, we can look around us for those over-achievers.  Singapore's education system is able to produce these people who are in the first place not to be there.<br><br>There are graduates from comp sci who cannot write a single program (in real life).  People who have a degree and do not know how to express his view.  People who are supposedly qualified and are lost in the job.<br><br>In the Singapore's education, you can 'work hard' to get a piece of paper which can be sad.  These people simply cannot survive in the real working environment.<br><br>The worse notion about the people planning the program is that everything can be taught.  How I wish life can be that simple.<br><br></div>
