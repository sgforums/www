            <div class='col-md body'>I can't find the blardy link to that thread over at sgchinese so if anyone knows where its at kindly link this to that thread cause this farmer's got something to say to those shallow turds.<br><br>First of all, let me say something to the singaporeans that have spoken up against them. Bravo! For taking a stand and not letting such things go by. However, maybe its the reporter's fault or the newspaper's fault, we shouldn't use the " we gave them a grant to study here" its a weak argument cause they do have the right to their opinions and can leave anytime they want. its not as if they begged for the grant anyway.<br><br>Besides that, I think all of us should take a lesson from this. All our comments don't fall on deaf ears. No matter how jokingly you say it, please be sensitive to the feelings and sentiments of others.<br><br>ok...lets begin..<br><br>U blardy nonsense spouters! Who gave u the right to condemn<br>us as "pigswill" munching people? Before u even start to hit out at us, you better take a close look at who you are and where you come from! Yea, we might not have accomplished what China has but we can be proud of it can't we? that's where self-motivation comes from. (at this point those of you who are proud to the point where your egos inflate, stop it..u give sg ppl a bad name). I don't know what gave you the right to flame and generalise singaporeans! Yea that guy might be a lazy bum but he's just ONE friggin jerk among the 3 million plus plus of us. Am I supposed to generalise your countrymen now, cause you let your mouth off? Am I to ASSUME that all chinese nationals are shallow, narrow minded and very immature? NO!! i will not. I know there are plenty of Chinese nationals out there who have better manners and able to think more clearly then you have!<br><br>You say we are culturally barren. Yes I agree. But what do you expect of a nation that's been around (independently) for 39 years( we were previously just an island colony and colonies dun really have much heritage u see) You want us to come up with our own dialect? Religion? Culture? Festival? WHAT??!! after just 39 short years. America's younger then you and they STILL have not formed a cultural heritage that can compare to china's 5000 years. So where does that put Singapore? THINK my chinese brother.<br><br>U say we've got lame-ass TV shows, that I don't dispute.. (mediacorp and mediaworks, please please DO somethine). But have you EVER seen your tv commercials? They are EXTREMELY tacky and have real stupid music. You have vast resources to shoot epic films and we just don't have it. Come on man.. look at that pathetic spoof of amazing race.. I feel damn sad when i see such stuff on TV. But its STILL OUR LAME-ASS TV SHOWS AND I'M DARN PROUD TO WATCH LAME-ASS TV SHOWS cause its made in singapore!<br><br>This is my fave point. You lament there's nothing exciting to read on papers, that everytime the headlines rotate between fallen tree trunks, mistresses, naked mps and best food in singapore, well that's way better then reading about how we're arming (and aiming) our missiles at some rogue state. Its a million times better then having to read about our OUB and UOB towers collapsing after a terrorist attack and its CERTAINLY better not having to read how a hundred plus tourists visit a singapore hotel and have an orgy all over the entire floor of that hotel. What have you got to say now? HUH?!<br><br>You say we've forgotten our roots, well i'm very sorry you've got that opinion. First of all, you're NOT my ancestor. YOU have NO right to tell me that i've forgotten my roots. I know where my roots lie. HERE! true, my granddad came from Guang Dong Shen, Da Bu Xian. HAH!! How's that!! He stayed in a Wei Lou and I think Wu Lai Ban (Hakka Yam Cake) is one of the best dishes in the world. I aspire to travel to my GRANDAD'S hometown one day but MY roots are firmly rooted in SINGAPORE, Serangoon Gardens.<br><br>About your poly lecturers, wasn't there this chinese saying, Yi Ri Wei Shi, Zhong Shen Wei Fu. (A teacher for a day, A father for life). What happened to that my culturally enriched friend? what happened to YOUR roots and YOUR values? I don't need to elaborate do I? And the rest of you grant takers, what happened to Yin Shui Si Yuan? Yes maybe Singapore might not offer as bright a future as China might. You might not think Singapore's suitable for you. Fine. Its your life anyway. But its damn sad that you guys can just adopt the "i'll take the money thank you! and walk away after that" talk about being grateful, about contributing to a society that nutures you. And you tell us we forget our roots?<br><br>Now i've said enough to refute your words. (when i say your i mean to say all those shallow and narrow minded Chinese Nationals). Some of us have said really nasty things about your country and I feel sorry you have to hear the words of such barbarians but I wanna say this. Singapore might not be the most fantastic place to live in. We might be "boring" and lack "culture". We might be insensitive, spoilt and seem arrogant. But look at your own country first. You are still coming to grasps with Human Rights (something singapore took less then 39 years to accomplish HAH!) The most foul and uncouth disgruntled toilet cleaner in Singapore can't compare to some of the vagrants on your streets. Our city is by FAR cleaner then most if not ALL of your cities. Our crime rate is impressively lower, standard of living and literacy levels are all higher (on average). Yea.. you can say that we're smaller and its easier to manage. But thats how much WE'VE accomplished as a tiny nation after 39 years of independance. SO doesn't that give us reason to be proud of??<br><br>On saying all that, I'm not anti-china or anti-chinamen. i'm proud of what China has accomplished as well. Without china, there'd be no paper, no printing machines, kites, gunpowder and heck..no toothbrushes. I prefer reading Jin Yong then Shakespeare. My point is, don;t generalise...even out of anger... if you want, put down that lazy bugger's upbringing, say he's a lousy person. BUT DO NOT accuse singaporeans of pigswill munching people. After all.... I'm not going to say you grew up on dog meat am i?<br></div>
