            <div class='col-md body'>Just read it in e new paper a few hours ago n it really pi55ed me off.....<br>There was a 18 year old China student who is now in Singapore on a student grant.... he said Singaporean brains r filled with pig swill,fat ,have no intelligence,feel complacent when they have only accomplishes something small....<br>others wrote that the Singapore government was cheap in paying for their school fees for them to stay and they will not return to Singapore even if they were asked to....n would leave after completing their studies....<br>Others say we forget our roots n that we should remember our ancestors r from China.....n that we r culturally barren......<br><br>Now...personally...I have nothing against  people from China but this attack was totally uncalled for.... talk about biting the hand that feeds....there's being culturally rich for ya... most of us r born in this country so don't u think that this is our home.Our forefathers had donated generously when China was at War as they were born in China,but we are Singaporeans so our loyalty should be to Singapore .I dunno wat to say....but it's like stero typing us...... just not fair!!!<br></div>
