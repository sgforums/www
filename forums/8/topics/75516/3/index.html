            <div class='col-md body'>even through not all PRCs behave like that, from my personal experience, there are quite a propartion of them which are arrogant and behave in a self-centred manner, my own point of reasoning is that most of these young PRCs are born under the One-child rule of china, therefore they are the only child in the family.  This could have have a impact on their personality, as well as the fact that china is now rising.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I Agree to China people's comment (but they should speak nicely).<br><br>Singapore has a lot of problem:<br><br>- Mother language: Singapore is the only country in the world do not seriously use their mother language especially Chinese. Politicians should find out more from American human research how important about mother language.<br><br>- Law are outdated especially women charter:<br>- Why women got hand and leg but cannot work ?<br>- Why the couple agree oral sex but law not allow ?<br>- Why the couple agree marriage agreement but law not allow ?<br><br>- Other:<br><br>PAP should listen to people more and make Feed Back Unit more open and Live.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with harryman about the uncalled remarks that such ill mannered people from China has made.<br>Wonder  why they come here in the first place? Is it because they are cheap? Cant even afford an education themselves and have to ask for scholarship. Not that they are scholar. Coming to Singapore and not even able to speak english. WORST, when they have to come with their so called study mamas who are nothing but selling themselves as karaoke bar hostess etc...Come On. Why have your mother come here to prostitute herself for you so that you can be such a spoilt brad. Go home. Singapore doesnt need spongers and leech like you all here that are nothing but social menace to society.<br>SingMan</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>before we critise them we have to aslo look at ourselves. But i am not saying they r right. they have to do the same same thing. they say we are proud so r they. they r using 1 finger to point at us but they didnt notice 3 fingers are pointing back at them. why we need 4 weeks to finish wat they can do in 1 day. simple we finish the 4 weeks stuff and show it to u guys that why u all know the steps. once the steps are known u can do it very fast. so that sotong who critise us in the newspaper pls use ur brain b4 speaking. i know u guys are loyal and proud to be chinese frome china. but u guys also have to know we dont mean anything bad when we joke around dont be so block headed. when ppl make fun of singapore in a joke sense i just accept it. and laugh together with them. i understand there is or are some singaporeans who are spoilt and proud and self centred but hey that is only the 1% of the whole singapore. u r just unlucky to meet them. if u guys want to point out on our chinese we can also point bakc at ur english. but in the end there isnt a END. its like which came first<br>egg or chicken. there is no answer to it. and we singaporeans aimming at those Prose that i find it unfound for. these gals who came here also didnt have a choice. who in this world want to be a prose. or have a dream of being 1. right? i myself know a few chinese from china. they r not that proud. since we know they are fiathful to their country wat we singaporeans can do is not to talk about their country. right? if u dont like someone just stay away from him or her. so simple.</div>

China got SO MANY people... Just because one person with no brains said one thing, doesn't really mean anything? Though I'll agree with you that what he said was uncalled for...

You choose one case to look down upon all the people from China? Then why don't you choose some singaporean who is in the prison right now, who made a lot of mistake before as example, and to show that how bad the singaporean is? Poor you~and also stupid you~<br></div>
