Supported by evidence from various fields such as palaeontology, anatomy, zoology, embryology, developmental biology and more recently molecular genetics (which is my department).<br><br>Your analogy misrepresents evolutionary theory in three ways.<br><br>1. Discussing random sequence variation without mentioning natural selection.<br><br>2. DNA sequence is 4-base, not 50-base.<br><br>3. You assume teleology, which means the final sentence must read Â“THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION IS BELIEVABLE?Â” exactly, character for character. It will take much less time to spell "EVOLUTION - TRUE?" which preserves the meaning of the phrase with less letters. In real living systems, novel genes can have different roles from ancestral functions. Longer, shorter, different... if it works, the living systems aren't picky.<br><br>This is called attacking a "straw man" because you are claiming something scientist don't claim, which you then make it sound ridiculous, because it is ridiculous.<br><br>Also, evolutionary biologists did not compute the age of the Universe - cosmologists, who are physicists (using other techniques and models) did.<br></div>
