In fact, 2 chicken came 1st a male and a female. If only one chicken came 1st e.g female, no male to fertilise the eggs. so even if it lays a thousand more eggs, there will still only be 1 chicken. And male chickens cant lay eggs can they ? And if the egg came 1st, It will grow to a chicken and the whole reasoning of 1 chicken can't fertelise itself can it ? </div></blockquote>Very cool answer.<br><br>But i found a loophole.<br><br>An egg can sometimes hatch to bring forth 2 chicks. I think it happens. Just like twins. So maybe an egg with 2 chicks hatched, 1 male, 1 female.<br><br>Anyway that's just speculation.

In human context, what you see intracellular is actually 2 embryos, if you wanna talk in chicken egg term = 2 eggs.<br><br></div>

[b]All things were created through Him and for Him. 17 And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist</strong>. All things are created through him, not to be contained by some man-made theories, and all things are created for Him, we are created by God for God isn't it sad to see your own child making up some theories that snuff out the existence of you?<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I'm appalled by your attempt to undermine God's capability. You are just being short-sighted. What makes you think that God's way of Creation is through literal Creation itself? God is almighty - do you think evolution is a difficult job for God to create humans? As i said, times over and over again. Do not ever, ever, ever, put time as a measure. Because, God is OUTSIDE time and space. For he created the universe, and everything in it. Therefore, he created us, technically. The mechanisms may be different, but he created us, not through literal creation, but evolution.<br><br>You failed to catch my point about time. If you think God can't create human through evolution, then you are doubting His power. If you agreed with me that the Bible is not anywhere better explaining scientific facts regarding Origin of Life, then why are you still quoting from the Bible in regards to creation?<br><br>As i have said over and over again, the Bible serves the purpose of spreading the word of God, very accurately, for there is no other book capable of that. But it is not intended to teach about scientific facts.<br><br>God gave us intelligent brain to think, to judge, to reason, to gain knowledge and appreciation of our world. If you think that being scientifically smart is a threat to God, then you are really doubting God's capability. For Science do not conflict with God. Science is explaining our natural world by observing and conducting experiment in regards to the natural laws of the universe. God is not subjected to the natural laws for he resides outside the Universe. So what is the hooha about disowning God when science do not seek to disown or disprove his existence? It can't be done in the first place!<br><br>Take some time to think out of the box and stop trying to put Him into our context.<br><br>Evolution does not put God out of the picture, you people think that evolution snuff out His part to play, because it seems too random and not entirely directed. As i said again and again, evolution may seems to be a pretty long time to us, it is not, however, necessary the case for God because he is outside time. In addition, we may not see his inner workings for what may seem to be random to us may not be to God.<br><br>If you dread Science that much, if you loathe what Science has given us, then i plead you, to shut off your PC now, throw it off your window, and live in a cave, or something. Thank you.<br><br></div>

There is a God don't you think so? where does God comes from? we won't know. Say already He's God, He can appear and dissapear anytime, God mah? evolution theory is crap, if men evolved from monkeys then why are we seeing monkeys in the zoo? aren't we suppose to put them in the lab or something cause they're our great great ancestors? Big bang theory also crap, should there be atom that caused the cosmic accident who created the atom in the first place? thought bout it? crash two lousy car and get a ferrari? that's what u say, does it make sense? i don't think so =D</div></blockquote>I am amused by how you perceived Big Bang and Evolution as. Not to sound mean, but from this post i can see that you are entirely clueless about the Evolution theory and how it works, in addition, you failed to understand the Bigbang theory as well.<br><br>I say that you give Evolution as serious look before saying that monkeys in the zoo are our ancestors. The darn monkeys you see in the ZOO is not our ancestor, they evolved from a common ancestor as well. And correction, we are more related to ape, not the darn monkeys you see in the ZOO.<br><br>If you are seriously doubting evolution, then explain to me why do we have vestigial organs such as the appendix, coccyx, wisdom tooth? Put there so we can have appendicitis, or pluck them out when we are feeling extreme pain in our jaws? Fun right?  Geez.<br><br>Big Bang theory is based on the thermodynamic law, more precisely the 2nd law. The universe is ever expanding, but when entropy is at the least minimum, it starts off at one single point - the singularity, a concentrated ball of highly intense energy and matter call the Big Bang.<br><br>Someone may be more well versed in the concept of Big Bang, for i am not adept in physics but at least i do give you something to think about Big Bang, it is not just two car crashing to become Ferrari, if you meant about matter and antimatter collision, yes it does exist. Go read more about CERN, they have an entire structure dedicated to creation of antimatter. And you don't create atom out of the collison, all you have is pure energy.<br></div>
