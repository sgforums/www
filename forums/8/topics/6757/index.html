            <div class='col-md body'>A half-fuc*ed essay but at least there won't be so many of them for you to waste time on anymore.<br><br>Why I will not write anymore.<br><br>Words, words, treacherous written words!  Writing traps my thought and forces me to commit while my thoughts never stay the same.  I can deal with them changing but one day when someone reads what I have written he will not know that they are no longer true.<br><br>Writing also simplifies the thought into an expressible form.  It depends solely on descriptions and/or illustrations and forces me to label things so that they can be identified by the readers.  Oh, what do I care about the readers!<br><br>There was a time when I loved pouring my feelings into stories, poems, letters and journal entries.  It started off as a way to deal with the havoc my emotions create inside me.  However, after a while it became a way to communicate those feelings to the readers, a circus exhibition or a published autobiography.  Why did I want to share them, why did I let others scrutinize what could have been mine alone?  Why did I need to be understood and why did I let myself be dependent on others, the oh-so-fickle others?<br><br>I wish I could write these paragraphs in purple.  They look so pretty on my foolscap paper.<br><br>-----------------------<br>"Enlightenment is your ego's biggest disappointment"<br><br>Yoginandha</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mayaJ - unlike terence, i shall have to reply without stroking your hair or gently touching your cheek. i hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>"Won't it be superb if we can get rid of this dependency on people whom at the end of the day don't care about us all that much."<br><br>maya, my dear child....from which secret corner of your beleaguered soul comes this ever-growing need to renounce the world? what desire does it satisfy? at what goal does it aim?<br><br>methinks your writing is a means to self-discovery. towards finding yourself. but let me elaborate on that by replying to your question:<br><br>"why do we have to surrender to humanity, anyway?"<br><br>the surrender is not to humanity. if there were to be a prisoner, it would be the solitary soul. humanity frees us and is the enemy of captivity. only within dialogue can the seeds of emancipation bear fruit. the Other is our salvation, don't you see? but how?<br><br>firstly, understand that the Other defines your Self. it bestows identity. it teaches independence. only in relation to someone else (the Other) do you understand yourself for who you are. meaning arises from the play of differences. your "need" to write reveals u as a part of humanity, which always relates to the world in a discourse of addressivity, as it strives to define itself. to be human (to be who you are) is to relate, to address. you are being only human, maya my dear.<br><br>so how has your need bound you in chains? the only chains that hold u are the chains of signification. and these chains give autonomy even as they keep you in bondage. there is no creature more mythical than absolute freedom. the identity (the Self) you gain from the Other sets you free as much as it keeps you within the walls of your sense of being. identity enables as much as it disables. but is there really the possibility of a different paradigm? u feel trapped within the demands of humanity only because (i suspect) you have yet to find yourself. and finding yourself (if that is to be your goal) cannot be done in solitude. for what u find in solitude, u cannot give back to the world.<br><br>"as for misleading words, so what's the point of writing it down when you know tomorrow it may not be true and the readers too know that it's something iffy?"<br><br>you have said it yourself. writing, said maya, "forces me to label things so that they can be identified by the readers." in a world of constant change, we have a psychological need for identity and stability. the fixity of writing (assuming a fixity of interpretation) is a means of creating a self-identity. a paradox of the human need for the absolute in a heraclitean world of flux.<br><br>"say, what i've written, what's the point of you reading it if you know that I may think it's rubbish by the time you log into the forum?"<br><br>it matters not. you would then have a new understanding of yourself. a new mayaJ. all that matters is self-creation. and that you have done (and will always do) with each new word that you write and with each new utterance you make. self-understanding presupposes the Other. it presupposes you address the Other. if only so you can better find yourself.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear MayaJade,<br><br>Actually, there was a period of my life where I decided to stop writing my diary. I used to keep the records of my life daily, and then after a terrible heartbreak from my 1st ex-gf, I totally stopped. Until recently, in the beginning of this new year, I started recording my thoughts about things I have learned everyday.<br><br>I would like to dispute some of the thoughts which you put forward in your essay. It has been very expressive and provoking. Words are merely manifestations of the human soul. Of course, we can always rely on the beauty of words and yet have no substance. I believed that words are important, but actions are more important. I could feel some spur to write sometimes, as I walked from my home to my workplace. Have you read my recent letter in the Singles thread? That is an expression of my thoughts to someone whom I feel for.<br><br>You see, writing helps to convey ideas. A picture paints a thousand words. If that is true, we don't need to write essays but draw pictures. We need to label things before we need to set up a system of ideas to interpret our reality. Although language is not perfect, nevertheless it is the only medium we have. Of course, there is a distinction to a person who can write well and yet not write logically. There are some people who writes a lot of stuff, but it is nothing but fashionable nonsense and a whole load of rubbish. The whole essence is that you should write to make people understand what you are saying.<br><br>You should write because you love writing and not care about what others think. I write because it is an expression of the way I see things. I don't care whether people would say that I am a lousy writer. I would only continue to write till one day I could put the hardest concepts into simple language where a layman could understand.<br><br>U like purple pens? I liked my purple pen as well.....<br><br>I wished that I could finish all my unfinished works with my strength. Yet the only tragedy as a writer is the wish that he could have the most beautiful story like the stories which he wrote for his characters. Still, I hope to be one of my characters who would have the greatest love story of his life.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Enough of my own thoughts...

            <div class='col-md body'>first of all...i would like to start with...<br>TO HELL WITH YOU MRBLUE<br>OOOOhh...do you think you are sooo great to have the right to criticise other pple urself??????<br>And what makes you think MayaJade is out to attract attention????? Do you know the people in this forum well enough to have the right to say all those rubbish???<br>I can say the honest truth in here that i myself do not like HK but still i refrain myself from flaming her simply because i do not know her well enough. Maybe im wrong about her. For those of you who have heard me complained before about her on irc, i have not yet change my views but that also doesn't mean im totally against HK. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and perspectives...you don't like it? Well then thats too bad. Shut your stinking filled with garbage mouth pls.<br>The fact that you scold Terence a bas**** only proves your immaturity. If i didn't recall wrongly...even Twinkle didn't scold HK with any vulgarities. Do some self-reflection on yourself pls and stop shaming your ownself here. Man..you are plain pathetic. And i suppose YOU are gonna flame me back. Well...go ahead. However...kindly pls direct ur flaming under a new topic...don't continue it here unless you have the intention to resolve the issue.<br><br>Ok..back to the real issue at hand.<br>MayaJade...i think you are merely feeling emotionally exhausted from all these writing. Its not surprising to have this sort of feeling when just like you said, you put so much feelings into the things that you write.<br>Everyone thoughts and perspective changes as each event unfolds and situation change. Underneath each person's writing, you are able to tell to a certain extent what a person is like. It doesn't matter at all whether or not people know whether the previous posting of your thoughts still hold true or not. The fact is that perspective were once held by someone and thats enough for the reader. The reader for whatever the case shouldn't judge the person by the writing. And also....whatever you have posted, the reader is suppose to be able to know whats right and whats wrong. Your posting only serves to give him/her another perspective into the situation. He/she shouldn't mind whether or not the thinking still holds true for you right now...cause its a different case already after all..the reader should know as time passes, things change.<br>We write cause we feel the need to. We have the urge to write cause we wish to express our own thoughts and feelings out to others. Deep down inside us...we want others to know what we feel. This is why we post.<br><br>Take care my dear Maya Jiejie</div>

(see? i'm so used to it i actually click on it). the real question is, how you want to treat it. shrug your shoulders and say 'c'est la vie' or throw in your two cents worth? if its the latter here are a few responses you might like to try out.<br><br>1. for a romantic approach -<br>"Hey Kitty, can you go get yourself laid properly and spare us this freaking preening??"<br><br>2. if you prefer a more commercial edge -<br>"Hi there Kitty! I'm selling lives. Would you like to buy one?" (may be applied to io as well)<br><br>3. or if you're into neurology -<br>"Kitty, if ever an intellectual thought were to enter your head you'll die from headache."<br><br>you see, its all about how you want to handle it.<br><br>cheers<br>=============================================<br>It's amazing that whenever you get criticised you fall into a heap of emotional uriah.... someone tread on your delicate toes eh.... tsk tsk tsk.<br><br>Yes, I am going to reply through here and yes I am going to flame you, but I want you to read the shit that was posted here by Terrance. Isn't this a statement of his "maturity".<br><br>You people tend to see this forum with tinted glasses. Just because one writes good poems and has a masterful grasp of English, then they are educated, refined and sweet and ohhhh so sugary and anyone like HK is treated as a slut.. to be abused and slandered.<br><br>I for one do not know HK, but when I see statements like this, I tend to believe that you look down upon them.<br><br>Another example of this visciousness, was in the treatment of Pokemon (remember him?). I for one cannot turn a blind eye to this kind of abuse.<br><br>This thread is certainly all lovey dovey.. in fact you may say an exclusive club. You attack others in their threads by calling them "rubbish" or "inane".<br><br>Others who have made the effort to post threads and many may tend to challenge this profane assumption and boy have you insulted the other members here.<br><br>There seems to be a core element, like yourselves and Twinkle who believes that they have the sole rights to stand on a pedestal and preach. Colonialism is dead in Singapore but it looks like that a few of you would like a revival to fulfil your fantasies.<br>By going into your thread, have I contaminated the pureness of it all... tsk, tsk, tsk.... should have known better.... "No dogs or Chinese" allowed.<br><br>It certainly hurts to taste your own medicine, doesn't it?<br><br>Maturity is how well one handles a situation. Locutus, you seem to have failed.</div>

Pokemon defend the rest leh...the rest of the forumites got mistreat u meh?<br>The only person whos being hated and banned from this forum is the imfamous goodbookmarks aka shaolin boy aka tons of other stupid nicks..hahaha<br>You seem to think that Terence is insulting other pple? hmm..i don't think so....something is wrong with your interpretation of his words. What makes you think that we are actually thinking very highly of ourselves and that we think we have the right to preach????<br>I for one never said im mature. You can interpret me in anyway you like. I understand that just by criticising you in the very first place would have stated something about my character...but i feel theres a need to defend those pple. whom i know does not have the way of thinking that you described them to be.<br>Just look at what you have typed...you are no better than twinkle. No wait...Twinkle is far better than you.<br>Oh yes by the way...I do not care a single bit whether or not Terence's english is superb or plain junk. Who cares anyway? YOU care?? oh then thats too bad.<br>Exclusive club? Nope i don't think so. Thats what u think thats all.<br>If maturity is how well you handle a situation...then obviously you urself have failed as well.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi Mr. Blue,<br><br>i do agree with you that Terence may rub people the wrong way through his caustic remarks sometimes, but you have to understand here that MayaJade &amp; Terence are very good friends, both in this public forum &amp; via private mail. Terence was responding the MayaJade's troubled feelings about her writings &amp; encouraging her, i seriously don't see any need for you to flame Terence here.<br><br>i don't deny that his remarks sometimes hurt, but he usually doesn't overstep the boundaries of common courtesy by hounding the flamed forumite incessantly. if you read most of the threads here, you should realise that there're cliques here &amp; sometimes even the cliquemates "flame" each other in a bantering way. well, as far as i can see, there's no love lost between Kitty &amp; Terence and i don't think it bothers either of them.<br><br>as for Pokemon, you can't deny that some, no, <strong>all</strong> of the thread topics he posts are very offensive to the fairer gender, i don't even want to get started on that.<br><br>let's just keep this a friendly, happy forum, if that's indeed possible?<br><br>colette<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 01 April 2000).]</div>

They do rub us up the wrong way and by giving them a taste of their own medicine through this forum should make them realise that they have to be more considerate.<br>Thanks for your comments.<br><br>Locutus,<br>You care, I know you care whether these ppl are not educated and I can understand your complete Bias.
