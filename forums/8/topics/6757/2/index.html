            <div class='col-md body'>Well...YOU think i care. You are not ME and thus you are unable to put urself in my shoes. Do you think i myself am very educated to have the right to criticise others??? Whos the one being biase here? Me or YOU?<br>You say that you are "giving them a taste of their own medicine." Do you have the right to do that? Also...what makes you think that they are truly the pple that you describe them to be?? You do not even know them well enough. Perhaps when you have made an effort to know them then you would reconsider what you have said.<br>You can insult me for as much as you like. I do not care. Im only stating what i think is right and that MayaJade and Terence are definitely not the type of pple. you think they are. Even if some of the other forumites or me have annoyed you or irritated you in any sort of way..the least you could do is to be tolerant. Do you always flare up your temper at everyone that you can't stand with?? Doesn't that state something about UR character?? I may have mistaken certain parts about what you were meaning to say...but at least im willing to admit that im wrong.<br>Think about it yourself. Can you honestly say that whatever you have said so far is 100% correct and fair to the others???<br>Oh yes and btw...my brains are somewhere in the toilet bowl and not in the zoo...hahaha...i accidentally flushed it...hahaha...would that be enuff for u?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>eh, Locutus, you're having fun or should I say like a good girl, "relax, relax?" =)<br><br>Mr. Blue:<br>say whatever you like about me, it may be unbelievable but I don't care about what you think at all.  As for disagreeing with my views, you can always refute them in their proper topics, not here, I can't remember all my postings.  Anyway, have you ever considered yourself to be obstinate or not observant because you keep spelling Terence's name wrong in your posts?  In that case it's rather a waste of electrons to argue with you, isn't it?<br><br>------------------<br>Why be difficult when with a little more effort you can be impossible?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In Jennings there is a character called Violet Elisabeth and she would say things such as "I SCHREEM &amp; SCHREEM &amp; SCHREEM TILL I AM STHICK OF IT". Lately she has made an appearence in this forum. Why I wonder did it take days for her to respond to her Boy Wonder?<br>Terrence or Terwance is a deliberate mistake.... read it properly and you see why.<br>Tsk... Tsk.. Tsk... cannot read between the lines MayaJade, and with all that English...<br><br>Thanks for the verbal Locutus, it's great to be lectured upon.. makes one feel like being at University again. Shame that you do not want to waste precious energy on people like me. I was just thinking that we little people are the sole reason for your existence. Quite a good natter really... at least I am enjoying it.<br><br>Sad really that you can get so uptight over li'lle ol" me.... just play play. Wonder how you cope with the important things in life.<br><br>My analysis is nearly complete... next chapter?<br><br>For those psychatrists or readers of history will know that the truth is not as it may seem.<br><br>Read between the lines you ppl??!!!<br></div>
