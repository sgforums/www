It is not invented and yet I can already think of quite a number major problem it will bring to the world. Remove illness, yes ok or else I might sound anti-medicine and anti-hospital but anti-aging is a no no. One thing to clear with you though, you want to prolong life so that you can live to a thousand years because you would not want to reach 70 years old and just sit around and wait for your death but what happens when you are at 999 years old? You welcome death? Or are you actually talking about immortality?</div>
