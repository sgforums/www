              <p>oh yes the accents are very different as well. i can tell a malaysian straightaway from his voice. their english has a totally different accent though manglish and singlish share some similarities. generally they do not pronounce the end of the words and are less fluent in english. (since English is far less commonly used in msia as in sg)</p>
              <p>mandarin wise, they have an accent as well, very strong cantonese accent.</p>

              <p>How many percent of Malaysians is that? 0.01%?</p>
              <p>You are talking about the exception rather than the norm. I haven't heard a Malaysian with a British accent except those who were educated in Britain, like the current Malaysian PM (very slight British accent).</p>
              <p>Mahathir does not have a British accent. Very Malaysian accent, very different from Singapore's.</p>
              <p>In fact, 90% of Malaysian Chinese I've met can't speak fluent English. Nothing wrong with their accent of course, I am merely pointing out that it is different from the Singaporean one.</p>
