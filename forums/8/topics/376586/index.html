              <p>Pardon me, this is going to be long.</p>
              <p>I have been thinking of what should I do after I have graduated from poly for some time and have become more serious in the thoughts when I realise (&lt;- yea that's the word, time flies) I'm going to be in my final semester soon. Afterwhich, I will be going to serve my NS for 2 years.</p>
              <p>I have thought about furthering my studies to get a degree after graduated from poly and that's where I'm having problem with. With my current GPA of 2.8, it's impossible to get into any local university (well, except SIM which is a private university). Even if I work hard in my final semester and pull my GPA to 3.0 (which I'm intending to achieve), local universities is still out of my choices. Get into SIM?</p>
              <p>I thought of making use of this "chance" to broaden my views/mindset by going overseas to pursuit my degree. Australia is the only choice I have?</p>
              <p>I have tried doing some research on the application requirement through
                              visiting some of the Australia universities' webpage and the
                              information it gaves me is so confusing and vague. What are the chances of Australia universities accepting me with my current GPA scores?</p>
              <p>What is the level of recognition of overseas degrees in Singapore (I do intend to come back)? If you were to compare, which is better? SIMS degree? Overseas degree? Why?</p>
              <p>Can anyone with experience/knowledge in overseas universities answer some of my questions above or share some info with me? For example, life in Overseas/Australia universities?</p>
              <p>One thing that is making me hesitating in going for overseas degree is that unable to accustom, my proficiency in english language and to make it worst, my minor introvert personality.</p>
              <p>Please don't answer me with "why didn't you study harder instead" kind of question instead. I know that and there is no point in crying over spilled milk. We should look forward instead and learn from past experiences, shouldn't we?</p>

              <p>Arts course is quite impossible for me. Currently, I'm pursuing an IT-related diploma and have no intention of switching. If I were to pursuit my degree, I will go for IT-related degree too.</p>
              <p>Normally, I would hear/see people going for Australia. Can you give a reason why Australia isn't a best place for me to go to? You mentioned I'm a chinese, so is racist the reason?</p>
              <p>You said Britain but I've seldom heard people go to britain for overseas education.</p>
              <p>About SIM, I too do not have a good (to be exact no impression at all) impression of it and that's the reason why I'm thinking overseas universities.</p>

              <p>Yea, I understand what you means, 2 years is long and whatever happen during the period of time can affect your decisions/plans later but 2 years can also pass quickly in a blink of an eye.</p>
              <p>If you ask me, I scored pretty good (in my point of view) for my O-level because I have an aim to get into the course I want in poly. However, during my poly years, I have no aim/plan at all on where I should go except getting into NS which is predetermined. It's hard to work on something without a plan/aim.</p>

              <p>now nie is dam competitive, with the economic downturn attracting more people to turn towards the civil service.</p>
              <p>now for poly grads, i heard they are asking for 3.3.</p>
              <p>for IT and other technical/knowledge related field of studies like engineering, I think it is better to study in singapore, as it will be much cheaper than actually going overseas.</p>
              <p>but if you are intending to take up 'softer' courses like business, economics and finance, it might be better for you to go overseas for ur degree, as the soft skills to be obtained there are not the same as what you will get in oversea study programme at SIM.</p>

              <p>Well, the only place I can think of in Singapore that will accept me is SIM and maybe some other overseas universities offshore (which is not popular I think since I don't see people put it as one of their choices generally) in Singapore. Frankly speaking, I have a negative view about SIM but I'm not sure how do others generally see it in reality.</p>

              <p>Its not true at all that Australians are any more racist than Americans and Britons. Most of my friends in JC and sec school went overseas to study, with hardly any staying in Singapore. We all believe that local university education is substandard and we still do. Some of my friends who went to the UK, but not to London, eg further up like Manchester, Southhampton, Birmingham, did not experience racism in their universities, but only when they visited the countryside like The Lake District.</p>
              <p>That said, studying in the UK and US is quite expensive. I'd say that LSE, Imperial, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol would be out of your league as they have stringent entry criteria.</p>
              <p>There are many many many Singaporeans studying in Australia, UK and the US. Some go to Australia because it's the closest to Singapore distance wise, and is the cheapest among the three options.</p>
              <p>Your grades will not get you into Uni of Melbourne, which takes in many top students from Australia, but there is a wide variety of lower rung universities there that you can apply to that shouldn't be a problem at all, eg Deakin, RMIT, La Trobe</p>

              <p>Pardon me, this is going to be long.</p>
              <p>I have been thinking of what should I do after I have graduated
              from poly for some time and have become more serious in the
              thoughts when I realise (&lt;- yea that's the word, time flies) I'm
              going to be in my final semester soon. Afterwhich, I will be going
              to serve my NS for 2 years.</p>
              <p>I have thought about furthering my studies to get a degree after
              graduated from poly and that's where I'm having problem with. With
              my current GPA of 2.8, it's impossible to get into any local
              university (well, except SIM which is a private university). Even
              if I work hard in my final semester and pull my GPA to 3.0 (which
              I'm intending to achieve), local universities is still out of my
              choices. Get into SIM?</p>
              <p>I thought of making use of this "chance" to broaden my
              views/mindset by going overseas to pursuit my degree. Australia is
              the only choice I have?</p>
              <p>I have tried doing some research on the application requirement
              through visiting some of the Australia universities' webpage and
              the information it gaves me is so confusing and vague. What are the
              chances of Australia universities accepting me with my current GPA
              scores?</p>
              <p>What is the level of recognition of overseas degrees in
              Singapore (I do intend to come back)? If you were to compare, which
              is better? SIMS degree? Overseas degree? Why?</p>
              <p>Can anyone with experience/knowledge in overseas universities
              answer some of my questions above or share some info with me? For
              example, life in Overseas/Australia universities?</p>
              <p>One thing that is making me hesitating in going for overseas
              degree is that unable to accustom, my proficiency in english
              language and to make it worst, my minor introvert personality.</p>
              <p>Please don't answer me with "why didn't you study harder
              instead" kind of question instead. I know that and there is no
              point in crying over spilled milk. We should look forward instead
              and learn from past experiences, shouldn't we?</p>

              <p>Overseas degree, depending on which universities, are more recognisd than local degrees in Singapore. Just look at our own PM, his father and where almost all the ministers studied. Not in loser local u which is meant for frogs in the well.</p>

              <p>Why would anyone study science or engineering in a country like sg?! Costs aside, subjects like science, medicine and engineering that hinge heavily on research and development must be best done in universities and countries that are at the forefront of science, research and development. Which is..the US.</p>
              <p>Singapore has nothing. Not a single Nobel Laureate to its name. Not a Putlitzer prize winner or a Booker prize winner. Nothing.  I think (A)NUS is only fit to be MIT's anus, it should change its name to ANUS.</p>
              <p>If I was forced to study in Singapore, where even its arts course is anus shit, which is really a joke since you don't need to build a billion dollar observatory for the study of philosophy or history, I'd take up the course that is least dependent on the funding, research, brains and talent. something like degree in bartending or barista. That's the only thing the degree mills here like NTU, NUS and SMU are fit to give out.</p>

              <p>FYIP, nowadays austrailian degrees and diplomas are worth less
              in Singapore's employer's eyes.</p>
              <p>I'm 16, and my old schoolmates who went over told me that their
              syllabus is roughly 3 years behind ours (i.e. learning calculus at
              about only 19/20 years old while I have already learnt it for O'
              Levels), both at secondary and tertiary education levels.</p>

              <p>I'm not sure about how worthless it is but I'm quite sure that having a degree is always better than having only a diploma though. You never know when these papers might come in handy.</p>
