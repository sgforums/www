              <p>To all managers, bosses: Being abit late isn't a big deal. Life is short to be so calculative and petty....<br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">Among those who were running late that September morning:</span></p>
              <p>1) Because she stayed up late Monday night to finish a master's thesis, 
              former Louisville-area resident Elizabeth Kramer was slow getting to her
               job with the Peace Corps yesterday morning in the World Trade Center 
              complex. ... "The first thing I did was look for a pay phone to call my 
              mother. I waited in line. A woman next to me was crying. She worked in 
              the first tower that was hit. Her colleagues were on the floors that 
              were burning. She had been running late to work, too." (<em>The Courier-Journal</em>, Kentucky)</p>
              <p>2) Four friends who called in late for work because they stayed up the 
              night before to watch a Giants game on "Monday Night Football" missed 
              being there when the planes hit.</p>
              <p>3) A worried woman approached Seamus Campion to ask what was going on, 
              saying she was late for work at Cantor Fitzgerald, a bond trading firm 
              with offices above the 100th floor in the first tower. Those floors were
               completely devastated; no one made it out alive. "I gave her a hug and 
              told her she was safe, and to stay where she was," Campion says.</p>
              <p>4) On a routine day, Bud Flanagan would ride an elevator to the sky lobby on 
              the 78th floor, where he'd board another elevator for the 105th. He 
              usually was at his desk by 7:45 a.m. But that Tuesday, he was running 
              late. ... Two phone calls [to his home that morning] and a brief 
              conversation: If not for them, Flanagan would have been in his corner 
              office, high up in One World Trade Center that morning.</p>
              <p>5) "I take the bus into Manhattan every day, which leaves me about two 
              blocks away from WTC," Debbie Archimbaud said. "The bus was running just
               a couple of minutes late. I was a little annoyed, because I wasn't 
              going to have enough time to read my newspaper at my desk before I 
              started my day. As I was walking toward the WTC, I decided to stop for a
               cup of coffee and a muffin at one of the street carts. I rarely do this
               anymore, but I hadn't eaten dinner the night before so I was a little 
              hungry. These two miniscule details—a late bus and a muffin—saved my 
              life."</p>

              <p>i still remember last time during my BMT at tekong. that time only got pager handphone not mainstrean and affordable yet.</p>
              <p>tekong my camp that era very 'special', after a certain timing bunks must switch off lights. even when its not bedtime. so after shower or what all have to use nighteye or torchlight to find your way with things in your metal cardboard.</p>
              <p>i remember got a few smartasses in my platoon or company when its their turn to use the payphone with phonecard they will hog the phone tokin to their girlfrends, even ignoring the long line of people at the back queing up. theres a few jokers i can still remmber their faces.</p>
              <p>sometimes some of us have no choice have to make phone calls early in the morning manyhours before the sun is even up just to inform our relatives or family members taht we are still in one piece.</p>
              <p>when you are goin to be late inform your bosses. if you worked late the night before tell your bosses i am sure they will understand. ottherwise when its time to knock off no work jollywell fuck off back home. when its time to report on time for work jolly well get the fucking ass in office.</p>
