            <div class='col-md body'>Not true...? I feel that ALOT of boy bands actually have very talented singers and dancers... And yes, they do use each others' voices to cover up the whole song at times, but it is just so that the song would end up to be a beautiful one.... I think the impt is whether the song turn out fine...? I still believe that most of them are very talented in their own ways...? It's just that their voices make nice combinations...? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">)<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>
