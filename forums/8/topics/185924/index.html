            <div class='col-md body'>'Drive drunk or you can't marry'<br>Guy obeys... and kills 1, hurts 7 in crash<br>April 12, 2006<br><br>A SHANGHAI man's first meeting with his girlfriend's parents turned into a nightmare after he killed one of her relatives and injured seven others while driving drunk.<br><br>Not only was he jailed for the offence, he is being blamed for the accident by the relatives.<br><br>This is despite them being the ones who forced him to drink alcohol during the meal. They also later insisted that he drive them around.<br><br>The man, who was identified only as Zhang, had been dating his girlfriend for several years and decided to meet her parents for a meal in Jinshan District last October, reported the Shanghai Morning Post.<br><br>During the meal, he was persuaded by her relatives to drink half a bottle of yellow wine to show his sincerity towards his girlfriend.<br><br>As the group was about to leave for home, one of the relatives, who was identified as Mr Yao, fell off his motorcycle and injured his face.<br><br>The relatives asked Zhang to take<br>Mr Yao to the hospital for treatment in his minivan.<br><br>Zhang refused as he felt dizzy from drinking too much.<br><br>But the relatives were not going to take no for an answer.<br><br>'Today is your first visit to our family,' one of the relatives told him.<br><br>'If you don't drive Yao to hospital, I won't recognise you as a member of our family.'<br><br>Zhang eventually agreed.<br><br>But some of the other relatives wanted to go to Fengjing to enjoy themselves and insisted that Zhang drop them off before he took Mr Yao to the hospital.<br><br>The group never made it to Fengjing.<br><br>Zhang lost control of his speeding minivan in heavy rain and ploughed into a concrete barrier near the town.<br><br>Mr Yao later died in hospital.<br><br>The other passengers suffered serious injuries, including broken bones and ruptured spleens.<br><br>Only one woman, clutching her child, remained conscious throughout the accident.<br><br>'I heard a loud noise when the van hit the barrier,' she told the paper.<br><br>'When I looked around, no one else was in the van. They had all been thrown out.'<br><br>The Jinshan People's Court sentenced Zhang to three years' jail and ordered him to pay the relatives 460,000 yuan ($92,400) over the next seven years for medical expenses.<br><br>Zhang told the court that he could not be expected to take all the blame for the accident.<br><br>'The accident may not have happened if I had taken Yao to the nearest hospital directly, but some relatives insisted on going to Fengjing first,' he said.<br><br>He added that he was disappointed because the relatives had insisted he drive Mr Yao to the hospital even though he tried to refuse as he had been drinking.<br><br>But when the accident happened, they asked him to take responsibility for the crash.<br><br></div>

They also later insisted that he drive them around.<br><br>The man, who was identified only as Zhang, had been dating his girlfriend for several years and decided to meet her parents for a meal in Jinshan District last October, reported the Shanghai Morning Post.<br><br>During the meal, he was persuaded by her relatives to drink half a bottle of yellow wine to show his sincerity towards his girlfriend.<br><br>As the group was about to leave for home, one of the relatives, who was identified as Mr Yao, fell off his motorcycle and injured his face.<br><br>The relatives asked Zhang to take<br>Mr Yao to the hospital for treatment in his minivan.<br><br>Zhang refused as he felt dizzy from drinking too much.<br><br>But the relatives were not going to take no for an answer.<br><br>'Today is your first visit to our family,' one of the relatives told him.<br><br>'If you don't drive Yao to hospital, I won't recognise you as a member of our family.'<br><br>Zhang eventually agreed.<br><br>But some of the other relatives wanted to go to Fengjing to enjoy themselves and insisted that Zhang drop them off before he took Mr Yao to the hospital.<br><br>The group never made it to Fengjing.<br><br>Zhang lost control of his speeding minivan in heavy rain and ploughed into a concrete barrier near the town.<br><br>Mr Yao later died in hospital.<br><br>The other passengers suffered serious injuries, including broken bones and ruptured spleens.<br><br>Only one woman, clutching her child, remained conscious throughout the accident.<br><br>'I heard a loud noise when the van hit the barrier,' she told the paper.<br><br>'When I looked around, no one else was in the van. They had all been thrown out.'<br><br>The Jinshan People's Court sentenced Zhang to three years' jail and ordered him to pay the relatives 460,000 yuan ($92,400) over the next seven years for medical expenses.<br><br>Zhang told the court that he could not be expected to take all the blame for the accident.<br><br>'The accident may not have happened if I had taken Yao to the nearest hospital directly, but some relatives insisted on going to Fengjing first,' he said.<br><br>He added that he was disappointed because the relatives had insisted he drive Mr Yao to the hospital even though he tried to refuse as he had been drinking.<br><br>But when the accident happened, they asked him to take responsibility for the crash.<br><br></div></blockquote>JIn Shan is countryside......not real Shanghai....</div>
