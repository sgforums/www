            <div class='col-md body'>Mayajade,<br>While I agree with you about needing to be open minded, I feel the gay issue has implications apart from just being deemed as "fringe" behavior.<br><br>1) Religion - I'm a Christian and to openly accept gays and the gay lifestyle contradicts what I learnt in Sunday school as a kid, and what I read in the bible.<br><br>2) Family and society - while I don't want gays to be persecuted for their lifestyle, I unabashedly admit that I would hate to find my loved ones being gay. I could probably learn to accept it, but I wouldn't like it.  So, while I have nothing against gays doing what they do, I do have a lot against the media trying to depict gay behavior as "normal" or "perfectly acceptable" or even "faddish".<br><br>Every society has to define it's norms and boundaries, otherwise I'd walk to work naked everyday. I for one prefer to have gays remain on the fringe of society rather than have them accepted as mainstream.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dito, every country has its own share of gays and lesbians. They are merely a minority of the whole population. You should open your mind more. If you think what you saw were shocking, how would you be able to accept some of the more severe cases in other countries?<br>In Singapore, i admit it seems like a lot girls sch. nowadays seem to have plenty of lesbians. But thats also because they are still young, sooner or later they will grow out of it.<br>As for you accusing MayaJade as a gay, i would say you have a very severe narrow perspective. What MayaJade said was absolutely correct, different situations different perspectives. Whos to say that in a gay city, i wouldn't invite stares from others if i were to hold a gal's hands?<br>As for the amt. of single guys out there, this has absolutely nothing to do with the amount of lesbians in Singapore.

I really can't argue against what the religion say, but can't you see the tides of time are sweeping us over?  I mean there are so many change, our ability to plant hearts on pigs and harvest them, aren't they iffy subjects but they're coming right at us?<br><br>Haha, you'd love to work naked?  So will I, but I suppose we can't because others may feel uncontrollable lust and who will blame them if we are, like, raped or something?  Anyway, are you sure you'd love to go to work naked?  The sun is so merciless, the aircon is so cold, we have reasons to wear clothes other than preserving the modesty of the beholders...<br><br>Anyway, I still would love to hear why gays should keep their lifestyle in secret.  Are they creating eyesore for the normal people out there?  Or many simply don't like them and that's that.  I sincerely don't see anything wrong with being gay.  If I announce right now in the forum that I am a gay, will you stop talking to me?  If I am not sad about it, will you feel obliged to feel sorry for me?<br><br>------------------<br>"Time flies like an arrow.

It's faith, not logic. And about scientific advances - Wow - talk about your Pandora's Box. And not just from a religious point of view. Cloning, genetically engineered crops etc.<br><br>As for working naked, it sure would save me some laundry bills! I'd need to get rid of my PVC chair though - it's got stitches in all the wrong places.<br><br>And I absolutely would not stop talking to a person just becos he/she were gay. It's his or her choice. However, I do believe in the old fashioned values of God/country/family, and see many points where the gay lifestyle clashes with these values. By fringe, I didn't mean they have to keep their lifestyles secret. Just that the media should not actively play up alternative lifestyles as normal and healthy. The media is an extremely large influence on our young, and it is often in these formative years (I believe) when a person often begins experimenting with alternative behavior - the rebellious teen.<br><br>Take prostitution - we all know what goes on in Geylang. Are we going to have a documentary telling our 17 yr olds that it's perfectly acceptable to have a weekly visit to the establishments there as long as they wear their rubbers? Are prostitutes any less human than gays? It's a stretched analogy, but I can't seem to think of anthing else at this hour.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cal Guy<br><br>I don't want to get started about prostitution.  I said in another thread that prostitutes don't kill or steal, if you do not consider the goods they are peddling, they are just sellers.  Now the goods itself, I am not convinced why selling flesh is not a cool thing to do. I don't think I'm ready to suggest outloud that prostitution should be legalized like any other profession, but I'm moving towards that direction, I can feel it.<br><br>I read a book by Paulo Coelho (Veronica Decides to Die).  He said that the ultimate sexual liberation is when nothing is taboo anymore except raping and having sex with children, and for me I guess I'll add in sex with animals in my nono list.  This idea of sexual liberation somehow appeals to me.  I think many of our values regarding sexuality are stuff designed by paranoid people.<br><br>Yes, it's me, it doesn't mean everyone else has to follow in my footsteps.  But as Barclays has said, there is so much hatred going on, why spread it further by hating gays and this race and those people and whatnots?<br><br>------------------<br>"Time flies like an arrow.

Prostitution *IS* legal in Singapore. However, it is confined to registered persons (who go for mandatory checks) and registered premises. They are also not allowed to advertise.<br><br>This is sorta in line with what Littleman and myself have been saying. We all know it exists, and I won't go and throw eggs at the prostitutes and call them names, but I wouldn't want them setting up shop next door to me either. The same goes for cigarettes - do U know that it is now illegal in the USA and many other countries to advertise cigarettes? Smokers can still buy the little cancer sticks, but why encourage our young ones to take up smoking when we know the ill effects it causes?<br><br>There will always be a conflict between the rights of the individual and the rights of society. In a democratic process, the lines drawn are *in most instances*, drawn along the lines that mainstream people feel comfortable with. In parts of the Middle East, women aren't even allowed to go out without a veil. Are they wrong, primitive, backward? Who are we to decide? We don't live there, contribute to their economy and vote, and therefore rightly don't have any say in how they choose to live their lives.<br><br>So it goes with gays - until the gays and people who feel that gay lifestyle should be "mainstreamed" (eg. legitimising gay marriages, allowing gays to buy HDB flats, adopt kids etc) form the majority, I'm afraid they will remain largely fringe, and I have no qualms at all about that. I belong, afterall, to the present conservative majority in S'pore. Who knows though, in 20-30yrs? Less than a century ago, women were walking around Singapore with bound feet - We've come a long way baby!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>waaah, you two made the conclusion without me.  I am not promoting gay life style, you know, not like, why don't you try being gay, it's fun blah blah blah.  I'm promoting acceptance of gays and I don't mean qualified acceptance (lesbians okay, lah, but the guys give me the creep) or things like, I try to rehabilitate them first, if cannot, nevermind.<br><br>There is a difference between what is accepted fully and what is encouraged.  and I didn't mention the animals first, somebody else did.
