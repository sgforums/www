Right View Wisdom<br>2. Right Intention<br>3. Right Speech Ethical Conduct<br>4. Right Action<br>5. Right Livelihood<br>6. Right Effort Mental Development<br>7. Right Mindfulness<br>8. Right Concentration<br><br>The Noble Eightfold Path describes the way to the end of suffering, as it was laid out by Siddhartha Gautama. It is a practical guideline to ethical and mental development with the goal of freeing the individual from attachments and delusions; and it finally leads to understanding the truth about all things. Together with the Four Noble Truths it constitutes the gist of Buddhism. Great emphasis is put on the practical aspect, because it is only through practice that one can attain a higher level of existence and finally reach Nirvana. The eight aspects of the path are not to be understood as a sequence of single steps, instead they are highly interdependent principles that have to be seen in relationship with each other.<br><br>1. Right View<br><br>Right view is the beginning and the end of the path, it simply means to see and to understand things as they really are and to realize the Four Noble Truth. As such, right view is the cognitive aspect of wisdom. It means to see things through, to grasp the impermanent and imperfect nature of worldly objects and ideas, and to understand the law of karma and karmic conditioning. Right view is not necessarily an intellectual capacity, just as wisdom is not just a matter of intelligence. Instead, right view is attained, sustained, and enhanced through all capacities of mind. It begins with the intuitive insight that all beings are subject to suffering and it ends with complete understanding of the true nature of all things. Since our view of the world forms our thoughts and our actions, right view yields right thoughts and right actions. [back to the top]<br><br>2. Right Intention<br><br>While right view refers to the cognitive aspect of wisdom, right intention refers to the volitional aspect, i.e. the kind of mental energy that controls our actions. Right intention can be described best as commitment to ethical and mental self-improvement. Buddha distinguishes three types of right intentions: 1. the intention of renunciation, which means resistance to the pull of desire, 2. the intention of good will, meaning resistance to feelings of anger and aversion, and 3. the intention of harmlessness, meaning not to think or act cruelly, violently, or aggressively, and to develop compassion. [back to the top]<br><br>3. Right Speech<br><br>Right speech is the first principle of ethical conduct in the eightfold path. Ethical conduct is viewed as a guideline to moral discipline, which supports the other principles of the path. This aspect is not self-sufficient, however, essential, because mental purification can only be achieved through the cultivation of ethical conduct. The importance of speech in the context of Buddhist ethics is obvious: words can break or save lives, make enemies or friends, start war or create peace. Buddha explained right speech as follows: 1. to abstain from false speech, especially not to tell deliberate lies and not to speak deceitfully, 2. to abstain from slanderous speech and not to use words maliciously against others, 3. to abstain from harsh words that offend or hurt others, and 4. to abstain from idle chatter that lacks purpose or depth. Positively phrased, this means to tell the truth, to speak friendly, warm, and gently and to talk only when necessary. [back to the top]<br><br>4. Right Action<br><br>The second ethical principle, right action, involves the body as natural means of expression, as it refers to deeds that involve bodily actions. Unwholesome actions lead to unsound states of mind, while wholesome actions lead to sound states of mind. Again, the principle is explained in terms of abstinence: right action means 1. to abstain from harming sentient beings, especially to abstain from taking life (including suicide) and doing harm intentionally or delinquently, 2. to abstain from taking what is not given, which includes stealing, robbery, fraud, deceitfulness, and dishonesty, and 3. to abstain from sexual misconduct. Positively formulated, right action means to act kindly and compassionately, to be honest, to respect the belongings of others, and to keep sexual relationships harmless to others. Further details regarding the concrete meaning of right action can be found in the Precepts. [back to the top]<br><br>5. Right Livelihood<br><br>Right livelihood means that one should earn one's living in a righteous way and that wealth should be gained legally and peacefully. The Buddha mentions four specific activities that harm other beings and that one should avoid for this reason: 1. dealing in weapons, 2. dealing in living beings (including raising animals for slaughter as well as slave trade and prostitution), 3. working in meat production and butchery, and 4. selling intoxicants and poisons, such as alcohol and drugs. Furthermore any other occupation that would violate the principles of right speech and right action should be avoided. [back to the top]<br><br>6. Right Effort<br><br>Right effort can be seen as a prerequisite for the other principles of the path. Without effort, which is in itself an act of will, nothing can be achieved, whereas misguided effort distracts the mind from its task, and confusion will be the consequence. Mental energy is the force behind right effort; it can occur in either wholesome or unwholesome states. The same type of energy that fuels desire, envy, aggression, and violence can on the other side fuel self-discipline, honesty, benevolence, and kindness. Right effort is detailed in four types of endeavors that rank in ascending order of perfection: 1. to prevent the arising of unarisen unwholesome states, 2. to abandon unwholesome states that have already arisen, 3. to arouse wholesome states that have not yet arisen, and 4. to maintain and perfect wholesome states already arisen. [back to the top]<br><br>7. Right Mindfulness<br><br>Right mindfulness is the controlled and perfected faculty of cognition. It is the mental ability to see things as they are, with clear consciousness. Usually, the cognitive process begins with an impression induced by perception, or by a thought, but then it does not stay with the mere impression. Instead, we almost always conceptualize sense impressions and thoughts immediately. We interpret them and set them in relation to other thoughts and experiences, which naturally go beyond the facticity of the original impression. The mind then posits concepts, joins concepts into constructs, and weaves those constructs into complex interpretative schemes. All this happens only half consciously, and as a result we often see things obscured. Right mindfulness is anchored in clear perception and it penetrates impressions without getting carried away. Right mindfulness enables us to be aware of the process of conceptualization in a way that we actively observe and control the way our thoughts go. Buddha accounted for this as the four foundations of mindfulness: 1. contemplation of the body, 2. contemplation of feeling (repulsive, attractive, or neutral), 3. contemplation of the state of mind, and 4. contemplation of the phenomena. [back to the top]<br><br>8. Right Concentration<br><br>The eighth principle of the path, right concentration, refers to the development of a mental force that occurs in natural consciousness, although at a relatively low level of intensity, namely concentration. Concentration in this context is described as one-pointedness of mind, meaning a state where all mental faculties are unified and directed onto one particular object. Right concentration for the purpose of the eightfold path means wholesome concentration, i.e. concentration on wholesome thoughts and actions. The Buddhist method of choice to develop right concentration is through the practice of meditation. The meditating mind focuses on a selected object. It first directs itself onto it, then sustains concentration, and finally intensifies concentration step by step. Through this practice it becomes natural to apply elevated levels concentration also in everyday situations. [back to the top]<br></div>

He is the Mighty, the Wise One.<br><br>His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He ordains life and death and has power over all things.<br><br>He is the first and the last, the visible and the unseen. He has knowledge of all things.<br><br>He created the heavens and the earth in six days and then mounted His throne. He knows all that goes into the earth and all that emerges from it, all that comes down from heaven and all that ascends to it. He is with you wherever you are. He is cognizant of all your actions.<br><br>His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. To Him shall all things return. He causes the night to pass into the day and the day into the night. He has knowledge of the inmost thoughts of men.<br><br>24:34 Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth. His light may be compared to a niche that enshrines a lamp, the lamp within a crystal of star-like brilliance. It is lit from a blessed olive tree neither eastern nor western. Its very oil would almost shine forth, though no fire touched it. Light upon light; Allah guides to His light whom He will.<br><br>24:36 As for the unbelievers, their works are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty traveler thinks it is water, but when he comes near he finds that it is nothing. He finds Allah there, who pays him back in full. Swift is Allah's reckoning.<br><br>Or like darkness on a bottomless ocean spread with clashing billows and overcast with clouds: darkness upon darkness. If he stretches out his hand he can scarcely see it. Indeed the man from whom Allah withholds His light shall find no light at all.<br><br>50:12 We created man. We know the promptings of his soul, and are closer to him than the vein of his neck.<br><br>86:11 For every soul there is a guardian watching over it. Let man reflect from what he is created. He is created from an ejected fluid that issues from between the loins and the ribs.<br><br>10:80 We are the witnesses of all your thoughts and all your prayers and all your actions. Not an atom's weight in earth or heaven escapes your Lord, nor is there any object smaller or greater, but is recorded in a glorious book.<br><br>58:7 Are you not aware that Allah knows what the heavens and the earth contain? If three men talk in secret together, He is their fourth; if four, He is their fifth; ii five, He is their sixth; whether fewer or more, wherever they be, He is with them. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of their doings. Allah has knowledge of all things.<br><br>7:22 Children of Adam! We have given you clothing with which to cover your nakedness, and garments pleasing to the eye, but the finest of all these is the robe of piety.<br><br>39:43 When evil befalls man he calls upon Us; but when We vouch- safe him Our favor, he says: "It is my due." By no means! It is but a test: yet most men do not know it.<br><br>56:56 It was We that ordained death among you. Nothing can hinder Us from replacing you by others like yourselves or transforming you into beings you know nothing of.<br><br>21:311 Every soul shall taste death. We will prove you all with good and evil. To Us you shell be recalled.<br><br>39:39 Allah takes away men's souls upon their death, and the souls of the living during their sleep. Those that are doomed He keeps with Him and restores the others for a time ordained. Surely there are signs in this for thinking men.<br><br>32:13 Had it been Our Will, We would have guided every soul. But My word shall be fulfilled: "I will fill the pit of Hell with jinn and men."<br><br>35:11 Praise be to Allah, the Creator of heaven and earth! He sends forth the angels as His messengers, with two, three or four airs of wings. He Multiplies His creatures according to His will. Allah has power over all things.<br><br>2:98 Say: "Whoever is an enemy of Gabriel" (who has by Allah's grace revealed to you the Koran as a guide and joyful tidings for the faithful, confirming previous scriptures) "whoever is on enemy of Allah, His angels, or His apostles, or of Gabriel or Michael, shall make Allah Himself his enemy: Allah is the enemy of the unbelievers."<br><br>70:1 No power can hinder Allah from punishing them. He is the Lord of the Ladders, by which the angels and the Spirit will ascend to him in one day: a day whose space is fifty thousand years.<br><br>53:24 Numerous are the angels in the heavens; yet their intercession shall avail nothing until Allah gives leave to whom He accepts and chooses.<br><br>Those that disbelieve in the life to come call the angels by the names of females. Yet of this they have no knowledge: they follow mere conjecture, and conjecture is no substitute for truth.<br><br>43:13 They regard as females the angels who are Allah's servants. Did they witness their creation? Their claims shall be noted down. They shall be closely questioned.<br><br>2:29 When your Lord said to the angels: "I am placing on the earth one that shall rule as My deputy," they replied: "Will You put there one that will do evil and shed blood, when we have for so long sung Your praises and sanctified Your name?"<br><br>He said: "I know what you do not know."<br><br>He taught Adam the names of all things and then set them before the Angels, saying: "Tell Me the names of these, if what you say be true."<br><br>"Glory to You," they replied, "we have no knowledge except that which you have given us. You alone are wise and all-knowing."<br><br>Then said He to Adam: "Tell them their names." And when Adam had named them, He said: "Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of heaven and earth, and all that you hide and all that you reveal?"<br><br>And when We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourselves before Adam," they all prostrated themselves except Satan, who in his pride refused and became an unbeliever.<br><br>7:8 "Why did you not prostrate yourself?" Allah asked.<br><br>"I am nobler than Adam," he replied. "You created me of fire and him of clay."<br><br>THE EXORDIUM<br><br>IN THE NAME OF ALLAH THE COMPASSIONATE THE MERCIFUL<br><br>Praise be to Allah, Lord of Creation, The Compassionate, the Merciful, King of Judgment-day!

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.illuminatedlantern.com/tao/jpg/lam.jpg"><br><br>What is Taoism?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Taoism is philosophy. It is spirituality. It is religion. It is logic. It is intuition. It is science. It is myth. It is archetype. It is all of these things and none of these things - and can be so because it transcends, yet includes each of them.<br><br>Taoism arose in some of the most earlycultures of humankind, in ancient China, and is an understanding of the cosmos and reality which is one of the most fundamental; yet also one the most fearlessly true. From many people Taoism is the most essential understanding of reality which human perception can realize. It is neither fully intellectual nor fully intuitive. It is about the source of what guides the cosmos. It is beyond God or gods, beyond organized religion, beyond cultures, beyond philosophy, and even beyond spirituality.<br><br>At its deepest level, Taoism speaks about the non-anthropological, non-deistic guiding source behind all understanding. It is not about beginnings or endings, pre-worlds or after-worlds, and finds such human inventions and fantasies mute points. True Taoism sees such preoccupations as being beyond discernment and not connected to true reality, and so doesn't bother trying to invent expalinations. Taoism says we have enough to do being authentic and vital, compassionate and ethical in real life, right here, right now, so why invent other worlds or ruling forces we aren't even certain exist. Such actions just complicate matters and confuse our minds.<br><br>Taoism says be natural, follow nature's principles, and attain an enlightened and empowered penetration into reality, then one can achieve a life of happiness and tranquility which far surpasses anything that all of humankind's wile and cleverness can devise.<br><br>THE MYSTERIOUS GATE<br><br>The mysterious gate has many names. Some call it the 'alter of wisdom', and say it embodies limitless compassion. They say it arises when one is totally without grasping desires and mimics the way of heaven. Others say the mysterious gate is the 'spirit mountain', the empty consciousness of 'original mind', or 'nirvana,' the ultimate consciousness. Others say it is the 'golden palace' and the 'golden pill', the domain of the 'Three Pure Realms' and the root of all things.<br><br>And though the mysterious gate is called different things by different people, the state of mind which it is alluding to is the same. People speak through different cultural expressions and frames of references arising from their varying cultures. What they know about, they use to describe the mysterious gate.<br><br>Some say that when the mysterious gate opens, the sage emerges. Some say when the mysterious gate is opened a Buddha emerges. Some say when the mysterious gate opens the immortal emerges.<br><br>The mysterious gate is guarded by some as a hidden secret, never to be revealed to others who are uninitiated into their particular order. Yet, this kind of mind-set and attitude is just 'ignorance' and 'egoism' trying to make the "initiated" people higher than others. In reality the mysterious gate is open to all people at all times. It is a great and wonderful "secret", but it cannot be guarded and possessed. It is the consciousness opening to deeper levels.<br><br>Some say the mysterious gate is some particular spot in the body. They say it is between the eyebrows, or at the center of the head, or in the chest, or in the lower belly. But this level of vision is just lack of understanding. Such erroneous conceptions happen because people experience their consciousness in different ways, at different times and in different degrees of depth.<br><br>The real mysterious gate is not about a specific location in the body, it is about an attitude and perspective which arises when the mind and body are joined together and transcending to deeper wisdom. To believe it is just the body is a false and misleading conclusion. Yet, to believe that the mysterious gate is just in the mind is also a false conception.<br><br>The only way to perceive the mysterious gate is to use both the whole mind and whole body as one. The mysterious gate can only be approached when one is undivided. The mysterious gate is the gate of no gate, the passage which has no opening, the doorway that goes nowhere, yet opens forever the eyes to true reality.<br><br>GUIDELINES FOR A MODERN TAOIST<br><br>Respect life. Don't be judgmental of what you don't understand.<br>Take conscious responsibility for your own life. Do not blame others.<br>Strive to learn and grow. Cultivate yourself physically, mentally, and spiritually.<br>Let go of the need to be superior to others and always do right.<br>Strive to act from a positive spirit and let negative energy go.<br>Understand that you are how you think and act - not the fantasy you have of yourself. Strive to manifest your inner being in the outer world.<br>Don't try to manipulate others. Let the true state of being create the changes.<br>Don't try to change others to match your own wants. Accept people for what they are.<br>Strive to care about and know yourself, so that you many care and know others. Use empathy and compassion.<br>Strive to choose you own way. Don't blindly follow others or existing dogma without careful consideration.<br>Let go of the need to possess and control things whether the recipient of that control is objects, people, or nature.<br>Strive to help maintain the environment in a healthy state.<br>Strive to act without anger.<br>Strive to understand guilt and let it's "shoulds" and "don'ts" transform to interest and caring.<br>Strive to maintain an open mind.<br>Seek sharing and cooperation. Let divisiveness and separation go.<br>Seek naturalness. Act without forcing.<br>Choose positive assertiveness when it is called for. Let aggressiveness and obnoxious egotism go.<br>Choose mindfulness, not speediness and lack of awareness.<br>Act ethically. Treat others as you would like to be treated.<br>Strive to see with a sense of perspective. Act with an overview.<br>Seek the highest good. Strive to know unity and tranquility.<br>Cherish peace.<br>Cherish cherishing.<br>The teachings of the great sages of Taoism say:<br><br>See through the illusions and cultural partialities of life and understand what true unbiasedness is.<br>If one understands the principles of yin and yang, then you can master the foundations of heaven and earth.<br>Empty your mind and fill your soul. Raise your spirit and seek the golden inner source and essence.</div>

Its roots lie in the deepest beliefs and aspirations of all great religions, thus encompassing a religious heritage as old and as varied as man himself.<br><br>Though drawing upon the wisdom of some 50,000 years, Scientology is a new religion, one which has isolated fundamental laws of life and, for the first time, developed a workable technology that can be applied to help one achieve a happier and more spiritual existence. Scientology is therefore something one does, not merely something one believes in Â— an important point which will be greatly clarified as you continue reading.<br><br>That ScientologyÂ’s development and rapid promulgation was made possible, in part, by advances in the physical sciences through the first half of the twentieth century is significant. Scientology constitutes manÂ’s first real application of scientific methodology to spiritual questions.<br><br>Thanks to scientific and technical advances over the last hundred years, most people are today materially wealthier than their forefathers. Yet, by their own accounts, the improvement in the quality of their lives has not matched their material gains. In fact, it may be argued that people once were happier and more fulfilled. For some, material affluence breeds anxiety, a gnawing fear that if someone doesnÂ’t take away their hard-earned acquisitions, the end of their days will prematurely arrive to finish the job. Others find death easier to face than a lifetime of assembly-line slavery, while most, in a less dramatic fashion, simply buckle down to lives of quiet desperation.<br><br>Most individuals have no real grasp of the factors governing their existence. And yet, simply stated, if they had a greater understanding of themselves and their fellows they would be able to improve conditions and thus live happier lives. This, then, is the purpose of Scientology: to enable man to improve his lot through understanding.<br><br>Before Scientology, the tremendous scientific advances of this era were not matched by similar advances in the humanities. ManÂ’s knowledge of the physical universe had far outdistanced his knowledge of himself. The resulting pressures from such an imbalance account for much that has unsettled society and threatens our future. What Scientology represented to many when it appeared in the early 1950s was a restoration of the balance.<br><br>Despite its many successes, science has not provided answers to questions man has been asking himself since time immemorial: Who are we? What do we consist of? Where do we come from? Where are we going? What are we doing? These questions have always been the province of philosophy and religion, but traditional answers became inadequate in the face of the H-bomb. Scientology, drawing on the same advances in knowledge that led to the understanding of nuclear physics, provides modern answers to these questions. And it supplied workable methods of application which made it possible for man to reach the ancient goal he has been striving toward for thousands of years: to know himself and, in knowing himself, to know and understand other people and, ultimately, life itself.<br><br>Scientology is a religion. It holds in common many of the beliefs of other religions and philosophies. Scientology considers man to be a spiritual being, with more to him than flesh and blood. This, of course, is a very different view to that espoused by prevailing scientific thought which views man as only a material object, a complex combination of chemical compounds and stimulus-response mechanisms.<br><br>Scientology believes man to be basically good, not evil. It is manÂ’s experiences that have led him to commit evil deeds, not his nature. Often, he mistakenly seeks to solve his problems by considering only his own interests, which then causes trouble for both himself and others. Scientology believes that man advances to the degree he preserves his spiritual integrity and values, and remains honest and decent. Indeed, he deteriorates to the degree he abandons these qualities.<br><br>But because man is basically good he is capable of spiritual betterment, and it is the goal of Scientology to bring him to a point where he is capable of sorting out the factors in his own life and solving his own problems. Other efforts to help man have tried to solve his problems for him and in this respect Scientology is different. Scientology believes that an individual placed in a position where he can increase his abilities, where he can confront life better, where he can identify the factors in his life more easily, is also in a position to solve his own problems and so better his own life.<br><br>Dianetics constituted L. Ron HubbardÂ’s first breakthrough, and it was his initial discoveries in this area which led to further researches and the exact isolation of the source of life itself. Man does not have a spirit. He is a spirit. He has a mind and he has a body. Dianetics addresses and handles the effects of the spirit on the body. Dianetics thus helps provide relief from unwanted sensations and emotions, accidents and psychosomatic illnesses (ailments caused or aggravated by mental stress).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.scientology.org/pics/std/religion/background-origins/pg005b.jpg"><br><br>The word Scientology is taken from the Latin scio, which means "knowing in the fullest sense of the word," and the Greek word logos, meaning "study of." It literally means "knowing how to know." Scientology itself is defined as "The study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, universes and other life."<br><br>Scientology addresses the spiritual being. It directly raises his awareness and ability, and by so doing, he also becomes increasingly able to overcome the negative factors that impair him.<br><br>In over half a century of investigation, Mr. Hubbard isolated many, many fundamental truths about life, leading to his development of Scientology and the subsequent growth of the Scientology religion.<br><br>Life has tended to force the individual into certain values. The stresses of existence have tended to fixate his attention to a point where his awareness of himself and his environment has been greatly diminished. Attendant to this lowered spiritual awareness are problems, difficulties with others, illness and unhappiness. The goal of Scientology is to reverse this diminishing awareness and, in that sense, wake the individual up. As one becomes more and more alert, his abilities increase and he is capable of greater understanding and thus better able to handle his life.<br><br>Scientology, then, contains solutions to the problems of living. Its end result is increased awareness and spiritual freedom for the individual and rehabilitation of his basic decency, power and ability. It can and does accomplish these ends routinely, daily, all over the world.<br><br>The source and founder of the Scientology religion is L. Ron Hubbard, who devoted his life to finding answers to questions that have troubled mankind for millennia. Mr. HubbardÂ’s intellectual rigor, his curiosity and boundless spirit of adventure inspired his search, even as a young man.<br><br>The first widely released results of Mr. HubbardÂ’s researches did not lie in Scientology, however, but in another field of endeavor, "Dianetics." The word Dianetics comes from the Greek words dia, meaning "through" and nous, meaning "soul," and is defined as "what the soul is doing to the body."<br><br>A testament to the truths contained in Scientology lies in the fact that the Scientology religion flourishes on every continent with thousands of churches, missions and groups touching millions of lives daily. Found in every facet of society, Scientologists are businessmen, housewives, students, artists, celebrities, laborers, scholars, soldiers, doctors, policemen and on and on.<br><br>Scientologists, ever involved in the world around them, naturally share with others what they have learned in Scientology. Others, seeing the relevance Scientology can have in their lives too, also become interested in what Scientology can offer them. And so Scientology grows, in much the same way as every great religion in history has grown, from individual to individual, bringing knowledge, wisdom and hope for a better life.<br><br>With Scientology, millions know life can be a worthwhile proposition, that man can live a fulfilled life in harmony with others and that the world can be a happier place. Scientologists work to create such a world every day, joined by others who share this dream. The undeniable relevance of Scientology to the lives of these millions assures its permanence in our society. Millions upon millions more will follow in this quest to create a better world.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>but, however, nevertheless, somehow, Einstein is of the theory that<br>the.....   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Physical Meaning of Geometrical Propositions<br><br>Geometry sets out from certain conceptions such as Â“plane,Â” Â“point,Â” and Â“straight line,Â” with which we are able to associate more or less definite ideas, and from certain simple propositions (axioms) which, in virtue of these ideas, we are inclined to accept as Â“true.Â” Then, on the basis of a logical process, the justification of which we feel ourselves compelled to admit, all remaining propositions are shown to follow from those axioms, i.e. they are proven. A proposition is then correct (Â“trueÂ”) when it has been derived in the recognised manner from the axioms. The question of the Â“truthÂ” of the individual geometrical propositions is thus reduced to one of the Â“truthÂ” of the axioms. Now it has long been known that the last question is not only unanswerable by the methods of geometry, but that it is in itself entirely without meaning. We cannot ask whether it is true that only one straight line goes through two points. We can only say that Euclidean geometry deals with things called Â“straight line,Â” to each of which is ascribed the property of being uniquely determined by two points situated on it. The concept Â“trueÂ” does not tally with the assertions of pure geometry, because by the word Â“trueÂ” we are eventually in the habit of designating always the correspondence with a Â“realÂ” object; geometry, however, is not concerned with the relation of the ideas involved in it to objects of experience, but only with the logical connection of these ideas among themselves.    2<br>It is not difficult to understand why, in spite of this, we feel constrained to call the propositions of geometry Â“true.Â” Geometrical ideas correspond to more or less exact objects in nature, and these last are undoubtedly the exclusive cause of the genesis of those ideas. Geometry ought to refrain from such a course, in order to give to its structure the largest possible logical unity. The practice, for example, of seeing in a Â“distanceÂ” two marked positions on a practically rigid body is something which is lodged deeply in our habit of thought. We are accustomed further to regard three points as being situated on a straight line, if their apparent positions can be made to coincide for observation with one eye, under suitable choice of our place of observation.    3<br>If, in pursuance of our habit of thought, we now supplement the propositions of Euclidean geometry by the single proposition that two points on a practically rigid body always correspond to the same distance (line-interval), independently of any changes in position to which we may subject the body, the propositions of Euclidean geometry then resolve themselves into propositions on the possible relative position of practically rigid bodies. 1 Geometry which has been supplemented in this way is then to be treated as a branch of physics. We can now legitimately ask as to the Â“truthÂ” of geometrical propositions interpreted in this way, since we are justified in asking whether these propositions are satisfied for those real things we have associated with the geometrical ideas. In less exact terms we can express this by saying that by the Â“truthÂ” of a geometrical proposition in this sense we understand its validity for a construction with ruler and compasses.    4<br>Of course the conviction of the Â“truthÂ” of geometrical propositions in this sense is founded exclusively on rather incomplete experience. For the present we shall assume the Â“truthÂ” of the geometrical propositions, then at a later stage (in the general theory of relativity) we shall see that this Â“truthÂ” is limited, and we shall consider the extent of its limitation.    5<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Izzac Newton is of the firm belief and opinion that<br><br>AXIOMS, OR LAWS OF MOTION...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>LAW I.<br>Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon.<br><br>PROJECTILES persevere in their motions, so far as they are not retarded by the resistance of the air, or impelled downwards by the force of gravity. A top, whose parts by their cohesion are perpetually drawn aside from rectilinear motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is retarded by the air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting with less resistance in more free spaces, preserve their motions both progressive and circular for a much longer time.<br><br>LAW II.<br>The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.<br><br>If any force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impressed altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And this motion (being always directed the same way with the generating force), if the body moved before, is added to or subtracted from the former motion, according as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other; or obliquely joined, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion compounded from the determination of both.<br><br>LAW III.<br>To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction; or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.<br><br>Whatever draws or presses another is as much drawn or pressed by that other. If you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone. If a horse draws a stone tied to a rope, the horse (if I may so say) will be equally drawn back towards the stone: for the distended rope, by the same endeavour to relax or unbend itself, will draw the horse as much towards the stone as it does the stone towards the horse, and will obstruct the progress of the one as much as it advances that of the other.<br><br>If a body impinges upon another, and by its force change the motion of the other, that body also (became of the quality of, the mutual pressure) will undergo an equal change, in its own motion, towards the contrary part. The changes made by these actions are equal, not in the velocities but in the motions of bodies; that is to say, if the bodies are not hindered by any other impediments. For, because the motions are equally changed, the changes of the velocities made towards contrary parts are reciprocally proportional to the bodies. This law takes place also in attractions, as will be proved in the next scholium.<br><br>COROLLARY I.<br>A body by two forces conjoined will describe the diagonal of a parallelogram, in the same time that it would describe the sides, by those forces apart.<br><br>If a body in a given time, by the force M impressed apart in the place A, should with an uniform motion be carried from A to B; and by the force N impressed apart in the same place, should be carried from A to C; complete the parallelogram ABCD, and, by both forces acting together, it will in the same time be carried in the diagonal from A to D. For since the force N acts in the direction of the line AC, parallel to BD, this force (by the second law) will not at all alter the velocity generated by the other force M, by which the body is carried towards the line BD. The body therefore will arrive at the line BD in the same time, whether the force N be impressed or not; and therefore at the end of that time it will be found somewhere in the line BD. By the same argument, at the end of the same time it will be found somewhere in the line CD. Therefore it will be found in the point D, where both lines meet. But it will move in a right line from A to D, by Law I.<br><br>COROLLARY II.<br>And hence is explained the composition of any one direct force AD, out of any two oblique forces AC and CD; and, on the contrary, the resolution of any one direct force AD into two oblique forces AC and CD: which composition and resolution are abundantly confirmed from mechanics.<br><br>As if the unequal radii OM and ON drawn from the centre O of any wheel, should sustain the weights A and P by the cords MA and NP; and the forces of those weights to move the wheel were required. Through the centre O draw the right line KOL, meeting the cords perpendicularly in K and L; and from the centre O, with OL the greater of the distances OK and OL, describe a circle, meeting the cord MA in D: and drawing OD, make AC parallel and DC perpendicular thereto. Now, it being indifferent whether the points K, L, D, of the cords be fixed to the plane of the wheel or not, the weights will have the same effect whether they are suspended from the points K and L, or from D and L. Let the whole force of the weight A be represented by the line AD, and let it be resolved into the forces AC and CD; of which the force AC, drawing the radius OD directly from the centre, will have no effect to move the wheel: but the other force DC, drawing the radius DO perpendicularly, will have the same effect as if it drew perpendicularly the radius OL equal to OD; that is, it will have the same effect as the weight P, if that weight is to the weight A as the force DC is to the force DA; that is (because of the similar triangles ADC, DOK), as OK to OD or OL. Therefore the weights A and P, which are reciprocally as the radii OK and OL that lie in the same right line, will be equipollent, and so remain in equilibrio; which is the well known property of the balance, the lever, and the wheel. If either weight is greater than in this ratio, its force to move the wheel will be so much greater.<br><br>If the weight p, equal to the weight P, is partly suspended by the cord Np, partly sustained by the oblique plane pG; draw pH, NH, the former perpendicular to the horizon, the latter to the plane pG; and if the force of the weight p tending downwards is represented by the line pH, it may be resolved into the forces pN, HN. If there was any plane pQ, perpendicular to the cord pN, cutting the other plane pG in a line parallel to the horizon, and the weight p was supported only by those planes pQ, pG, it would press those planes perpendicularly with the forces pN, HN; to wit, the plane pQ with the force pN, and the plane pG with the force HN. And therefore if the plane pQ was taken away, so that the weight might stretch the cord, because the cord, now sustaining the weight, supplies the place of the plane that was removed, it will be strained by the same force pN which pressed upon the plane before. Therefore, the tension of this oblique cord pN will be to that of the other perpendicular cord PN as pN to pH. And therefore if the weight p is to the weight A in a ratio compounded of the reciprocal ratio of the least distances of the cords PN, AM, from the centre of the wheel, and of the direct ratio of pH to pN, the weights will have the effect towards moving the wheel and will therefore sustain each other; as any one may find by experiment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">1.0 - The Fundamental Properties of the Universe</span></span><br>If you want to describe the universe as we know it in its most basic terms, you could say that it consists of a handful of properties. We are all familiar with these properties - so familiar, in fact, that we take them completely for granted. However, under special relativity many of these properties behave in very unexpected ways! Let's review the fundamental properties of the universe so that we are clear about them.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Space</span><br><strong>Space </strong>is the three dimensional representation of everything we observe and everything that occurs. Space allows objects to have lengths in the left/right, up/down, and forward/backward directions.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Time</span><br><strong>Time </strong>is a fourth dimension. In normal life, time is a tool we use to measure the procession of events of space. But time is something more. Yes, we use time as a "tool", but time is essential for our physical existence. Space and time when used to describe events can't be clearly separated. Therefore, space and time are woven together in a symbiotic manner. Having one without the other has no meaning in our physical world. To be redundant, without space, time would be useless to us and without time, space would be useless to us. This mutual dependence is known as the Spacetime Continuum. It means that any occurrence in our universe is an event of Space and Time. In Special Relativity, spacetime does not require the notion of a universal time component. The time component for events that are viewed by people in motion with respect to each other will be different. As you will see later, spacetime is the death of the concept of simultaneity.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Matter</span><br><strong>Matter </strong>in the most fundamental definition is anything that takes up space. Any object you can see, touch, or move by applying a force is matter. Most people probably remember from school that matter is made up of millions of billions of tightly packed atoms. Water, for example, is the compound H2O, meaning two hydrogen atoms combined with one oxygen atom forms one molecule of water.<br><br>To fully understand matter let's look at the atom. It is now generally accepted that atoms are made up of three particles called neutrons, protons, and electrons. The neutrons and protons are found in the nucleus (center) of the atom and the electrons reside in a shell surrounding the nucleus. Neutrons are heavy particles, but they have no charge - they are neutral. Protons are also heavy particles and they have a positive charge. Electrons are light particles and they are negatively charged. There are many important features that arise from considering the number of these particles in each atom. For example, the number of protons an atom has will determine the atom's place on the periodic table, and it will determine how the atom behaves in the physical universe. (See the HSW article entitled "How Nuclear Radiation Works" for a further discussion of atoms and subatomic particles.)<br><br><span style="color: red;">Motion</span><br>Anything that is in the act of changing its location in space is said to be in motion. As you will see later, consideration of "motion" allows for or causes some very interesting concepts.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Mass</span><br><strong>Mass </strong>has two definitions that are equally important. One is a general definition that most high school students are taught and the other is a more technical definition that is used in physics.<br><br>Generally, mass is defined as the measure of how much matter an object or body contains - the total number of sub-atomic particles (electrons, protons and neutrons) in the object. If you multiply your mass by the pull of earth's gravity, you get your <strong>weight</strong>. So if your body weight is fluctuating, by eating or exercising, it is actually your mass that is changing. It is important to understand that mass is independent of your position in space. Your body's mass on the moon is the same as its mass on the earth. The earth's gravitational pull, on the other hand, decreases as you move farther away from the earth. Therefore, you can lose weight by changing your elevation, but your mass remains the same. You can also lose weight by living on the moon, but again your mass is the same.<br><br>In physics, mass is defined as the amount of force required to cause a body to accelerate. Mass is very closely related to energy in physics. Mass is dependent on the body's motion relative to the motion of an observer. If the body in motion measured its mass, it is always the same. However, if an observer that is not in motion with the body measures the body's mass, the observer would see an increase in mass when the object speeds up. This is called <strong>relativistic mass</strong>. It should be noted that physics has actually stopped using this concept of mass and now deals mostly in terms of energy (see the section on the unification of mass and energy) . At this stage, this definition of mass may be a little cloudy, but it is important to know the concept. It should become clearer in the special relativity discussion. The important thing to understand here is that there is a relationship between mass and energy.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Energy </span><br>Energy is the measure of a system's ability to perform "work". It exists in many formsÂ…potential, kinetic, etc. The law of conservation of energy tells us that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be converted from one form to another. These separate forms of energy are not conserved, but the total amount of energy is conserved. If you drop a baseball from your roof, the ball has kinetic energy the moment it starts to move. Just before you dropped the ball, it had only potential energy. As the ball moves, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Likewise, when the ball hits the ground, some of its energy is converted to heat (sometimes called heat energy or heat kinetic energy). If you go through each phase of this scenario and totaled up the energy for the system, you will find that the amount of energy for the system is the same at all times.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">Light</span><br><strong>Light </strong>is a form of energy, and exists in two conceptual frameworks: light exhibits properties that have characteristics of discrete particles (eg. energy is carried away in "chunks") and characteristics of waves (eg. diffraction). This split is known as duality. It is important to understand that this is not an "either/or" situation. Duality means that the characteristics of both waves and particles are present at the same time. The same beam of light will behave as a particle and/or as a wave depending on the experiment. Furthermore, the particle framework (chunks) can have interactions which can be described in terms of wave characteristics and the wave framework can have interactions that can be described in terms of particle characteristics. The particle form is known as a photon, and the waveform is known as <strong>electromagnetic radiation</strong>. First the photonÂ…<br><br>A photon is the light we see when an atom emits energy. In the model of an atom, electrons orbit a nucleus made of protons and neutrons. There are separate electron levels for the electrons orbiting the nucleus. Picture a basketball with several sizes of hula-hoops around it. The basketball would be the nucleus and the hula-hoops would be the possible electron levels. These surrounding levels can be referred to as orbitals. Each of these <strong>orbitals </strong>can only accept a discrete amount of energy. If an atom absorbs some energy, an electron in an orbital close to the nucleus (a lower energy level) will jump to an orbital that is farther away from the nucleus (a higher energy level). The atom is now said to be <strong>excited</strong>. This excitement generally will not last very long, and the electron will fall back into the lower shell. A packet of energy, called a photon or quanta, will be released. This emitted energy is equal to the difference between the high and low energy levels, and may be seen as light depending on its wave frequency, discussed below.<br><br>The wave form of light is actually a form of energy that is created by an oscillating charge. This charge consists of an oscillating electric field and an oscillating magnetic field, hence the name electromagnetic radiation. We should note that the two fields are oscillating perpendicular to each other. Light is only one form of electromagnetic radiation. All forms are classified on the electromagnetic spectrum by the number of complete oscillations per second that the electric and magnetic fields undergo, called <strong>frequency</strong>. The frequency range for visible light is only a small portion of the spectrum with violet and red being the highest and lowest frequencies respectively. Since violet light has a higher frequency than red, we say that it has more energy. If you go all the way out on the electromagnetic spectrum, you will see that gamma rays are the most energetic. This should come as no surprise since it is commonly known that gamma rays have enough energy to penetrate many materials. These rays are very dangerous because of the damage they can do to you biologically (See the HSW article entitled "How Nuclear Radiation Works" for a further discussion of gamma radiation.). The amount of energy is dependent on the frequency of the radiation. Visible electromagnetic radiation is what we commonly refer to as light, which can also be broken down into separate frequencies with corresponding energy levels for each color.<br><br>As light travels its path, through space, it often encounters matter in one form or another. We should all be familiar with reflection since we see bright reflections when a light hits a smooth shiny surface like a mirror. This is an example of light interacting with matter in a certain way. When light travels from one medium to another, the light bends. This is called refraction. If the medium, in the path of the light, bends the light or blocks certain frequencies of it, we can see separate colors. A rainbow, for example, occurs when the sun's light becomes separated by moisture in the air. The moisture bends the light, thus separating the frequencies and allowing us to see the unique colors of the light spectrum. Prisms also provide this effect. When light hits a prism at certain angles, the light will refract (bend), causing it to be separated into its individual frequencies. This effect occurs because of the shape of the prism and the angle of the light.<br><br><img src="http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/prism.gif"><br><img src="http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/relativity1.gif"><br><br>If you look closely at what happens as the light wave enters the prism in the second diagram, you will notice that it bends down. This bending occurs because the light travels faster through the air than it does through the prism. When the lower portion of the wave enters the prism, it slows down. Since the upper portion of the wave (still in the air) is traveling faster than the lower portion, the wave bends. Similarly, as the wave exits the prism, the upper portion exits first and begins travelling faster than the lower portion that is still in the prism. This speed differential causes the wave to bend once again. Think of a skateboard rider going down the driveway. If the rider turns and goes into the grass, his body will lunge forward and actually fly off of the board if he is traveling fast enough originally. This is analogous to light bending as it goes through different mediums. The skateboard and the rider are moving at the same speed until the wheels hit the grass. Now suddenly, the skateboard is traveling slower than the rider is, so the rider begins to bend forward (the rider is trying to continue traveling at the same speed he was before the wheels hit the grass).<br><br>Now that we have a little understanding of the composition of light, we can begin to resolve the oft under explained concept of "the speed of light". Since light itself is just a form of electromagnetic radiation, the speed of light is just an easy way of talking about the speed of electromagnetic radiation in general. If you think about it, the speed of light is the "speed of information". We can not acknowledge that an event has occurred until the information about that event reaches us. The information is contained in the electromagnetic radiation from the event via a radio signal, a flash of light etc. Any event is just an occurrence of space and time, and any information that can be transmitted about an event is emitted outward as radiation of some sort. The information (electromagnetic radiation) from the event travels at 186,000 miles/second in a vacuum. If you picture a long train that begins to move forward from a stopped position, you do not expect the very last car to begin moving instantaneously. There is an amount of time that passes before the last car begins to get pulled. Thus, there is an expected delay for last car to "receive" the information that the first car is moving and pulling. This delay is analogous to the transfer of information in special relativity, but SR only imposes an upper limit on the speed of the information; the speed of light. You can make the train example as detailed as you like, but regardless, you will always find that there can be no reaction without a time delay of at least the speed of light between the action and reaction. In the special relativity section we will further discuss the importance of this speed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: brown;">Holes in the Theory</span></span><br>The theory of evolution is just that -- a theory. According to "The American Heritage Dictionary," a theory is:<br><br><blockquote><span class="small">A set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena, especially one that has been repeatedly tested or is widely accepted and can be used to make predictions about natural phenomena. </span></blockquote>Evolution is a set of principles that tries to explain how life, in all its various forms, appeared on Earth. The theory of evolution succeeds in explaining why we see bacteria and mosquitoes becoming resistant to antibiotics and insecticides. It also successfully predicted, for example, that X-ray exposure would lead to thousands of mutations in fruit flies.<br><br>Many theories are works in progress, and evolution is one of them. There are several big questions that the theory of evolution cannot answer right now. This is not unusual. Newtonian physics worked really well for hundreds of years, and it still works well today for many types of problems. However, it does not explain lots of things that were eventually answered by Einstein and his theories of relativity. People create new theories and modify existing ones to explain the unexplained.<br><br>In answering the open questions that still remain unsolved, the theory of evolution will either become complete or it will be replaced by a new theory that better explains the phenomena we see in nature. That is how the scientific process works.<br><br>Here are three common questions that are asked about the current theory of evolution:<br><br>How does evolution add information to a genome to create progressively more complicated organisms?<br>How is evolution able to bring about drastic changes so quickly?<br>How could the first living cell arise spontaneously to get evolution started?<br><br>Let's look at each of these questions briefly in the following sections.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: brown;">Question 1: How Does Evolution Add Information?</span></span><br>The theory of evolution explains how strands of DNA change. An X-ray, cosmic ray, chemical reaction or similar mechanism can modify a base pair in the DNA strand to create a mutation, and this modification can lead to the creation of a new protein or enzyme.<br>The theory of evolution further proposes that billions of these mutations created all of the life forms we see today. An initial self-replicating molecule spontaneously formed. It evolved into single-cell organisms. These evolved into multi-cell organisms, which evolved into vertebrates like fish, and so on. In the process, DNA structures evolved from the asexual single-strand format found in bacteria today into the dual-strand chromosomal format found in all higher life forms. The number of chromosomes also proliferated. For example, fruit flies have five chromosomes, mice have 20, humans have 23 and dogs have 39.<br><br>Evolution's mutation mechanism does not explain how growth of a genome is possible. How can <strong>point mutations </strong>create new chromosomes or lengthen a strand of DNA? It is interesting to note that, in all of the selective breeding in dogs, there has been no change to the basic dog genome. All breeds of dog can still mate with one another. People have not seen any increase in dog's DNA, but have simply selected different genes from the existing dog gene pool to create the different breeds.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One line of research in this area focuses on <strong>transposons</strong>, or transposable elements, also referred to as "<strong>jumping genes</strong>." A transposon is a gene that is able to move or copy itself from one chromosome to another. The book "Molecular Biology of the Cell" puts it this way:<br><br><blockquote><span class="small">Transposable elements have also contributed to genome diversity in another way. When two transposable elements that are recognized by the same site-specific recombination enzyme (transposase) integrate into neighboring chromosomal sites, the DNA between them can become subject to transposition by the transposase. Because this provides a particularly effective pathway for the duplication and movement of exons (exon shuffling), these elements can help create new genes.</span></blockquote>Another area of research involves <strong>polyploidy</strong>. Through the process of polyploidy, the total number of chromosomes can double, or a single chromosome can duplicate itself. This process is fairly common in plants, and explains why some plants can have as many as 100 chromosomes.<br><br>The amount of research in this area is truly remarkable and is teaching scientists amazing things about DNA. The following links give you a taste of that research, and are interesting if you would like to learn more about these topics:<br><br>Maize as a model for evolution<br>Using Jumping Genes to Elucidate Gene Function<br>Speciation by Polyploidy<br>Genomes Online Database<br>Genome Evolution Search Engine Query<br>Studies in Probabilistic Sequence Alignment and Evolution<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: brown;">Question 2: How Can Evolution Be So Quick?</span></span><br>Imagine that you create a very large cage and put a group of mice into it. You let the mice live and breed in this cage freely, without disturbance. If you were to come back after five years and look into this cage, you would find mice. Five years of breeding would cause no change in the mice in that cage -- they would not evolve in any noticeable way. You could leave the cage alone for a hundred years and look in again and what you would find in the cage is mice. After several hundred years, you would look into the cage and find not 15 new species, but mice.<br>The point is that evolution in general is an extremely slow process. When two mice breed, the offspring is a mouse. When that offspring breeds, its offspring is a mouse. When that offspring breeds... And the process continues. Point mutations do not change this fact in any significant way over the short haul.<br><br>Carl Sagan, in "The Dragons of Eden," put it this way:<br><br><span class="small"><blockquote>The time scale for evolutionary or genetic change is very long. A characteristic period for the emergence of one advanced species from another is perhaps a hundred thousand years; and very often the difference in behavior between closely related species -- say, lions and tigers -- does not seem very great. An example of recent evolution of organ systems in humans is our toes. The big toe plays an important function in balance while walking; the other toes have much less obvious utility. They are clearly evolved from fingerlike appendages for grasping and swinging, like those of arboreal apes and monkeys. This evolution constitutes a respecialization -- the adaptation of an organ system originally evolved for one function to another and quite different function -- which required about ten million years to emerge.</blockquote></span><br><br>The fact that it takes evolution 100,000 or 10 million years to make relatively minor changes in existing structures shows just how slow evolution really is. The creation of a new species is time consuming.<br><br>On the other hand, we know that evolution can move extremely quickly to create a new species. One example of the speed of evolution involves the progress mammals have made. You have probably heard that, about 65 million years ago, all of the dinosaurs died out quite suddenly. One theory for this massive extinction is an asteroid strike. For dinosaurs, the day of the asteroid strike was a bad one, but for mammals it was a good day. The disappearance of the dinosaurs cleared the playing field of most predators. Mammals began to thrive and differentiate.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: brown;">Example: The Evolution of Mammals</span></span><br>65 million years ago, mammals were much simpler than they are today. A representative mammal of the time was the species Didelphodon, a smallish, four-legged creature similar to today's opossum.<br><br>In 65 million years, according to the theory of evolution, every mammal that we see today (over 4,000 species) evolved from small, four-legged creatures like Didelphodon.

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's take Carl Sagan's statement that "A characteristic period for the emergence of one advanced species from another is perhaps a hundred thousand years, and very often the difference in behavior between closely related species -- say, lions and tigers -- does not seem very great." In 65 million years, there are only 650 periods of 100,000 years -- that's 650 "ticks" of the evolutionary clock.<br><br>Imagine trying to start with an opossum and get to an elephant in 650 increments or less, even if every increment were perfect. An elephant's brain is hundreds of times bigger than an opossum's, containing hundreds of times more neurons, all perfectly wired. An elephant's trunk is a perfectly formed prehensile appendage containing 150,000 muscle elements (reference). Starting with a snout like that of an opossum, evolution used random mutations to design the elephant's snout in only 650 ticks. Imagine trying to get from an opossum to a brown bat in 650 increments. Or from an opossum to a whale. Whales have no pelvis, have flukes, have very weird skulls (especially the sperm whale), have blow holes up top, have temperature control that allows them to swim in arctic waters and they consume salt water rather than fresh. It is difficult for many people to imagine that sort of speed given the current theory.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: brown;">Example: The Evolution of the Human Brain</span></span><br>Here is another example of the speed problem. Current fossil evidence indicates that modern humans evolved from a species called Homo erectus. Homo erectus appeared about 2 million years ago. Looking at the skull of Homo erectus, we know that its brain size was on the order of 800 or 900 cubic centimeters (CCs).<br><br><img src="http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/evolution-timeline.jpg"><br><br>Modern human brain size averages about 1,500 CCs or so. In other words, in about 2 million years, evolution roughly doubled the size of the Homo erectus brain to create the human brain that we have today. Our brains contain approximately 100 billion neurons today, so in 2 million years, evolution added 50 billion neurons to the Homo erectus brain (while at the same time redesigning the skull to accommodate all of those neurons and redesigning the female pelvis to let the larger skull through during birth, etc.).<br><br><img src="http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/evolution-skull.jpg"><br><br>Let's assume that Homo erectus was able to reproduce every 10 years. That means that, in 2 million years, there were 200,000 generations of Homo erectus possible. There are four possible explanations for where the 50 billion new neurons came from in 200,000 generations:<br><br>Every generation, 250,000 new neurons were added to the Homo erectus brain (250,000 * 200,000 = 50 billion).<br>Every 100,000 years, 2.5 billion new neurons were added to the Homo erectus brain (2,500,000,000 * 20 = 50 billion).<br>Perhaps 500,000 years ago, there was a spurt of 20 or so closely-spaced generations that added 2.5 billion neurons per generation.<br>One day, spontaneously, 50 billion new neurons were added to the Homo erectus brain to create the Homo sapiens brain.<br><br>None of these scenarios is particularly comfortable. We see no evidence that evolution is randomly adding 250,000 neurons to each child born today, so that explanation is hard to swallow. The thought of adding a large package of something like 2.5 billion neurons in one step is difficult to imagine, because there is no way to explain how the neurons would wire themselves in. What sort of point mutation would occur in a DNA molecule that would suddenly create billions of new neurons and wire them correctly?* The current theory of evolution does not predict how this could happen.<br>One line of current research is looking at the effect of very small changes in DNA patterns during embryonic development. Any new animal, be it a mouse or a human, starts life as a single cell. That cell differentiates and develops into the complete animal. A tremendous amount of signaling happens between cells during the development process to ensure that everything ends up in the right place. Tiny changes in these signaling processes can have very large effects on the resulting animal. This is how the human genome, with at most 60,000 or so genes, is able to specify the creation of a human body containing trillions of cells, billions of carefully wired neurons and hundreds of different cell types all brilliantly sculpted into organs as diverse as the heart and the eyes. The book "Molecular Biology of the Cell" puts it this way:<br><br><span class="small"><blockquote>Humans, as a genus distinct from the great apes, have existed for only a few million years. Each human gene has therefore had the chance to accumulate relatively few nucleotide changes since our inception, and most of these have been eliminated by natural selection. A comparison of humans and monkeys, for example, shows that their cytochrome-c molecules differ in about 1 percent and their hemoglobins in about 4 percent of their amino acid positions. Clearly, a great deal of our genetic heritage must have been formed long before Homo sapiens appeared, during the evolution of mammals (which started about 300 million years ago) and even earlier. Because the proteins of mammals as different as whales and humans are very similar, the evolutionary changes that have produced such striking morphological differences must involve relatively few changes in molecules from which we are made. Instead, it is thought that the morphological differences arise from differences in the temporal and spatial pattern of gene expression during embryonic development, which then determine the size, shape and other characteristics of the adult. </blockquote></span><br><br>In other words, there just are not that many differences in the DNA of a human and a whale, yet humans and whales look totally different. Small collections of DNA mutations can have a very big effect on the final result.<br>Right now, the signaling mechanisms that wire up the 100 billion cells in the human brain are something of a mystery. How can the mere 60,000 genes in the human genome tell 100 billion neurons how to precisely wire themselves in the human brain? No one right now has a clear understanding of how so few genes can meticulously wire so many neurons. In a developing fetus in the womb, DNA is correctly creating and wiring up millions of cells per minute. Given that DNA does wire up a working human brain every time a baby is born, it may be the case that DNA has special properties that make evolution work more efficiently. As the mechanisms become better understood, the effects of DNA mutations during development will become better understood as well.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: brown;">Question 3: Where Did the First Living Cell Come From?</span></span><br>In order for the principles of mutation and natural selection in the theory of evolution to work, there have to be living things for them to work on. Life must exist before it can to start diversifying. Life had to come from somewhere, and the theory of evolution proposes that it arose spontaneously out of the inert chemicals of planet Earth perhaps 4 billion years ago.<br>Could life arise spontaneously? If you read How Cells Work, you can see that even a primitive cell like an E. coli bacteria -- one of the simplest life forms in existence today -- is amazingly complex. Following the E. coli model, a cell would have to contain at an absolute minimum:<br><br>A cell wall of some sort to contain the cell<br>A genetic blueprint for the cell (in the form of DNA)<br>An enzyme capable of copying information out of the genetic blueprint to manufacture new proteins and enzymes<br>An enzyme capable of manufacturing new enzymes, along with all of the building blocks for those enzymes<br>An enzyme that can build cell walls<br>An enzyme able to copy the genetic material in preparation for cell splitting (reproduction)<br>An enzyme or enzymes able to take care of all of the other operations of splitting one cell into two to implement reproduction (For example, something has to get the second copy of the genetic material separated from the first, and then the cell wall has to split and seal over in the two new cells.)<br>Enzymes able to manufacture energy molecules to power all of the previously mentioned enzymes<br>Obviously, the E. coli cell itself is the product of billions of years of evolution, so it is complex and intricate -- much more complex than the first living cells. Even so, the first living cells had to possess:<br><br>A cell wall<br>The ability to maintain and expand the cell wall (grow)<br>The ability to process "food" (other molecules floating outside the cell) to create energy<br>The ability to split itself to reproduce<br>Otherwise, it is not really a cell and it is not really alive. To try to imagine a primordial cell with these capabilities spontaneously creating itself, it is helpful to consider some simplifying assumptions. For example:<br>Perhaps the original energy molecule was very different from the mechanism found in living cells today, and the energy molecules happened to be abundant and free-floating in the environment. Therefore, the original cell would not have had to manufacture them.<br>Perhaps the chemical composition of the Earth was conducive to the spontaneous production of protein chains, so the oceans were filled with unimaginable numbers of random chains and enzymes.<br>Perhaps the first cell walls were naturally forming lipid spheres, and these spheres randomly entrapped different combinations of chemicals.<br>Perhaps the first genetic blueprint was something other than DNA.<br>These examples do simplify the requirements for the "original cell," but it is still a long way to spontaneous generation of life. Perhaps the first living cells were completely different from what we see today, and no one has yet imagined what they might have been like. Speaking in general terms, life can only have come from one of two possible places:<br>Spontaneous creation - Random chemical processes created the first living cell.<br>Supernatural creation - God or some other supernatural power created the first living cell.<br>And it doesn't really matter if aliens or meteorites brought the first living cell to earth, because the aliens would have come into existence through either spontaneous creation or supernatural creation at some point -- something had to create the first alien cells.<br><br>Most likely, it will be many years before research can completely answer any of the three questions mentioned here. Given that DNA was not discovered until the 1950s, the research on this complicated molecule is still in its infancy, and we have much to learn.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Submarines: How They Work - Archimedes' Principle<br><br><img src="http://express.howstuffworks.com/graphics/neatstuff/sub/outersub.gif"><br><br>Whether a submarine is floating or submerging depends on the ship's buoyancy. Buoyancy is controlled by the ballast tanks, which are found between the submarine's inner and outer hulls.<br><br>A submarine resting on the surface has positive buoyancy, which means it is less dense than the water around it and will float. At this time, the ballast tanks are mainly full of air.<br><br>To submerge, the wsubmarine must have negative buoyancy. Vents on top of the ballast tanks are opened. Seawater coming in through the flood ports forces air out the vents, and the submarine begins to sink.<br><br>The submarine ballast tanks now filled with seawater is denser than the surrounding water. The exact depth can be controlled by adjusting the water to air ratio in the ballast tanks. Submerged, the submarine can obtain neutral buoyancy. That means the weight of the submarine equals the amount of water it displaces. The submarine will neither rise nor sink in this state.<br><br>To make the submarine rise again, compressed air is simply blown into the tanks forcing the seawater out. The submarine gains positive buoyancy, becomes less dense than the water and rises.<br><br></div>
