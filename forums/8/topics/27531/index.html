            <div class='col-md body'>Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri has said that 182 people, mostly foreigners, were killed and another 132 others were injured in Saturday's bomb blasts on the tourist island of Bali.<br><br>A hospital official estimated some 75 percent of the dead were foreigners.<br><br>Mrs Megawati also said on Sunday that she would travel to Bali where more bodies were still being pulled out of the rubble.<br><br>Three explosions occurred nearly simultaneously late on Saturday night in Bali, two of which ripped through the heart of the main Kuta Beach tourist area near the popular Sari nightclub which suffered the brunt of the damage.<br><br>The third one was detonated at Sanur, near a US honorary consulate, but it caused no casualties.<br><br>Bali police believed all the explosive devices were homemade bombs and Indonesia's police chief said terrorism was possibly to blame.<br><br>The dead included nationals from Australia, Britain, France, Germany, New Zealand and Sweden.<br><br>Many Japanese are also believed to be among the casualties.<br><br>Police said the explosion near the US honorary consulate took place on the side of the road and no one was injured because the homemade bomb was apparently thrown and exploded some 250 metres from the consulate.<br><br>The explosions come just weeks after the US reopened its diplomatic missions in Indonesia following a shutdown over the September 11 anniversary caused by fears of new attacks by the Al-Qaeda network.<br><br>The bombs completely destroyed the nightclub and triggered an intense blaze which burned for hours as rescuers struggled to ferry scores of injured people to hospital.<br><br>The blaze was still burning fiercely as the sun rose on the shell-shocked island, which had until now managed to escape the violence that has wracked Indonesia since the fall of former president Suharto in 1998.<br><br>Police said many bodies were charred or incomplete, making identification difficult.<br><br>Local journalists at the scene said body parts were scattered across the site and on the roofs of surrounding buildings, and that the blasts left a deep hole on the street in front of the two clubs.<br><br>Many surrounding shops were also destroyed and windows were blown out in a 500-metre radius.<br><br>The first television pictures on the private Metro TV showed a huge fire and a nearly naked foreign man on a stretcher, his face bloodied.<br><br>It also showed rescuers wrapping another body with a white cloth.<br><br>Bomb squad officers and investigators were now combing the sites.<br><br>Authorities have stepped up security at all entry and exit points to Bali, which draws holidaymakers from across the world.<br><br>Earlier Saturday evening, a blast at a Philippine consulate in Manado, North Sulawesi, broke three windows but caused no injuries as the building was closed at the time.<br><br>It was unclear if the blast was related to the explosions in Bali.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, something to ponder upon.<br><br>(i) According to BBC, there are no US citicen involved in the blast. The terrorist had targetted the US in the WTC blast last year. Similar accidents like the bomb blast outside American embassies in phillipine and Indonesia this year did not involve any causualty. With the UN not really keen on supporting the US, would the terrorist risk the warth of the other nations by getting them involved? Who will stand to gain in this blast?<br><br>(ii) Megawati has not taken any action on the terrorist in Indonesia. But she had not agree to helping the US in their fight either. With her help, US can send troops into Indonesia. Will this blast force her into action? Who will gain from this?<br><br>Please feel free to comment.</div>
