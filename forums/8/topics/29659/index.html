            <div class='col-md body'>once i was at a cross junction and i saw a bus hit a motocyclist...it happened so fast and the bang was so loud...i actually saw the motorcyclist get flung out of his bike and landed about ten metres away...for awhile, there was like this scary silence lasting a few seconds, as all motorists and people stared. the thrown-out rider was lying on the ground motionless and i was like..ohmygod, is he dead??! i felt so shocked, cant move either<br>luckily, he moved abit then slowly got up and limped to the kerb..sheesh, i felt so relieved then....<br>luckily the bus was not moving fast...but then, just imagine, the bus was slow and yet the impact can be so great...the motorcycle was bashed up..frightening....can almost imagine the worse scenario of accidents caused by speeding cars<br></div>
