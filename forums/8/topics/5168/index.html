            <div class='col-md body'>hehehe... sweet topic... got true one, but not in spore... in philippines, can or not? Well, it goes like this... I was in the orchaestra in my high school in phil. Together with other music bands in our school, we would have an annual concert tour throughout the rural areas of philippines. We were suppose to bring the joy of music to those folks lving in remote mountain provinces. Very few foreigners venture up to these places 'cept missionaries, adventurous hikers, and young punk musicians like us... well, we stayed in alot of villages and often the places dat we stayed in where either churches or hospitals... aka places that the natives would not like to be near at... in fact, all the places we stayed used to be battlegrounds between rival tribes and rivalry lasts until this day too. Our conductor was hit by a couple of eggs when we performed in a village that had problems with the one who had provided lodging for us. Anyways, the most memorable incident throughout the trip was our stay at Baguio. Baguio is this city on top of some mountians. There was a bad quake in dat area during the early 90s which killed thousands of people... so basically, da whole place is very "dirty". My friends and I (total of <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> were put to stay in the house of an army officer. His house is really big, with 5 bedrooms in the middle of nowhere surrounded by trees. After our performance, we came back all hyper and fooling around... u know guys... there were 3 people each in a bedroom and while we were going to bed, we were knockin at the walls trying to disturb our other friends. This was at around 1 am. Then we got bored and started to fall asleep. Suddenly, we heard a knock on the wall. Thinking it was the other person in the next room, we told them to quit it and let us sleep. the knocks continued... one of my friend went to the other room to tell the guys to quit doing it but they said they weren't doing anything... then the toilets started flushing. everybody heard it and my friend immediately ran back into da room and we stayed very quiet... knocks continued for about 20 secs and then stopped. so did the flushing... i dunno about the other guys but those in my room tried to fall asleep as fast as possible. When we woke up the next morning, a friend of mine staying in another room told me that around 3 am, he woke up and felt something lookin at him. He looked around and saw through the window, a man/thing squatting on one of the branches of the trees around the houses staring at him. He freaked out and closed his eyes. Well, we all had breakfast really quietly and was really glad when we got out of there... good thing we only perform one nite in that city... it was only in the bus on the way back, did we start to talk about it...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>got one more... dis time in taiwan but my roommate tell me one... true lah according to him... U know in taiwan, there are certain tunnels which are considered haunted? i'm sure all of u who have taiwanese friends should know about this. seems like the government decided to build tunnels through mountains which used to be cemetaries long time ago... So its kinda customary for travellers who have to drive through the tunnels late at nite to have some incense or paper money jsut in case...<br><br>According to my friend, he and his friend was driving home on a motorbike after partying at a club around 2 am. When they entered the tunnel, wat would normally take 5-min to drive through it seemed to take a really really long time. It was all dark and they couldn't even see the end of the tunnel. suddenly they saw an old man on a bicycle coming up from behind. THe next thing they know, the old man was right beside my friend and they were going at 120 kmh !! The old guy look at them and laughed and sped off on the bike. My friend then noticed that the bike wasn't even touching the ground!<br>AFter seeing dat apparition, they immediately stopped the bike and began burning papermoney and incense. Next thing they knew, they saw the end of the tunnel and quickly drove as fast as they could out of the tunnel. When m friend got home he looked at the time. Wat would normally take a 10-15 min drive from the club back to his house took 40 mins...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know if u guys call this scary but it happened to me several times. I can swear by it!<br><br>I am based at Seletar Camp. Though there aren't any stories to go around by my ex-colleagues. I do had an experience that I'd never forget.<br><br>It was just after the Hungry Ghost Festival (if I remember correctly) and it was August on the Lunar Calender. I was on Guard Duty and as all the officers had gone home, leaving two of my friends and me in the Guardroom, we carried on our own activities until it was time for bed.<br><br>I had just turned the lights off and laid in bed (I'm an extremely light sleeper) but somehow couldn't get to sleep. Then I heard noises outside the Guardroom. Initially I thought it was just one of my other team's colleague who had decided not to go home but return to Guardroom to sleep (he was on duty the next day). But something WAS very wrong.<br><br>1) I heard shuffling footsteps outside the Guardroom.<br>2)Someone turned on the television rather loud and the radio too.<br>3)More and more footsteps were heard.<br>4)The other bedroom door opened and someone shuffled the foot in and closed the door silently.<br><br>I sat up in bed immediately and the footsteps seemed to shuffle less. Immediately, I ran out and saw... NOBODY! It couldn't have been my imagination! Anyway, I quickly shrugged it off and returned to bed. Just as my butt touched the bed and was about to lie down when I heard distincitively someone calling my name outside the gate...<br><br>The terrifying thing is that, anybody with extremely powerful lungs shouting from the gate will NOT be heard when we're in our room. Even the motorcycle horn would sound muffled. UNLESS it's a car horn.<br><br>Hit the pillow quickly, covered my ears and didn't sleep until it was time to get up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's another true life account which happened to me at camp again...<br><br>When I first came to my Unit, there was a telephone extension (which has since been cut off when officers started complaining about the time we spend on the telephone rather than staring at the gate) in our bedroom. It was customary for the duty team to yak on the phone until wee-hours after officers have gone home.<br><br>This lucky day, I happened to have the WHOLE camp to myself (to guard, of course) as my colleagues went out for supper, leaving me to guard my Unit. Feeling bored, I locked the gate hopped over to the bedroom and started yakking on the phone.<br><br>About 1/2 hour later, I heard someone calling me at the gate. I told my gal friend to hold on while I open the gate for my colleagues. I pulled down the blinds to check first (the bedroom window faces the gate) and saw something terrifying...<br><br>A white shapless appriation was at the gate -legless. I turned away from the window and heard my name being called again - my Chinese name. Of course, my Guardroom mates would never call each other by their Chinese names. Furthermore, my mates don't even KNOW my Chinese Name and call me by my English name!<br><br>Sucking up my chest, I decided to face whatever shit is out there, rushed over to the bedroom door - opened it, and stared straight out to the gate.<br><br>The name calling stopped and I could see no appriation at the gate whatsoever. A few minutes later, I heard the familiar sound of an Aprilla bike being driven in. My colleagues had just returned from supper...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My last account...<br><br>Another time I had the camp to myself again and was watching 'Legend of the 8 Immortals' on TCS8. My colleagues had went out for dinner and threw me alone there. Since the extension was cut off already, I had no other choice but to stare at that silly show.<br><br>My camp dog started barking furiously and I sprang to my feet. Rushing to the spot where the dog was, I saw a small cobra about 25cm long. Rushing to get hot water and sulphur I returned only to find that the snake has escaped. Oh well, adventure's gone. Back to the silly show.<br><br>I heard the dog barking at the gate. Adventure Time again! I grabbed the baton and rushed out, only to see... nothing again. I swore at the dog:<br><br>'Why bother me with your stupid barking? Stupid Dog!'<br><br>A gust of bone-biting wind started blowing at me. All my hair started standing on ends and the wind got stronger the longer I stood there.<br><br>I started praying around, "Sorry 'brothers'. Sorry for my shouting..."<br><br>The wind died down instantly and stopped blowing at once, once the dog and I moved away from the gate.<br><br>I never swore at the camp dog again and treated him better from that day onwards. (No beating, no swearing. Nothing. Just talk and order the dog, he understands human language)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I almost never encountered any experience with the supernatural, but my very first night at Dieppe Barracks (1 Guards, opp. Khatib Camp) wasn't exactly pleasant.<br><br>Before we retired for the evening, my bunk mates and I padlocked our lockers, keeping the individual keys safely in our pockets. And I remebered distinctly in the middle of the night that I actually woke up. I instinctively felt for the key in my pocket -- it was still there. I looked around the room, dimly lit by the corridor lights. Nothing aroused my suspicion and so I went back to sleep.<br><br>The next morning, all the lockers in our bunk were mysteriously unlocked -- the doors were left ajar, the padlocks hanging onto the ear of the doors with the keys attached to the locks themselves.<br><br>And the funny thing is, nothing was missing...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
