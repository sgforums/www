              <p>I am 18+this year,and my birthday is on nov,once after this year birthday will be 19.</p>
              <p>My
              father,59,is a sinpaporean,but he don't have his ic with him course he
              is running away from a case,so his ic had been conficated.</p>
              <p>I heard he divorced before and he had to pay his old wife money monthly but I am not very sure.</p>
              <p>My
              mother,46which is his second wife,is a malaysian with no singpore
              ic,she still have her malaysia ic which is blue one i think.And she
              stayed in singapore for many years already but she had never went to
              chop her passport,I think this is call overstayed.</p>
              <p>Until now,I haven't got my ic yet because of my parents' issue.</p>
              <p>I only study until Kindergarden 2 and I stopped not even primary school I went.Because of them too I couldn't continue study.</p>
              <p>And
              I think I can't continue to live on like this,but everytime I bring up
              the problem and tell them what do they have in mind,they just kept
              avoiding it.</p>
              <p>But I really think we need a solution for this problem,and there's the problem.</p>
              <p>I don't have any lawyer friend,and I don't know how much is it going to cost if I go consult a real lawyer.</p>
              <p>So everybody,I have some question here would really like to know the solutions for each or any suggestions are welcome too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1.Is my current situation against the law?</p>
              <p>2.Do I need my parents' ic in order to make my own one?</p>
              <p>3.If we go and report to police,what will happen to me,my father,and my mother?</p>
              <p>4.Will my father go to jail?and will my mother be sent beck to malaysia and never been able to come to singapore again?</p>
              <p>5.Will I go to jail also?</p>
              <p>6,Also,any suggestion for my current situation?Becuase I really got no idea what to do now already...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These are the question for now,once I think of more I will post them here again.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>How come the birth cert state you are not a citizen of Singapore when your dad is a Singaporean? Unless his ic was already confiscated when you were born?</p>
              <p>And what case was he running away from? Was it so serious he have to sacrifice his son future (not sending him to school, etc)?</p>

              <p>I havev no idea about if my father's ic was confiscated at the time of my birth.</p>
              <p>And at the time of birth,would the hospital ask about this issue?since my mother is malaysian.</p>
              <p>and for the case my father is running away is about a divorced with his first wife,he had to pay his first wife money monthly,but he had not pay her for the pass years.</p>

              <p>I think you need to really talk with your parent about this.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>There should be the father and mother particulars included in your birth certificate if you are born in Singapore which will include their name, ic, race, dialect group, nationality, and country of birth, pls check if your birth certificate again. <br></li>
              <li>You need to ask your parent why the birth cert state that "this child is not a citizen of singapore at the time of birth". If I am not wrong, the hospital would need to register both the parents at time of birth. If your father was present then and he is Singaporean, I don't see any reason why the hospital would put that comment.<br></li>
              <li>Are your father and mother legally married?<br></li>
              <li>If your father is only running away from paying the monthly allowance, I don't think it's a very serious crime. You can't put this aside as his problem has now become your problem. <br></li>

                      not wrong, the hospital would need to register both the parents at
                      time of birth. If your father was present then and he is
                      Singaporean, I don't see any reason why the hospital would put that
                      comment.<br></li>
              <li>Are your father and mother legally married?<br></li>
              <li>If your father is only running away from paying the monthly
                      allowance, I don't think it's a very serious crime. You can't put
                      this aside as his problem has now become your problem.<br></li>

              <p>2. Not really...hospital will only register the mother...and the gynae must sign a document stating that the baby he/she delivered belongs to the mother and the details of the mother will be recorded in the document and given to the mother.</p>
              <p>then father/mother will go ICA to register the birth officially and the BC will be issued there. There is a chargeable fee if the father/mother wants to save a trip to ICA and do it at the hospital instead(optional).</p>
              <p>Can either ask ur parents or go ICA and ask them with ur BC and any other documents U can have.</p>
              <p>4. if not paying alimony is the only offence...then I dont think IC will be confiscated...unless there are other things like warrant of arrest issued...court usually confiscate the passport...not the IC....I am actually thinking of something more dramatic...like AWOL or escape from police custody...or simply dun want to use real IC for some reason...I dunno...U find out.</p>
              <p>but I think the real killer is the overstaying...that one cannot help one...I only can say get ur mother to go ICA and give herself up.</p>

              <p>Your case is a can of worms.</p>
              <p>Is your father's name listed on your birth cert ?</p>
              <p>If his name is listed, you can always go to MOL to get confirmation of his citizenship status.</p>
              <p>I'd suggest you seek legal aid and have someone proficient with immigration laws help you.</p>

              <p>the State definitely did not recognised TS as a singaporean.</p>
              <p>if not he wud have received notice to collect ic and also NSF. the consolation is TS is born in SG?? yes? And the father is a singaporean.</p>
              <p>once TS seeks legal aid, it's likely  the mum would face legal consequences....and perhaps deportation back to malaysia <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>

              <p>The issue here is that TS is not at fault, he should seek govt or NGO youth organisation help, as for army, singapore is very short of young guy to serve, the army will gladly take him in. And if anyone serve the army more than 7 years as some malaysians who do not have the qualification but wanted to covert to singapore citizen do, he/she is eligble to be a singapore citizen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If he do not let the authority knows his situation, by the time he is 21yo, under the adult section, it will be consider an offence in term of living here without an identity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are many broken families in singapore resulting in childrens neglected, but they are not deem to be orphanage, it just that their parents dun really care about them, they know how to sex only. I myself have helped many gals in joining Brownies Association of Singapore, YWCA of Singapore and also Reform centres for young gals. Through such insitution, they get recognized by our govt to be a citizen of singapore, and also, these insitutions help them to educated both in academy and skill development, make good friend and teamwork, find jobs for them and most important, bring back an identity and self confidence in them. Otherwise, most may end up in joo chiat or orchard pubs and nightclubs at the expense of Uncles and Ang Mo</p>

              <li>Are your father and mother legally married?<br></li>
              <li>If your father is only running away from paying the monthly
                          allowance, I don't think it's a very serious crime. You can't put
                          this aside as his problem has now become your problem.<br></li>

              <p>I am sorry but I am born in 1989,I don't know if this is still against the law of compulsory education.</p>
              <p>I don't quite get you why you would say I could be a solicitor?</p>
              <p>I do hope I am making all the story up and is not happening in my life too.But unfortunately it is not.</p>
              <p>As for the rest,do you mind simpify them as I don't get those law wording.</p>
