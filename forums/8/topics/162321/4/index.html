            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forum.<br><br>Foreign workers on bicycles can be a road menace. Fine them<br><br>I have observed from my daily trips at bus stops that some cyclists are a menace and they charge their way through the crowd by ringing their bells incessantly.<br><br>These cyclists, usually Indian and China nationals working at nearby construction sites, have no regard for pedestrian safety. I was nearly knocked down by one such cyclist when I alighted from the bus at the bus stop at Montfort Junior School along Hougang Avenue 8.<br><br>I urge the Land Transport Authority to erect bollards or steel posts to block cyclists from cycling through the bus stops. This will definitely barricade the commuters from speeding cyclists and force them to dismount from their bikes and push through the crowd carefully.<br><br>The traffic police and the police should also enforce safety on pedestrian walkways. Errant cyclists should be summoned.<br><br>Once a little schoolgirl, about nine-years-old, was knocked down by a cyclist at Kovan Melody bus stop at Upper Serangoon Road. The cyclist, a China national apparently from the Kovan Melody site nearby, did not render assistance but rode off.<br><br>This is as good as a hit-and-run accident on our roads. It is worst as cyclists have no insurance like motor bikes. Whom to make a claim against if one is injured by such errant cyclists? The traffic police must act tough on cyclists who are reckless and dangerous.<br><br>Raymund Koh Joo Guan<br></div>
