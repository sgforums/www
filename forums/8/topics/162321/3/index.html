As I approached the corner of the fence near Balestier Road, I saw a cat there. The dog also saw the cat and made a beeline for it. The cat dived into a drain but because it was a closed one, its escape route was sealed. The dog then bit the cat on its throat and took it away. It then flipped the cat in the air, bit its stomach and flung it about. The owner, seeing this, rushed forward and got the dog to release the cat, which lay on the ground writhing.<br><br>I told the man he should not have let his dog loose but he ignored me and walked away. I alerted a veterinary clinic nearby and two of its staff went to retrieve the cat but it had already died.<br><br>What if it had been a child who was attacked?<br><br>Larry Quah Chai Koon<br></div>

I learnt that they too have feelings very much like ours. Even chickens are capable of developing the same bonds as our 'usual' pets like dogs and cats. You read heartwarming stories of rescued chickens in this website: www.bravebirds.org<br><br>I would be distraught if the Agri-food and Veterinary Authority comes and confiscates any of my animal family members in response to my neighbours' unfounded "kiasuism" and "kiasism".<br><br>We try very hard to imbibe humane values such as kindness and compassion in the development of our society. It was with amusement that I learned from a television programme a few years ago that the HDB estates are now called heartlands. I didn't know that before.<br><br>To me, a home with a heart is a place that accommodates a colourful assortment of people that includes those who like animals and those who dislike animals.<br><br>A home with a heart also accommodates for the community animals such as stray dogs and cats that, being born on this island, are as Singaporean as we all are, but they are being severely marginalised.<br><br>The AVA's rapid response to an unfounded public complaint about Ms Leong's pet chickens by swiftly removing them and preying on the ignorance and fear of the grandfather smacks of iron-fisted cold-heartedness.<br><br>I work with elderly people in the community and I can vouch that a large number of them still have trepidation when they get letters from the government.<br><br>The AVA should educate the complainants with facts, that these chicken are free of bird flu, instead of fuelling more fears with the immediate removal of the chickens. My heart remains in sympathy with Ms Leong and her family. I hope the chickens have not been killed yet.<br><br>Dr Tan Chek Wee<br></div>

What the fish does she need to borrow so many freaking books at one go for? Is she so underemployed that she has so much time to read all of them within three weeks??

That's being merciless to people in desperate need of money<br><br>I refer to a recent letter in the Online Forum page suggesting that people who borrow from illegal moneylenders should be jailed and caned.<br><br>I am a healthcare professional with a successful practice and I have no shame in telling everyone that I am where I am today because of so-called illegal money.<br><br>In 1984 I returned home after seven years of travelling and studying, having gone to India, Europe, England and the United States. I came back armed with a professional diploma in osteopathy plus diplomas and certificates in other branches of natural health. I came home with practically no money.<br><br>I could not find employment as an osteopath because at that time, there was no such profession in Singapore. I had to start my own practice or find another job and let my professional qualifications go to waste.<br><br>How could I start a small clinic without any money?<br><br>My bank would not lend me a cent even though I had an account with it for about 10 years, and I used to have a lot of money in that account.<br><br>Before I left Singapore, I was earning a high salary as a medical sales representative and in my early 20s, I already owned a house, a car and a credit card. All that was depleted as I invested in my own education.<br><br>My family, though not poor, was not particularly well-off. My mother helped me by raising $15,000 through an illegal tontine. If not for that, she might have resorted to an illegal moneylender.<br><br>Should my mother or I be jailed and caned for borrowing money illegally?<br><br>For someone like me in 1984 with no money, no collateral, no track record, the only people who were willing and able to help, sadly, were those involved in illegal lending activities.<br><br>It is true that loansharks charge exorbitant interest and that they sometimes resort to nasty debt collection tactics. Those who deface public property or use threats and violence should be dealt with by the law.<br><br>But to suggest that borrowers be punished is merciless and totally lacking in compassion. People borrow from illegal moneylenders only because they are in extremely desperate circumstances.<br><br>If we cut off yet another route out of their desperation, we are in effect telling them to steal and rob instead.<br><br>Dr David Tio<br></div>

When she pointed to a handphone on the table signalling us to lift it up so that she coulf wipe the table, we indicated to her that the handphone was not ours and that it was probably left behind by the previous customer.<br><br>The waitress then took the phone, placed it on her tray and left. Two girls later came to retrieve a handphone while we were waiting for our food. We suggested that they approach the staff. None of them admitted to having taken the phone.<br><br>We deeply regret that we did not take a good look at the waitress who came to wipe our table but we had an idea whom she might be. We approached one of the two managers to tell him of the suspect but we were rudely dismissed.<br><br>He said the bags of the staff had been checked and nothing was found, and that <span style="color: red;">the police had been notified.</span> It sounded as though he was implying that we might have pocketed it.<br><br>The two girls told us that the manager suggested to them that we could have taken it. We expressed our willingness several times to turn out our bags to prove our innocence, but the girls and another manager nicely declined our offers.<br><br>After our meal, we approached the other manager to express our displeasure at being treated like suspects. He offered an apology and promised to look into the matter but he did not take immediate action when we conveyed to him whom we thought was a possible suspect.<br><br>I am deeply disappointed at the attitude of the staff and the reluctance to immediately search the suspect, who did not look at us while we were dining.<br><br>The bags might have been checked but there were many places to hide the mobile phone.<br><br>We frequent Delifrance and are delighted at its food. It is the first time we had encountered an unpleasant and dishonest staff in Delifrance. We hope Delifrance will have more stringent measures to verify the honesty of the staff. We sincerely wish that the phone be rightly returned to its owner and the dishonest waitress punished.<br><br>Tan Soo Ying Janice<br>Ng Wei Jing<br>Oh Ding Hui<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forum.<br><br>It's a shame many S'poreans are inconsiderate. They need to be educated<br><br>Unable to afford a car, I am forced to use public transport. I say forced because taking public transport especially during peak hours can cause me high blood pressure.<br><br>I travel by train from home to my workplace in Tanjung Pagar every morning at around 8am. Understandly, trains are packed. However, many commuters are plainly inconsiderate. The yellow lines on the platform to remind boarding passengers to give way are obviously a waste of paint.<br><br>Boarding passengers leave only a tiny gap to let alighting passengers to squeeze through. Perhaps they are afraid the train doors may close on them if they don't hurry in. I often meet people who in such crowded conditions lean their bodies on the pole, thus depriving other passengers of the support.<br><br>At the escalators, the sign that says 'Please keep left, Thank you' is obviously too small to be noticed. Commuters simply clog up the escalators, both on the left and right sides.<br><br>Why are Singaporeans so inconsiderate? Must fines be imposed even for these before they learn to be more considerate? That would be a real shame. Even fines don't seem to work nowadays. I have on numerous occasions seen people eating on the train.<br><br>Singapore is said to be a very clean city. But is Singapore really that clean? Everytime I walk from my home to the Jurong East train station, I think that Singapore is dirty.<br><br>The shelthered walkway is littered with empty cans, leaflets and plastic bags. This is especially so in the mornings and at nights when the cleaners are not working. Is it only the job of cleaners to keep Singapore clean? I feel that all this plainly reflects how inconsiderate some Singaporeans are. Fines, cleaners and enforcement officers should not be the answer to these problems.<br><br>Singaporeans should really reflect on their behaviour and remind themselves to be considerate. Only in this way can Singaporeans really be considered civilised and cultured.<br><br>Miss Elizabeth Chong<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forum.<br><br>Peeping Tom at YMCA Orchard got away. The CCTV cameras were off<br><br>I joined the YMCA Orchard's swimming programme in August. In November after one of the sessions, I went to the changing rooms to have a shower.<br><br>Halfway through, I felt I was being watched. When I turned back to look, I saw a Peeping Tom looking under the door of the shower room. I screamed and the culprit escaped.<br><br>I lodged a complaint with the management and was appalled at its response. The management informed me there was no way of identifying the culprit as he covered his face while making his escape and it could not be seen on the CCTV cameras.<br><br>When pressed, the management admitted that there were CCTV cameras but they had not been switched on for a few months. As there was only one way out of the changing rooms, the culprit would certainly have been captured on the cameras as he made his escape. But this was possible only if the cameras had been switched on.<br><br>I decided to lodge a police report. The security manager went with me to the police station. Maybe it is a sign of his poor work attitude or he was simply unconcerned because the security manager fell asleep when he was at the police station.<br><br>Fearing for their safety, two of my friends in the same swimming class decided to cancel their lessons. Instead of being sympathetic, the management told them flatly that refunds were out of the question and that no exceptions were made for anyone.<br><br>With security so lax and the management having such a lackadaisical working attitude, it is no wonder that the culprit had the audacity to do what he did.<br><br>I would not be surprised if today, the cameras are still not switched on. I think the management's handling of this issue is downright insensitive and shoddy. It owes all the members in the classes an explanation.<br><br>Ms Sim Chai Leng<br></div>

It's distasteful<br><br>There is a new radio show on Power98FM called the Cool Club Clan (CCC). This is obviously a play on the name of the infamous racist group Ku Klux Klan (KKK).<br><br>Some would say that this is a clever way of attracting attention to a new radio show. I feel that the name of the show is extremely distasteful.<br><br>The association of Power98FM with SAFRA and thus the Ministry of Defence lends some respectability to the radio station. Having a radio show with a name that has any link whatsoever with a racist group is not an image that Singapore should project.<br><br>I call on the authority to please change the name of the show.

I made only five cents' (ST, Nov 2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. At McDonald's, we believe in giving our customers quality food at great value and convenience.<br><br>Although the pricing strategy of our Extra Value Meals may differ according to choice of sandwich, the genuine intent to offer greater value and savings to our customers remains.<br><br>Our commitment to giving our customers greater value also takes the form of a 'Value Savers' Promotion. Offerings include the McChicken a la carte at $2 (a 38 per cent savings on its original price of $3.20).<br><br>Mr Lim bought a McChicken Extra Value Meal at $5.60. The savings, taking into consideration the original a la carte prices of McChicken and French fries, would have come to $1.60 or 22 per cent, and not just five cents. The savings is consistent with the rest of our Extra Value Meals, based on the original sandwich prices.<br><br>We would like to assure Mr Lim and all readers that McDonald's is continually looking to offer even greater value to our customers.<br><br>Kenneth Chan<br>General Manager<br>McDonald's Restaurants<br></div>

(ST, Dec 3).<br><br>To be eligible for the Edusave Merit Bursary, a child has to perform well in his studies and his family's gross monthly household income should be less than $3,000.<br><br>Why is there a need for the second criterion if the intention is to reward pupils for doing well in their studies? The child may feel disappointed at not being able to get the bursary.<br><br>The relevant authorities should filter out children from families whose household income exceeds $3,000, and send bursary letters only to those who are eligible. This will not only cut down on unnecessary postage costs, but also avoid discouraging children.<br><br>I believe schools hold such records, and they could work with the relevant agencies to facilitate the process.<br><br>Steve Wong<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forum.<br><br>Drinks at concert cost an arm and a leg.<br><br>IN RECENT weeks, I attended two Chinese pop concerts, one at the Singapore Indoor Stadium and the other at the Max Pavilion at Singapore Expo.<br><br>On both occasions, there were stewards at the entrance checking bags for water bottles. Patrons who brought drinks were asked to surrender them. I also saw some patrons asked to empty water from their own water bottles into the dustbin before they were allowed into the stadium.<br><br>While the Max Pavilion has no kiosk selling drinks, the indoor stadium has shops selling knick-knacks, drinks and even beer and wine.<br><br>Wanting to enjoy the concert with a beer, I was about to buy one only to find out the exorbitant price I had to pay. A can of local-brand beer cost $8, while a small bottle of wine cost $15. If bought in a supermarket it the beer would cost less than $3 and the wine, less than $7.<br><br>If I am not mistaken, the liquor cost more than at nightspots in town.<br><br>There are a few questions I would like to ask the operators of the two establishments, as well as the concert organisers.<br><br>First, if security is the reason plastic bottles are not allowed to be brought in, why are drinks in similar packets sold on the premises?<br><br>Second, why are drinks at the indoor stadium sold at two or three times the price of a supermarket?<br><br>I understand the need to be profitable in business, but surely such prices are too high, especially when patrons have to surrender their own drinks at the entrance.<br><br>By the way, I settled for a soft drink for $3 after I found out that a cup of mineral water like those served at funerals cost about $2.<br><br>David Tan Kok Kheng<br></div>
