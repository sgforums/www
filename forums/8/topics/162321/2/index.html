I HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD.<br><br>If this incident takes place at hawker centres or food courts, it is right to demean this comment made by this fellow Singaporean. However, this incident is taking place in a HOSPITAL!!!<br><br>Obviously, you guyz are apparantly SO in the pink that you all don't ever get to sleep or stay in a hospital. Well, I once did. And if this case was to happen to me and if I ever happen to see it, I'll definitely voice up in the ST Forum as well. Calling me a complaining patient? By all means, go ahead.<br><br>But let me tell you all, that it's no fun being a patient in a hospital. My life was once at stake, and if ever I consume anything unhygenic, or bacteria infected, causing me any harm, that vendor is going to be solely responsible for everything.<br><br>In conclusion, I am agreeing with this forum writer and her comments, although many of you think it's just another complain. But I think that something must be done regarding hygiene in hospital premises.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the fruit complaint was quite reasonable - its hospital, even wash toilet oso muz be careful, not saying about things dat we consume. the equipment complaint is common-knowledge (dats y they no business in the first place) and the soil, its overreacting but nothing to be pissed about.<br><br>singaporeans really like to complain, either complain or complain about complains which are being complained about. hopeless.</div>

This translates into a savings of $1.35, or almost 20 per cent.<br><br>Although the pricing strategy of our Extra Value Meals may differ according to choice of sandwich, the intent to offer greater value and savings remains.<br><br>We would like to assure Mr Zhuang and all readers that McDonald's is continually looking to offer even greater value to our customers.<br><br>Kenneth Chan<br>General Manager<br>McDonald's Restaurants<br></div>
