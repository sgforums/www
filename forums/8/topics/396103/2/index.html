              <p>For all you know, the one with more gfs is still a virgin. xD</p>
              <p>Uhm for me definitely not. In fact, for me, I think it's better to go on the journey with someone equally inexperienced so that there's this element of exploration and fun in the relationship. Playing a challenging mission solo is less fun than playing with a team member, if you catch my drift ;D</p>

              <p><br>Yes... The man can survive by himself... But who's going to pay for the bills??? Cars.. mortage payment etc... If wife earns more than husband... means wife more likely to pay the bills for the husband wages might not be enough to support lavish lifestyle... like tat is also indirectly considered living off wife... Man minds their ego the most... imagine relatives and kaypo frens gossiping behind the man and said he depends on wife for lavish lifestyle.. U think the man can take it??? Especially Asian chinese man..</p>

              <p><br>No, the husband survived by himself, he paid for his own expenses, he also helps to pay for the kids expenses equally, whenever the wife said going to exotic places for holiday or changing car, he will tell her truthfully that he do not have enuf money, if she is willing to foot, he dun mind and feel inferior about it. There is nothing wrong in man about earning an honest living while having a higher income wife. Take it as a blessing rather than a curse. Usually, it is the lower income men who feel inferior about themselve, for gals, we are more toward Love relationship. But of course those lazy bum men who dun work at all and expect us to feed them, that is totally out of the scope</p>
