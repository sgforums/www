              <p>Hi,<br><br>Chanced upon this thread while looking up some PEO's crap shit which i got into, not any mentioned in this thread tho.<br><br>Just like to share my 2 cents worth.<br><br>I've called up MOE and enquire about pte/in-hse dips and the truth is that MOE neither accredit/recognise nor disregard/deny any pte dips in SG. The governance of the course contents is still up to the provider itself, but they are required to be registered with MOE and info to be provided like the module synopsis and some other info. However, MOE does not review the cse contents/syllabus/what cse notes they use/textbooks etc. Like some pri schools which uses books from publisher A and some from publisher B. In the case of PEO, the diplomas are usually offered in-hse like SMa, Kaplan, PSB etc. The real values of the dip lies in which prestigious foreign unis the schools has tie-up with do gain advanced standing/module exemptions. Much like a polytechnic's diploma's value lies in it can gain module exemptions in local uni admissions or overseas universities, where they deem the dip has met a certain requirement to be able to go into the 2nd/3rd/final year of studies. Another scenario is that the pte diplomas are taken from the 1st year of that certain prestigious uni, and they were allowed to term it as a diploma on their own. Much like the NAFA concept where you stop at year 2, you get a dip, you finish year 3, you get a degree, which is what doodlegal explained.<br><br>In Ms Sim's case, SMa's dip is offered in-hse which i believe they dun send it to ECU for grading/marking as it is offered in hse, like what i've mentioned above. If you actually go through the ECu's webby, you would find that none of the modules in the dip are part of the 16 degree modules if you take up the degree with ECU, which means that the dip is definitely an in-hse one, so there shldn't be any ECU logo. Perhaps you've mistaken the degree and the diploma? Local poly dips also have tie-ups with foreign unis to gain advance standing/direct entry to 2nd/3rd/final year, but you don't see any foreign uni's logo on local poly cert. It simply means that the dip has met the criteria to embark on ECU's degree program. Also, if you see that on top of the 16 core modules in ECU's list, there are 8 more minor/elective modules required before they consider you to have adhered to their degree awarding standards, thus this dip could have served as a minor/elective purpose. <br>IMHO, your degree is not going to be affected as it's coming from ECU as the dip is most prolly just the minor/elective portion, and it's listed on APAC's website. However, if you still feel unsafe, do look up APAC website for other accredited certs to take up or even go to JCU/NUS where these are confirm recognised in the psychology industry. Mature candidates(over 21) with relavent working experiences will also be considered for local polytechnic admisions tho, do check with them.<br><br>Sunshine85: I would just like to point out that based on your postings, I believe that not resitting for the exams was a mutual agreement btw the students and the management, as per what the students wanted. If the students had wanted to resit for the exams in the first place, you think the management would have stopped them? What they were trying to achieve is a win-win situation. If the school demanded the students resit the exams, they also would make noise, both ways you can't balance both ends of a scale. They are aware of the backlash too tho. As for the macdonalds part, Ms sim seems to have viewed it as bribery to shut up, but....macdonalds and one would agree to shut up? I believe it's a little too extreme.</p>
              <p>Iamvoldermort: Dude, don't be surprised that what she said is true, as i had lecturers reading off the slides and giving out templated answers during programming lessons when i was in poly, and it's end of lesson after he finish transfering the answers to OHP slides. LOL.</p>
              <p><br>Normkwok: I believe there is some misunderstand here, the list here you pasted only lists the degree and not the diplomas. With regards to yr 1 of the studies being converted to a diploma, i believe if they do that, they would have to school's approval, however, most don't do that, if you would actually check the actual modules being offered by the uni itself. In this SMa/ECU's case, the dip's modules are clearly not part of the year 1 modules. The only diplomas that have been accredited in SG, by the SPS are the polytechnic's diplomas and not the pte diplomas, but like i've mentioned, the real value of the dip lies in which prestigious overseas uni they can gain admission to. From what i've checked, the 16 core modules by ECU are offered by SMa, where like i've mentioned earlier, the diploma probably serves as a fulfilling of minor/elective purposes to make the student reach the criteria of being awarded the degree.</p>

              <p>hahaha I identify with you cos.. same uni... and its quite sad that after your own hardwork... ur degree becomes crap thanks to other people's cockups.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BUT... having said that - I think BESIDES govt and stat boards who have their own rather stringent confidential list of approved educational institutions... many other MNCs and other organisations DO give u a chance.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, your degree only gives you a little LITTLE step into the door. Eventually the rest of your career depends on you - not on the degree.</p>

              <p> one of my classmate pm this. just one to share with you all.</p>
              <p>he/she is really kind , understandin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the advise ".... i came back to read the thread. well, i am from the school as well. I have just graduated in Oct 2008 .........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, just a piece of advice, gather the people who are willing to stand together, especially your lecturer. It will only be strong to prove your case. It may do harm to your diploma since it will be awarded by SMa, but i understand your rationale in doing so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>I have spoke to the person mentioned, but I am a little disappointed to hear what he had said. He said "be pragmatic, finished it and move on" on a seperate issue. the other moustache guy, well, he is a taichi master.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>..... I have feedback about the level of service by the SSD, but quite disappointing. Terrible.</p>
              <p>......Anyway, i think the manager was asked to go because of the incident which is what I had heard.</p>

              <p>Ms Sim, i understand that you are frastrated and angry with the incident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really think that you could have deserve a better solution to this matter, however, what you are doing now is nly trying to flame the school as much as possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I must remind you this Ms sim, i do not care about how you want to deal with your grivences with the school management but now that you have mentioned the name, you have not only tarnish the name of the school and your own certification, you have also destroy thousands of student's dream.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, you were actually a poor victim of this incident but now that u do this, you are hurting thousands of people who are from this school.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me tell you this... u said u can't sleep for day and night because of this matter rite? now i tell you.... after u have tarnished and spread the name of the school... dig in your concious... now u have thousands of people haunting behind your back becoz you attempted to destroy people's dream juz becoz of your personal problem. Now, think of what i said here and u can go try enjoy your sleep ms sim. Now countless people are suffering with you... can you please expain to me how you feel now?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not trying to blame you of anything... but as a psychology student... can't be be more thoughtful for people ard you? The world is not only abt you... the world is abt everyone in this world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On top of this, the people who had the meeting with you guys have already left the organisation i presume(after reading all the posts)?</p>
              <p>Then why are you still struggling with a result of an incident not done by the same people? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Apart from this, i wanna tell you something about ur diploma and degree. The matter happens to you on your diploma rite? To let you know of the situation better... your diploma's result do not affect your degree's result. you definately will ask why??? its because, the diploma you take will actually only be a credit exemption for Y1 of the whole 3 year programme. Your results from the Diploma will not be stated in your final transcript in your degree. You get what i mean? Its a credit exemption system... the diploma is offered by the school as a bridging course (Y1) of the programme. Since the modules of the course is not the same as of those on campus, it only serves as a credit transfer. This applies to the same for polytechnic students who wants to join the degree programme.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now think Ms Sim... after knowing all these... do you feel that u have made a mistake in handing the situation this way? You could have just continue with your studies or transfer to another school quietly... life still goes on Ms sim....</p>

              <p>i m shocked.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>
              <p>on 1 hand i agreed w joeacid. the should be a better way to handle it , the school will want to cover this up as much, you might even get back your refund. on the 2 hand. i sympathise with the students in the school. i have 1 friend studying there. the school is not tat big, maybe got a few hundred students not like thousands joeacid mentioned. most singaporean mentality is to keep quiet when we got cheated or expreicenced bad services. why waste time, dont go back that all. but look at the recent dbs bank scandle where they cheat so many uncles and aunties of their life savings . many of them lost their "coffin-saving" , they cried, suffered depression. everyone kept quiet, the banks kept quiet, the government kept quiet, monentory autority of singaproe mas keep quiet. only mr tan kim lian stood up and fight for the cause, went to freedom corner to speak and help them band together and now at least most of them got back some of their lifesavings. tan kim lian did not need to do it , why ? becuase of his social and moral responsiblities.. he could have kept quiet, who wants to go against the zeng hu in singapore. but in this case, it was a good example of the victim coming together and getting their voice heard. they are uncles and aunties but never pushovers.</p>
              <p>in this case, the school sma school management and/or the university edith cowan is clearly at fault. again veronica could have ask for addtional grade and kept her mouth shut. but that will not do justice to the rest of the students. she was selfless and standup to scrutiniy. her vocal in some way help warn off potential victims from falling into the same trap , to sign up for such a dubious school.</p>
              <p>just food for thought. veronica, so long your conscious is clear, u need not worry how people judge you or bad mouth u. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>As i have mentioned before, i am not out to blame Ms Sim. I'm actually trying to let her know that using such method might not be a best choice in this scenrio. This case is different from lehman brothers... what happen to lehman brothers is that it actually collapse and ppl lose their investment money...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But in this case its different, instead of the school being closed down... she's actually making it closing down... if its a bank.. having ppl like Ms Sim bad-mouthing the bank like this could actually cause a "run on the bank" where everyone quits or withdraw their money out, causing the bank to close down... where it might not hav happen if ppl give more trust for their bank to recover...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and btw... yes they do hav thousands of students there.... so... pls... spare a thought for those students...voicing out is correct... ... telling your frens ard might help if they ever ask u abt this school... but pls... spreading on the internet like this is really bad... it no longer put u in the position of being a victim... you're like a rebellion to the school now... pls stop whatever you are doing... u are invovlving and creating more victims if the school ever get affected...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>can you imagine? its not only the students who are currently studying there... those who have already graduated are also affected... despite already being in a economy downturn now... they managed to get a bachelor degree which might help them abit... but if this thing blow up... can you imagine how this thing can affect their lives?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think further my fren... i'm serious... i seriously urge you to think again and again... let me emphasize  on this... we all know that you are a victim.. and we feel bad for you... but pls dun get anymore ppl involved... look at the world with a wider vision and one day you will be blessed...</p>

              <p>i have studied very hard and managed to pass with some credits and 1 distinction. this is my hardwork but now i felt so helpless. the piece of paper i am getting is worthless... apparently some of the students who didnt attempt the examiation also got a distinction.</p>
              <p>how can that b. i have checked and it is true, to shut the affected students, the school agreed to give ADDITIONAL marks to the students assignements and pass them with distinction.</p>
              <p>i am now at the crosss road . i want a refund but i wasted 5 months of my time. i want to go to MOE but that will affect my university resputation and hurt my career opportunites.</p>
              <p>i have done my checks. the school is accredited with case and the program is accredited by MOE. the university is also approved by austraila psychological association and worst the school is also sqc-peo which is like the gold standards of education.</p>
              <p>my friends and i felt so trapped and lost. i feel like just giving up and drop out but what about my hard earn $$$... how can a university do such a thing just to shut up the students and cover the incident. they could have give a re-sit..... WHY WHY WHY..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if u were us. what will you do ? please help us... very very LOST AND SAD :( sign...worst christmas of my life....</p>
