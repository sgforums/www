              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/44974">Gedanken</a>, thank you for your point. of alll the info
              posted here. yours is by far the most helpful.</p>
              <p>1 question. i saw the diploma certificate , it is awarded by the
              university n the school. it has 2 logos of the university and the
              school. so its awarded by the university.</p>
              <p>it is a 3 year programme which i signed up . year 1 is awarded
              by both insitutution and year 2 and 3 by the university only.</p>
              <p>we just want to get out and i have evidence, you suggest we
              write in to APS ?</p>
              <p><strong>we want a refund</strong> and if we bring the evidence to case singapore
              does it help.</p>
              <p><strong>honestly, never trust an australia university. the government
              will do anything to get the student's money...including
              this......</strong></p>

              <p>So you finally reveal your true intentions.. You want a refund. I guess in this day and age even justice comes with a price tag. I wonder if you had this intention right from the start and now the opportunity falls out of the sky for you to get your money back after you have studied, used the school resources, teaching, etc etc.</p>
              <p>You already mention its a diploma then degree course. Does it make any difference if you don't get distinction for one of the modules of your diploma? What diploma you have will not make any difference anyway since the end goal is the degree.</p>
              <p>You have with your last sentence demonstrated first hand your level of intellect and maturity. Just because of a mistake committed by the school LOCALLY, you go and smear all australian universities. I appluad you.</p>
              <p>Then again I do hope you manage to get your money back and quit the course, because I think with your standard, maybe you just are not cut out to be a degree holder. You'll give degree holders a bad name.</p>

              <p>yes arkansaw. its totally blatant.</p>
              <p>was very sad and went out for a party last night at st james. drank myself mad. now suffering hangover but at least better than feeling lousy about the whole thing.</p>
              <p>even if we withdraw, i really dont think the school , yes like night sky say, its the school and not the university should be let off or covering up. but it is still confusing as the university logo is on the certificate and i presume the unviersity should have certain processes or quality built in to ensure the academic intergity.</p>
              <p>if it is really the school, you think i should contact the university on this and the australia regulator since they are putting their reputation and Our reputation at stake.</p>
              <p>somehow or another, i beleive they are in cahoot , my university needs the $$ and so will cover the local school.</p>
              <p>really regretted, should have studied hard and enter polytechnic instead of private school ...</p>
              <p>i really hope you people outthere can enlgihten me..</p>

              <p>peruro,</p>
              <p>its unlikely to be university of western australia ,i have done some checks,</p>
              <p>yes uni of western australia deliver the psychology diploma here with psbacademy</p>

              <p>but there are another 2 school that offer psychology degree with western australia</p>
              <p>edith cowan university is also from western australia who offer it with sma ,</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.sma.edu.sg/programmes-p050.asp">http://www.sma.edu.sg/programmes-p050.asp</a></p>
              <p>both these instutitions are government bodies and i believe that they have got the system in place to deter this unethical activities.</p>
              <p>the biggest suspcision is with</p>
              <p>murdoch university who offer psycholgoy with kaplan singapore which is an american pubilc listed company. knowing how the amercia work including the sub-primes and the lehman cases, i strongly beleive it is  they who are churning out the fake qualificatiions (ps. my opiinon,,dont sue me) since they also have many china students who will never pass the qualification without help</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> veronica, you have your rights as a paid student and what your school or university is doning is downright like a degree mill.</p>
              <p>you have your rights and the university cannot denied that they are not aware of the act since the university is awarding the diploma .</p>
              <p>you can call the university and provide them with the evidence and tell them that unless u get a formal apology and full refund . dont go to ministryt of education ,and case, they are quite uselss and your plead will never be heard</p>
              <p>go to the press.</p>
              <p>straits times and newpaper love these stories. has to be true of course. so do get ur facts right esecpailly on that fact the people who didnt take exam got a distinction. this is so laugable.omy.</p>
              <p>to rest of u. be ware of commercial scoholl..</p>

              <p>i sympathise with ms sim aswell. its absurb how the government can allow the university to operate like this. everytime things like this happen, the end consumer , in this case the students will be the sufferer.</p>
              <p>if i am one of the student, i will demand an offiical letter of apology from the university to safeguard my interest. if news leaks out, my cert will indeed be worthless.</p>
              <p>these australian universities , especially the lower grade ones should never be allow to operate in singapore, it spoilts our reputation as an education centre. shame on them</p>

              <p><br>So what, if you were in her shoes, got a diploma from a school and finds out there's a scandal that might be released anytime soon and might make her piece of paper worthless and tarnish her career prospects, you wouldn't mind throwing thousands of dollars down the drain?</p>
              <p>Let's be frank. No one likes a miser who will quibble with CASE over a 10 cents price increase on a can drink, but when it comes to thousands of dollars you would either be very stupid or very rich not to fight for your money. I am sure even billionares like Warren Buffet and Bill Gates would fight out a case like this, for honour and pride. There is nothing shameful about wanting a refund.</p>
              <p>The point is that her piece of paper will lose its credibility and hence its worth.</p>

              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><em>dy and i came early straight afterwork but was told to wait outside as the managemetn was talking to some students. not too bad, at least we are not the only one affected. 20 minutes later, we were ushered into a room, the academic director was there, the general manager, think she is new, never met her before. the ceo was there. must be a big event, not often did we have a chance to talk even to the student service manager, now we got the entire management in front of us to air our unhappiness.</em></span></div>
              <div><em> </em></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><em>the ceo started by thanking us for attending the meeting and explain to us why we were shifted to a smaller campus, (a load of crap, get straight to the point). after 10 minutes of airy fairy stuff, the bad news came, the examnation script was lost , some asked, was it stolen ? was it misplaced ? how can 50 over scripts be lost like this, ? where is the procedure and checkpont. </em></span></div>

              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><em>he gave us a sorry but this is the fact look and asked for our opininon on how to close this matter. do we want a resit or just add up our assignemnt marks. no way r we going to resit so in the end we opt for a collated marks from our assignment which is like a guareenteed pass for the whole class. the academic director added as a gesture of goodwill , 10 additional marks will be added to our total grade. wow..sounds good. then came the free dinner, they ordered mcdonald for all of us . how thoughtful of them since most of us havent had dinner yet.</em></span></div>
              <div><em> </em></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><em>before the meeting concluded, the parting shot, the management said of course the decision has to be kept within the 4 walls since if it leaks out, it will not only affect the school but also our certification. someone asked if it will affect our progession into the university degree, no came the reply since the cert is recognised by the university. back then it sounds rationale but now it sounded like a threat, in between the line, that now instead of it being their mistake, it is now our mistake as well since we benefited from it.</em></span></div>

              <p>You know what?.. What I am saying may sound scary but it is as
                                  good as reality itself<br> <br> Bottomline: Almost every forum or website I went seem to have cases
                                  of grievances from students (regardless whether they are local or
                                  foreign) that their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respective</span> (in other words,
                                  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">various</span> foreign
                                  even local universities) school/partnering universities are doing
                                  something unethical behind the students' back.<br> <br> Conclusion: No matter where you go, you can never avoid "reality".
                                  If you can ever prove that one university in this world is free of
                                  corruption or clean, provide a so-called reference which is a must
                                  in Psychology. It is a matter of how well every university keeps
                                  its "secrets".<br> <br> Moral of the story: As long as the university is accepted by
                                  MOE/Singapore, get a degree and throw your ass into the workforce
                                  as soon as possible!</p>

              <p>Like Gedanken had mentioned, NO bodies like APS will accredit any Diploma courses in psycholgy.</p>
              <p>- according to sunshinetan85, I think I noe wat sch u are fm, and there is no affiliation of the diploma course u r taking wif any university, as this diploma course is solely by the private institution u r in.</p>
              <p>- the private institution &amp; maybe the Uni(i m nt too sure) would have approve other relevant diploma courses offered by either private or local, so that u can have advanced standing in the degree course. similar like a poly grad will get into yr 2 of the degree course in any local unis.</p>

              <p>hell2kane, what a nice nick. easy for you to say , you are not one of the victim, so its easy to say so. No university worth its salt will cover up on academic matters, for example in the past university of london at sim lost some scripts, they spoke to the students and make them resit the exam. caused alot of unhappiness and also media reports about unhappy students who have to resit their examination but at least they sent out a clear signal that they are no mickey mouse institution. they apologies to the students but still insist the students must retake their examination. short term they got alot of heat from the media and i beleive the government bodies to review their examination procedure but long term, they sent across a clear signal that they are a reputable institution who will not bend the rule and take the shortcut.</p>
              <p>doodlegal, you are right about the Australia Psychological society accreditation, they do not accredit diploma but a quick check on the australia psycholgical accreditation council APAC site on accrediton of singapore psychology courses shows otherwise</p>

              <p>most singapore institutions will not offer the year 1 of the psychology degree but replace it as a diploma. so like it or not, the diploma program will affect the accredition status of the degree.</p>
              <p>peuro, the writing is on the wall, there is only 4 universities from perth offering psychology degree in singapore. veron says its not curtin and uni of western australia, that leaves us with only 2 universities. isnt it clear</p>

              <p>Here I would however like to highlight to potential students regarding these dips, they are worthless unless you are prepared to continue a degree course with the school which ironically you would not want to after doing the dip course.</p>
              <p>my bf was quote unquote """ .."conned" in the sense that when he signed up for the diploma in psychology program. the course consultant mentioned that the diploma will be endorsed by the University and the diploma certificate has the university logo on it..</p>
              <p>However when the course commenced, the standard of students not withstanding.. The program management were extremely bad, he gets push  around when he needs to clarify some queries. the diploma was also different from what was stated on the website and in their phamplets. And they didn't inform him until much later that the cert would not be endorsed by the univeristy but issued only by the school.</p>
              <p>To anyone who would want to sign up, consider carefully and weigh your options. It is not cheap to study for your degree, go for school with real campus such as curtin and james cook university. the rest are really not worth it.</p>
              <p>Am Sorry if I offended anyone.. Just my own opinions...</p>

              <p>Normkwok : i wud like to add that the dip doesnt affect the accreditation of the status of the degree...tt is fm my own understanding thou..</p>
              <p>Babyjkoh08 : in a way, yes it's kinda being conned, but it is still up to the individual to do their own 'market survey' b4 signing up any course.</p>
              <p>all in all, these private institutions, they dun offer the 1st yr (or rather wat makes up the 'electives') in a normal uni situation. hence the dip will serve as the so called 'electives'. Usually, these private institutions &amp; the overseas uni accept students wif the relevant dips into the degree prgm w/o having to take the bridging course or the 1st yr. But all in all, it boils down to $$$, usually, they will see ur work experience &amp; may close one eye on whether the dip u took is relevant or not.</p>
              <p>in addition, students are nt compelled to continue to take up the degree courses after completing the dip courses, of cox the private schs will encourage them, but it takes both hands to clap. If the students think that the dip courses were up to standard &amp;/or lazy to source for other schs etc they will still sign up wif the course..</p>
              <p>i m saeing this cox i took my dip elsewhere &amp; my degree course @ another place. it all boils down to consumer choice and rights.</p>
              <p>well...its the same in every private institutions that the admin support sucks big time, but there is nth we can do if the top management refuse to take action. but one thing is for sure, if the uni itself cares for their students, they might take some action if concerns are voiced properly.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Just complain lor. <br>5 months only. It's not too late. <br><br>I think that ensuring scripts do not get lost/misplaced/damage is an important thing because it disrupts the equal ground that students compete on. It is something that no reparations can fix and the school cannot satisfy anyone. <br><br>Of course, some people say that if everyone retakes a different paper it will be fair; after all, those who got study will still do well, those who don't study won't do well. But for most of us, exams are a thing that boils down to the time of the paper, to an extent, some luck is involved (e.g. studying more for certain topic or have extra info to put in writing). If luck/chance is involved, it is certainly unfair to award others more chance. That's why I say that it's an error that cannot be repaired.<br><br>i really don't know how to settle it once this happens.<br></p></div>

              <p>i gt my dip from this school too. i understand where you are coming from. losing exam scripts and for that module, the whole class got high distinction and distinction. and add macdonald's to it. can u believe it? losing exam script also can have 2 different side of story. the group that gt macdonalds for conpensation was told that the lecturer lost the script. but the other group that attended the 2nd meeting was told the lecturer didnt even get to see the exam papers and it was lost. losing exam paper is 1 thing, losing assignment is the other. and if the school loses your assignment, do not worry. i'm sure you will get a minimum of distinction! when i first signed up for the course, i tot that school is quite reputable. but now. its just a money spinning organisation giving out free diploma for a fees for $5,000!!!!!!</p>
              <p>and we even once had a lecturer, who cant even teach. she was basically reading off the text. she told us on the first day that she spent nights preparing the notes and lecture, but found out it was a complete copy and paste from the lecturer's version of the textbook's cd rom. she still dare to say she teaches in wat poly wat uni. we wasted money and time trying to teach her instead of learning from her!!! and for this, our results for this module was mostly distinction and high distinction.</p>
              <p>from wat i see that since you have taken up this course, either you can take this case up to CASE as you have definately been cheated your way through, or you can jst let this matter off and get the cert and endure another 2 years with them.</p>

              <p>if you are wise and smart,  which i seriously doubt you are judging from your actions, you would stop this nonsense....</p>
              <p>from what you mentioned in the forum, you have humiliated yourself and the institution as you don't even have the slightest idea of the course you enrolled in and its accreditation process - its outright clear that you didn't do your research....</p>
              <p>if you have your doubts, you should go through the proper channels to clear them. posting an online forum to gather support for your stupid cause ain't gonna do nothing other than to further tarnish the school's reputation and your reputation (which i'm not in the least concerned).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is childish behaviour and i regret to say the fine body of psychology has such a mindless student like you....</p>
              <p>what a 'good' way to start the year, especially after we took so long to earn its accredited rights...you have to impose this shit</p>
              <p>geezzz....i seriously hope that i don't get you as my classmate....you are not only a figment of character but shallow in maturity as well...</p>
              <p>for the school's, its students and for your own bloody sake....put a end to this madness...</p>
