              <p><em>2 of my friends and i signed up for a psychology diploma with a commerical school . The diploma is awarded by an university from western australia.</em></p>
              <p><em>we have been very uphappy about the services of the school as we were treated like second class citizen and the administration was very poor . the staff turnover was frightening.</em></p>
              <p>recently there were some rumors that the school has lost some exam scripts and to cover their tracks, all students affected was given a distinction without even attempting a re-sit. i find this extremely disappointing but there is nothing i can do...</p>

              <p>i have studied very hard and managed to pass with some credits and 1 distinction. this is my hardwork but now i felt so helpless. the piece of paper i am getting is worthless... apparently some of the students who didnt attempt the examiation also got a distinction.</p>
              <p>how can that b. i have checked and it is true, to shut the affected students, the school agreed to give ADDITIONAL marks to the students assignements and pass them with distinction.</p>
              <p>i am now at the crosss road . i want a refund but i wasted 5 months of my time. i want to go to MOE but that will affect my university resputation and hurt my career opportunites.</p>
              <p>i have done my checks. the school is accredited with case and the program is accredited by MOE. the university is also approved by austraila psychological association and worst the school is also sqc-peo which is like the gold standards of education.</p>
              <p>my friends and i felt so trapped and lost. i feel like just giving up and drop out but what about my hard earn $$$... how can a university do such a thing just to shut up the students and cover the incident. they could have give a re-sit..... WHY WHY WHY..</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>So does posting here help. You're stuck between a rock and a hard place. Think carefully about what you are unhappy about.</p>
              <p>So it's the case of the students who got distinction? Like eagle mentioned, 1 module with distinction does not make that much of a difference. Its only one module. If you want to tell on them - sure, but then again you don't wish to for fear that doing so will discredit the whole course/batch and by proxy, yourself included.</p>
              <p>You already mentioned that you already taken the bank loan. You also mentioned that the course and degree awarded is accredited - so what is the noise about it being worthless? Its not worthless, the content you study is NOT worthless. If there are such more incidents, if next time the student affected is you, and you are the one who got the distinction for free, will you come here and WHINE about you getting distinction due to the admin losing your assignment and the other students getting credit?</p>
              <p>Amid the wall of text that you have typed, trying to push blame on the admin, the school, the course, the degree - the underlying message that you are trying to push is that YOU ARE JEALOUS. Jealous because you think your hardwork deserved marks while the students whose assignments were lost got higher marks than you. Why don't you think - what makes your assignment so special above the others? can you be 100% sure that the assignments that were lost by the admin will not have gotten distinction in the first place?</p>
              <p>In the first place, you should have done your own prior research in the first place, before taking the bank loan and etc etc etc. I'm sure if the course is accredited, there are a few schools that you can learn from. Its a case of buyer beware - just that in this case the school you chose fell short of your expectations.</p>
              <p>I would like to reiterate what noahnoah said - Be happy with what you have. Too pushy and you might lose everything.</p>

              <p>sorry is it  diploma you took or the degree you took?</p>
              <p>For Diploma, if you are taking from private whether you from which school they will be rate as second class as most of the local companies will prefer to get those local polytechnic students unless you studied in a course that local poly didn't have. Like medic or Some HR courses.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My brother took up private HR course from the teka mall. which is sg HR assocciation recognised.</p>
              <p>When you want to take up course from oversea exchange study, you should check with professional board how recogised the diploma and degree and not blindly take it up.</p>

              <p>Okay, first thing, it appears that you don't have a clear idea of what you've gotten yourself into.  The APS does not and has never approved universities - they only approve courses, and only degree (not diploma) courses at that.  You will have no recourse with the APS since they can't pull accreditation on a course they never accredited in the first place.</p>
              <p>You can approach your university student ombudsman who will investigate the case and maintain your confidentiality.  On the other hand, before you lodge any reports, you'd jolly well make sure that you have evidence to prove that these students are getting the marks without attending the exams.  If you want to send the ombudsman on a wild goosechase based upon nothing but unsubstantiated allegations, do so at your own peril.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/44974">Gedanken</a>, thank you for your point. of alll the info posted here. yours is by far the most helpful.</p>
              <p>1 question. i saw the diploma certificate , it is awarded by the university n the school. it has 2 logos of the university and the school. so its awarded by the university.</p>
              <p>it is a 3 year programme which i signed up . year 1 is awarded by both insitutution and year 2 and 3 by the university only.</p>
              <p>we just want to get out and i have evidence, you suggest we write in to APS ?</p>
              <p>we want a refund and if we bring the evidence to case singapore does it help.</p>
              <p>honestly, never trust an australia university. the government will do anything to get the student's money...including this......</p>

              <p>Hang on.  Are you doing a <strong>degree</strong>, or are you doing a <strong>diploma</strong>?</p>
              <p>If you're <strong>not</strong> doing a degree, forget the APS - they have nothing to do with it.</p>
              <p>In any case, you said you want a refund.  The APS cannot help you there.  In fact, the ombudsman probably won't be able to either.</p>
              <p>If it's a refund you're after, CASE seems to be the most useful body you can approach.  Frankly, I don't think your chances are good.  If you paid for a full year, I'd expect that you'd get one semester's fees back at most.</p>
              <p>One thing you might want to try is approaching the university with this issue.  It may be that they are not aware that the school in Singapore is doing this, and if so, they may back your demand for a refund to protect their reputation, and possibly terminate their affiliation with the school.</p>
              <p>I don't think it's fair to make a general conclusion about Australian universities on the basis of what's happened.  In my eight years at Australian universities I've never had anything like this happen to me.</p>

              <p>Ms Sim.. i smypathise with your case.. i m a curtin graduate and some years back, the university stuff up some exam papers and the resit paper leaked out. some students got a copy of them and ace thier exam. university chancellor has to come up and apoloogies and all students re-sit their exam. even then, the reputation of curtin was tarnished. many indonesian students goes to curtin because tthey are the easiest to passed amongt the australian university.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i had a hard time finding as job... hope u are not from curtin aswell.. anyway curtin dont offer psychology in singapore...or do there ? think they got campus here now... gosh.. really hoped its not curtin.. you must  face the decision and be brave enouf to do it.. keep crying over spilled milk is futile. if you have evidence. go to the university or AQUA, an australia body oto confrnt them. you wil get your recourse, but be prepared to be cruified for standing out like Mr tan kim lien....sign.. no democracy in singapore anyway... all just keep quiet and live a quiet life....very problem just keep the mouthy shu.welll. good luck in watherver you do. happychrismas...</p>
