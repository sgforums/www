            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">You're looking at it as sex with an inanimate object. No doubt, this is similiar to the current trend of sex with blow up sex dolls. But honestly, lets put aside the whole debate of whether such behaviour is twisted or not. Do not forget that normality is defined by society. When we look back at what was normal in the past, we sometimes find it laughable do we not? Its never right to judge normality, and hence, what is twisted, thru our present eyes. Afterall, if people of the past saw you today, you'd be a very twisted person indeed, for u're a girl but u're wearing pants.<br><br>Humans are a constantly evolving creature. The long and short is that anyone not willing to accept evolution and sees evolution as a "slide", will not wish to pay the "price" however justified and necessary it is. In the end, its not hard to guess who becomes extinct 1st.<br><br>Taking the whole issue of robotic sex from another angle, the big question is, when robots become so human that humans cannot help falling in love with them, are people going to adopt the same attitude they adopt towards gay relationships, mixed race relationships today? How do we define what is human? How can we be sure that AI doesn't develop a self-awareness? What then defines the soul? Does human mean one has to be organic? What about people who have been so extensively cybornically modified that they are only a 'ghost' in a artificial body?<br><br>These are philosophical questions about the future facing us today. We must learn to see things from tomorrow's eyes, not today's eyes. It is very short-sighted indeed, to just assume that your eyes of today are the absolute best judgement in everything. To come right out and blatently call such behaviours and minds twisted, can be quite ill considered and is perhaps not in the most open minded context. However, I will add that males HAVE to evolve their thinking as well, for it not too incorrect to say, as sixsentinals have said, that they are so dominated by sex that everything in their lives seems driven by sex alone.</div></blockquote>good speech! when complete AI is achieved and implemented into machines, humans may start developing feelings for the robots and then society would see these people as outcasts...</div>

Â“We have to manage the ethics of the scientists making the robots and the artificial ethics inside the robots.Â”<br><br>Verruggio and his colleagues have identified key areas that include: ensuring human control of robots; preventing illegal use; protecting data acquired by robots; and establishing clear identification and traceability of the machines.<br><br>Â“Scientists must start analysing these kinds of questions and seeing if laws or regulations are needed to protect the citizen,Â” said Verruggio. Â“Robots will develop strong intelligence, and in some ways it will be better than human intelligence.<br><br>Â“But it will be alien intelligence; I would prefer to give priority to humans.Â”<br><br>The analysis culminated at a meeting recently held in Genoa by the European Robotics Research Network (Euron) that examined the problems likely to arise as robots become smarter, faster, stronger and ubiquitous.<br><br>Â“Security, safety and sex are the big concerns,Â” said Henrik Christensen, a member of the Euron ethics group. How far should robots be allowed to influence peopleÂ’s lives? How can accidents be avoided? Can deliberate harm be prevented? And what happens if robots turn out to be sexy? Â“The question is what authority are we going to delegate to these machines?Â” said Professor Ronald Arkin, a roboticist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. Â“Are we, for example, going to give robots the ability to execute lethal force, or any force, like crowd control?Â” The forthcoming code is a sign of reality finally catching up with science fiction. Ethical problems involving machines were predicted in the 1950s by the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov whose book I, Robot was recently turned into a Hollywood film. The Terminator and Robocop series of films also portrayed mechanical law enforcers running amok.<br><br>Present robots perform more mundane tasks: the most common consumer robots in Britain include self-guided vacuum cleaners such as the Scooba, lawnmowers such as the Robomow and childrenÂ’s toys such as Robosapien.<br><br>But far more sophisticated machines are being developed. The National Health Service has used a robot called da Vinci to perform surgery at GuyÂ’s and St ThomasÂ’ NHS Foundation Trust in London. In Japan, human-like robots such as HondaÂ’s Asimo and SonyÂ’s Qrio can walk on two legs. More advanced versions are expected to be undertaking everyday domestic tasks and helping to care for the elderly in as little as 20 years.<br><br>Â“I would hope they would always be subordinate,Â” said Brian Aldiss, the science fiction writer. Â“But one will no doubt come to rely on them deeply.Â” AldissÂ’s short story Supertoys Last All Summer Long was the basis for the Steven Spielberg film AI, which addressed the subject of whether androids that have become as intelligent as humans should be denied equal rights.<br><br>Other dilemmas may arrive sooner than we think, says Christensen. Â“People are going to be having sex with robots within five years,Â” he said. So should limits be set on the appearance, for example, of such robotic sex toys? The greatest danger, however, is likely to lie with robots that are able to learn from their Â“experiencesÂ”. As systems develop, robots are likely to have much more sophisticated self-learning mechanisms built into them and it may become impossible to predict exactly how they will behave.<br><br>Â“My guess is that weÂ’ll have conscious machines before 2020,Â” said Ian Pearson, futurologist-in-residence at BT. Â“If we put that in a robot, itÂ’s an android. That is an enormous ethical change.Â”<br><br>To critics who scoff that intelligent robots are a long way off, the roboticists easily riposte that machines can already exert surprising influence over our lives Â— think about the influence of the internet.<br><br>Keeping control<br><br>New robo-ethics recommendations<br><br>Safety Ensure human control of robot<br>Security Prevent wrong or illegal use<br>Privacy Protect data held by robot o Traceability Record robotÂ’s activity<br>Identifiability Give unique ID to each robot<br><br><strong>Isaac AsimovÂ’s laws of robotics </strong><br><br>Robot may not injure human or, through inaction, allow human to come to harm<br>Robot must obey human orders, unless they conflict with first law<br>Robot must protect itself if this does not conflict with other laws<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by SixSentinels:<br><strong>Within the next 15 years, sex dolls will go robotic. This may pose a serious problem for human society as these dolls can be customized and fitted with various components such as facial features, extra large bre@sts. These dolls would move on their own, acquiring knowledge from its user so that it is better able to satisfy its owner's needs. They'll be so lifelike, indistinguishable from the real human being. People would tend to have sex with these dolls than with their wives or girlfriends, and very soon, these dolls would no longer be just a bedroom item, but they'll function as the household's maid or servant, quickly gaining new upgrades and add-ons to make it smarter, more intelligent, and capable of helping humans in almost every way. Robots will no longer be programmed with a fixed set of code, instead, they'll have a very simple mind that mimics that of the human, a mind that starts small and grows bigger with life experiences. It will be a mind that gains knowledge and skills as it goes through life as a machine, like how a baby grows up in human society. Already, countries such as Korea and Japan have set goals of having at least one household robot in every home by 2020-2025, and with this I ask you, [b]"Will robots pose a greater threat to human society than humans themselves?"</strong><br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/08/Repliee_Q1_at_expo.jpg/180px-Repliee_Q1_at_expo.jpg"><br><br>The woman in red is a Gynoid (female robot) and has basic human functions. Repliee Q1 has silicone for skin, rather than hard plastic. It has a number of sensors to allow it to react in a manner that appears natural; it appears to flutter its eyelids, chest movements correspond to breathing, and other tiny shifts in position that mimic unconscious human movement.[/b]</blockquote>Oh my God! This is bad!<br><br>Imagine the number of perverted ideas people will have if these robots ever become a retail product!<br><br></div>
