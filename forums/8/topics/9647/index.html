            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, this sort of relationship would be a test on the lady more than the guy. Only the lady would be able to answer such a question, as I feel the guy doing NS will be very emotional dependent on the lady. The term absence makes the heart grow fonder is only an optimistic view. And the feelings more often than not will be corroded in someway or the other, either by his reliance on the lady, or by the lady's longingness of a more stable relationship, the wish to have her loved one beside her when she is feeling down or when she sees another couple lovingly walk past.<br><br>But don't take my word for it. It has all been encouraging posts in this thread and I feel the reality of it all is that it is more negative than positive. And the onus would be on the lady to maintain the relationship, especially for the guy who is going to go through BMT.<br><br>So knowing that such a relationship is hard to maintain, I guess the lady would really need to make the extra effort to keep the flame ablazed. A heart to heart talk to the guy to give him the reassurance would be very helpful. Don't give him the space to have any doubts about the relationship.<br><br>Very negative guy I am. But I still believe things might work, With special effort, especially on the lady. It will be tiring, but just picture yourself in his arms, or the beautiful memories that you all share, when you feel weary, and understand this will be a difficult patch both of you will be going through.

            <div class='col-md body'>It all depends on both of u. If u had wished to go astray, nothing can stop this thought from becoming reality. I do have experience of a breakup when I was in my NS. Most sad experience for me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>It's up to u. U can choose to give yourself and him the chance to test this relationship. Seeing each other everyday doesn't mean the relationship will last. What matters most is whether either party trusts each other to make it last. Have faith.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Else, maybe the time the two of you dun see each other is like a few months and this time-off will really stress your relationship.<br><br>Or try to think of ways to let him know that you miss him even when you're flying... me cracking my brains also, trying to think of how to communicate with him when no handphone  is allowed in Tekong... can't even sms... thinking of song dedication over radio...<br><br>got ideas must share hor...</div>
