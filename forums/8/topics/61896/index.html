            <div class='col-md body'><strong>(Unedited version)</strong><br><br>This article, I shall explore the technical details of the film. Like any other articles, they represent my own perception of the film and offer an alternative view on it. Please feel free to post what you feel but I hope you can take some time to read through it and digest the essence before you flame me or post rebuttals.<br><br>Â“Every program exists or a purpose. Without one, they will cease to existÂ…Â”<br><br>To begin, let me go through the cast of the more important characters in the film, and their real purposes.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NEO-- The One (with Morpheus and Trinity)</span><br><br>NEO belongs to the side of the ARCHITECT. He is a tool used to enable reset of the Matrix. He can be likened to a RESET BUTTON on the CPU (please see ORACLE, ARCHITECT and the SOURCE).<br><br>The machines found a purpose in NEO which is to determine when a version of the Matrix should be rebooted. NEO program embedded in a selected individual human. Morpheus and Trinity are programs written to locate this individual from the Matrix and bring him out of Matrix.<br><br>NEO was thought to bring hope to the people of ZION. The irony here is that, he exists because of an anomaly of the system, the result of an unbalanced equation, such that the machines are forced to implement and utilize him to bring about the destruction of ZION, to enable maximum amount of individuals to accept the system. Every other versions of the Matrix had NEO choosing the Â‘correctÂ’ door which will lead to the destruction and reconstruction of the ZION. Thus, ZION was just another tool used by the Source to contain the human infidels who didnÂ’t choose to remain in the Matrix.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AGENT SMITH</span><br>Agent Smith and Neo were opposites. Hence, at this juncture, you shouldnÂ’t be surprised to hear that he is a tool being used by the ORACLE. (Remember, in Matrix 3, when Agent Smith smashed the cookie plate and shouted like a crazy bastard, he mentioned that the Oracle was his creator.)<br><br>What was his real purpose? If you remember the rule of thumbÂ—Neo and Smith are opposites, then youÂ’ll be able to understand that the ORACLE was using Smith as a threat to trick ARCHITECT. In the end, the machines were so threatened by SMITH that they agreed to peace with ZION. It turned out that Smith is the saviour of ZION in version 6 of the Matrix.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The ORACLE, ARCHITECT and the SOURCE</span><br>What are they? To explain my theory, I shall compare these characters using things in real life.<br><br>The Source is like the Universe (Motherboard???), a place to hold the realm which resides the machines and the humans. Its sole purpose is to balance the elements contained. (balancing is a very important concept in matrix. We have smith vs neo, machines vs human, oracle vs architect. None of them can exist without their opposites.) Neo is linked to the source. Hence he seems to possess omnipotent powers. He was given such great powers because he is a direct tool in balancing the humans and machines.<br><br>The Oracle is like God (OS???) and the Architect the Devil(Harddisk???). From certain points of view, one is good and one is bad. But without bad there wonÂ’t be good so the Architect isnÂ’t that bad after all. Without a Harddisk the OS wun work and vice versa.<br>It was always mentioned that the Architect doesnÂ’t understand any options beyond him. The Architect (the name already suggests that he is very structural and logical) was only programmed to understand NEO choosing the usual door and not the other door. This means that the Matrix and Zion were supposed to function in such a way that NEO would come to the Architect for the door of reset and Zion destroyed and rebuilt with 13 individualsÂ…..<br>HOWEVER this time round, the Oracle played a game of chance. She played with the idea of giving NEO a choice. Using Agent Smith and Neo with this new found sense of choice, she was able to arrive in a better outcome in the end for the humans, where ZION and humans werenÂ’t destroyed. However, she didnÂ’t know this would come. She couldnÂ’t foresee what level of new equilibrium would be attained. Â…Â…Â….<br><br>(to be continuedÂ… more on oracle, Merovingian and othersÂ….good luck for my exams!)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THE MATRIX TRILOGY EXPLAINED - HONESTLY<br>by mikejwash@sbcglobal.net (movies profile) Nov 6, 2003<br>6006 of 6526 people found this review helpful<br><br>Let me first say I PROMISE YOU WILL LOVE THIS TRILOGY IF U READ THIS.<br><br>I apologize if my email does not follow the rules of this forum, but I felt I could offer you a very clear explanation of the Matrix series in light of reading your reviews of the Matrix Revolutions. The bottom line is people don't understand it. So this is a crash course for anyone who wants answers. Real one's, not some fanboys idea of what it's about. Please note, SPOILERS ARE ALL THROUGH THIS REVIEW.<br><br>Here we go with the basics.<br><br>Zion is real! The Matrix is not.<br><br>The Matrix was designed to provide a mental stimulus for the human bodies connected to the machines as a source of power. This is the sixth version of the Matrix. There have been multiple versions of the Matrix because of a flaw in the program (kinda of like Windows). That flaw is giving individuals the ability to choose.<br><br>The first Matrix was designed as a perfect uptopia (see pt. I - Smith explains it to Morpheus; pt. II - The Architect explains it again) but humans did not accept it as real so they just kept waking up. It was redesigned to reflect our civilization at it's last stage before it was taken over by the machines (the year 1999).<br><br>The Architect's problem with this new design (the anomoly)of the Matrix is that it require individuals to think freely, i.e. choice. It was the Oracle that suggested he redesign the Matrix in this way. But since humans have choices, so must the programs sent to watch over them, i.e. The Agents, thus bringing us the problem that is Mr. Smith. In Reloaded, The Architect continues to speak of the anomoly he is unable to get rid of, which is why at some point, he feels the only solution is to destroy the Matrix and those who are aware of it (the people of Zion) and start from scratch again.<br><br>The Oracle says it clearly in Revolutions. Mr. Smith is the result of the anomoly trying to balance itself. Mr. Smith began to think freely (see part I where he is freaking out while interrogating Morpheous) and the result was a negative one. Realize this, he is a similar program to the One so he is far more dangerous than a normal individual who makes bad decisions. Mr. Smith's virus like behavior happened in EVERY VERSION OF THE MATRIX. The result would always lead to the same thing -- a system crash if they didn't quickly reboot the system. The same knee jerk reaction you have when you realize someone has sent you a virus.<br><br>The One program was created to solve this problem. But each version of the One ultimately failed. Neo is different, in Reloaded he choose the door that led to Trinity, not the door that RESETS the program. Note: The Architect even noticed that Neo's experience in the Matrix was different than all the rest, realizing he was the first of them to fall in love.<br><br>Onto Revolutions:<br><br>Neo's choice has changed everything. The system is still threatened by Smith's behavior, so the Oracle makes a new choice; one she has never done before because no version of the One has ever chosen the difficult path as opposed to easy one of just resetting the system. She allows herself to become merged with Smith in the HOPE that she'll be able to help Neo when the time is right.<br><br>Neo makes another unique choice. He goes to the machines and asks for PEACE as opposed to simply destroying the system by going through the opposite door as all other versions of the One did. It was a simple as that to save Zion. Machines don't need very long to process that this may be a better idea than just constantly resetting the system.<br><br>At the end, Smith says to Neo the movies tagline - "Everything that has a beginning has an end," as the Oracle is speaking to Neo through Smith. Neo realizes it all along, the only way to end this is to sacrifice himself. The Oracle noted that Neo and the Source (the computer mainframe, the Architect they're all one and the same so don't get confused) are connected which is why he can control machines outside the Matrix. He uses this connection to his advantage. He becomes a Mr. Smith and since all the Smith's are connected, the Source now has a lock on Smith and simply deletes him. Pretty simple huh?<br><br>For those that like to dig deeper, than note the biblical references throughout the series. Heck, the French Man (Merovigchian) is the Devil, just read the elevator button Morpheous presses when he goes to see him for the second time. The Architect represents God - i.e. the creator of the world and its destroyer whenever things don't go as he wants. He even has you to chose a select group of people to restart Zion again sort of like Noah's Ark. Neo is Jesus, the one who realizes that peace and love is the answer, not war. And the Oracle represents the Holy Spirit - the conciousness that resides in all of us. It's a deep trilogy if you PAY ATTENTION.</div>
