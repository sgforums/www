He got sexually abused by his dad up to 5 years old but he kep quiet about it.. During his primary school, he never had his own textbooks but he persevered by staying back after school and revised using his teachers' materials. he had an irregular allowance in primary school with the most he can get was $1 for three days... He tried to supplement his allowance by collecting cardboard and tin cans when he was free and selling them to the karung guni.. But his parents caught him and took all of his "income" and spend it on booze and cigarettes..  Secondary school was worse, he got abused and beaten up by his parents when they were in drunken stupor... he never had allowance...and is reduced to eating his classmates leftover or "dont wants" during recess.. Drinks are just melted cups of ice water or plain water with ice... Again, he had no money for textbooks or other exam materials or even stationery.. getting stationery, he had to resort to freebies such as "free pens" in a promotion or road shows... He never had the chance to date as his free time will be in the library revising or working.. He worked his 4 years in secondary school to supplement his income..sometimes working up to 15 hours..again, his parents took most of it...he saved the rest in a savings account which he kept from his parents...<br><br>Then after sec sch, he got into a good jc..good jc means using up more and more money.. luckily for him, he made an "adopted mother" in the form of his civics tutor who found out about his background and paid up most of his education...When he stayed over his adopted mum's place for a few weeks, his parents couldnt care less and didnt ask about him...<br><br>Now he's 30 reaching 31..earning almost 30-35k per month..he found out his adopted mum was down with stage 3 cancer and requiring much of his attention.. the worse part was that his real parents are also down with stage 3 cancer and they begged him to pay for their treatments because THEY ARE his real parents...<br><br>now what should he do? when he told me his story, i teared because he's 30 plus and good looking, he never had the chance to enjoy life's pleasures such as dating..he didnt even buy a car...now he's torn between two parties..his adopted mum told him to ignore her and care for his real parents for they are his real parents... but his real parents didnt even care for him abit ever in his life...<br><br>sigh..life is sad</div></blockquote>he shld help his adopted mother too as she helped her b4. He shld also pay his real parents treatment. Then he will have a better life afterwards.</div>

Parents shd not treat their children as a form of investment.
