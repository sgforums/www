            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : The government is serious about getting to the root of Singapore's widening income gap.<br><br>Manpower Minister Ng Eng Hen said the Ministerial Committee on Low Wage Workers was not looking at quick-fix solutions, but an overall philosophy to deal with the matter.<br><br>And he said creating jobs just to keep people employed was not the way to go, especially if the jobs do not have market value.<br><br>Dr Ng was addressing multiple concerns in Parliament on the issue.<br><br>Retraining, job redesign and re-creation are some policies on hand to help low wage workers but MPs wanted to know whether they have really helped.<br><br>"How does he address the concerns of those undergone retraining but still can't find employment or better job opportunities?" asked Dr Lily Neo, MP for Jalan Besar GRC.<br><br>Leong Horn Kee, MP for Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC said: "The government should consider a more comprehensive review of the entire help package that we give to our lower income group. Are we doing enough to help bring up the level?"<br><br>Dr Ng said more work was being done to make sure that training was relevant for these workers.<br><br>He added that it was not enough to just come up with quick solutions or resort to welfarism.<br><br>Instead, Singapore has to find its own way to prevent a permanent underclass where someone is born into a disadvantaged class and can't get out.<br><br>Dr Ng said: "We don't want to perpetuate a permanent underclass. All the facts and surveys show us that your social economic background can disadvantage you because your children can't take advantage of educational opportunities."<br><br>"I don't want to rush the committee for quick and pat answers. I want solutions that are sustainable. These are structural challenges," he added.<br><br>Dr Ng also noted that the events like the Iraq war and SARS outbreak a few years ago had worsened the outlook for these lower end jobs.<br><br>- CNA /ls<br><br><strong>First of all to reduce the income gap, I think the gov should make it compulsory for the 49,000 millionaires to donate peanuts everyyear to whatever charities. These millionaires can have their names published to glorify them (chinese want face).<br><br>Next, everyone living in HDB flats should have whatever they have donated to NKF given back to them.<br><br>Thirdly, the sons and daughters of these millionaires should be drafted into the army and serve 3 years. They have more peanuts in Singapore, so it is rightful for them to be more serious on protecting Singapore. Then all HDB dwellers' sons should only serve 1 year and be released into the working world as soon as possible to earn money and get experience.</strong></div>

Why not say, the poor is poor becoz they are lazy...( yesh, does working 12 hrs a day means you are hardworking?)<br><br>If you want to live in a country with smaller income gap...try the 3rd world country. Coz our economic is driven by the rich...never the poor. So its wise to find out how you can get rich,rather than finger pointing people who doesnt even know you exist.....</div></blockquote>you are talking like those people in insurance.<br><br></div>
