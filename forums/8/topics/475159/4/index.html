              world of sports better not go there anymore warning, the staff same as courts megastore and stores, will treat you as thief first when you enter and as customers after you make payment to buy but by then you leaving already what service can you get siao. all world of sports store the same one la, even roal sporting house also the same, sports link also the same, guess all local stores selling things with commission for staff all using same method coz kiasua mah, if you dont buy they treat you as thief, even fairprice also, if you buy they win and you get no customer service. either way they all win kar liaoz. world of sports tampines 1, plaza singapura, bugis junction bhg, jurong point are some world of sports stores i went but didnt go for many years already waste of time, for royal sporting house all the store same like ngee ann city those in orchard road and easter side in tampines mall, for sports links are those stores in amk central, tampines 1 and all the same la sama sama as i said. their tactics are they wont approach you but stand a distance look at you and your friends treat you as thief see if you steal their department things coz they have to deduct pay leh if lost item. if you or you let your boyfriend or girlfriend oggle by their male or female staff you happy meh, and naturally you cant focus on enjoying shopping browsing things when a pair of eyes keep scanning your whole body, they like standing at end of a lane especially when you looking at whole row of socks or other small items they scared you steal mah what a crap. if you question them their standard answer is: oh no la we stand here to get ready to serve you if you need. what a lame and stupid answer if a sincere staff want to serve, he or she should come forward offer help not stand there like a log.
              
              real experience in tampines 1 sports link, an aunty staff when i was there searching for sports short in their wagon, she did not want to let me turn the shorts in wagon fear of have to fold all again, keep saying everything dont have and expect me to walk to other dept to search, kena scolded by me what the heck she doing then she guai guai go fetch the shorts i want but i brushed her side and left, why should you buy from these 3 stores when you can get even lower price and higher quality from online direct from usa like amazon ebay - new items, and if you willing to pay abit more but want made in usa stuffs highest quality, go under armour, sure you kee sia over their things, most importantly when you wear out, not many locals heave it and under armour only open stores in usa, internatioally they use online. you want exclusive go under armour

              2 education institutions dont go and better inform our friends not attend too. one is auston institute of management, my friend was in there study degree in 2004 and found their lecturers substandard - no phds only masters, degree 1 year can graduate already walao like that also can meh. after my friend left, in 2006, they got into trouble as listed company newly ipo for 1 year plus, the ceo falsified accounting figures and kena jailed and think all the lecturers also left but keep in mind the 2 lecturers in 2004 teaching strategic managment - a male chinese wear specs formerly a moe teacher in secondary school - he is the head of department in auston specially supervisor graduates final year strategic management project, and the other is a chinese male feminine  - can speak japanese coz used to work in japan company local, taught either international marketing or international management, friend say they are in cahoots with ceo but got away maybe, now auston institute of management i dont knwo how already no comments they moved from bugis area and now flooded with china students. but if you find that these two kar nai sai bor eng lan lecturers in any institutions, you better stay away from these schools, they cant teach and no integrity. want a safe route, go for sim and unisim, govt subsidy too.
              
              second one is singapore institute of materials management, principal roger, china manager lawrence and general manager morries all kar nar sai bor eng lan, they have so many china students thats as full-time that the staff also come from china, culture totally china style already, maybe a few local staffs attend to part-time students, but if you intend to take up part-time study, better go unisim and sim, why because simm chinese students have not even graduate can begin their masters degree course from curtin univertsity already, what do you think of this kind of school as corrupt and incompetent, also avoid curtin university if you want do distance learning from sim.

            <div class='col-md body'>this company arf (asia pacific) insurance, maxwell road, mnd building, better not go to buy insurance whether personal or general, or even go there interview for jobs. real life story here. during job interview, the chinese male boss a hokkien, personally interview shows how small the company is - not stable, likes to ask interviewee use microsoft words and start to pick and criticize little things to insult candidate especially uni and diploma graduates, he personally a diploma grad from olden times la. trying to show off in front of his malaysian secretary kar nar lan sai. worst he will force you sign 2 year contract in the guise of making you focus on job rather than look for better prospects, doesnt he know what is basic human rights, and in modern economy who will sign unless you are a scholar, hes not in right frame of mind and living in olden days liao very old school thinking, no wonder his company just besides amoy street market haiz. then i realized its the way he makes money, after one sign contract which he wanted to make interviewee sign immediately where got company like that no need think can sign during interview, and if you break even one day , have to compensate one to few months of salary, my friend left and shoot him an email chastising his attitude and way and behavior, and unethical way of doing business, salute my friend here! then my friend after one week received calls from china people telling him he stricke lottery and must remit money there, they used skype numbers like 12 digits no way to track and trace,  file online police report but officer return call no issue with this company as an illegal syndicate. so i highly suspect once the company cant make you sign, they will sell your information and esp phone number online to make a little sum and you suay suay kena china scam loh. beware this insurance company</div>
