            <div class='col-md body'>actually there was a story in Singapore about this guy who was abusive and raped his own wife and wife's sister. He felt no remourse when he was sentenced cause he thought he was 'teaching" his wife and sister in law how to behave in his presence when he is drunk or angry or whenever he is unhappy etc. He used violence to subjugate and violate but when he was in jail, he was also raped by the inmates but he still thought he was right to exercise violence. Till the last year, when his spirit was broken and he realised the err of his way. Then he became a piest and attempt to use religion to remove his sin. However, his wife divorced him and avoided him at all costs. His sister in law was so traumatised that she's in and out of mental hospital. The women hated him as much as they can. I feel that for a man to exercise such violence, that he destroys lives, he deserves more than death.<br>For me, I will always pray that for all the violent men/women and rapists (men and women) and evil people out there, that they will meet their doom in the nost horrible ways a million times over.<br><br>My nic is from a song. I used to watch a fountain spray out its misty waters by the river side and at that moment the radio was playing that song. Its also a longing for ...<br><br>[/code]</div>
