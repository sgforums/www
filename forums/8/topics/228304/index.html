Please contact me and ask me if you want to reproduce. Thank You.<br><br>One day private Rodney came to the station and ask Inspector Lim about a very bizzare case that happened yesterday.... on there was this man called uncle John who is 40 yr old was killed in his study room on the second storey of his house. When looked into the house apparently he put up a pretty good fight against his intruder before he was killed. In the house there are altogether 7 other person... They are all the suspects.<br><br>1) Bodyguard<br>2)Son of 8 yr old<br>3) Wife<br>4) Nanny<br>5) Maid<br>6) Butler<br>7) Cook<br><br>While interviewed... they found out that The body guard was out early in the morning to town and back the very next morning drunk. The Butler was chatting with the Maid thru the night at the lobby with the television and the only staircase up resided. The cook was sleeping in the room next to the staircase. The Nanny was with the Son coaxing him to sleep in the son's room at level two. The Wife is in the master bed room 2nd level too. There was nothing in particular that happens... No one was seen up and down the stair case thru the night. But The Butler was having a severe diarrhea and keep going to toilet. The cook was in his own room and woke up the next morning. There was a sound on the roof outside the house. Upon checked by the butler and maid they found its just a cat. Television is showing horror show. Window is opened at the kitchen at level one. And finally because the study room is sound proof... no one could heard any struggle.<br><br>Can you help inspector Lim solve the murder? Who killed uncle John and how did he do that?<br><br></div>
