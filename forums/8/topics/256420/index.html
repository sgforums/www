            <div class='col-md body'>Below is my latest complaint letter written and sent...<br>Just posting here so you guys can take note when buying certain model.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>==================<br><br>My friend, *** *****, bought your w880i phone recently on the 23rd of April. After using the phone for less than a week, it started to give my friend problems whenever he tried to synchronize the phone with his computer or use his headset.<br><br>Apparently, your phone choose to black out on him whenever he plug the charger or the earpiece in and refused to power on when it remains connected. The first send in was on the 28th of April, just 5 days after the phone was purchased.<br><br>He requested for an exchange for a new set as this was simply unacceptable. He was rejected and the phone was sent in for servicing. A week after he collected his phone, another problem surfaced. The phone decided to turn itself into a disco light instead. The led lights and the LCD lights flash on and off non-stop when it was turned on.<br><br>As he is tied down by his busy schedule, he was only able to visit the service center only recently which is on the 20th of May. Keep in mind that it is still less than a month. He again requested for an exchange and was rejected again. His phone was sent in for service again and he was promised that they will change everything except the casing.<br><br>Upon collection, the staff who attended to him insisted to have his memory card formatted while telling him that there is a virus in his memory card and she succeeded in doing so.<br><br>On the next day, 24th of May, another problem surfaced again. The phone blacked out when the contact list was selected. I accompanied him this time round as he felt frustrated at the fact that he bought the phone for less than a month, used it for less than a week and still have to send in his phone yet again. Not only this, he also complained to me that he was not able to relate well to your staffs as no one seems to be able to speak mandarin.<br><br>I requested to speak to the manager but was attended by the service centerÂ’s supervisor, S$#%y. I do not understand the reason why I do not have the honor to meet them even in my previous visits. Anyway, He was not able to tell me what virus that was claimed to be in my friendÂ’s memory card, that my friendÂ’s important data was seemingly forcefully deleted because of the reformat. Furthermore, he could not give any acceptable answer on why the interior was not replaced when it was promised to my friend in his previous visit.<br><br>If you are too busy to pull up the job descriptions, I shall relate it to you in this letter.<br><br>Job No. 1 : Customise Set. Clean up battery contact and connecter.<br>Job No. 2 : Customise Set. Advise to format M2 card.<br><br>It was written Â“advise to format M2 cardÂ” and not Â“virus in M2 cardÂ”. Furthermore, the M2 card was not send in with the set, why would your staff make such ridiculous claims? Even if so, should your staff not scan the memory card to verify but to reformat it directly?<br><br>S%$^y explained that it might be not a virus but corrupted data. But it was never verified in the first place and no attempt to explain, let alone allow my friend to salvage his data before they are thrown into the black hole.<br><br>As my friend is Chinese, he does not understand English well and felt threatened in the sense that there is really a virus in the M2 card and it had to be formatted to solve the problem.<br><br>I am rather satisfied by the staff and supervisor who attended to me during this visit rather than the previous encounter with Kevin Poh who impersonated the manager and made ridiculous claims about your K750i about a year back. My friend rejected to send in the phone although Sunny asked for a last chance to rectify the problem for him.<br><br>My question remains, what is wrong with your w880i? Why does different problems surface when the previous problems are rectified? Does your cable and software cause corrupted data? Why do some of your staffs make false claims and causes your customers to lose value data unnecessarily?<br><br>On the behalf of my friend, I am requesting your company to replace his faulty w880i handset, faulty headset, faulty cable, faulty charger and Â“virusÂ” infected M2 card with a new one. If itÂ’s possible, a possible explanation on what is going on.<br><br>Model : W880i<br>Imei : %*&amp;^&amp;%^#^%&amp;<br><br>I would appreciate that this problem can be resolved without possible press exposure like some other phones. Such would cause people to lose faith in the product and in the competency of the service center in Singapore. By the way, the service center that my friend and I visited is Wisma again.<br></div>
