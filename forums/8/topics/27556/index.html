            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>From the very beginning, gal's family objected strongly on her<br>&gt;dating this guy saying that it has got to do with family background, &amp;<br>that<br>&gt;the gal will have to suffer for the rest of her life if she were to be<br>with<br>&gt;him.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Due to family's pressure, the couple quarrel very often. Tho the<br>&gt;gal love the guy deeply, but she always ask him: "How deep is your<br>&gt;love for me?"<br>&gt;As the guy is not good with his words, this often cause the gal to<br>&gt;be very upset. With that &amp; the family's pressure, the gal often vent<br>&gt;her anger on him.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;As for him,.. he only endure it in silence.<br>&gt;After a couple of years, the guy finally graduated &amp; decided to<br>&gt;further his studies in overseas. Before leaving, he proposed to the gal:<br>&gt;"I'm not very good with words. But all I know is that I love<br>&gt;you.If you allow me, I will take care of you for the rest of my life. As<br>&gt;for<br>&gt;your family, I'll try my best to talk them round. Will you marry me?"<br>&gt;The gal agreed, &amp; with the guy's determination, the family finally<br>&gt;gave in &amp; agreed to let them get married. So before he leave, they got<br>&gt;engaged.<br>&gt;The gal went out to the working society, whereas the guy was<br>&gt;overseas, continuing his studies. They sent their love thru emails &amp; phone<br>&gt;calls.<br>&gt;Tho it's hard, but both never thot of giving up.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;One day, while the gal was on her way to work, she was knocked<br>&gt;down by a car that lost control. When she woke up, she saw her parents<br>&gt;beside her bed.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;She realized that she was badly injured. Seeing her mum crying,<br>&gt;she wanted to comfort her. But she realized that all that could come<br>&gt;out of her mouth was just a sigh. She has lost her voice....<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The doctors says that the impact on her brain has caused her to<br>&gt;loss her voice. Listening to her parents' comfort, but with nothing coming<br>&gt;out from her,she broke down. During the stay in hospital, besides<br>&gt;silence cry,..<br>&gt;it's still just silence cry that accompanied her.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Upon reaching home, everything seems to be the same. Except for<br>&gt;the ringing tone of the phone. Which pierced into her heart everytime<br>&gt;it rang.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;She does not wish to let the guy know. &amp; not wanting to be a<br>&gt;burden to him, she wrote a letter to him saying that she does not wish to<br>&gt;wait any longer.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;With that, she sent the ring back to him. In return, the guy sent<br>&gt;millions &amp; millions of reply, countless of phonecalls,.. all the<br>&gt;gal could do, besides crying, is still crying....<br>&gt;The parents decided to move away, hoping that she could eventually<br>&gt;forget everything &amp; be happy. With a new environment, the gal<br>&gt;learn sign language &amp; started a new life. Telling herself everyday that<br>she<br>&gt;must forget the guy.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;One day, her fren came &amp; told her that he's back. She asked her<br>&gt;fren not to let him know what happened to her. Since then, there wasn't<br>&gt;anymore news of him.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;A year has passed &amp; her fren came with an envelope, containing a<br>&gt;invitation card for the guy's wedding. The gal was shattered.<br>&gt;When she open the letter, she saw her name in it instead. When she was<br>&gt;about to ask her fren wat's going on, she saw the guy standing in front<br>of<br>&gt;her.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;He used sign language telling her "I've spent a year's time to<br>&gt;learn sign language. Just to let you know that I've not forgotten our<br>&gt;promise. Let me have the chance to be your voice. I Love You." With that,<br>&gt;he<br>&gt;slipped the ring back into her finger.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The gal finally smiled.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;*Treat every relationship as if it's the last one, then<br>&gt; you'll know how to Give*<br>&gt;*Treat every moment as is it's the last day, then you'll<br>&gt; know how to treasure*<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Met her on the net, how? I can't remember. But it seems to me that it is this 'little theoryÂ’, which I declared in the cyberspace that caught her attention. 'If I have a million dollars, I would buy a house. Do I have a million? No. ThatÂ’s y I dun have a house. If I have wings, I can fly. do I have wings? No. So I can never fly. if all the waters are drawn out of Pacific Ocean, but it still can't put off the flame of love between us. Can all the waters of Pacific Ocean be drawn off? No. ThatÂ’s y I dun love u. that's me, a typical science student. 1st u comes up with an assumption, and then u fit a suitable conclusion. If the proposed assumption doesn't stand at all, then everything is just bullshit. I guess this is what they call 'unromantic'. But she is an exception. She actually mailed me and said that IÂ’m a interestingÂ’ person. Â‘InterestingÂ’? What a word to use on me, its like using 'faithful' on Mr. Clinton. I thought this gal must be a low-IQ organism, or suffering from serious brain damage. Anyway, her nick doesn't seem so bad- FLYNDANCE- that's quite a unique one. But I was warning myself: hello, this is the virtual world of Internet. Who knows what might be lurking behind a beautiful nick. Talking from experience, most of the time it will be a 'dinosaur' in disguise, the only differences will be whether it is a carnivore or an herbivore. But, I know she is way different from a 'dinosaur', she is special.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So I guess its time for the appearance of FlyNDance. ever since she mailed to tell me that I m 'interesting', I was always wishing to meet her in #ajcrr. Too bad, lady luck was just not on my side. So I can only reply her letter to tell her that I will start to train myself to become an 'interesting' person, just to show that she is far-sighted. She replied my reply, I replied her reply to my reply, she again replied my reply to her reply blah blah blah... Oh no, I just started a chain-reaction. Actually what interested me the most is this 'para' she wrote in one of the mails.... I dance swithtly, amidst the crowd. your glance on me be it surprise, be it admiration, it ain't gonna stop my rhythm<br>'COs it's not your glance that made me dance, it's my heart of youth.<br>I simply cannot relate this gal to any of the 'dinosaurs'. But if she really is a dinosaur, I m willing to let her have her fill. Tye, my best pal unfortunately, noticed my little affair with FlyNDance, and has been perpetually warning me about this....<br>"HELLO!!!... u don't even know what she looks like, y take the risk??.. maybe 'she' is a guy!!... haha!!.."<br>I can't blame Tye for his ignorance. Ever since he was dumped by Sally in Sec4, he has become a renowned 'playboy'. As the saying goes: "Once bitten, Twice shy", in this case, after Tye was bitten, he has mastered the art of skinning snakes alive, and make into soup. But he got all the factors to be a playboy, I always think he is the 19 year-old version of Brad Pitt. Tall, handsome and got this tongue that causes diabetes in every women he targets. I dun think he can even remember how many girlfriends he had had.<br><br>I went online that night, log onto channel #ajcrr and yes!!... she is there.<br>Before I can get over the surprise and the daze, she sent me a message.....<br>"hey slorr.. so late liao haven't slept ahh??"<br>Now what? Now what??!!.. okok, I had to calm down 1st. I swallowed hard on my saliva, took a few deep breath. Now where is that Tye when I needed him most at such crucial moment, somebody to tell me what to say to her. How m I going to attract her with my pathetic humour which has gone stale. "slorr... me in a foul mood today.. can't sleep.. u leh??"<br>MOTHER'S(direct translation to chinese), what slorr slorr... now when I read it twice in a row, I m beginning to feel disgusted in that nick Tye gave me. Tye said that: "who knows.. it might attract some innocent gals in talking to u... haha.."<br>"I m not feeling very good too.... so lets sad together."<br>Finally squeezed a sentence out, but I can already feel droplets of sweat forming on my forehead. Actually I m not in a bad mood, I just wanna follow up her topic that's all. And if she ask for the reason for my feeling down, I can say: "since u r feeling down, how can I ever be happy?..." I know it sounds mushy, but Tye said:<br>"MUSHYNESS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL COURTSHIP".<br>And gals are a very weird species, they trust their ears far more than their eyes. So instead of doing 10 things to impress her, why not just say a sentence to move her.<br>"ok... but u haven't greet me leh..."<br>DAMNIT!.. how can I forget simple manners to gals. To think they call me 'MR COURTEOUS' in school. If this thing ever leaks out in school, I would lost all my female fans.<br>"nice to meet u... miss long-hair.."<br>I've been wishing that she's keeping long hair. Tye said that:<br>"FlyNDance... hmm.. she would either be long-haired or a desperado, 'COs when gals dance, only 2 parts of them may fly: hair and skirt. So if she doesn't has long hair, that means her skirt flys when she dances, AH-HA!!.. this has a certain sexual hint in it...haha.."<br>"eh?... how u know I got long hair?.."<br>BINGO!!.. heaven is on my side this time. It goes to prove that she is not a DESPERADO. yesh!!.. "not only that.. I also know u seldom wear skirt.."<br>I increased the stake, if I m correct this time, peace on earth forever.<br>"err... I guess u r rite lor.. but how u know one?.."<br>HAHAHAHAHA.... I m good ahh...<br>"just guess..."<br>"ok lor... hey slorr... tell u wat.. me tired liaoz... u coming online tomorrow morning??..."<br>"ya... y??.."<br>Please please please say the u coming too, if not I m going to kill myself for letting u go tonight.<br>"I'll see ya tomorrow at 10 am then...good night..."<br>"er.. should be today at 10 am.. ok.. good night too"<br>I just blurted out a last sentence....<br>Offline. Suddenly I was so impressed by my performance just now.<br>But is the season of spring really arriving for me??... I wish.<br>"slorr... what a coincidence ahh..."<br>yeh... I m not late.<br>"ya lor... so qiao.."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>gals are weird, I thought we already had an arrangement, y do I have to pretend that its not. they must have watched too many movies, and like to think that guys they met due to the thing called 'fate' is the best thing that can happen to their love life. "slorr.... u talking nonsense lah..." NONSENSE???.. ok, let me tell u what nonsense. Summer's beach, the guy must be good at running, with broad shoulders, dark complexion with a tint of redness, sparkling eyes and loud laughter. Then he will call out loud the name of the gal, running towards her, carry her and spin 3 rounds anticlockwisely. "slorr.... u siao liaoz ahh??"<br>I siao?.. ok.. lets change a location then. Deep in the mountains, the guy must have long hair, gotta have the look of an artist, carries a sketching stand, a few pieces of drawings, and u can see birds stop over at his side, admiring his work. and there will be a gal whose the model.... most problemably naked. "slorr.. but these all very romantic mah..."<br>ROMANTIC??.. hello miss... romance only survive in novels and movies. In real life, the guy on the beach may step onto broken glass or the gal may be too heavy which tore his arm muscles. Birds may just clear their waste on top of the guy in the mountains, or he might get a thrashing from the gal because he comments on the excess fats around the waist and hips.<br>"slorr... u hate romance??.."<br>I hate romance?... nope, I m just using my knowledge of statistic to get a deduction, that guys must be TALL to be romantic, not HANDSOME!!!.. some love novels even portrayed the guy as normal looking, but no-one dares to challenge the height of him!.. I object.... because I m not tall.<br>"slorr.... objection overruled..." I think I m really outstandingly bo liao, talking to her about these until noon. "slorr... are u hungry?..."<br>"ya... u leh??...."<br>"yesh... guess its time for lunch...slorr.." "then do u think we should....??"<br>"slorr... I m just asking... I dun intend to have lunch with u..."<br>ok, good.. I m not romantic... neither are u.<br>I had lunch with Tye, we talk about the conversation with FlyNDance this morning.<br>"U moron... told her u r not romantic... u siao ah?.." "u have disgrace me man... how can u make such a big mistake?....I...I..." Tye grabbed a chicken wing with chopstick, and I can see the trembling of the hand and the wing. "there are 3 'don'ts' in chasing a gal... one...dun forget to be romantic,.. two ... dun be too honest... 3... dun be too stingy on the sugar in our speech... noticed number 1, u stupid??"<br>what rubbish is that??....<br>"In mandarin we say 'nan ren bu huai, nu ren bu ai', u should know this..."<br>this I know, but it has been a controversial topic over centuries. "women aren't really that... cheap.. so y would they only falls for 'bad guys' like me??... that's because 'bad guys' are usually romantic... those 'nice guys' are usually... dumdums...so she would rather choose a romantic 'bad guy' rather than any of those dumdums... in maths we call this 2C1...understand?...dumdum.."<br>oh, Tye is talking about maths!!.. now I understand. No wonder I have always been left on the shelf. "in another words... gals wouldn't mind if u r not tall... if u r not handsome... they can bear with ur inconsiderate acts...can forget ur stupidity...but they can never forgive if u r not romantic..." come on, this is so exaggerating. "hey... most women have a 'knot' for romance.. just like most men have a 'knot' for virginity... to women they just can't understand how precious the thin layer of membrane is to men, same thing, men can't imagine how important women treats romance. this is bullshit! how come I've never heard of that. "the key word is 'knot'...if u can untie it... fine.. but how many had actually succeeded in that... practically none..." ok, fine. now I've done it... so what should I do to remedy the situation?<br>"face it... u r hopeless already... I promise u I'll have a drink with u when u and her are over..."<br>U SONOFABITCH.<br></div>
