Read some report comparing entrepreunrial behaviour between diff countries, a high 80-85% prefer security in their methods of income generation. Not many people can actually live without having the security of knowing when's the next paycheck and how much is it.<br><br>I guess you will be much more adaptable then most.<br><br>To take it further there are "Self-employed" as in people who own their business, and "commission earners" who are technically self employed too but dun own the business. Examples can be insurance advisors, brokers, car sales agents.<br><br>If you're a "self employed" in that sense, going into a new business may present newer better opportunites for yourself. However (with all due respect) if one is a commission earner and is thinking of jumping into another commission earner because he believed it is easier, the thinking is flaw. One will encounter the same obstacles again. Example a property agent going to be a insurance agent because he is not doing well in property, and believed he will not meet with the kind of rejections in insurance. I'm not saying all commission earners who jump from one industry to another are flaw, I am saying the reason for the jump must be qualify.</div>

I'm sure there is a 2nd-in-command whom you trust.<br><br>My 2 cents is you'll need to find a new driving force. I dun have the experience of doing up my own business. The nearest I'd been is a commission earner. But 1 thing I understand is one need to have a strong driving force at any one time. Since you are no longer motivated by winning your ex-boss, maybe u can motivate yourself by providing more for your family?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
