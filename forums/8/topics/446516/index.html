              In this time when our government are constantly fire-fighting on many fronts, are we as citizens too afraid to voice our concerns or demands. 
              
              Why when there are so many poor people in Singapore and yet the focus is always on minister's salaries?
              
              Why when the MRT still continuosly breaks down till today and yet we don't come together and demand change/improvements?
              
              Why when residents voice their concerns on safety at our HDB blocks,for example the need to change blown bulbs at void decks,car parks,roads,etc, the town councils do nothing?
              
              Are we becoming slaves to the machine? Shouldn't we have a mind of our own or are we too meek to stand together?

              <p>When we are discussing ministerial salaries, it doesn't mean we do not care about the less fortunate. We do. There are a group of passionate individuals like you and I who really care about this group of people.</p>
              <p>I am not sure which town council(TC) are you refering too. For mine Jurong TC, I find that their efficiency is excellent. I'm an active citizen of my country and neighbourhood. I remember there was once the lift had a power failure in the wee hour like now 3am+, and the siren was activated automatically. I called my town council and within 5minutes, they disabled the arlam. When the street light at the open space car park was not working, I called my TC and immediately they sent engineers to check on it. On one occassion, they even make it a point to call me back and ask if the lighting problems were resolved. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p>Wonder what will happen if Singaporeans follow the example of the Egyptian people who rose up against the incumbent government who was corrupt anyways. The problem is we won’t be able to rally enough people, i suspect most will be unwilling to start any revolution.</p>

              <p>Actually it's the younger generation mentality. Must change</p>
              <p>I tell you, nowadays it's very hard to find a young gen worker who dare to come up to me and say "this process need refinement, and here are my suggestions....". the younger gen only know how to follow rules by book and not creative at all.

              <p><br>Often, I can assure you, the young gen are opposite of what you have described...</p>
              <p>infact, in most cases, the older gens are the one sticking by the rules which have served and they have followed for sooo long...</p>
              <p>The young gen will say, cannot, then begin to impliment all sorts of extras just becoz they are eager to prove themselves (as are all young gens). Often u get alot of junks...</p>
              <p>Just take a look at scholars... Sometimes, simple solution works best, no need so fancy fancy stuff to hao lian...</p>
