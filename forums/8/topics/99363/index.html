            <div class='col-md body'>it seems kinda strange that info of this nature would be disclosed to the media. this only alerts Osama to their movement.<br><br>could well be Bush administration leaking the news out to generate impression that they've not let up on tracking down Osama.<br><br>Many months back, when they had him cornered in Afghanistan, Bush pulled troops back and diverted resources to the invasion of Iraq. They could well have caught him then, but just din go all way.<br><br>Now that the Iraq situation is a mess, Osama is brought back into the picture again......<br><br>Also dunno how true that Bush family has business ties with the Bin Laden clan.

I was said that the ransom money was ready and the hostage takers were willing but the american politicians were not because it was 1 year earlier than the elections which was round the corner, eventually they released after Bush Sr won I think to make it look like the old government was ineffective. Hence the term October Surprise was coined.<br><br>I won't be surprised they already have Bin Laden in the bag they just have him on a rope now, once either candidate wins the noose tightens.<br><br>I won't be surprised</div>
