            <div class='col-md body'>siao.<br><br>Nobody here says anything about it dying, but the expectation of the society on B2C Ecommerce is damn overbloated. Are you that stupid to assume that if I think that most B2C Ecommerce companies will close down or sell at cheap price, means that B2C Ecommerce will die off? Come on, you are more intelligent than that, right?<br><br>None of the Ecommerce companies are now making money. If you think you are the knowledgeable one, think crappingly carefully.<br><br>B2C Ecommerce will ONLY take off when WAP takes off. There is nearly no question about that. When WAP takes off, truly B2C Ecommerce will become viable. That is not going to happen in the next 2-3 years time, probably longer.<br><br>But B2B Ecommerce, HELL it is going to take off.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WAP's having major problems currently.<br><br>Lack of support from mobile phone makers is one. Whatever's available now is terribly buggy... there's something like 10? models out there now?<br><br>Service provider. Think we have read the problems with local service providers in the papers?<br><br>Some felt that WAP will integrate seamlessly with Bluetooth, providing more sensible services. (I have seen some pretty silly WAP services. Example : WAP auction) But then, signals from bluetooth is interferring with the other radio signals shooting around .. I think this applies to some foreign countries who forbids bluetooth due to this.<br><br>So, opinion is .. whoever picks up the WAP technology and tries to make something out of it now will be known as 'early adopters' It means that everyone will learn from their mistakes as WAP matures. (or die off) In another words, whoever does WAP now is either very rich, or a sucker.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While these problems are being ironed out, most of us , the consumers will want to shun the services, the phone and the technology till we are convinced that it works.<br><br>If I am a developer, I will choose to wait and see first. Let Nokia, Erricson etc. iron out the problems first... its the crucial moment now, whatever research that goes in could either make or break the technology. I choose to err on the side of caution.<br><br>Though they are totally 2 different matters altogether, I can relate the current state of dotcoms and WAP. After the shakedown during the last 6 mths, we have more or less gotten a rough picture of how an internet-related company should be run. Everyone trying to catch that bandwagon. Those who got in and out quick made a quick buck. Most didn't, and they are now part of the hugh shakedown. My ex-company closed. Sad.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>The pros of being an early adopter is that if the technology is a successful one, you will have gain a large portion of the market share once the smaller boys comes into the picture. The cons are, if it don't, the losses can be enormous. If you are merely a startup, living on fundings, then you need to wind up.</div>
