But the worst thing is that they're not as ready as I am to be totally open about expectations and what they want done - most times I have to guess and double guess if this is what will make them happy/ or if this is the Proper way to do things.  Then when I ask for clarifications they go - didn't you know that this is how it's supposed to be?? And I'm like DUH.<br><br>Aiya I just need a handbook.
