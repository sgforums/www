As we rushed down to the cinema and happily grabbed our popcorn and drinks, we entered the cinema waiting for the show.<br><br>After around 10-15mins of COMMERCIALS, the show started and it was showing Bridget Jone's Diary , instead of Blade Trinity.  After another 15-20 mins', the duty manager, Mr Glen was out there to address all of us.  He apologised to us for the mistake but he also reiterated there was nothing he could do.  He offered to sign on our tickets for us to catch the show on another day  or wait until the 4.30am show. I am busy person . December is a busy month for me and I only managed to schedule a time to watch the show with my girlfriend.<br><br>I asked for a refund because I was not able to meet the deadline of the ticket and I was upset about the service provided. Cathay Cineleisure has wasted my time , money (such as travel fare) , food and drinks.  As a matter of principle , I only want to be compensated for the amount of my tickets . I was refused compensation by the duty manager.<br><br>Personally, I've had such experiences with Golden Village when they had to delay their show for 20-30 mins' time. Even then, we were given an option of a refund or staying for the show.<br><br>The whole incident have been spoiled in such an experience and spoilt the good reputation of Cathay Cineleisure. I never expected such a negative treatment in a reputable cinema.<br><br>I am very disappointed with the treatment I got at Orchard Cineleisure.<br><br>Regards<br><br>An angry patron<br>[/b]</blockquote>A second draft I did for fun. hehhehe but make sure you check the back of your ticket that says they have a right to postpone a time for the show or any conditions stipulated in the terms of conditions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think if you were in thier shoes, you would think why a refund would be more ley chey.

But that certainly don't give them ANY EXCUSE to just IGNORE what they've FAILED to DELIVER DESPITE having ALREADY TAKEN the $ of the consumers?<br><br>Talk about 'ley chey'? What about WASTING SO MANY PEOPLE's time? Just a 'sorry'? We're not even talking about COMPENSATION yet...<br><br>How about people purposely going down to the cinema just to end up with an EMPTY TRIP?? Isn't that LEY CHEY...?<br><br>People who went down by midnight cab fare? Not LEY CHEY? We're even talking about ADDITIONAL COST at NOTHING here.. You think people would just travel around at night in cabs for 'sight-seeing'..??<br><br>The popcorns and drinks they bought at the cinema at higher price so that they could be BROUGHT IN... NO?<br><br>The TIME they've WASTED just to WATCH the STUPID COMMERCIALS... 10-15 mins... Then watch on another day... Another 10-15 mins... So watching around 30 mins of COMMERCIALS... Not LEY CHEY..??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They r certainly in the wrong ! Go and write to the newspaper on it and demand them to pay for the popcorn and drinks too ! Send the same letter to CASE and to their management simultaneously while u r at it ! Certainly they marked up the price of these snacks and forbid other form of food in just because they r the one showing the show. Their no refund policy doesn't work here since it is their wrongdoing in showing a different show ! They might as well put in an Indian show to cheat your ticket money while they r at it ! They should in fact offer some compensation for wasting your time as well ! If they keep insisting their unfair contract, then we might as well boycott cathay cinemas ! They r not the only cinemas in singapore. Who knows next time u r watching The Incredible with your kids and they give u an RA show instead !<br><br>BTW I am a friend of eng wah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
