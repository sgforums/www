            <div class='col-md body'>Extracted from ST Forum, 20 June 2006<br><br>MY FAMILY and I had a bad experience while holidaying in A'Famosa, Malacca.<br>I had walked to the carpark to collect my car and my mother, sister and children were waiting at the resort's lobby porch when a car sped along the porch and nearly hit two of the children, aged seven and 10. My son, 16, and mother, 63, gestured at the driver to indicate that he should not be speeding.<br><br>The driver jammed the brakes, got out of the car and shoved my mother, causing her to lose her balance but luckily my son managed to stop her from falling.<br><br>The driver called my mother uncivilised and said that while in Malaysia Singaporeans must also respect the royal family, to which he claimed to belong.<br><br>Hotel employees came on the scene and advised my mother to apologise but she refused as we had not done anything wrong.<br><br>When my mother told the driver that he should drive slowly when there were many people around, he threatened to have her arrested for being rude to a member of the royal family.<br><br>The valet who witnessed the incident kept insisting that my mother apologise. When she refused, a few members of the hotel staff apologised on our behalf.<br><br>The driver then walked off, shouting explicit words in Malay at my mother and son.<br><br>When I learnt about the incident, I asked the hotel staff why they apologised on our behalf.<br><br>They said that we should never mess with the royal family and we should quickly leave the place.<br><br>Taufik Abdullah<br><br></div>

My son, 16, and mother, 63, gestured at the driver to indicate that he should not be speeding.<br><br>The driver jammed the brakes, got out of the car and shoved my mother, causing her to lose her balance but luckily my son managed to stop her from falling.<br><br>The driver called my mother uncivilised and said that while in Malaysia Singaporeans must also respect the royal family, to which he claimed to belong.<br><br>Hotel employees came on the scene and advised my mother to apologise but she refused as we had not done anything wrong.<br><br>When my mother told the driver that he should drive slowly when there were many people around, he threatened to have her arrested for being rude to a member of the royal family.<br><br>The valet who witnessed the incident kept insisting that my mother apologise. When she refused, a few members of the hotel staff apologised on our behalf.<br><br>The driver then walked off, shouting explicit words in Malay at my mother and son.<br><br>When I learnt about the incident, I asked the hotel staff why they apologised on our behalf.<br><br>They said that we should never mess with the royal family and we should quickly leave the place.<br><br>Taufik Abdullah<br><br></div></blockquote>didn't you know that MALAYSIA is a place for malays????or rather the bumiputras or whatever they call them???? i told many people not to visit that sort of place.........cars scratched.......robbery.........nobody want to heed my warning.....please continue...........<br><br>clearly if i were you....i would have left the place immediately.......having to meet such things again......its is called malay supremacist there similar to australia where they call such things white supremacist.......you had only a small taste of it.........<br><br>they don't call malaysia for being only to malays only.......never heard of how racist things are there??? well this is your first time to experience racism huh.........</div>
