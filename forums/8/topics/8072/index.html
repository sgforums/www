            <div class='col-md body'>As a result of what I do for a living. Learning basic legal stuff is almost compulsory for me.<br><br>And if you people think that tet does not have an handle over that hero who posted lexelle's pictures, think again.<br><br>1) Lexelle's pictures copyright belongs to lexelle (should be, unless there are other complications), and Lexelle can sue for infringement of copyright.<br><br>2) It has been processed again by Tet, again, processing of original works, to be best of my understanding, belongs to Tet. So Tet can probably sue you as well.<br><br>3) And when someone sues you, the court of law will demand a system log from sgforums.com. But save the court some trouble, because I can access the log myself, and from the IP. Your ISP will be forced to give your login information, and your identity will be clear for the court of law to move action against you.<br><br>So before a lawyer's letter arrives in your mailbox, I suggest you remove that picture from your website, and maybe Tet will decide not to sue you.</div>

Couldn't it be lex or tet pass / email to someone else ?<br>Does it mean that when your name appear on the pic means that you possess the ownership ?<br><br>From my observations...<br>lex, personally I think that postings did not degrade your image.  In fact, the poster and many others find it cool and beautifully done. It's only ppl like "carrot" tried to link you to that pornstar Anabelle Chong...and others insisting this is sabotage. Wakeup, lex..if Zeta's intention is to sabotage you..then why on earth she uses 2 beautifully created pics and compliment on them ? I think this forum is over react over this issue.<br><br>Don't know if you have read the full thread before it was remove by your linux friend, If not, ask him to email you a copy and look closely and you can see who your "true" friends are ...Tet is one and Rev is another for these 2 really stand up for you and speak on your behalf (though I think they over react)....and the rest..sorry to be being rude... are all buayas or simply keep quiet sit back and "enjoy" the show and "sayang" you in the evening.<br><br>Ppl who relate you to pornstar and later try to show his concern...  ai yoh yoh....I think create the most damage and most disgusting, remind me of "crocodile tear".<br><br>You are smart in staying low profile and get help from administrator.... If every of your friend take it as cool as you.. then there won't be as many as 60 posting within hours ! and probably the thread will dies by itself after 105 or so posting<br><br>However..as DevilRay has mention, www is an endless pit and you never know how many of your so call "friends" or buayas already downloaded these pic.... Not to frighten you but it's bare fact...one of them might post the pic up again and again...ot here but at any other sites and I don't think that linux friend of your had the power to go around everywhere removing posting of pic....<br><br>Take it easy lex...and again I think you look really cool and had that kind of innocent look .... no wonder there's so many buayas around you. But put on guard when mixing around...as you never know..any of them might actually be Zeta. This is internet is all about.<br></div>

You know who you are. Kindly remove them. Thank you.<br><br></div></blockquote>Prove of negative is one thing..but you know how long you had upload these pics on the internet ? and the mistake you make here is that by putting up the pics on the internet, you are open up for the whole wolrd to see and you really can't track where these pic will end up at. So..stop pointing firgers at others, you yourself is to blame.<br><br>Regarding the removal of pic at other sites....I am sorry I don't think I had that authority and power to do that. Why don't you ask that linux friend of yours, may be he can help.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know what? I think you guys should meet up. Everyone who is involved in this mess should meet to clear up all and any misunderstandings. There's no use shooting each other in the fourms, it'll go on and on, with no end in sight. Just a simple meeting to talk things out, no need for shouting or threats of suing. Just talk. Agreed?</div>

Why just pin point at me ?<br><br>The truth is..if there aren't no so many boliao ppl..Ka Poh ppl..busybody..and some  who think they can "sue" someone and some who pretend to talk like legal expert  .........there won't be so many response and new topics regarding this..One good example is Ngkaihoe who started 2 related threads on these, don't know what his true intension is..? to help ? or to FLAME...but judging from the response, it's more like Flaming !<br><br>The main ppl concern here Zeta, Tet, Rev and myself and some others (I leave lex out because she didn't post any from start till now) alredi "sort of" agreed to stop posting to let the flame dies down by itself.. Any other posting after this will automatically classified into the 100% KaPoh category.<br><br>That's all I have to say.<br><br></div>

Go back to your IT field and stop behaving like a lawyer here. Otherwise, instead of helping lex, it is FLAMIMNG coz it'll turn out to be a provocation and challenge to re-post the pic here. Then lex gonna cry (or laugh and joy for the extra exposure it created here. Nobody knows, afterall, lex herself never comment on this.. and perhaps..it could be lex herself posting these pic up to boost up her popularity......) So..which side are you at ?<br><br>Everybody knows you do not have the "power" to remove the postings at Geocities, otherwise it would have been "blocked" long time ago.<br><br>Good Gal Tet, at least you are tame now. I am beginning to see the beauty side of you.<br><br>and Hugo, step aside, let me take it from here.<br><br>and all other "concerned" buayas, alligators and liz, get ready, your darling perhaps gonna upset again (or may up jump up and down and celebrate but pretend to be sad, and you never know)<br></div>
