I once trotted upstairs to see what sort of neighbours I have and the occupants were an elderly woman, her weak elderly husband and their domestic help. It is unlikely they played with marbles, and certainly not in the wee hours of the morning.<br><br>From conversations with friends, I was astounded to learn that this sound of dropping marbles is a widespread phenomenon in Singapore. It seems it happens only in HDB flats.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>This topic had been discussed sinceÂ…. God knows whenÂ… IÂ’m too lazy to read what was discussed before but IÂ’m going to tell you the cause of the marble dropping sound. For those who fancy a supernatural answer, sorry itÂ’s not.<br><br>Before I explain, did you realize this marble dropping sound happens only in highrise buildings? Did you also realize that the sound seem to come from the units above yours? Did you realize the sound is clearer at night although it also happens in the day? Did you realize it happens usually to old blocks and not new buildings? Did you realize that the marble dropping sound is always from a single marble and not multiple marbles dropping simultaneously? Did you realize that even though you are staying at the top floor of the block, you could also hear the marble sound coming from the rooftop? This is how it happens.<br><br>Our water tanks are all located at the top of buildings. The water pumps in the pump house (at the ground level) will pump water to the storage tanks at the top of the building. Pipelines are connected to distribute water to all the households of the block from top down. They flow through gravitational flow. The pipes are vertical except the branch lines. When someone turned on the tap at the lower level, the entire water in the pipeline above will flow downwards and because of the gravitation pull, there will be acceleration. Therefore, the longer the tap is turned on, the higher the acceleration.<br><br>When the tap is tuned off, there is a sudden stop to the flow of water in the pipeline. Due to the downward acceleration in the pipeline, there is a sudden pull within the pipeline at the top portion of the pipes. This will result in negative pressure (a surge) in the upper part of the pipeline. Knocking sounds are generated and could be heard from the pipelines. The technical term is called a water hammer.  The knocking sounds come in a simple harmonic manner. An example of simple harmonic manner is the sound of a marble dropping from a certain height and bounce to a complete stop (simple harmonic). We all know sound travels further in solid than air. The sound therefore traveled through the pipes and concrete and is always coming from the upper units. That is why you keep hearing marble dropping sound. It really is the water pipes.<br><br>This is a technical problem. All the developer has to do is to install a surge valve at the outlets of all the water tanks and this will absorb the pulling effect within the pipelines when there is a surge. Thus no knocking sound will be generated. That is why new buildings today do not have this problem except old blocks.<br><br>Those who thought the ghost had followed you from Lor Ah Soo to Punggol 21, those who was smoked to believe that contractor buried marbles while constructing the buildings or to please the child ghost are all bull sh*tÂ…. So, tonight you can sleep tight and not to worry about the marble dropping sound. ItÂ’s perhaps someone flushing the toilet bowl.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>
