Actually frankly speaking I still miss my ship Eagle Centaurus quiet a lot, maybe it was my second time onboard, maybe it is because I am having the luxury of TV and Fridge. I never like to bit farewell, because it will only make the heart ache even more. Since it is already a certainty which you could not change, why not leave quietly and avoid more hurt to other people? The other reason might be because I am still able to access email and SMS onboard ship this time. I did spend the last few hours of my time in the Engine Room, so much work we have done on it, I will really hate it if other people mess it up after that.<br><br>Pradeep, Raphael and me arrived at the so call Hotel early in the morning at around 0400 hrs, frankly speaking it is the worst I had ever stay, even the one I use to stay at Shanghai during my backpacking trip is much better. No TV, no Phone and so small and miserable, the hotel in Hong Kong seem spacious compare to this. Pradeep and me were surprise that there is Internet access, but we regret greatly after that. It was very slow; can you imagine Pentium PC running Windows XP? Only manage to access one email after one long hour, and it is from my Guangzhou GF saying how good I am and I will manage to find someone better than her in future. Even my favorite Hardware zone website is block by Net Granny. I am very disappointed and all Raphael can think of is finding some food at this god forsaken early morning.<br><br>Pradeep and Raphael decided to go to bed, I try to sleep but the bed was kind of too soft for me. There I was taking a slow walk in Tilbury Town early in the morning at 0500 hrs. My China friend Dong told me that he is flying over to Singapore to join ship, but I never did receive any call from him until now. I manage to came across a beautiful flowerbed and took a shot of it, a very cute pussycat stare at me as if he knew I was a foreigner from a faraway land.<br><br>I went back to the Hotel two hours later to wake Pradeep and Raphael up for Breakfast, surprised to find Pradeep awake and using the IRC chat. Raphael was sleep like a pig, or should I say dead log? Breakfast was an activity he participates once in a blue moon, no wonder he is so thin that a lot of people thought he was a drug addict.<br><br>Breakfast was one of the worst experiences in my entire life, how tasty can microwave bacon be? Pradeep was very eager to go London, Raphael wanted to stay back and sleep, I manage to convince him to think about microwave lunch.<br><br>We really donÂ’t know much about this place; all we can depend on is the London Map in my Pocket PC and the Casio Sea pathfinder which had wander with me for many years. Weather was nice during summer time in England, it is like you are walking in a land where there are air-conditioning everywhere. We took a slow walk toward a train station nearby, due to the Army training I receive during my NS my concept of walking distance is too much difference from them.<br><br>It cost us Ten Pound to get a day ticket, the ability to let us travel in any kind of public transport for the whole day is our key to achieve our ambition. Being a Gentleman for a day, walking in style in the street of London. Raphael always says that he is a very refine gentleman himself, I was surprise that there are men who go salon to trim their nails. I am also quiet a gentleman myself, only I am the so call rugged type of guy. How refine can a gentleman be if he always smoke, drink, gamble and swear? Rather be rugged then refine while we walk in the street of London in style. I have been very busy fixing computers since the day I arrived Singapore, havenÂ’t got the time to get a haircut or a shave. When I look into the mirror tonight just after my shower, I have a feeling that I am truly look like an uncle now. The Karma Sutra book doesnÂ’t come cheap for my cousin wedding gift, so better work harder and get me a nephew soon enough.<br><br>After an hour and a half we finally arrived in London, Big Ben is the first thing that greets us with the bell. We actually wanted to take a ride on the London Eye, but Eleven Pound is too expensive compare to the day pass we got from Tilbury Town. Cute Japanese Girls seem to float the street; only regret is that I never try to learn their language.<br><br>Next stop as suggested by Raphael is to head for Buckingham Palace, for the Royal Guards Changing Ceremony is one of the famous tourist attractions. A very gorgeous Greek Goddess was standing beside me; so donÂ’t blame me if the Ceremony Photos does turn up well. Raphael say the one-hour wait was not worth it, it had started raining just as the Ceremony come to an end. I was telling Raphael this was going to happen the moment we reach there, what good will it be if my Sea pathfinder could not tell me weather.<br><br>Pradeep wanted so much to see the London Bridge, but I always had something against the Fat Lady. Since we have come all the way here we might as well go all the way, London Bridge and Fat Lady here we come again. We didnÂ’t realize that it is actually call the Tower Bridge until we reach there, the T-shirt I brought for my friends had prove it right again. Saw a few pretty oriental girls along the way, but I am not in the mood to be a gentleman for them today.<br><br>Lunch by the river was one of the best I ever had, Raphael had Beef Steak while I chew on my juicy Pork Chop. That was the Grand Finale and we had to head back for a shower, I even forgot to visit the Hard Rack CafÃ© which I always do when I visit different countries. Raphael was complaining about no soap in the bathroom, how refine can a man be if he donÂ’t even had a toiletries bag in his hand luggage?<br><br>We reach the airport and was ready to fly, Pradeep was stuck for an hour because of his excess baggage. Raphael want to have dinner at TGIF, Thank God ItÂ’s Friday and we are going back home. Pineapple Sunshine and Buffalo wings, we spend our last pound on the last meal we had in London.<br><br>Blue Water,<br>Alex Chase.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
