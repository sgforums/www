            <div class='col-md body'>I walked into my favourite snack bar in suntec, and sat down near to the counter as all the seats were taken.. it was lunch time and I count my lucky stars beneath my breath..I picked up a menu and began to look at the various items trying to decide if I wanted to order breakfast as I did not have anything the whole morning or just go ahead and eat lunch..<br><br>"Excuse me," came a soft whisper, as she touched me on the shoulder..<br><br>I looked up and turned to the side to see a rather nice looking woman standing before me..<br><br>"Is your name Caramon by any chance?" she asked me..<br><br>"Yes." I responded, looking rather confused as I had never seen the woman before..<br><br>"My name is Felicia and my husband is Tony," she said, pointing to a distant table near the door leading into the bathrooms.. I looked in the direction that she was pointing but I did not recognize the man who was sitting, alone at the table..<br><br>"I'm sorry... I'm, ah, I'm ah, confused... I don't think that I know you guys.. But my name is Caramon.." I remind her..<br><br>"Tony Tang.. Tony from Hill-view sec school?" she asked me..<br><br>"I'm really sorry.. The name doesn't ring a bell." I said..<br><br>I finally decided to order my lunch and a cup of hot coffee.. I sat there continually racking my brain trying to remember who this Tony guy was..<br><br>"I must have know him," I thought to myself.. "He recognizes me for some reason." I picked my coffee up and took a sip.. All of a sudden it came to me like a flash of lighting.. Tony that son-of-the-b1tch.. I mumbled, as I swung myself around on my stool and faced in his direction..<br><br>How many times that sorry guy had made fun of my big ears in front of the girls in my class? How many times this sorry son-of-a-b1tch had laughed at me because I am soft-spoken labeling me a sissy? How many times this big bully slammed me up against the walls just to make himself look like a big man to all the other students? He was such a terror that nobody likes him..<br><br>He raised his hand and waved at me.. I smiled, returned the wave and turned back around and began to eat my breakfast..<br><br>"God. He's so thin now.. Not the big burley guy that I remember back in 1992," I thought to myself.. All of a sudden I heard the sound of dishes breaking so I spun around to see what had happened.. Tony had accidentally hit several plates knocking them off the table as he was trying to get into his wheelchair which had been parked in the bathroom hallway while they were eating..<br><br>As Tony rolled towards me, being pushed by his wife, I looked up and smiled..<br><br>"Caramon" he said, as he nodded his head forward..<br><br>"You remember. Don't you?" he said, looking directly into my eyes..<br><br>"I remember, Tony," I said..<br><br>"I guess you're thinking 'What goes around comes around'," he said, softly as the tears well up..<br><br>"I would never think like that, Tony," I said, with a stern look on my face.. we are still friend..<br><br>I reached in my pocket and pulled out one of my cards that had my home telephone number written on it and I handed it to him..<br><br>"Give me a call sometimes.. We'll have lunch," I told him..<br><br>I watched as they went out of the door and slowly made their way outside..  I sincerely hope he calls me sometime, as he will always be my friend that I have from my sec school days regardless of what he did in the past..<br><br></div>

He's so thin now.. Not the big burley guy that I remember back in 1992," I thought to myself.. All of a sudden I heard the sound of dishes breaking so I spun around to see what had happened.. Tony had accidentally hit several plates knocking them off the table as he was trying to get into his wheelchair which had been parked in the bathroom hallway while they were eating..<br><br>As Tony rolled towards me, being pushed by his wife, I looked up and smiled..<br><br>"Caramon" he said, as he nodded his head forward..<br><br>"You remember. Don't you?" he said, looking directly into my eyes..<br><br>"I remember, Tony," I said..<br><br>"I guess you're thinking 'What goes around comes around'," he said, softly as the tears well up..<br><br>"I would never think like that, Tony," I said, with a stern look on my face.. we are still friend..<br><br>I reached in my pocket and pulled out one of my cards that had my home telephone number written on it and I handed it to him..<br><br>"Give me a call sometimes.. We'll have lunch," I told him..<br><br>I watched as they went out of the door and slowly made their way outside..  I sincerely hope he calls me sometime, as he will always be my friend that I have from my sec school days regardless of what he did in the past..<br><br></div></blockquote>I used my amazing speed reading skills to read your story in 2 seconds (hey, if the.raven bothers to read your Shit, you can strike lottery) and I think your story is totally very very boring.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Caramon spends a lot of time daydreaming. In lala-land all the people who beat him up, dumped him, humiliated him etc get punished one way or another. Quite likely the very opposite is true in reality.  He spams sgforums and stalks certain forummers as a way to release that pent up frustration. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
