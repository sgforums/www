Firstly, the girl might not be interested to know the achievement history of a guy she just got to know. 2ndly, He spoke with his ego being too high and normally not appealing to most girl esp those feminist.<br><br>Advice is just to act naturally, talk normally from his own sincere heart to get to know the girl instead of wanting to let the girl know more about himself. The only correct thing that he did might be bringing her to exquisite and expensive places to dine...that proved his sincerity, his wealth and his generosity provided the expensive place is romantic enuff set the correct environment.<br></div>

Personally knows of GUYS who use such tactics OR VARIATIONs of it.... At 1st was quite SICK of it ESPECIALLY when the GUYS managed to HOOK babes up with their BULLSHITs.... But THEN AGAIN... What the heck? Sometimes I do give my 'sound advice' to the ladies... It's really still up to them to take it as it's REALLY their OWN LIVES... &lt;- And you would get girls who would LOOK AT YOU and SAY... "You're just PLAIN JEALOUS..." OH MY GOD....  :p<br><br>I think you can FORGET about POTENTIAL FUTURE relationships for MOST of the GUYs who USE this TACTIC... 1st of all, they're NOT SINCERE (At least I think so?)... And from what I know guys who use such tactics are USUALLY for SHORT-TERM relationship OR to WIN the MAID and NOT win her heart.... Just like a businessman or a hunter applying certain strategy.... What I believe is a BIG MISTAKE for LOVE (in their case, they're just looking for a RELATIONSHIP probably..?)....<br><br>CONCLUSION: These are the 'hunters' of the NEW MILLENIUM PACKAGED with CERTAIN MARKETING STRATEGY in order to 'sell themselves' to their TARGETs.... They're out to WIN a RELATIONSHIP... NOT a HEART.... DEFINITELY a 'no no' for people who's really out for a REAL LOVE RELATIONSHIP....<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT.
