              <p><br>Who says so ??</p>
              <p>The Swiss standard of living was achieved by some Singaporeans in April 2007...  a few months AFTER the last General Elections... by the MIW Government Ministers.</p>
              <p>They got to start with themselves first mah.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/world/asia/09iht-sing.3.5200498.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/world/asia/09iht-sing.3.5200498.html</a> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.yeocheowtong.com/Salaries.html">http://www.yeocheowtong.com/Salaries.html</a> </p>
              <p>As for the common people, gotta be patient... must wait a little longer .</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some excerpts here of an article by Mr Leong Sze Hian on MOM's latest report on  the labour / wage situation in Singapore :</span></p>
              <p><strong>"The median income for all employed residents dipped by 1.2 per cent from $2,450 in 2008 to $2,420 in 2009."</strong></p>
              <p>You got to take one step backward to go two steps forward, mah.  Everybody knows this.  Surely, not PAP's fault.   </p>
              <p><strong>"Part-timers also posted higher median income of $620 compared with $600 a year ago.   Part-timers’ median income in 1999 was $600. So, the increase for the last 10 years was only $20, or an annual increase of only 0.3 per cent, without adjusting for inflation. And it is important to consider that a possible reason for the $20 increase may be that a part-timer is now defined as one working 35 hours or less, instead of 30 hours"</strong></p>
              <p>See, for part timers they got an increase of S$ 20.00 in 10 years.   It's better than nothing, right ??   Thanks to the PAP for this increase.</p>
              <p><strong>"the report states that in June 2009, 26 per cent of unemployed professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) had been looking for work for at least 25 weeks.  It also noted that this figure was higher than the 23 per cent figure for workers in production and related sectors, and 20 per cent for clerical, sales and service workers."</strong></p>
              <p>What to do ?? World economy in tailspin caused by those bastards Americans, so cannot blame the PAP.  </p>
              <p><strong>"In the 40-and-above age group, the proportion of unemployed PMETs who had been jobhunting for at least 25 weeks was even higher – at 36 per cent. This is well above that of clerical, sales and service workers (27 per cent), and production and related (24 per cent) workers."</strong></p>
              <p>Who to blame ?? Those experienced PMETs are just plain fussy when job hunting.  Definitely not PAP's fault...</p>
              <p><strong>"The report also noted that the unemployment rate for cleaners, labourers and related workers was the highest across all sectors in June 2009 at 8.3 per cent, followed by service and sales workers at 7.9 per cent, and clerical workers at 7.4 per cent. All these rates were described in the report as “significantly above average.  </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Could this be due to competition from foreign workers in these lower-skilled, lower-paid jobs?"</strong></p>
              <p>Singaporeans don't want to do these types of jobs anyway... so nobody's fault here. </p>
              <p><strong> "There has been an increase in the number of “residents outside the labour force who were not looking for work because they believed their job search would be in vain.”</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The number of these “discouraged workers” has reached 11,000 in June 2009, up from 7,500 a year ago. They now form 0.6 per cent of the resident labour force inclusive of discouraged workers, rising from 0.4 per cent last year."</strong></p>
              <p>Hey, cannot blame the PAP.  There people are just plain lazy or the no-hopers.</p>
              <p><strong>"A cleaner who used to be paid about $800 a few years ago, is now typically paid about $650."</strong></p>
              <p>Don't worry to much here as they are mostly FWs.  Also, you must understand that if Employers want to manipulate the workers secretly, there is not much the PAP can do about it.</p>
              <p><strong>"Linking ministers’ pay to GDP growth may also have contributed to the importing of low-skilled foreign labour to grow the economy.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The latest call to be “cheaper, faster and better” may be the last straw that breaks the proverbial camel’s back of Singaporean workers.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>As if declining wages, wage cuts, shorter work weeks, compulsory leave, lower or zero bonus, weren’t bad enough, resident unemployment was 5.9 per cent in June, on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, with 116,300 unemployed residents.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The unemployment rate for Singaporeans may be worse, as PRs who cannot find employment may leave the country, whilst most unemployed Singaporeans may not have this option.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Why is there no breakdown of the unemployment rate for citizens and PRs?"</strong></p>
              <p>What does the writer know ?? The PAP Ministers are the highest paid Ministers in the world, so they are the Best of the Best.  Can he make the same claim ?? </p>
              <p><strong>"Despite all the above, we are giving out visas for foreigners to come to Singapore to seek employment, whereas most countries would require a foreigner to get a job before he or she can be issued a visa."</strong></p>
              <p>SIngaporeans cannot be selfish and must support  the PAP's 'open legs wide wide and bend forward' policy on FWs / FTs / PRs as it is good for the country.  We have one of the highest GDP in the world and all Singaporeans should be proud of this achievement...</p>
              <p>With high GDP... the Swiss standard of living will come - as promised by the PAP Government.</p>
