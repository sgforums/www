            <div class='col-md body'>The statement Â“morals cannot be taughtÂ” suggests an intrinsic knowledge in every person of the rights and wrongs of society. It is based on the idea of an instinctive leaning in everyone toward either good or bad, and a complete absence of any change as a result of external influence.<br><br>Morals exist as a definition of society. Society has dictated the correctness, the desirability of honesty, integrity Â– good behaviour. It is, thus, difficult to imagine societal conventions as instinctive. The concept of right and wrong is a matter of learning, an acquisition of knowledge. Thus, morals can be taught, and have to be, to a child.<br><br>The behaviour of oneÂ’s parents, or any person of guiding influence, dictates the behaviour of oneself. A dishonest person, who thinks nothing of keeping for himself property lost by others, breeds children with the same pattern of thought, simply because the child would receive no message that such an act is wrong. Other examples abound, of similar evidence: an overwhelming 92% of pre-school age children surveyed in London last year displayed patterns of thought almost exactly similar to that of their parents.<br><br>The traditions of oneÂ’s culture also dictate oneÂ’s morals. For example, bigamy is frowned upon by many societies, for being morally reprehensible and violating the rights of women. However, other societies permit this, for example, Muslim men can have up to four wives, and harems were common among Eastern kings in history. Clearly, the established Â“moralsÂ” of monogamy are not instinctive: Muslim men who practice polygamy certainly are not repulsed by the idea of their many wives; polygamous men brought up to believe in monogamy will suffer feelings of guilt at having done wrong.<br><br>That morals are taught can be examined in a more interesting fashion, by observing people brought up outside the human community. In the early 1970s, an Indian researcher rescued a girl of eight, who had been brought up by a pack of wolves. While she cowered in his presence, she once leapt at a sleeping baby and snapped at its neck. She was clearly displaying wolf-like behaviour, of healthy respect for bigger animals, but ruthless killing of weaker ones for food. The killing of a baby is seen as being wrong only by people taught that it is wrong.<br><br>Indeed, if morals cannot be taught, then what of the numerous campaigns launched by the government? These work by reiterating values as correct, so constantly and repetitively they become accepted as morals. Again, these exist as a reinforcement to those established by society.<br><br>Perhaps certain mentally limited individuals cannot be taught morals; certainly insanity is a valid plea in courts of law, admitting that such criminals are incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong. However, in the majority of the population, morals can be taught. Indeed, morals exist only because they are taught Â– by the family, by religious texts, by society. Morals are established by the society, for we decide what to believe is right or wrong, and have to teach our young accordingly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
