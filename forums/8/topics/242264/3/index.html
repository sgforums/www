They have law schools, business schools, engineering schools, school of arts and sciences. They are complete, full universities. SMU is a specialised university. There is no comparison - quality wise or otherwise.<br><br>Frankly, I think SMU is doing well. But the extent to which it is being lauded and praised is ridiculous. Don't accept the hype and whatever they say - it's their role to market the school; it's your role to be discerning enough.<br><br>SMU has an 12% admission rate?! It's not just about the admission rate, it's about the calibre of students that apply. If every Tom, Dick and Harry applies, of course the admission rate will be low. The best indicator of quality is how self-selective the pool of applicants is. Do you see anyone with less than 3As at A Levels being deluded enough to apply to NUS medicine?</div>
