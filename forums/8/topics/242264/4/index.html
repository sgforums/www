It's just your personal point of view...<br><br>Anyway, I may have the answer to your question... Some other forumers have already pointed it out actually...

Therefore, following your logic, no one wants to apply and therefore there is a high admission rate and it is a lousy school. But that's not accurate. People who apply to Caltech either attended RSI, have an International Olympiad medal or have done very good research work in high school. (If you have never heard of Caltech, it's no wonder you can actually compare SMU's admission rate to that of Harvard's).<br><br>I don't want to comment further about the SMU admission rate and so on. All I can say is that we should really see SMU for what it is. Good school? Maybe. Brilliant, excellent, best in business, graduates so sought after by all the BIG and top investment banking firms in the world? Not so certain.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jeremymjr:</div><div class="quote_body">Harvard is a research university; Yale is a research university. They have law schools, business schools, engineering schools, school of arts and sciences. They are complete, full universities. SMU is a specialised university. There is no comparison - quality wise or otherwise.<br><br>Frankly, I think SMU is doing well. But the extent to which it is being lauded and praised is ridiculous. Don't accept the hype and whatever they say - it's their role to market the school; it's your role to be discerning enough.<br><br>SMU has an 12% admission rate?! It's not just about the admission rate, it's about the calibre of students that apply. If every Tom, Dick and Harry applies, of course the admission rate will be low. The best indicator of quality is how self-selective the pool of applicants is. Do you see anyone with less than 3As at A Levels being deluded enough to apply to NUS medicine?</div></blockquote>Just to sidetrack a little. The reputation of a university has nothing to do with the domains it covers to begin with - at least, not exclusively.<br><br>Harvard and Yale College (for undergraduates) are widely renowned as being liberal arts colleges, but it hardly makes every faculty in their undergraduate body equally established. That said, many employers view graduates of these colleges with utmost respect stem from the fact that these are among the most selective colleges in the US - by extension, rendering them holistically (in terms of the entire student body) as the most brilliant and promising young people in the country. Even then, it's worth noting that each varsity has its niche areas - if you looked at the postgraduate level, everyone regards Yale Law School as one of the top 3 law schools in the country, but their postgraduate engineering courses are not as well-regarded.<br><br>However, it's also worth noting firms in a particular industry have an inclination of going after schools renowned in a particular niche area that is intrinsically linked to their industry - I mean, it's no secret tonnes of Wall Street investment firms go to UPenn to headhunt their top students, but you don't see the same firms resorting to headhunting the top brains at MIT. Just because such trends are commonplace doesn't necessarily render UPenn graduates as being more qualified than MIT ones.<br><br>In essence, what I am trying to say is the "employability" of a person depends very much on where and what he studied, as much as the firm and the industry his potential employer delves in. Naturally, the closer the match, the better chances of landing betters jobs for the student - in that sense, the selectivity or even the school itself doesn't play as big a part as both parties (for both the graduating student and employer) having a "common interest".<br><br>In truth, I just don't think anyone can deny the influence Wharton is having on SMU in terms of boosting its credentials as a business school and at least for me, I have got no qualms SMU will not be the school it is without its tie-up with Wharton.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
