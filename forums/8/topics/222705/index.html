            <div class='col-md body'>Riddled with flaws that is.<br><br>Even Wii is better<br><br>----<br>Since their debuts more than a week ago, two new game systems earn good grades from consumers - but the underdog Nintendo Wii is the early favorite over the pricier, sexier Sony PlayStation3.<br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>Both sold out on Day 1: Nov. 19 for the $500-$600 PS3 and Nov. 21 for the $250 Wii. But Nintendo seems to be reaping the benefits of a better supply.<br><br>Overall, Sony is estimated to have shipped between 125,000 and 175,000 PS3s to stores, says American Technology Research analyst P.J. McNealy; the target had been about 400,000. Nintendo shipped between 425,000 and 475,000, he says.<br><br>Nintendo's launch "has been probably a little better than expected and Sony's has been a little bit more disappointing," McNealy says. "If you have to rank on who won this holiday so far, Microsoft is first, Nintendo a close second and Sony a distant third, which is a rare statement."<br><br>Many gave up on getting a PS3 and opted for the Wii, according to New Media Strategies, a research firm that monitored Web activity related to the systems. And 38% who sought a PS3 and were subjected "to sleep deprivation, lost wages, missed classes, the elements and even muggings came away from the experience with a bitter taste in their mouths," the report says.<br><br>More coming up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's an opinion from a PS3 user.<br><br>I am tried the PS3 (jap) for 2 days liao and here are the reasons why i think its not time to buy it now.<br><br>1) Launch game titles super sucky - Gundam is the worst game of the lot! (no pun intended for Gundam fans) The game is really jerky. (framerates around 15fps at times). Considering its only at 720p! Ridge Racer 7 is RR6 on the Xbox360 with a little more extra. Bumping the res to 1080p, it looks really really nice on my bravia TV. I think both versions are equally nice. Genji is crap and the only game worth playing now is Resistant. But this game is not the hit title worth buying the PS3 for.<br><br>2) MGS4, RE5, FF12, DMC4, GT HD and all the must-have titles are not yet release and may only come out at 2nd half of 07! So your PS3 is basically sitting duck until then...<br><br>3) Blu-ray movies are disappointing! The grains on the TV are obvious and is not exactly the HD i can relate to when compared to HD DVD. Blu-ray titles that i have - House of the flying daggers (Worst HD quality movie ever!!! like DVD... waste money), ultra violet, XXX... all pales in comparison to HD DVD's Sword fish.<br><br>4) Play PS1 games on PSP using the Store feature - I think someone just came up with a homebrew that lets you play a lot more PS1 games like FF7 and RE2 on the PSP. Rite now the store only offers a few games.<br><br>5) Considering that i have a lot of original U/C games on my PS2... the local and jap set cannot play my games.... so i am basically screwed... haha<br><br>There are other minor issues regarding friends online and downloading and all i can say is that it isn't as good as Xbox Live.<br><br>So if you are thinking of buyin a PS3, my advise is to wait until next year!<br><br>I wonder whats the hype about on the Grand Turismo nonsense.Test Drive Unlimited have at least better graphics and better range of cars on the 360.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>About 49% of online discussions were favorable to Wii, compared with 27% for PS3. Says the firm's Sam Huxley: "The hype machine went too far."<br><br>The Wii, says Bryan Clute, 26, of Silverdale, Wash., rates an A because the new remote-shaped wireless controller is "something I haven't been able to experience before. It really adds to gameplay" in the bowling game that is included with the system. Clute, who waited in line at a GameStop store to reserve a system, says, "It was well worth it."<br><br>David Nieves, 26, of Philadelphia gives the Wii an A-. "Nintendo has definitely gotten it right." He and friends spent most of the first day golfing, boxing, bowling and playing baseball. The games "were a blast."<br><br>Assessments were harsher for the PS3. Ray McLean, 34, of Brooklyn, N.Y., rates the PS3 an A but gives the games a B "because many of the launch titles were pushed back to later dates." He wanted to see aerial combat game Warhawk, for one, because it would take full advantage of the motion-sensitive controller. But connected to his 42-inch HDTV, "I'm surprised at how good (the games) look, given that they are first-generation games."<br><br>Brett Conlon, 26, of Fairfax, Va., gives the PS3 a B- because of the system updates needed before playing games, going online and playing multiplayer games. "I will say, however, that Resistance: Fall of Man shows a lot of potential. The Blu-ray player has amazing clarity (compared with) a regular DVD."<br><br>On its website, Entertainment Weekly gave the Wii a B+ and PS3 a B. "The Wii slightly edges out the PS3 in our head-to-head because it has a blockbuster Zelda game at launch and a very attractive price point," Geoff Keighley says. But in the long run, "the race will get even tighter."<br></div>
