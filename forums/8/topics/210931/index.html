            <div class='col-md body'>Like what you dress differently, do you get different service treatment?<br><br>Me was dressed in a T-shirt and bermudas and went to Creative shop at Plaza Singapura to shop few days back... And when me was queueing up to pay for my item, me was given different service treatment... People who were queueing up behind and dressed more presentable got served first in front of me as the cashier just simply ushered them in front of me... When the queue was cleared, she gave me those "cheapskate" look and put "Counter Closed" sign even with me standing in front getting ready to pay... Me was furious and threw the item onto the counter and walked off... While me turned away, me heard the cashier saying me "So cheapskate! Can't be bothered to serve you!"<br><br>Me quickly turned around and scolded the cashier for having biased views on me... Me meant me may looked casual in my dressing but me doesn't require those preferential treatment... She even said me don't even deserve her service... Me got so agitated that me asked for the shop manager and gave my piece of mind to the shop manager... She offered to give me 50% on the item as compensation but she didn't know the crux of the issue wasn't about whether me could afford to pay, but rather the cashier insulted my integrity... Me rejected her offer and told her she's also a moroon who's treating me as a idiot and walked out of the store...<br><br>By the way, me wrote an email to Creative to feedback my experience and still waiting for a reply from them...</div>

A couple of months ago I went to Mont Blanc at Ngee Ann City to get a wallet. Although I was dressed rather simply the salesman still treated me very politely, with no airs. So I guess your incident is just a plain unlucky one.</div></blockquote>That's the way for service. So many salespeople are mismatched to their jobs. Thumbs up for Mont Blanc.</div>
