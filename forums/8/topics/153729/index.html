My wife and I are both in the private sector, and for most part of last year, we are finding jobs due to retrenchment. We lowered our expectation so as to contain with FT's in singapore who are willing to work for a  measly sum and for long hours. Finally after a few months of job-hunting did we managed to get a 1.2k per month job. we will do everything we can to comply with all government directives, but it seems that this matter is out of our hands now.<br><br>I have called your department and also BCA several time to seek help, but the reply is always the same, your instructions will be to call and call until I can find one contractor who can meet the deadline.<br><br>Some contractors even make use of my distress to say that they can speed up the work, with the compensation of a few hundred more. According to our plan, we have saved up just enough for retrofitting the windows, we did not save up for the 'coffee money' for contractors to give us piority in ther job queue. My wife and I is seriously considering borrowing money from loansharks but, borrowing from loansharks is illegal, so we are really in a dilemma, if we don't have extra money, our windows will only be retrofitted after the deadline, and the only way we can get extra money is to borrow from loansharks. we really don't know what to do now.<br><br>We really need your help, I am under great stress to get the windows done to comply with your policy, but as I've explained earlier, its really out of our control now. My wife is getting nightmares every night for fear of being fined a couple of thousands and being locked up in jail. Please help us and give us advice. I have already done as instructed, which is to keep calling, but it didn't work. What should I do now?<br><br>Distress,<br>A Loyal Singaporean<br></div>
