              <p>For the one living above you....</p>
              <p>First
               you need to investigate and make sure it is not structural noise from 
              the building itself.........some buildings have internal noise from the 
              pipes......</p>
              <p>Go up and take a closer listening at night......make 
              sure it is human activity.....then if you can pinpoint the place, why 
              not just knock on the door and talk to the resident......ask nicely to 
              keep the noise down.....simples.</p>
              <p>Second,</p>
              <p>For the resident opposite you who like to play music loudly....same remedy, go pinpoint the source....knock and talk.....</p>
              <p>For teenagers...again same remedy.</p>
              <p>It is important that you try to be nice and polite, and make a request that they keep the noise down.....</p>
              <p>If
               you write a letter, lodge a complaint...etc.....it wont be 
              effective....the most effective thing to do is face-to-face 
              communication directly.</p>
              <p>If you really wanna solve the problem, you have to do this.</p>

              <p>Last time I rig a machine which is a long pole with a small hammer at the end attached to a timer machine. Every 10 minutes, the long pole would hit my roof so the upstairs neighbour can hear. When I go to work i would switch on my machine. If the upstair neighbour drill or hammer until late at nite, i would activate my machine early in nthe morning so the neighbour cannot sleep.</p>

              You must be very frustrated. Seem like no one is able to help you.  Please allows me to raise the following questions:-
                  
                  Are your neighbours affected by the noise pollution?
                  
                  Are you having insomia?
                  
                  Are you having a lot of stress recently?
                  
                  Are you having problem at work?
                  
                  Are you feeling better after sharing over the forum?
                  
                  Please share with the originator on your problems in a polite manner. They should be able to help you.
              
              But if they can't. Perhaps you can get yourself an ear plug. You can get it at beach road. If it is too troublesome to go there, use cotton wool.
              
              Take care.
