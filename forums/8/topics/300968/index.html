            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I was wondering what is the role of a woman in the modern society nowadays? Woman becoming more and more independant, putting as much emphasis in their career even after marriage. I know woman of the millenium is definately different from the past. But is it a good thing?? I mean, let's put in a prospective as in as a wife and a mother. How do guys define a good wife or a good mother?<br>In my point of view, I sincerely thinks that a good and successful planning surely leads to a better family being set up in the long run. A lot of broken families are mostly no family planning or lack of understnading before marriage. And the kids as a result suffers esp when the mum works and with no communication established, the kids will have a gap in understanding what he is doing in his own life.<br><br>I do think that most kids will want their mum to talk to them and let them understand the way of life there is so novel to them. A world they are going to venture not knowing what is in store for them. Imagine when he comes back from school, there is no one at home, and he has to find his own food and try to find things to do to kill his time. This is the typical schema of a kid who has both parents working. I mean the character of how the kid is going to grow up has an indirect impact on the teachings of the parents. I wonder how many of us here really think that their parents have done a really good job in upbringing them? Maybe all of us can share...<br><br>Of cos, there are cases whereby children wants to go astray themselves but I think the family has to play a part in the nature of the kid as a result.so is it a result of working parents and no one to guide them , in this case the mum since the dad is the bread winner?<br><br>In another case, do guys mind to switch roles with their wife if the wife has greater earning ability as them? Which means The husband will cook and take care of the kid.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, though kids nowadays, can be lead astray easily, but they are still teachable, the problems with parents, is that, they lack of patience to educate their kids about mannerism, back then when i was a kid, there was discipline, but now, nope..... just endless quarreling with parents<br><br>if you don't teach your children about respect and mannerism since young, wait till they are 17 or 18 years old, see what will happen<br><br>spare the rod, spoil the child or spoil the child, spare the rod.<br><br>Even though, woman has more earning power, but that doesn't give them more bragging rights!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is always tougher to be a woman IMHO. The most basic problem is that woman is constraint by age. New age independent women will tend to avoid the marriage thingy because of higher educational level and a higher pay makes them financially stable and marriage becomes secondary as the dependancy for men or provider is lower. It is alright to think this way, as long as the woman does not want to start a family.<br><br>The problem will come when a woman wants a family of her own. But different from men, age is the main constraint. Fertility and beauty will fade with age. IT is not easy for a women to get a right partner.<br><br>However, it will also be unfair to cope the woman at home just look after the kids, cook meals and other mundane but impt household chores.<br><br>As usual like what the Matrix movie had pointed out, the problem is choice. Woman will have to make impt decision on whether to become a housewife or a career woman... left door or right door but one will have to choose a door to walk through.<br><br>This is where communication with the other half is impt. A symbiosis relationship can be formed between the husband and wife. Career and kids. But don't depend too much on the educational system here cos the kids are still afterall belongs to the parents and parents are responsible for proper education in "doing the right things". School is just for "doing the things right".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Its not true that men or women are smarter. The fact is that each gender has its strengths and weaknesses (women are usually more expressive while men are more pragmatic)<br><br>What you see in school (girls usually do better than boys) is due to the biological fact that girls mature mentally (and physically) earlier than boys. Therefore they are more driven and disciplined to work hard. Boys on the other hand are usually more playful, mischevious.<br><br>2. Personally, I support gender equality but I believe that each gender should recognise and play their roles. While the modern woman is independant and confident, she must still play the homemaker role. The simple fact is that women are better equipped to care for others (husband/child). Its not just a societal creation but biological. Women are more emotion/understanding/caring than men and they are biologically equipped to care for children. Hence, no matter how successful a women is, a house-husband is honestly a very awkward and inappropriate concept.<br><br>3. I also believe that each man/woman has the innate knowledge of his/her role in society. That is, the man being the protector and the woman being the caregiver. No matter how much modern society tries to defy this, its actually implanted in our minds. I'm not sure how many of you might have read about this, but even the most powerful and confident women want a man who can protect them and take the lead. And men have the innate drive to protect women (which is why no women are allowed as frontline soldiers)<br><br>What happens in modern society is that many of the old traditions and biological purposes of humans are being defied by ambition. We are so driven by economic goals that we neglect many other things. Thats what leads to broken marriages and failed relationships.</div>
