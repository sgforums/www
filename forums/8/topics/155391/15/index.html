            <div class='col-md body'>the Great Commission says to go ye therefore and teach all nations that Jesus saves.<br><br>Its the duty for christians to share the gospel. They only need to share, not pressure, because the changing of mindsets is not done by man but by God.<br><br>Unfortunately probably because christians don't want their friends to go to hell (as christians believe is the punishment of sin), they forget that God does all things in His time and will, so they tend to be more pestering and to their friends they appear overzealous and sadly, irritating.<br><br>So be patient to your christian friends. Its because in their heart, they love or care for you, but they may forget that God does all things in His time and will, and it will never be their fault if they don't turn non-christians to Christ, as long as they share the Gospel.<br><br>To christians, remember that God has a purpose and plan for everything. You love your friends, but you need to be patient and follow his will. God will do all things in His time.<br><br>Would this explain why Christians seek to convert others, why they may be so pestering etc? I hope you all understand.<br><br>Love manifests in many forms. You may not understand it, but it is always there. So I hope you wont say "its not my fault he or she keeps trying to convert me, he is making my life difficult." or "why do I have to suffer at the expense of his or her religious ways."<br><br>Your friend is always there, you can view him or her as irritating and ignore him or her if you think its worth it to lose that friend. It depends on how you see the worth of the friendship.<br><br>To me, friendship is priceless.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wealthball:</div><div class="quote_body">the Great Commission says to go ye therefore and teach all nations that Jesus saves.<br><br>Its the duty for christians to share the gospel. They only need to share, not pressure, because the changing of mindsets is not done by man but by God.<br><br>Unfortunately probably because christians don't want their friends to go to hell (as christians believe is the punishment of sin), they forget that God does all things in His time and will, so they tend to be more pestering and to their friends they appear overzealous and sadly, irritating.<br><br>So be patient to your christian friends. Its because in their heart, they love or care for you, but they may forget that God does all things in His time and will, and it will never be their fault if they don't turn non-christians to Christ, as long as they share the Gospel.<br><br>To christians, remember that God has a purpose and plan for everything. You love your friends, but you need to be patient and follow his will. God will do all things in His time.<br><br>Would this explain why Christians seek to convert others, why they may be so pestering etc? I hope you all understand.<br><br>Love manifests in many forms. You may not understand it, but it is always there. So I hope you wont say "its not my fault he or she keeps trying to convert me, he is making my life difficult." or "why do I have to suffer at the expense of his or her religious ways."<br><br>Your friend is always there, you can view him or her as irritating and ignore him or her if you think its worth it to lose that friend. It depends on how you see the worth of the friendship.<br><br>To me, friendship is priceless.</div></blockquote>Share does not mean preach. And dont be arrogant. What makes you think non christians will go to hell? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
