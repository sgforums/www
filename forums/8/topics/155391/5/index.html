            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe in the first place, you must ask yourself. Do you believe in Christ Himself alone ? Teenagers don't go church because the church is very nice nor because they are going with the "trend". Christian faces trials in life, procecution from the rest. But why still so many hang on with their Faith in Him ? They can feel the work of Christ is their lives. CHC do not force people to attend their services, neither do other churches. The 10 Commandments says " Keep the Sabbath Day holy". If you still got any questions, simply walk into a recognised church, go for the service, speak to the pastor. But do not flame others in this thread. Religious harmony in Singapore is considered pretty good.<br><br>Hiding behind a computer and flame others and their religions doesn't keep you safe. The authorities can track down those causing our religious harmonies to be broken.</div>
