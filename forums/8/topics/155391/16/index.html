            <div class='col-md body'>In this morning's Straits Times:<br><br>Talking about God in schools, hospitals<br><br>The nurse could not stop talking about her faith, even as she was inserting a needle into her elderly patient's arm.<br><br>A routine blood test at Tan Tock Seng Hospital turned out ot be a lesson in evangelical Christianity for Associate Professor Wong Weng Fai, 41, a computer science lecturer, and his 66-year-old mother, a dementai sufferer.<br><br>According to Prof Wong, a National University of Singapore lecturer, in the testing room, they were greeted by two nurses listening to Christian worship songs on a CD player. As one of them drew blood from his mother, she began evangelising.<br><br>He recounted: "She asked my mother in Cantonese, 'Auntie, do you believe in Jesus?'<br><br>"My mum was saying, 'No, no, I'm Buddhist.' But the nurse continued, 'You should go to church because it'll be good for you.'"<br><br>Prof Wong felt offended. "They're preyingon the weaknesses of old folks, especially when they are sick and down."<br><br>A TTSH spokesman said the hospital is unaware of the incident and that it "regularly reminds our doctors and care providers that proselytisation is not allowed".<br><br>The issue of promoting one's faith in public institutions has been in the news lately with letters in the Forum page touching on the subject.<br><br>How sidespread is the practice? should government doctors, teachers and bosses who are in positions of authority and trust be allowed to preach to their charges?<br><br>The official answer is no. But in practice, the issues are not so clear-cut, as Insight finds out.<br></div>
