Ban religion related activity? dun tink so .. we have lots of them in varsity.<br><br><blockquote>Read what you have post and ask yourself once more.

But did you? I'm sure you CAN .. nt trying to belittle you .. but you obviously didn't.<br><br><blockquote>What about the islam part that you post.<br><br>What about the taoist part.</blockquote>Can't rem the Islam part. The Taoist part is immaterial in Buddhist discussions.  I was just urging believers not to mix them up together.
