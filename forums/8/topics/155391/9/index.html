Not memorise lines, though it is good to memorise some. I think reading bible is a very basic thing for a believer. If you are illiterate, then at least attend mass to listen what the priest has to say about the bible.<br><br>on the other hand, if you are a buddhist, then I think you should be interested more about your own religion. Not saying the more you know the better you be, as others have said, your behaviour shd reflect what your religion teaches you. If after 10 years you know almost nothing beyond the Eightfold paths and Four Noble Truths, that shows something about your interest right? Do you claim to be a Buddhist 'cos you want a label? Do you sincerely seek the teachings of Buddha?<br><br>if you want to compare, then it is like a Christian not going to church and not reading the bible.<br><br>The above is just my humble opinion.</div></blockquote>wats your religion ? dun dare to say ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by crazy monkey:</div><div class="quote_body">why ? because some ppl start attacking and degrade other religions.</div></blockquote>Hmmm....I am a christian and I dun know whether you have seen me post or not lah but anyway I may not be the best person to do this but I will do it......<br><br>I think sometimes when dealing with issues surrounding christianity, we can get a bit touchy and this is of no fault of any one. It is true that some christians can get very irritating and pushy to the point they push people awayinstead of pull people to Jesus.  It is also true that some christians mistakenly thinks that they are a notch above the rest.<br><br>But that is some. In my experience of dealing with non-christians, and I was a non christian before and I was a very cynical one at that, I realise that many of us jumps at statements like "If you do not believe in Christ, you will go to hell" or "Jesus is the only One True God". But does such statements really constitute DEGRADING other beliefs and religions? Again, I believe that there are some christians who will make such statements with malicious and ill intentions.<br><br>What should be understood that there are some christians who make such statements purely for the fact that this is what the bible says. And when the bible says that, it does not have an element of degrading. It is making a statement you can either believe or disbelieve.  This is like the Japanese saying "We make the best technology". Is that a degrading statement to say that other countries technology is lousy? No that is a Japanese strong conviction abt their beliefs in their technology.<br><br>I always tell my non christian friends that hey I believe when the bible says that if you do not believe in Christ, you will go to hell. And of cos they will say WTF! But my explanation is that this is what I believe. WHat i believe about GOD does not influence my relationships with them, how I treat them and least of all, degrade what they believe. Above all, I encourage them to tell me their beliefs. And they trust me, becos they know me. But even if you do not know me, I hope you can see that I do not come with bad intentions but really hoping that we can see that statements can be made becos that is our beliefs. It is never meant to degrade anyone or any beliefs. You see, there are so many posts that says that God is nonsense, christians are $%!@#@$, this and that, and never once I will reply in malice becos simply that is their beliefs abt us and God but I stand strong in my own beliefs and therefore see no need in rebutting them.<br><br>Anyway, ICEMOON is not a christian I think so with his postings in EH. But he does bring up many questions for tots and discussions....so lets just discuss.<br><br>Cheers~!<br><br></div>

In my experience of dealing with non-christians, and I was a non christian before and I was a very cynical one at that, I realise that many of us jumps at statements like "If you do not believe in Christ, you will go to hell" or "Jesus is the only One True God". But does such statements really constitute DEGRADING other beliefs and religions? Again, I believe that there are some christians who will make such statements with malicious and ill intentions. </div></blockquote>x2 to your post.<br><br>I feel that all the talk about Jesus being the one true god and hell won't make any sense until a person is made to see the christian belief about sin. After all, sin is what most pple can readily identify, not some lofty ideas about God and who He is.</div>
