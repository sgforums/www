It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. 6But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. 7Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. 8Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a cropÂ—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. 9He who has ears, let him hear."<br><br>18"Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: 19When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path. 20The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. 21But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away. 22The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful. 23But the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it. He produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown."<br><br>besides, in another passage in the bible says that salvation comes not by works but by faith in the finished work of jesus (the gospel)<br><br>8For it is by grace you have been saved, through faithÂ—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of GodÂ— 9not by works, so that no one can boast. 10For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>i do agree that it may look unfair if u put it to me that a christian goes around raping and killing yet goes to heaven.<br><br>let the bible speak for itself:<br><br>17"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 19Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20[b]For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>since you talked about murder, lets see what good ol jesus says eh?<br><br>21"You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not murder,[a] and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' 22But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother<strong>will be subject to judgment.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by No_Problemo:</div><div class="quote_body">how people practice their religion guan ne pei se?<br><br>just simply one person agree a portion of what you mention, you act like the saviour of human kind.<br><br>read properly what I post earlier dumb ass</div></blockquote>At least a bona fide Buddhist who knows what he is talking about lent me some support.<br><br>dumbdumb also posted this conversation he heard on mrt:<br><br><blockquote>haha speaking about memorising and reading scripture.. i once was in an mrt, then overheard 2 temple volunteers talking la. they were talking about another one of their friend or something.. but one of them was like "that guy don't even know dunno wat 3 folded path, call himself a buddhist, does he know about the 8 noble truths? dunno at all! how can he call himself a buddhist?" not quoted exactly la, since he was speaking in chinese.. and i'm not totally familiar with buddhism haha. </blockquote>How pple practice their religion is not my pei se .. but they are bringing a bad name to Buddhism. Now even superstitious acts also attributed to Buddhist teachings. If you realize, most xtians are against superstitious acts like worshipping idols and burning joss. that was why they converted in the first place, isn't it?<br><br>and to booster my pt, let me quote the ST interview (full article in <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=post_display&amp;post_id=3690812" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=post_display&amp;post_id=3690812</a>)<br><br><blockquote><br>'It woke us up to say, hey, we have not really been teaching people about Buddhism,' says Mrs Angie Monksfield, vice-president of public affairs of the Buddhist Fellowship, set up in 1988 to cater to young, English-educated executives.<br><br>..<br><br>Taoists are fighting hard to keep their followers after census figures showed a sharp slide in the proportion of Taoists here from 30 per cent in 1980 to 8.5 per cent in 2000.<br><br>Mr Tan Thiam Lye, chairman of the Taoist Federation, says: 'People think that Taoism is superstition, but it is not. We need to teach people what is the meaning of Taoism and its rituals.' </blockquote>btw .. the article about the boy saying xtianity is most logical is here <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=155742" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=155742</a> actually i tink there is another one, i was thinking of that in the beginning, but this will suffice also.</div>
