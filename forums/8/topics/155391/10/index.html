            <div class='col-md body'>Hello guys. We have questions on why the teacher-student relationship is so close and whether teachers having the role of educators can influence their students religiously.<br><br>Religion is and has always been a sensitive topic. More so when there is the comparision of "mine is better than yours" or "mine is right, yours is wrong". What is the role of religion in society anyway? Does it serve to unite us, or divide us?<br><br>Is a teacher allowed to have a closer relationship with his students other than that of a teacher-student relationship? i.e. to say a mentor, a friend? In my opinion, being a mentor means teaching moral things, and very opinionated things. The right course of action to take would be to befriend the student's parents, earn their trust, then only should the mentor impart his morals and opinions. This is why schools don't teach life skills. Can one learn life skills in school? Is it appropriate? All these questions simply serve to open up more pandora's boxes and cans of worms.<br><br>In retrospect of what i have written, I think it is important to see what is the big picture. I hope you guys won't flame each other. This topic actually is something that when discussed properly can allow us to discover more about ourselves and others. So enjoy, and discuss more!<br><br>Cheers</div>

It is true that some christians can get very irritating and pushy to the point they push people awayinstead of pull people to Jesus.  It is also true that some christians mistakenly thinks that they are a notch above the rest.<br><br>But that is some. In my experience of dealing with non-christians, and I was a non christian before and I was a very cynical one at that, I realise that many of us jumps at statements like "If you do not believe in Christ, you will go to hell" or "Jesus is the only One True God". But does such statements really constitute DEGRADING other beliefs and religions? Again, I believe that there are some christians who will make such statements with malicious and ill intentions.<br><br>What should be understood that there are some christians who make such statements purely for the fact that this is what the bible says. And when the bible says that, it does not have an element of degrading. It is making a statement you can either believe or disbelieve.  This is like the Japanese saying "We make the best technology". Is that a degrading statement to say that other countries technology is lousy? No that is a Japanese strong conviction abt their beliefs in their technology.<br><br></div></blockquote>Since when did the bible say you will go to hell if you are not a christian? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And also since when did the bible say that Jesus is the only one true god? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> I feel sorry for those who made such statements and claim that the bible mentions it.

How can a person make a choice out of his free will if he is faced with the threat of going to hell if he does not become a christian(or he is terrified by this "fact")?<br><br>What the teacher did was wrong. The teacher is clearly aware that the girl is a bhuddhist. Why then persist in making life difficult for the girl by persuading her to attend church? This is comparable to the scenario of  introducing a third party to a couple who is clearly in a relationship.<br><br>This clealy shows that the teachers aim was to convert. He was acting in the interest of his ego and not in the interest of the girl.</div>

It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. 6But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. 7Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. 8Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a cropÂ—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. 9He who has ears, let him hear."<br><br>18"Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: 19When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path. 20The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. 21But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away. 22The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful. 23But the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it. He produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown."<br><br>besides, in another passage in the bible says that salvation comes not by works but by faith in the finished work of jesus (the gospel)<br><br>8For it is by grace you have been saved, through faithÂ—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of GodÂ— 9not by works, so that no one can boast. 10For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>i do agree that it may look unfair if u put it to me that a christian goes around raping and killing yet goes to heaven.<br><br>let the bible speak for itself:<br><br>17"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 19Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20<strong>For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.</strong><br><br>since you talked about murder, lets see what good ol jesus says eh?<br><br>21"You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not murder,[a] and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' 22But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother[b]will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca,[c]' is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.<br><br>so what do you think? that God is this being who don't know what's going on, and you can cheat him? you can twist his arm and think you can make it?<br><br></div>
