            <div class='col-md body'>I strongly condemn what the teacher is doing. To me, it constitutes an abuse of authority, as he's trying to use his position of power over the student to unduly influence her in ways which has nothing to do with his job scope. It is ironic that the teacher tells the mother that the daughter should be able to think for herself and yet he is trying to bend her to his views.<br><br>I have no problem with Christians who want to spread their religion, but they should do so outside the workplace, and approach strangers or distant acquaintances rather than people over whom they have power and authority.</div>

I dunno whether there is another church as rich as CHC, yet congregate in a "simple church". Hmm .. maybe NCC, the church mentioned in the ST Forum article?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I think the argument about spending 100k and using $$ to help others is kind of naive. It is not as if they are pocketing the money for themselves and contributing very little to society. I've shown they are indeed contributing [quite a lot].<br><br>You can't compare the Jewish Temple with the secular world. The Temple is the House of God. God is the receiver. However, in social service, the receipents are the people. No money no talk. Maintaining a home for the aged or children, or sustaining a dialysis centre needs money.</div>
