            <div class='col-md body'>I've seen a handful of posts recenly that offend Islam so directly.  That's why I've decided to start this.<br><br>It's quite sad to be a free-thinker.  I pity them.   They can do anything they want.  If their chances of robbing a bank and not getting caught are high, they'd do it, because there are no consequences to evil actions.  If they are under pressure, then they have no help.  They'd kill themselves because they exist for no reason.  It all depends on their morals.<br><br>Muslims on the other hand, believe that everything you do has its consequence.  We believe there is a God.  He watches us all.  We believe there is Merit and Sin.  If anything bad happens to us, we must be patient.  It may be a test from God.  I'm sure this applies to Christians, too.  No, even Hinduism and Buddhism.  People with religions have to be good for some reason...besides some paganistic cults.<br><br>Recent events in the world have made muslims open to attack.  People have been slandering us, if not God.  Please, even if you don't curse Islam but curse God or Jesus (we believe that he is a prophet), it's offensive to us (in this case, even the Christians and Hindus).<br><br>Everything that is done in Islam is done for a reason.  Sometimes things appear bad because of the media, they give biased information!  The free-thinkers then hurl their insults at us.  I'm not saying all of them, but some.<br><br>Just an example, the strict laws in Arabia, often misunderstood.  For stealing, the culprit's hands has to be cut off.  They cut off the hands that the culprit uses to steal with.<br><br>Here is an explanation, I'm quoting this from a website:<br>&lt;<br><br>" It is true that the Qur'an al-karim contains the rule of mutilating the hands of those who steal. But, what is meant by "thieves" in the text are those who savagely attack the homes of innocent people to burn, destroy and usurp. The Qur'an al-karim commands that their hands be cut off when they are caught. But, its execution depends on conditions. The absence of those conditions prevents its execution. Hadrat Ali (radi-Allahu 'anh) specifically commanded that the hands of those who stole during the famine not to be cut off. If this law is applied wrongly in some countries in the name of Islam, the culpability belongs to those who apply it wrongly, but not to Islam. It has not been executed in real Islamic countries that apply the principles of the Islamic religion correctly. This is because the conditions for the implementation of "hand-mutilation" did not exist. Seeing the penalty revealed in the Qur'an al-karim, nobody dared to commit those types of crimes. In Islamic countries no one, even the judges, has a right to forgive the penalty called had. This penalty is sentenced upon those who committed a crime which requires a "had" penalty and execution in front of the public. With the fear of being subjected to this penalty, nobody commits, in other words, cannot commit these sorts of crimes.<br><br>Now let us look through the Holy Bible that is in the hands of today's Christians.<br><br>It is written as follows in Matthews Book (chapter 18/<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">: "Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: It is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire."<br><br>The fourteenth verse of the thirty-first chapter of Exodus in the Torah states: "Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death."&gt;<br><br>People can be good, people can be bad.  When one muslim does something wrong, the free-thinkers insult us once again.  Well, the truth is when he does something wrong, he is defying Islamic law, and for some reason, the free-thinkers who curse us muslims fail to see that.  Even IF a muslim government does something wrong (which is least likely), that does not prove anything.  The government is made up of living, breathing people, who are capable of making mistakes, just like all of us.<br><br>The best way to deal with conflicts is let the muslims settle their own conflicts.  We understand who did what and why best.  This should apply to all.<br><br>So people, please!  Especially the free-thinkers. Respect us as we respect you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Bumiputra laws stand out as an unusual public policy where preferential actions benefit the majority race of a country, and some argue that the advantages afforded to bumiputras border on outright racism. The government, however, argues that the legal and economic advantages are necessary for Malaysia to reduce ethnic conflict. The NEP, in particular, was spurred by large racial riots on May 13, 1969.<br><br>Since 2000, the Government has discussed phasing out these advantages, and reinstating a "meritocracy". Any meritocracy implemented, it was declared, would be based upon the "Malaysian model".<br><br>In 2003, the government began the system of "Malaysian model meritocracy". In the actual implementation, admission to public universities was not based upon a common examination like the SAT or A-Levels but rather upon two parallel systems of a one-year matriculation course and a two-year STPM (literally translated as "Malaysian High (School) Education Certificate") programme. <span style="color: red;">Bumiputras compose an overwhelming majority of entrants to the matriculation programme, leading to some complaints from the public, as the public university entry requirements are perceived to be easier for matriculation students. In 2004, Non-Bumiputra students who scored 5As in the STPM (the highest possible grade) were denied admission to their first choice of study in public universities. Bumiputra students with lesser grades were nonetheless admitted.<br><br>Quotas exist for Public Services Department scholarships. In 2004 Mohd Johari Baharum parliamentary secretary of the Prime Minister's Department stated that PSD (Public Services Department) scholarships would remain quota based. He added that there were no plans to convert this to a merit based system. He stated that the total value of the PSD scholarship since 1996 was 2.4 billion Ringgit. [1] (http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/30623)<br><br>Quotas also exist for entry into public education. In 2004, Dr. Amir Shafie, the newly appointed Higher Education Minister, stated that he "will ensure the quota of Malay students' entry into universities is always higher".</span><br><br>[edit]<br>Present condition of the Bumiputra<br>The Bumiputra has come to be dependant on government subsidies as mentioned by 4th Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad:<br>"We have tried to tell them if you depend on subsidies, you are going to be very weak. But they donÂ’t seem to understand. We tell them if you use crutches, you will not be able to stand up. Throw away the crutches, stand up straight because you still have the capacity. I have talked about this thing and as a doctor I know very well the meaning of crutches but somehow or rather they want the easy way out. If I get an AP and I sell it and make some money, itÂ’s all right, they say."<br><br>He spoke of the government project to build school computer labs which were awarded to Bumiputra contractors:<br><br>"The great debacle was the computer labs. We tried to help as many people as possible because we were accused of giving things to only a selected few. But every one of them sold their contracts. Sold and sold and sold until finally the last man could not sell and had to do the work. He then found he would make terrible losses and so he tried to cut corners, used bad materials and the labs collapsed. They know it, they see it right before their eyes but they learn nothing. Next time they will do it again."<br><br>Increased emphasis on the Malay Language in education have led to Bumiputras becoming less employable. Mahathir (who was also education minister previously) said in 2004:<br>"Why is this only happening to Malay graduates and not Chinese graduates? The reason is probably the Chinese graduates choose the right subjects so they are employable. We find that the Malay graduates, especially those from the Malay stream, canÂ’t speak English at all. No matter how much value you put on a certificate, the fact remains that an employer wants somebody with whom he can communicate. The employer is not Malay, he is a foreigner. And if heÂ’s not going to be able to communicate with you, he will not take you."<br><br><span style="color: red;">Preferential hiring in the civil service has led to less non-Bumiputras applying, yet proportionally more non-Bumiputras are accepted.<br>[2] (http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=6330) As reported by the Public Services Commision - of 350,000 applicants annually for civil services jobs, less than 5% were from non-Bumiputras. The PSC employs 40% of the 1.2 million civil servants in the country. Despite the low application rate, non-Malay applicants make up [3] (http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=6329) around 13% of the civil service. For the Chinese community in particular, 2% of the applicants are Chinese but they obtain around 8% of the positions in the civil services.</span></div>

Why do u have tis idea tat free thinkers = no morals ? Free thinkers do have wisdom and knows how to live in a society. They will not do harm to other people because they know how much it will hurt if they r the ones been hurt. They do it because they got real compassion and love of other peopel in the society. On the other hand, the only thing keeping them from committing great evil is just because they fear punishment and crave for some form of reward. Not because they have compassion, not because they wich to help people, they do it all for a motive.<br><br><blockquote>Just an example, the strict laws in Arabia, often misunderstood. For stealing, the culprit's hands has to be cut off. They cut off the hands that the culprit uses to steal with. </blockquote>Obviously u guys had deviate from the original intent of the scriptures.<br><br><strong>And thief, either male or female, cut the hand of both; this is recompense for their earning and terrible punishment from AllÃ¢h. The Power of AllÃ¢h is prevailing over everything and HE is All-Wise and Watchful. </strong><br><br>Did they say anything about theft of scripture or burning of homes ? Aren't u interpreting the scripture the way u want it ? U might as well say the thief here represent those who steal other people heart ! U can even say tat the word thief here represent stealing the word of the scripture and replacing it with your own meanings ! If tat is the case, then everyone can interprete the scripture anyway they like. I can even say tat the above paragraph did not mention about human at all. So it must have meant on dogs of horses who steals things ?<br><br>Tis act of cutting hands is indeed practised till recent times. In fact it may still be practised now. I thought your god stated int he quran 4 times "Easy have we made the Quran to understand; is there anyone who will pay heed?" Perhaps God wants to repeat this message because He knows that there will be boneheads "scholars" who will want to insist otherwise. (adapted from a website)<br><br>And if we take your quran the way u want it to be meant, then I guess it support terrorism and jihad. Why ? Because some muslim interprete tat americans r savagely attacking the homes of innocent people to burn, destroy and usurp (palestinians, iraq). SO the quran must have supported muslims from rising and attaking the americans ?<br><br><blockquote>People can be good, people can be bad.

I wonder where the attack rises from but from the above things u said, it appears to be an attack on the scriptures.<br><br><blockquote>So people, please! Especially the free-thinkers.

Someone please close the thread </div></blockquote>This thread is not even a 'discussion' at all.<br><br>Actually, I personally think that it is good that the topic-starter posted this thread, so that we can all learn from it.<br><br>what have we learnt?<br><br>- To understand the world better, Muslims must not keep to themselves.<br>- We learn to be tolerant to others if we know that not everyone think likewise.<br><br>- We learnt that some muslims think that 'free-thinkers' insult them.<br>- We learnt that some muslims feel that 'free-thinkers' are people who do whatever they want ('evil' included) and do not think about consequences.<br>- 'Free-thinkers' are pitiful <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Ok, I admit, I was joking for the last one. Oh wait, did u know I was joking?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>P.S &gt; I hope the topic-starter now understands that it is not the 'free-thinkers' who are worried about them, it is the whole world being worried about 'extremists'. FYI, most people have a religion, only a very small minority are truely atheist, but that doesnt mean atheists are evil, do things with no consideration of others. Atheists deserves respect too, and are not lesser than any religious people. I hope u open up and socialise more with non-muslim people in order to understand the world better and learn to be tolerant towards others.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Both Atheists and religious extremists of all stripes are a threat. We have fundamentalist Christians who do all sorts of silly things like burning JK Rowling books. Bear in mind that all religions have their share of extremists and moderates.<br><br>On a side note, I have strong suspicions that dark wizards threw in their lot with the Dominican friars to persecute their white counterparts in the 15th century. many of those burnt at the stake for witchcraft were good people. Till today, Wicca is still viewed with scorn by much of the world even though it seeks to do no harm.</div>
