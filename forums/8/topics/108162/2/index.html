            <div class='col-md body'>To stupidissmart,<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">Why do u have tis idea tat free thinkers = no morals ? Free thinkers do have wisdom and knows how to live in a society. They will not do harm to other people because they know how much it will hurt if they r the ones been hurt. They do it because they got real compassion and love of other peopel in the society. On the other hand, the only thing keeping them from committing great evil is just because they fear punishment and crave for some form of reward. Not because they have compassion, not because they wich to help people, they do it all for a motive.<br></div></blockquote>With all due respect, it seems that you have misinterpreted what I said!  I'm talking about the ill-sensitive ones who curse the muslims.  Curse our religion!  That's why I decided to end my paragraph with "It all depends on their morals".<br><br><blockquote><br><strong><br><br>Obviously u guys had deviate from the original intent of the scriptures.<br><br>Did they say anything about theft of scripture or burning of homes ? Aren't u interpreting the scripture the way u want it ? U might as well say the thief here represent those who steal other people heart ! U can even say tat the word thief here represent stealing the word of the scripture and replacing it with your own meanings ! If tat is the case, then everyone can interprete the scripture anyway they like. I can even say tat the above paragraph did not mention about human at all. So it must have meant on dogs of horses who steals things ?<br><br>Tis act of cutting hands is indeed practised till recent times. In fact it may still be practised now. I thought your god stated int he quran 4 times "Easy have we made the Quran to understand; is there anyone who will pay heed?" Perhaps God wants to repeat this message because He knows that there will be boneheads "scholars" who will want to insist otherwise. (adapted from a website)<br><br></strong><br></blockquote>Firslty, yes I am a Muslim.  What are you?  I interprete the Qur'an correctly, and I have all my muslim brothers and history, what muslims in the past did, how they did stuff in difficult situations, to prove it (like the one during the famine).  You know nothing about the Qur'an.  In fact, some free-thinkers have tried to add some more verses!  Don't look for any old website for muslim resources, anyone can make a website.<br><br><blockquote><br><strong><br>And if we take your quran the way u want it to be meant, then I guess it support terrorism and jihad. Why ? Because some muslim interprete tat americans r savagely attacking the homes of innocent people to burn, destroy and usurp (palestinians, iraq). SO the quran must have supported muslims from rising and attaking the americans ?<br></strong><br></blockquote>As I have said, "When one muslim does something wrong, the free-thinkers insult us once again. Well, the truth is when he does something wrong, he is defying Islamic law, and for some reason, the free-thinkers who curse us muslims fail to see that".  This very well describes you, don't you think?<br><br>So a christian man murders someone.  "Oh look, Christianity supports the murder of innocent men!"  Is that it?  Of course not.<br><br></div>

Oh gosh, I am being 'pitied'. I guess all atheists can go crash into buildings and behead other people because we felt 'insulted' or being 'disrespected', it is justified. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This is a perfect example of people thinking in their own world. Atheists don't believe in a higher power, retribution or judgement etc, that doesnt mean we 'exist for no reason' or 'do anything we want' without thinking.<br><br>WOW ~ yes, we are humans and we can 'THINK'. We use our brains too, albeit not imagining stuff, we use it to think wisely and logically. We know what we do has its consequences on the society too. We know what is causing pain and hurt, and a chaotic world is not what we want to be living in. Wow ~ Did that surprise you? Or did u actually understand what I am talking about? </span><br><br>[/quote]<br><br><br>What I meant was they have *only* science to justify everything.  If they are experiencing bad times they have no "supernatural help".  Atheists really do believe that they exist for no reason.  They just live and die, so they live life to the fullest.  Everything is *just* science.<br><br>Let's say I'm an atheist-Mafia Lord.  "I can kill anyone I want and no one can stop me.  Who cares about others?  Whatever it is, I'll never get hurt, the police will never catch me, because I have many men.  Who cares if anyone's emotionally or physically hurt??  As long as no harm comes to me..."<br><br>A free-thinker has no reason not to do evil so long as he has the means to prevent any evil happening to him.  They may know it's bad and offensive but what's the point if no harm ever coming to him is possible.<br><br>Even if they have morals, they can crack under stress.  People with religions can too, but they have a much lesser probability.<br><br>Don't you see that this is what I meant by consequences?  I can go ahead and start a gangster group right now if I were an unbeliever!  It's the atheists who CHOOSE to be good in conduct.  THAT is why I wrote "it all depends on their morals".<br><br><blockquote><br><strong><br><span style="color: blue;"> I pity you. You do everything because of a reason - because u are scared of God, not because you truely understand the reason not to do evil. People like you who cannot think or decide by yourself what is considered good or bad for the society must be put under control before all 'hell' breaks loose. That is indeed the reason why religion exist in the first place - to put people like u in check.<br></span><br></strong><br></blockquote>It's true that we Muslims are scared of God.  It's not too hard to explain to you my answer.  It's TOO SIMPLE to explain.  Not only are we scared of God, but we do what He commands us to do, which does not include violence when weÂ’re angry.   Besides, I think it makes perfect sense to be good.  ThatÂ’s my reason for being good, and obeying my Creator, whom I believe is every sense in the word Â“perfectÂ”.  I believe He knows all.<br>Besides that, it would be much better than living a life of guilt with no sense of hope, doing evil (IÂ’m not referring to free-thinkers here).<br><br>The prophet Abraham was commanded by God Almighty to sacrifice his only son (pbut).  He didnÂ’t know why God asked him to do that, but he believed that God is perfect, God knows all (in every sense of the word Â“allÂ”) and God knows whatÂ’s best for everyone.  So he did but when the sword met his sonÂ’s neck, his neck was harder than stone!  An angel and a ram appeared and the angel told him to sacrifice the ram instead.  It was all a test from God Almighty, to show how close he his to Him.<br><br>Note:  this is the Islamic version of the story.  The biblical version of the Christians may be different.<br><br>So you see, for the world to exist, I believe only a perfect god can exist.  Even if I donÂ’t know why I have to be good, I know that my Creator knows best.  Good thing I know why I have to be good anyway.<br><br>History has proven that an evil society would be horrible for everyone.  But later, some people have realised that a minority of wrong-doers can exist.  They are taking the upper-hand.<br><br><blockquote><br><strong><br><span style="color: blue;">U telling me beheading people, crashing into buildings, suicide bombers are 'good'? </span><br></strong><br></blockquote>People can be good, people can be bad. When one muslim does something wrong, the free-thinkers insult us once again. Well, the truth is when he does something wrong, he is defying Islamic law, and for some reason, the free-thinkers who curse us muslims fail to see that. Even IF a muslim government does something wrong (which is least likely), that does not prove anything. The government is made up of living, breathing people, who are capable of making mistakes, just like all of us.<br><br><blockquote><br><strong><br><span style="color: blue;"> It is u who fail to see that the rest of the world understands that only some people are extremists aka terrorists, we understand most muslims are not. Also, you fail to see that 'people who insult you' are not only the 'free-thinkers'.<br><br>[\b]<br>[quote]<br><br>Once again, Â“IÂ’m not saying all but someÂ”.  This was in the first post<br>[quote]<br>[b]<br>I don't understand why a person or govt supposedly being 'influenced' under the 'holy guidance' of God, can do wrong? Didn't u consult God or didn't God guide you? hmmm.... </span><br></strong></blockquote><strong>[\b]<br><br>They only think they are right.  ItÂ’s the responsibility of another muslim to correct that misguided one.<br><br><blockquote><br>[b]<br><span style="color: blue;"> To let u settle your own conflicts huh? To let u do as u wish? Crash into buildings, behead people and such huh? Or wage war against each other? Yeah, how I wish all extremists kill all of themselves altogether. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> May I add: Please remember NOT TO INCLUDE INNOCENT PEOPLE WHILE U'RE AT IT?<br>[\b]<br></span></blockquote>Crash into buildings?  Behead people?  Wage war against each other?  Are you cross-eyed?  Is crashing into buildings an Islamic thing?  NO.  So youÂ’re saying that all these terrorists are the people whom you wish to interprete as Â“muslimsÂ”, while all of the true muslims are not muslims?  These are the acts of terrorists.  Thank god youÂ’re not in the government, or else they would ban Islam.<br><br>If what you said is true, then muslims would have been wiping out their enemies 1400 years ago, and they would constantly be war until now.<br><br>Due to recent events, people have been thinking about Islam.  Thinking the same way you do, that muslims are terrorists.  But wise people want to know more about Islam, if it the religion really is all about violence.  They discover the truth about it and thatÂ’s why Islam is the worldÂ’s fastest growing religion.  Not biggest, but fastest growing.<br><br>ItÂ’s interesting what you said by the way.  I read OsamaÂ’s speach.  He decided to target the two towers because the Jews, who are being supported by the Americans, attacked twin towers in Jordan.  This was his way of revenge.  ItÂ’s wrong though.<br><br>And settling conflicts?  There were reports in the newspapers that America actually had enough time to stop the planes from crashing into the twin towers.  I donÂ’t know how but according to the reports, they had enough time.<br><br>Anyway what I actually meant was issues like Israel.  The land conflict.  (Some) Free-thinkers have been insulting the muslims in this.  Even people like you are saying that the terrorists are representing Islamic acts.  You may have sub-consciously said it.<br><br>Sure, they are conflicts between muslims.  But itÂ’s better that we settle it ourselves, because people like you would assume that Islam supports the terrorists and their actions.  I am making this claim with evidence from your post.<br><br>[quote]<br>[b]<br>"We understand who did what and why best. This should apply to all." LMAO... pls enlighten me what is 'best'? This has gotta be the most 'enlightening' advise I've read in my life  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>With all due respect (pun intended), your post dont show any respect if u noticed. Re-read your 2nd paragraph and tell me you are respecting others.<br><br><br></strong></div></blockquote><strong>For example, if a terrorist uses the QurÂ’an to defend himself, we are able to explain to him why his interpretation is wrong.  Like Jihad.  A popular word now.  People nowadays are interpreting it wrongly.<br><br>I think my post contains very much respect.  IÂ’m exposing all the stupid things (some) free-thinkers do as they are free from morals.  Just imagine, if the police force collapses I bet thereÂ’ll be many robberies.  These people who commit them will most likely be the low-moraled free-thinkers (IÂ’m not labeling all the free-thinkers here) and next would be those weak in their religion.<br><br>IÂ’m not condemning all the free-thinkers.  IÂ’m just condemning those who are guilty of what I have stated.<br></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have 2 little stories to tell you guys.<br><br>Story 1:<br>During my teens, I have a Christian friend who was born into a Christian family. One day, he made a shocking remark. He said 'Aiya, why they pray to Buddha and Guan Yin? These people are all greedy people who kept praying for 4D and Toto numbers, and the gods (my friend meant Buddha and Guan Yin) also give out these numbers and encourage betting and greed!"<br><br>FYI, the very basic idea of Buddhism is to renounce desires, esp monetary and possessions.<br><br>Story 2:<br>I have an Indian Muslim friend who made a comment. "I do not encourage you to celebrate Chinese New Year." Try as I might, till this very day, she cannot accept the idea that CNY has NOTHING to do with religion.<br><br>FYI, CNY has everything to do with race, no matter what my nationality or religion, I am born a Chinese - nothing can change that fact, even if I died for 10,000 years, my remains will still be identified as a chinese~! CNY is celebrated by the Chinese race, simple as that. To her CNY = buddhist or taoist (or some other 'chinese' religion). Mind you, she has a Masters degree, but cannot understand and differentiate between race and religion.<br><br>Why did I tell these 2 little REAL LIFE stories?<br><br>To highlight the fact that many religious people stick too much to their own group and do not even try to understand others, so much that they have warped and totally absurd ideas of others made up by themselves.<br><br>Please, people, don't imagine things. Find out before making assumptions. Best is to come out from the little social circle and mix with others.<br><br>Such ignorance is not even funny.</div>

In tight situations, some religious people may feel betrayed by their religion when they find that things don't go their way. Will they be rational enough to control themselves when they are freed from their religious beliefs? Don't start telling me these people are 'defying their religions' or are 'weak in their faiths', you can call it whatever you want - that's not the point. The point is:<br><br>A person who cannot handle the stress - it is regardless of religious backgrounds.<br><br>Similarly, people do good things or commit 'bad' offenses - regardless of religious backgrounds, also it does not necessarily mean that they are under stress.<br><br>Have you lost your ability to understand that people are able to keep themselves in control without relying on others (aka God/religion/superior powers)? <strong>Your whole idea of needing to 'fall back' to a superior being is due to the effect of your strong faith. </strong><br><br>Remember, free-thinkers <strong>don't need</strong> to rely on the idea of falling back onto others(superior beings - which to us is non-existant) and <strong>this does not make us less strong-willed.</strong><br><br>[BTW, I'd like to know if my comment that 'Superior Beings/God(s) are non-existant' appear to you as an insult?]<br><br>In short -<br><br>Not everyone needs a religion/God/higher powers to keep themselves sane/lawful/in control/understand empathy, love, kindness and compassion.<br><br>Most people understand that terrorists are extremists and most Muslims are not extremists. Most people understand that Muslims do not approve of the actions of these extremists.<br><br>People who are intolerant of other's religious beliefs are probably having a religion themselves. Evidence? Many conflicts, riots, wars, suicide bombers, etc are done by religious people for religious purposes, targetted at specific religious groups. Seldom (I don't think there are any) atheists go to such extremes to proof themselves - the fact is religions don't bother atheists as much, we don't have any to start with. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

What you meant was "Imam", with an m.  If what you say is true about Islam, then we would have started it 1400 years ago in Arabia.<br><br>The way we take religion is not just a hope in times of need (exactly why I said free-thinkers are more likely to crack under stress, they do not have something to cling on to), but we really DO believe that there is a God.  We must obey his commands, which does not include violence.<br><br>Let me rephrase your words: everytime a muslim terrorist carries out his terror, he CLAIMS THAT HE RECIEVES blessings from Allah through his Iman telling him that he would be a martyr if he was killed or blows himself up.<br><br>One word.  Misguided.  Islam is not about violence.  Our prophet (pbuh) set a good example for us.  We learn the Holy book and the Hadith (his sayings).  The Byzantine emperor had a meeting with his enemies (those who saught to destroy Islam) and questioned them.  It just so happened that they ended up praising him.<br><br>Why is it so hard to understand that 9/11 is the act of stray fanatics?  IsnÂ’t it natural for us to be upset with America?  President Bush won the election.  Who chose him?  People cast votes.  This is the second time in history that a large amount of Americans are migrating to Canada.<br><br>I donÂ’t really think Imams go astray, but the Imams in religious groups tend to.  Popular ones like JI and Al-Qaeda.  They make Islam look like violence.<br><br>And right here, I have evidence.  Evidence needed to prove that people are misinterpreting terms.  Â“JihadÂ” does NOT mean Holy war.  I quote from a website<br><br>In the 256 th verse of Surat al-Baqara in the Qur'an al-karim it states: "There is no compulsion in religion..." Muslims do not attempt to convert a person to Islam by having recourse to any means, that is, by force or by promising material advantages. He who wants to be a Muslim becomes a Muslim willingly. Muslims cause non-Muslims to embrace Islam with their sweet, logical and reasonable words, and with their moral conduct and good behavior. Those not becoming Muslim live freely under the protection of the Islamic state as non-Muslim inhabitants. They have the same rights and freedoms as Muslims; they freely perform their own religious rituals.&gt;<br><br>Jihad itself is quite a big topic, so I wonÂ’t elaborate.  Its meaning is NOT Holy War.<br>Things like the woman who got beaten up for mixing with a non-muslim, the hand mutilation for crime, are small examples of things misunderstood by non-muslims.  And in the forum, some free-thinkers have been slandering Islam (read my previous posts to see how I knew they were free-thinkers).  This is why I want no more offensive comments from those who have been slandering Islam.<br>As for the woman, they were right to be angry with the woman, but their method of punishment is wrong.  Also, thereÂ’s not much detail so I canÂ’t say what went wrong.<br>Leave such affairs to us.  ThereÂ’s a town in America just for Judaists.  Yes, that means no electricity at all.  You may find it outrageous but they do this actually so that they will not get distracted.  They donÂ’t want to forget God, or have any evil thoughts.<br>So no matter how weird it seems, stop talking about issues like the woman.  If she was treated unfairly, PUNISHED WRONGLY, she has the right to sue her punishers or the court if they were involved.  If the court refuses, that is most unislamic.<br>As a Muslim, IF she was guilty of her crime, she must accept her punishment.<br>And why is it that people pick up only the mistakes of Muslims?  Why is it that youÂ’re searching for flaws?  Finding more ways to mock us?  Where do you get this biased information?<br>This makes it sound like AmericaÂ’s so innocent.  Like it was a superb idea to send an army to invade another country as an excuse to find Â“weapons of mass destructionÂ”.  What a brilliant idea!  Â“Not happy, I just call it a warÂ”.<br>The idea of God communicating through Imams is more of a Jewish idea.  I remember reading that it was in the Talmud.  God consults the rabbis, something like that.  The JI are acting on their own wanting a Muslim state.  DonÂ’t think it was Allah asking us to do it.  DonÂ’t guess if youÂ’re not sure, because this will soon become a popular hoax if it gets out of hand.  If you are curious, announcing your thoughts in the forum is not a good idea.  It will do done more damage.  Ask an Imam in a local mosque if you are curious about Islam, or a Muslim friend.<br></div>

It's not much of a warning, but there have been such posts.  I want those type of posts to stop.</div>

Don't start telling me t have any better or worse chance of cracking under pressure. In tight situations, some religious people may feel betrayed by their religion when they find that things don't go their way. Will they be rational enough to control themselves hese people are 'defying their religions' or are 'weak in their faiths', you can call it whatever you want - that's not the point. The point is:<br></blockquote>Think statistics and logic.  People with faith have something to cling on to, a supernatural being, a perfect being, a being that can do the impossible.  This is the disadvantage that free-thinkers have.<br><br>If things don't go our way, we believe that God knows a better plan for us, God knows best.<br><br>We can still try hard a few times but if our attempts repeatedly fail, the above applies<br><br>For example:  Imagine I'm a kid.  Today's my birthday and I 've planned to celebrate it and KFC.  Unfortunately, it's there's a thunderstorm outside.  My parents think it's too dangerous to go.  The next day, news of bird flu arrives in Singapore and the chicken at the KFC branch I planned to go to was actually infected!<br><br><blockquote><br>A person who cannot handle the stress - it is regardless of religious backgrounds.<br></blockquote>Read above.  Think in terms of logic and statistics.  <strong>The chances</strong> of a person coping without a faith compared to one with a faith.<br><br>How would you behave if there was a Big, strong man always watching you?  This is not my description of God, but having an eternal source of comfort and help is a big help emotionally and mentally.<br><br><blockquote><br>Similarly, people do good things or commit 'bad' offenses - regardless of religious backgrounds, also it does not necessarily mean that they are under stress.<br></blockquote>True, but stress is a vague word.  What I meant was people usually commit crimes due to stress and anger.  With faith, a person has more than the law to abide.  In this, people with faith have an advantage.<br><br><blockquote><br>Have you lost your ability to understand that people are able to keep themselves in control without relying on others (aka God/religion/superior powers)? <strong>Your whole idea of needing to 'fall back' to a superior being is due to the effect of your strong faith. </strong><br><br>Remember, free-thinkers <strong>don't need</strong> to rely on the idea of falling back onto others(superior beings - which to us is non-existant) and <strong>this does not make us less strong-willed.</strong><br><br>[BTW, I'd like to know if my comment that 'Superior Beings/God(s) are non-existant' appear to you as an insult?]<br></blockquote>True, but I like the first thing you said in bold. <strong>That</strong> is why people with faith have an upper hand in commitments.  This makes them more disciplined.<br><br>We have already seen what happens to a misguided strong-willed person with faith.  The faith increases our will.  People with faith have an advantage here too.  This does not mean that free-thinkers are not strong-willed, but people with faith are moer advantageous in this area.  If a strong-willed free-thinker decides on having a religion, how much more strong-willed will he be by thinking that there's an eternal being always there for him?<br><br>No, it's not an insult.  I understand your position as a free-thinker.<br><br><blockquote><br>In short -<br><br>Not everyone needs a religion/God/higher powers to keep themselves sane/lawful/in control/understand empathy, love, kindness and compassion.<br><br>Most people understand that terrorists are extremists and most Muslims are not extremists. Most people understand that Muslims do not approve of the actions of these extremists.<br><br>People who are intolerant of other's religious beliefs are probably having a religion themselves. Evidence? Many conflicts, riots, wars, suicide bombers, etc are done by religious people for religious purposes, targetted at specific religious groups. Seldom (I don't think there are any) atheists go to such extremes to proof themselves - the fact is religions don't bother atheists as much, we don't have any to start with. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></blockquote>First paragraph-true<br><br>2nd paragraph-Gosh, I hope so.<br><br>3rd pargraph-  Not really.  By using violence, they are defying their own religion.  Who's to blame?  The person who does not follow what the faith says, or the faith, for promoting peace?  They are promoting their faith wrongly, not according to how the faith says it should be.  What's the use of converting someone by force if he still doesn't believe in it, accept it in the end?<br><br>During the time of Muhammad there were Wars against the uprising of Islam.  Islam defended itself from Idol-worshippers (Al-Lat, Al-Uzza) and people with no religion.<br><br>What about miracles that were done by biblical prophets?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To make it easier for u to understand my point, I'll use some numbers to represent stress tolerance levels.<br><br><strong>In your view:</strong><br><br>Religious people's stress tolerance<br>= self + gained from faith<br>= 1 + 1<br><br>Atheist's stress tolerance<br>= self tolerance + gained from faith (since no religion, faith = 0)<br>= 1 + 0<br><br>The above is what you THINK is true. However, you failed to realise that it is an overly simplistic idea. You did not take into consideration many factors such as:<br><br>- Atheists have come to terms with themselves that there is NO Supreme Being, thus they have <strong>grown accustomed</strong> to not to rely on 'external forces'. While you think atheists are weakened by not having someone to rely on, the truth is that atheists have GROWN STRONGER themselves by NOT RELYING ON OTHERS.<br><br>* Religious people have grown accustomed to their beliefs and rely heavily on the faith that there is a Supreme Being or supernatural forces to back them up. Instead of growing stronger themselves, they tend to grow stronger on their faiths, and thus, the tendency to rely on external powers.<br><br>- Atheists are not bound by religious beliefs, therefore they tend to see things more rationally, to see things as they are. Being <strong>clear-minded,</strong> it is easily understandable that atheists can handle more stress by themselves, and less tendancy to sway their thoughts to rely on others or freak out.<br><br>* Religious people, being too faithful, are bound too tightly to their religious beliefs and it is harder for them to see things rationally. They tend to relate and reference happenings back to their beliefs, rather than to see things as they are. If they are weak in their faith, they tend to freak out because they are not accustomed to relying on themselves to solve problems.<br><br><strong>Therefore, in MY VIEW:</strong><br><br>Religious people's stress tolerance<br>= self + gained from faith<br>= 1 + 1<br><br>Atheist's stress tolerance<br>= self tolerance + gained from faith (since no religion, faith = 0)<br>= 2 + 0<br><br>Hope it helps u understand my perspective.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To 6White_Pawn9:<br><br>Just as you're defending your faith, I'll be defending America.  First of, like me, most rednecks don't care about what muslim wants to do as long it doesn't affect us.<br><br>IsnÂ’t it natural for us to be upset with America?  President Bush won the election.  Who chose him?  People cast votes.<br>Ans;  Sure, we voted for BUSH but who made us consider BUSH to be a better hope in defending U.S then otherwise?<br><br>Strangely its only after 9/11 that I'm hearing that Islam is a religion of peace considering that the 1st hijackers of aircraft were muslims.<br><br>Why is it so hard to understand that 9/11 is the act of stray fanatics?  Ans; muslim around the world was shown cheering when they saw the events unfold on Al-Jazeerah.<br><br>This is the second time in history that a large amount of Americans are migrating to Canada.<br>Well, I'm not seeing a large amount of Vietnamese, Chinese, Mexicans, South Aficans, et cetra leaving for Canada.  I wonder why?  Besides most of those who run for Canada do not hold a green card or a visa, making them an alien in America.<br><br>ThereÂ’s a town in America just for Judaists.  Yes, that means no electricity at all.<br>Why would I be outrage by their life-style?  Muslim had been practising their faith too in America before 9/11 &amp; it wasn't a problem.<br><br>If she was treated unfairly, PUNISHED WRONGLY, she has the right to sue her punishers or the court if they were involved.  If the court refuses, that is most unislamic.<br>Oh! You mean like if a WOMAN was <strong>RAPED</strong>she won't need 4 other men to be present during the rape to prove she was raped?  Or maybe you mean that virgina mutilation is not wrong even when the woman is forced?<br><br>As a Muslim, IF she was guilty of her crime, she must accept her punishment.<br>Really, how do you define if she is guilty or not if she's got no chance of a defence without a man.  A muslim woman can be beaten up on the street if she was not in the company of a man.  What kind of law is that?<br><br>And why is it that people pick up only the mistakes of Muslims?<br>Ans; Until 9/11, no one cared about the mistakes of Muslims.<br><br>Why is it that youÂ’re searching for flaws?<br>Ans; whats to search if it was already there in the first place?<br><br>Finding more ways to mock us?<br>Ans; well, prove that you're tolerant.  Isn't that what Islam all about?<br><br>This makes it sound like AmericaÂ’s so innocent.<br>Whose eyes was it that claimed that America is innocent?  In fact, name me a country thats innocent.  Iraq under Saddam? A'stan under the Talibun?<br><br>Like it was a superb idea to send an army to invade another country as an excuse to find Â“weapons of mass destructionÂ”.<br>Ans; like it was a superb ideal to crash airliners into America without any excuse.<br><br>The idea of God communicating through Imams is more of a Jewish idea.  I remember reading that it was in the Talmud.  God consults the rabbis, something like that.  The JI are acting on their own wanting a Muslim state.  DonÂ’t think it was Allah asking us to do it.<br>Ans; you don't sound to sure yourself either, why don't you ask a fanatic muslim to confirm?  Theres no need to disassociate from what has already been practicing by <strong>STRAY</strong>, fanatic muslim.<br><br>DonÂ’t guess if youÂ’re not sure, because this will soon become a popular hoax if it gets out of hand.  If you are curious, announcing your thoughts in the forum is not a good idea.  It will do done more damage.  Ask an Imam in a local mosque if you are curious about Islam, or a Muslim friend.<br>Ans; theres really no need to guess &amp; your concern about what is written in forums like this is totally uncalled for as the informations are already on the internet, in case you missed.</div>
