            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>With all due respect, it seems that you have misinterpreted what I said! I'm talking about the ill-sensitive ones who curse the muslims. Curse our religion! That's why I decided to end my paragraph with "It all depends on their morals". </blockquote>Tat is very funny, why state only free thinkers ? R u sure no buddhist, taoist, hindus, christian or catholic r the ill-sensitive ones ? Depends on morals ? There r muslims with no morals either. Having a religion doesn't make u special and necessary have a high moral. Just take a look as osama.<br><br><blockquote>Firslty, yes I am a Muslim. What are you? I interprete the Qur'an correctly, and I have all my muslim brothers and history, what muslims in the past did, how they did stuff in difficult situations, to prove it (like the one during the famine). You know nothing about the Qur'an. In fact, some free-thinkers have tried to add some more verses! Don't look for any old website for muslim resources, anyone can make a website. </blockquote>I am just surprise tat a muslim will write such a post to tarnish its own reputation. If u talk about history, muslim do cut off the hands of theives in the past. Tis is a real historical fact tat cannot be denied. U say u interprete it correctly, but please elaborate on it. I don't really see any connection with your explanation with the exact pharsing in the scipture. In it they never say anything tat theft only meant scripture but u just add it in to make your religion look good. Don't look for any old website.. strange... u mean they keep changing their content ?<br><br><blockquote>As I have said, "When one muslim does something wrong, the free-thinkers insult us once again. Well, the truth is when he does something wrong, he is defying Islamic law, and for some reason, the free-thinkers who curse us muslims fail to see that". This very well describes you, don't you think? </blockquote>Tat is again an attack on free thinkers. Doesn't other people from other religion too "insult" or "attack" your religion too ? Why specifically point to free thinkers ? Nevertheless I am not attacking on any individual, but on your explanation which i find some problems to it. I am talking about the problem of your interpretations. However u totally ignore about mu doubt on it and claims I am attacking on individual ? Frankly, it shows tat u r too sensitive and thought everyone is attacking your religion, when it is really on your understanding. U better read on my first line<br><br><strong>And if <span style="font-style: italic;">we take your quran the way u want it to be meant</span>, then I guess it support terrorism and jihad.</strong><br><br>The next is your interpretation of the line<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">But, what is meant by "thieves" in the text are those who savagely attack the homes of innocent people to burn, destroy and usurp. The Qur'an al-karim commands that their hands be cut off when they are caught</span><br><br>I said there r people tat really do see muslim being savagely attacked, burnt and land being usurp. (Iraq, palestinian). If according to your above interpretation, then doesn't tat justify jihad and terrorism (cutting hands off, america and israel r not having famines either) ? It is an attack on your interpretation, and tat is it. U r sensitive and thought it attack your religion.<br><br><blockquote>So a christian man murders someone. "Oh look, Christianity supports the murder of innocent men!" Is that it? Of course not. </blockquote>Did anyone mention anything about singular individual ? U better read back my post properly again.<br><br>BTW, u had given an example tat we shouldn't blame christianity just because one individual had erred, then why do u condemn free thinkers just because some of them "insult" your religion ? Tat seems to be a difference between your actions and your words.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Let's say I'm an atheist-Mafia Lord. "I can kill anyone I want and no one can stop me. Who cares about others? Whatever it is, I'll never get hurt, the police will never catch me, because I have many men. Who cares if anyone's emotionally or physically hurt?? As long as no harm comes to me..." </blockquote>is having your religion any better ? Lets say I am a muslim leader " I can kill anyone for god. I can kill innocents using car bombs and planes. I don't care if there r innocent people on the plane because I do it because of god. I don't care if any one is emotionally or physcially hurt, god has a way. I will establish a muslim region because tat is wat god desire. I will kill all the dirty people who had no respect for god and god will grant me victory. i am doing it all because it is in line with god"<br><br>U want to give extreme examples, i can give one too. A buddhist or muslim can be mafia leaders as well.<br><br><blockquote>Even if they have morals, they can crack under stress. People with religions can too, but they have a much lesser probability. </blockquote>if u r under a religion u r more likely to commit extreme acts fr your religion as well. It is well known from history tat many conflicts and wars r started because of religion. The reason why there r so many terrorist attacks r because of religion. U can say they r deviants, extremists bla bla bla, but then again they r really still terrorists because of their religion nonetheless. If u think mass murdering is better than cheating, then I have nothing to say.<br><br><blockquote>Don't you see that this is what I meant by consequences? I can go ahead and start a gangster group right now if I were an unbeliever! It's the atheists who CHOOSE to be good in conduct. THAT is why I wrote "it all depends on their morals". </blockquote>Really... If i am a muslim in iraq, i will join the al qaeda now as well. Why ? because my religious leaders r telling me my muslim brethrens r being exploited now and they r telling me to pick up arms and fight. I don't think if it is logical or senseful or not, I just do it because my religious leaders tell me so.<br><br>Which is more problematic ? Personally masses under control by an individuals appears to be worse.<br><br><blockquote>It's true that we Muslims are scared of God. It's not too hard to explain to you my answer. It's TOO SIMPLE to explain. Not only are we scared of God, but we do what He commands us to do, which does not include violence when weÂ’re angry. Besides, I think it makes perfect sense to be good. ThatÂ’s my reason for being good, and obeying my Creator, whom I believe is every sense in the word Â“perfectÂ”. I believe He knows all. </blockquote>Because of your fear of god, it makes u possible to do things irrationally. If god ask u to sacrifice your son, u will use a knife and cut off his head (some scripture examples u had given). If yoru god ask u not to eat pork, u will do it. If your god ask u to strangle your baby to death, u will do it too. If your god ask u to be a terrorist, u will do it as well. U don't use your own judgement, u blindly obey. U r being controlled like a toy. Is tat a good thing or bad thing ?<br><br><blockquote>Not "they do whatever they want", rather "can do whatever they want". And I said free-thinkers who "HAVE", which is in the past tense. Why I started this is because I have seen some posts by free-thinkers insulting God and my religion. I know they are free-thinkers because they cursed the idea of believing in a God too. </blockquote>How do u know ALL the people who had attack your religion to be freethinkers ? I am pretty sure some of them r from other religion as well. DOesn't tat show u r biased against free thinkers ?<br><br><blockquote>I pity them since they have no supernatural belief. It brings great comfort. In fact suicide rates might go down. Why? Because people with religions believe there's a God to pray to in harsh times, no, anytime. Believing that all our problems are assigned to us from God, and knowing that God would never give you a problem that you cannot solve, is a great comfort. Meanwhile, the free-thinker has to cope with so much more. </blockquote>I don't know about the rate of committing sucide but I do know about the rate of murder do increase with religion. There r many conflicts and fights from history to now just because of religion. There r some people who cannot stand the high expectations of their religion (having sex without marrying) and was killed by their own counterparts. I am pretty sure u can't deny these death as well.<br></div>

Did the wrongdoers get punished by the muslim communities?<br><br>Let's take a look at the riot in Indonesia.  All the rioters have gone scott free.  Why is that so?  The govt condoned that because they are all "brothers"?<br>One example : a Christian girl who volunteered in helping &amp; taking care of the raped victims &amp; their family, got raped and killed by a gang of muslim rioters.  No justice has been done.  Instead, the muslim community said that the girl was a prostitute.  This was reported in our local newspapers.<br><br>I certainly respect the clear minded muslims who follow the teaching in the right way, which is what Islam is all about.  But these muslims have done little and almost nothing to correct the wrong.  I may not agree with free thinker stereotyping muslims just because of one 9-11 case or one Osama in Afganistan, but we cannot totally (partially can lah!) blame them for their opinion on the religion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i know what u are trying to say, and i totally agree with u that some people have wrong impressions of muslims.<br><br>The fact is that many people tend to relate separate issues together, whether u like it or not. It is also a fact that many of the recent terrorist activities are executed by muslim extremists, and because of this, many people relate them to other peaceful muslims naturally. It is stereotyping, yes, much like how the general public would stereotype a chinese to be materialistic or a blonde girl to be a bimbo - u cant do much about it. However, I'm sure with all the 'public education' and repeated media coverage 'educating' the public, most people understands that most muslims are not extremists and certainly don't approve of their actions.<br><br>Some people chose to 'refuse to understand' (a phase i like to use on people who knows but refuses to accept the facts), and it is sad that muslims are being looked at with suspicions of being extremists. You cant expect every single person to agree with you.<br><br>The reason so many people disagree with u is because you have started the topic PINPOINTING free-thinkers (albeit 'only the ones who say bad stuff about muslims'). The rest of us are wondering why u specify 'free-thinkers'. Can u explain why? You seem to mean that a Buddhist or Christian (or any religious person) is justified if he/she talks bad about muslims.<br><br>Lastly, my advise to all muslims is not to get too sensitive, and pls open up your social circle to include non-muslims and understand each other more. Please dont ask to get special attention or special treatment or ask others to be sensitive to you, as others deserve the same as you do.</div>

Did the wrongdoers get punished by the muslim communities?<br><br>Let's take a look at the riot in Indonesia.  All the rioters have gone scott free.  Why is that so?  The govt condoned that because they are all "brothers"?<br>One example : a Christian girl who volunteered in helping &amp; taking care of the raped victims &amp; their family, got raped and killed by a gang of muslim rioters.  No justice has been done.  Instead, the muslim community said that the girl was a prostitute.  This was reported in our local newspapers.<br><br>I certainly respect the clear minded muslims who follow the teaching in the right way, which is what Islam is all about.  But these muslims have done little and almost nothing to correct the wrong.  I may not agree with free thinker stereotyping muslims just because of one 9-11 case or one Osama in Afganistan, but we cannot totally (partially can lah!) blame them for their opinion on the religion.  </div></blockquote>Simply, then the government is wrong in doing so.<br><br>Anyway, all medias are biased and you will never know the full story until you're there.

Hey, most people can only think in their own perspectives, that's why it is good to mix more with people from different walks of life - to understand more about other people!<br><br>I disagree with you mainly because of your views of free-thinkers. Your stereotyping of free-thinkers being the (only?!) ones who look at all muslims with suspicions, your 'understanding' that free-thinkers are more susceptible to commiting wrongs and being easier to 'crack under pressure' - I cant agree with you on these issues. If u started the thread without specifying free-thinkers, and all those comments u have of them, I would have agreed with you.<br><br>As for insulting the idea of believing in a God, just treat them as being ignorant? Please dont be so sensitive and treat it as an insult, everyone has their own views, and many times they are different from our own.
