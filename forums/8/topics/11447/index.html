            <div class='col-md body'>Actually not really true...some testers prefer snail drivers, some prefer 'confident' ones...ie those who dare to drive fast (of coz within speed limits lah). I passed on my first attempt but boy was it anything but easy.<br>On the practise session before the test, found out that my instructor's car's handbrake buay jiak wan...even pulled all the way up, the car will still slide down the slope. Siao! On actual test, the stupid tester on air-con to 4, cannot hear a damn thing man. On slope, no choice have to release clutch until biting point, then quickly release brake and floor the accelerator. Car slipped back very, very slightly, but surprising no deductions. I did not even bother to engage handbrake. Tester told me to turn left, but did not hear properly (!@#$% aircon), signal right, go all the way down slope liao, then he told me should turn left. Shit...already at the bottom =&gt; no choice..said sorry and turn left from a cannot-turn left part. By now super low morale. Everything else went on smoothly until parallel parking. Stopped too close...but act smart decide to go ahead. In the end, car totally lop-sided and have to squeeze like siao to get in. When coming out, I noticed that the front is going to hit the pole, so quickly braked. The moment I braked, the pole fell. By then, super sian liao...thought sure fail wan. So when we go out to the road, I anyhow drive liao. Basically I drove around 60km/h - 65km/h all the way, and filter also damn fast...signal on, filter straightaway.<br>In the end come back to office. Realised I got 20 points. 2 for additional reverse needed in parallel parking. 10 for knocking down the pole, and 8 for filtering too fast. The tester asked me how, I keep quiet lor. But it turned out that driving fast on the road helped because he said I was very confident on the road. So he struck off the 2 points and let me pass. Heng hor.<br>One word of advise for those taking the test. Do not screw urself up even if you think u failed. I nearly screwed it for myself when I thought I failed and basically filtered any-o-how.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

I don't really see the point in driving fast. And having a P-plate doesn't mean you cannot drive fast. You can always drive at 100++kph, but no thanks from me. I value my life and I am contented to crawl along at 90, sometimes 80. Remember...better late than never.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>
