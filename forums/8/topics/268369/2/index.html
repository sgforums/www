Your GF? Your lawyer???<br><br>Sure~ you think that would NEVER happens. Then picture this: when your wife-to-be is walking down the aisle towards you, the groom, you do not see your parents by your side. How you feel? When you have your first born and your parents are not with you, who share your joy? You in-laws only? When you need financial backing to fund a small business and you got all the help from friends, loans and morgages and still not enough. You r parents are not there to help you. How you like it?<br><br>If you do not know how to love your parents, how can you love your partner when she knows you are not a family-oriented person?</div></blockquote>nice 1.... you can't change parents. but you can be at yr best  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
