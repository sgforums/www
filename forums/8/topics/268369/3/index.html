I am not saying that my parents did anything though. They are the perfect ones for me. I love them a lot. I have had friends whose parents gave them hell day in and day out. Treat them like servants, abuse and all. I pity those people. I try to help them as and when I can. Give them moral support and sometimes a shoulder to cry.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

The past is the past... there is nothing you can do about it.<br><br>Also, you can thank your parents for toughing you up. I see so many people that cannot handle a bad tempered superior and resign. By now you should be an expert at handling bad superiors or at least feel no pain when your boss lose his temper often.<br><br>If people keep on resigning from their jobs, they cannot put in enough time for the company to trust them enough to promote them to the highest positions.</div>
