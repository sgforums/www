For a 20mins exercise, after certain times, you will find that you can only maintain your current condition (if you are fit and healthy). To be more effective you need to do about 40mins.<br><br>In a typical week the recommendation is to do 3/4 exercises. You should be doing 20mins for 2-3 times, and 1 set of 40mins. Also try to change the way or type of exercise you are doing to be effective.

            <div class='col-md body'>hey, looks like u've already gotten some sound advice. But i juz like to intervene and be a busybody sometime <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Here's my take in this:<br><br>To attain a flat tummy, u needa do 3 main steps:<br><br>1) Cardio-vascular activity(eg jogging, swimming, cycling, etc)<br>I recommend jogging as u support your own weight, hence adding to the intensity.<br><br>Pointers/tips to look out for while jogging.<br><br>-As pointed out before, try to jog/walk for at least 20 mins and above. Below that and ur body is using glucose as the respiratory substrate, hence there's no net loss in fat volume. Try to maintain for ard 30 mins, tt way, ur body will start metabolising lipids to use as energy.<br><br>-Wake up early and jog in the morning. Studies have shown that jogging in the morning tends to use stored fats and glycogen rather than those in ur blood. Moreover, doing cardio in the morning will kick-start your metabolism, and rev up ur energy level throughout the day.<br><br>-Find a jogging partner for motivation and support.<br><br>-Remember to hydrate yourself before, during, and after the jog.<br><br>2) Strength/Resistant training<br>Doing crunches, situps etc will strengthen ur abs. (though much is dependent on your genes)<br><a href="http://exercise.about.com/cs/abs/l/aa100801a.htm" rel="nofollow">Here are some effective exercises you can try to strengthen your abs</a><br>Change ur routine every 4-6 weeks to avoid your muscles from adapting to the intensity and exercises and thus the plateau-ing effect.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Note: doing ab exercises will NOT give u six packs,  the ONLY way for u to see ur six packs is to reduce your body fats.<br>However, strong abs support your spine and protect your back.<br><br>3) A healthy, low calorie diet<br>In a nutshell, eat a balanced diet.<br>Rich breakfast, moderate lunch, little dinner.<br>Eat in smaller proportions. I think u shld noe wad is healthy and wad is not. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Try not to eat after 6-7pm, as after that your metabolic rate falls, and ur body will convert the excess glucose to fats. And for guys, the most amount of fat storage is in the adipose tissue under ur tummy. (trivial: for females, it's the hips and butt, hence the hourglass shape)<br><br>Hope this helps. If not, whatever.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Cheerios,<br>mythoria<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Best the natural way.. no pills no ops no jabs etc.. later u become part of the stats of the Slim10 saga..<br><br>Spread out ur meals.. maybe 6 SMALL meals.. eat less fat less sugar and just sufficient carbo.. unused carbo is stored as fat in the body.. eat more veg n fruits n drink water.. helps to flush out..<br><br>Exercise regularly..include cardiovascular and strength training.. both will burn calories and increase ur metabolism.. higher met will enable u to utilise calories more efficiently.. strength training helps to tone ur body.. u could alternate cardio n str.. cardio on day1.. str on day2.. rest on day3.. den repeat the process.. the sequence is up to u.. slowly up the intensity as u become fitter..<br><br>Last of all.. ample sleep. Too little or too much may result in ballooning..<br><br>The effect varies among pple.. genes play a big role..<br><br></div>
