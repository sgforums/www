            <div class='col-md body'>i don't see what's wrong with guys taking care of themselves properly as long as they don't exceed the limit.<br><br>Guys want thier gals to look nice, so as guys, think it's a form of respect for them to be well-groomed as well.<br><br>Of cos, i dunno what's the limit, but i find going for facial to keep your face clean, dye hair is alright. I'm not sure about nail grooming and eyebrow trimming and i'm not into these, but it's really up to personal preference for others i guess.<br><br>For me, i dont consider myself a "new-version homo/gay"... i do keep myself neat and dont behave like a sissy. and whenever i'm out to orchard or town, my style will always be a long-sleeve shirt (those designed to be tucked out), wear jeans and some simple accercoris like a ring and a choker. dont feel anything wrong with that. people might think i'm over-dressed, but, who cares~? this is my style and i'm not doing anything wrong.<br><br>think most impt is how you portray yourself. some guys look really macho and "man", but their action is really feminine...<br>for me, i think i look like an ah beng with specs.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
