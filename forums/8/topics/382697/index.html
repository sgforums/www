            <div class='col-md body'><p>The dark side was seen as having been used for selfish purposes, although many dark-siders who were accused of such selfishness claimed that their dark side was simply a means to achieve an end. One of the most notable examples was Anakin Skywalker, who embraced the dark side with the intentions of saving his wife, at the expense of the Jedi Order. Many found the dark side to be addictive, being unable to resist its pull the more they subjected themselves to it. Dark side users became more powerful as their physical bodies slowly decayed. However, some users like Mara Jade noted that the use of the dark side was a practical matter, as the power it granted was more efficient when performing destructive Force powers like telekinesis. Like the light side, the dark side was often treated as though a semi-sentient entity with purposeful designs.</p></div>

The weak-minded have ever been ready to obey one who wields great power. Those who learned the powers of the dark side were quick to exploit this weakness—to make war. Again and again the dark side has surged forth, like a storm…devouring whole worlds and entire star systems. Those who mastered dark power became dark power.

              <p>C'mon guys, you all must be kidding on the 'dark side' stuff, arent you folks?</p>
              <p>Try doing a 'dark side' twist and you will end up in jail. Singapore is rule by law. Run foul and you gonna kiss your sorry ass goodbye.</p>
              <p>Being cunning or greedy does not need to go to the dark side.</p>
              <p>Military example:</p>
              <p>If the enemies are 300m and ambushed you, its too far to do a charge. You find cover, discern the number of flashes or firers in the enemy team, and you can either call in the artillery to lay waste on them, or if arty is out of range and the enemy force small, you do a flank and wipe them off the face of this Earth. That's cunning. Nothing to do with the dark side.</p>
              <p>Biz example:-</p>
              <p>If you competitor is getting his market share, you better find out and analyze where you are and why you cannot compete. Price, services, production costs, etc have to be studied. Once the results are out, you work on your weakness and capitalize on your strength, and the market is yours, depending on how much you can produce to corner the market.</p>
              <p>This works only in Singapore I must add. Overseas, its a hotbed of dark corruptive forces. As long as you stick to Spore, you dont need to cheat, lie or steal. Do it and you will sell your product once. No one's gonna return a second time. You can fool one person for one day but it is unlikely you can fool everyone everyday.</p>
              <p>So, its still back to basics on what we had been taught in school. Those who practise the dark side are now in the dark shade of Changi Prison's high security walls. Others who are still running around within society will check in soon.</p>
              <p>And the worse aspect is - heaven have eyes. Retribution is real. Dont play around with fate. The price for belonging to the dark side is never worth any riches you presume to obtain, because in the end, you will still return to dust. You will either be immortalised or reviled in memory by those lives you touch for generations. to be venerated or to be spate upon, even to your descendants.</p>

              <p>Actually it was a joke about the relating or discriptive 'jedi' dark side we talking about, using it as a mataphor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For your military example it is a good solution youproposed but on the actual battle field things will happen very fast. Do not think like what you see in the movies. The enemy thinks too. Mors so when you already mentioned your team was ambushed. depending on the size of your group when the enemy fired the first shot they probably had everyone in their team aimed at selected indivdual in your group, targeting signallar radiomen first or their equipment (this were taught to us in the army to cut off communications)sharpshooters, heavy machine gunners and officers first right down to the riflemen. They probably also deplyed they men on your flanks to cut off retreat or flanking action from your group. They are the ones ambushing so they have the element of surprise. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for work in the sales line is is good ethic practise and professionalism as you wrote but most salesmen bosses don't think this way. they only want figures so as a result this chain of greed and cunningness never ends. not only in sales and businessess, this is also observed in everyone's daily working life, not matter how good one try to hide their intentions and doings.</p>
