            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>Have seen many cases of salary disputes of students who engage in part-time jobs through such agencies and end up not getting paid or having their pay delayed for weeks and even months. They do not care about MOM guidelines, and even challenge staff to go to MOM if they are unhappy. Also, I understand that any contract signed, both parties (ie. the Employer and the Employee) are entitled to a copy, but in my case the employer did not. Luckily I managed to take a copy when he wasn't looking(sorry if this ain't ethical, but i wanted to show my parents and seek their opinion).Currently they owe me pay from as far back as Oct 2005. It was clearly stated in the contract that pay would be ready 4-6 weeks from the date of service rendered. My current part-time employer has made many threats both verbal and physical to many staff regarding dispute of pay.But they do not abide by it, so what can we do?<br><br>Does MOM actually protect part-timers who contribute a small portion to the economy and also the service industry?Please advice...Also I would like to bring this issue up to the MOM,but I do not know which department and how specifically to lodge a complaint and what actions will be taken against the employer.<br><br>Thanks for all the help!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just go to MOM and file a claim against your employer. Substain your claims with your no-pay proof, dates and timings of work rendered, letter of appointment. Be prepared to pay a fee of $50 for filing the claim and from there, MOM will investigate your claim and if necessary, both parties will be called up for verification and confrontation in MOM and if issue is not resolved, your claim will be submitted to Small Claims Tribunal.</div>

So what you signed for only applies on that particular agreement.  Your company still follows MOM policy, but the agreement you signed has nothing whatsoever to do with it(that policy). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
