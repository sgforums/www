I personally don't believe in doing so; and had she done that i'd have thought that was silly, since greed is not unusual. it's the way singaporeans are so absolutely undiscerning that she's concerned about. Like sheeps to the slaughter, so as to speak.<br><br>so why use the word gullible? because it strikes the nail on the head. i could think of other words and ways of phrasing this, but i wouldn't have done it in any degree of lesser humility (or nonhumility).<br><br>why risk alienating herself? to begin with, was she close to us? she's a surgeon, not a politician. at best, one might describe her as socialite. that being the case, she would clearly know better about donations then any of us would. but once again, she didn't demonstrate that either; since donations are clearly personal and the money is sitting in your wallet.<br><br>does that do us any good? no. absolutely not. why should it? it's a message, not a charitable act. it's interesting tha tyou mentioned nkf; i hope you're not suggesting that it has done anything to help singaporeans, for i'd say it is a 'case in point' for Prof Lee. Note that after the revelation of the 'golden peanut', everybody simply tightened their purse strings without really questioning why. that's just as guilty as being gullible. and verily much, all the mainstream media within SPH simply stopped short of saying 'singaporeans deserved it'.<br><br>I don't know how you read her letter, but simply put, it's a reminder that we should donate to causes that we understand, and not because of hyped up media etf.c.. she simnply spelt out what we already knew but never acted upon. it is in no way a personal attack to singaporeans, i think it's quite shallow to think so otherwise. might be a good idea to start learning how to read things in context instead of ingesting parts that appeals or are easy to understand.</div></blockquote>It's fair to say that her motive was to chide singaporeans for being naive. But really, the fact she thinks we are too easily conned is really whose fault? And with her ties (no matter how hard she may try to distinguish herself separately) to Lee Senior, who is not going to link the two together, however mistaken that might be?<br><br>Whenever someone writes, people are bound to interpret their underlying meaning differently.

That they simply followed thru on the media's one-side coverage? People donate (or not) out of the goodness of their hearts, not based purely on the 'subtle' media 'propaganda'.<br><br>It would be equally 'gulliable' to believe singaporeans cannot make sound judgement on their own after all these years; or if you are led to believe that the media played a bigger role than they actually did.</div>

Dr Lee is always welcome to comment on singaporeans but it is inevitable that writing such a strong letter will definitely invite links to the minister mentor, even if the original intention was to express her feelings as head of neuroscience or as a fellow citizen. I may be slightly prejudiced on this point, but certainly suspicious. However, i accept her letter as stand alone and not politically motivated, and have responded as such.<br><br>It is also incorrect to say singaporeans don't do their due diligence before opening their wallets. People have questioned flag day volunteers and inspected (even scrutinised) collection cans to ascertain which organisation they were contributing to. This line of questioning was further publicised in the ST after the NKF outcry, highlighting on the particularly rude manner in which student volunteers were interrogated while collecting donations. Either way, singaporeans do question organisations before make a decision.<br><br>It would be unfair to expect singaporeans to ask to a level that includes funds auditing or level of reserves before making any sound judgement.<br><br>With regards to Huang Na's case, at this point, has it been proven that the cash collected was indeed used to fund the renovation of the parent's house? Is there an active investigation into this matter? Or are we once again being fed blown-up media reports filled with half-truths trying to influence us?

'sincere and truly compassionate' and 'foolish and naive' are entirely mutually exclusive sets, you can be both at the same time. and i certainly hope you're not suggesting otherwise.<br>also, wouldn't you agree that this statistic seem to indicate that most singaporeans felt rather bitter about their donations and henced stopped donating? i certainly feel so. if not, what's your point of citing how they can be considered a statistic?<br><br><strong>What about those who continued donating?

That's my opinion, period.<br><br><strong><br>By using this term, she whitewashes the sincere and truly compassionate people who donate generously, prefering to label singaporeans on a whole as foolish and naive. With regards to trend analysis, certainly those who discontinued contributions to the NKF can be considered a statistic, since there was ample media influence and coverage of the trial to provoke singaporeans into a predictable response.<br><br>ah, a classic case of mistaking how the 'sincere and truly compassionate' cannot be 'foolish and naive'.<br>but jsut for you, i'd spell it out<br>i don't see how she whitewashes the sincere and truly compassionate. i'd imagine that even the sincere and truly compassionate feels quite silly about donating to other people's paychecks and not the charity itself. 'sincere and truly compassionate' and 'foolish and naive' are entirely mutually exclusive sets, you can be both at the same time. and i certainly hope you're not suggesting otherwise.<br>also, wouldn't you agree that this statistic seem to indicate that most singaporeans felt rather bitter about their donations and henced stopped donating? i certainly feel so. if not, what's your point of citing how they can be considered a statistic? </strong><br><br>I plainly said that Dr Lee swept aside the ones who gave willingly and directly branded singaporeans in general as naive. Certainly those who give must have gone through some thought process. How can you or anyone assume stupidity or a lack of curiosity?  It was curiosity that got people to find out the whole story on the twins in the first place. But certainly not everyone is a qualified neurosurgeon like Dr Lee, who can instantly Â‘deduceÂ’ whether the operation will succeed or not.  In fact, if she knew from experience that the op was flawed to begin with, why publish an article now when it serves no purpose other than to chide Singaporeans? Why wait till after the whole op is complete than raise an issue? If she wanted to make a difference, she should have made her deduction known earlier so doctors can contemplate whether or not to risk going through with the op.<br><br>As to the statistic, I already said the mass withdrawals were following an obvious trend.<br><br><strong><br>What about those who continued donating? Should we label them 'gulliable'? I wonder if we have let one man's greed blind us to the true concept of compassion.<br><br>it's nice to wonder, but what conclusions are you drawing from it? what's your take on it? or have you just started wondering and left things hanging?<br><br>also, it'd be nice if you made definitive statements like, 'we should/shouldn't label people who continued donating gullible'. asking questions like these dosen't reflect your position at all. it's what's making replying to you so difficult. it's almost as if you're afraid to commit to a single stand, like you're just waiting for me to make a mistake in my replies. </strong><br><br>Do you enjoy sarcasm? The innuendo is clear: people who continue to contribute after the scandal do not imply gulliability. You or Dr Lee can say whatever you want. ThatÂ’s after all, your opinion and youÂ’re always entitled to it.<br><br><strong>If so, then every CEO of SG charity organisations should be defined as mercernary entrepreneurs out to make the big buck at the expense of their patients.<br>why should they be defined mercenary entrepeneurs? because 'we have let one man's greed blinded us ot the true concept of compassion'? how is that relevant?<br>i'll tell you what's relevant. have you actually checked out how much other ceos of charitable organizations are earning? based on the prevailing trend, i'd dare to say that you haven't. why is it relevant you ask? because you probably reflect most other singaporean apathy when it comes to donations.<br>see, it's these kindda blind statements &amp; assumptions which are quite frustrating. </strong><br><br>The only frustrating thing is that you clearly have difficulty interpreting statements. And your follow-up rhetoric doesnÂ’t help. This statement simply said (and I will politely indulge you) that if people saw all CEOs of charities in the mould of TT Durai, then everyone will think they are simply profit driven. Yes, to clarify your presumptuous suggestion, I have indeed checked up on the salary packages of CEOs of such organizations before I responded. Whether they earn enough or too much is subjective. Clearly you think they are over paid, but can you explain how you came to that conclusion? Or is that simply your opinion?<br><br>Can you benchmark what formula should be used to calculate a CEOÂ’s pay? Do you even have the basic foundation to assess this? If not, thereÂ’s nothing to discuss, because all this is undoubtedly your opinion alone.<br><br><strong>It is also incorrect to say singaporeans don't do their due diligence before opening their wallets. People have questioned flag day volunteers and inspected (even scrutinised) collection cans to ascertain which organisation they were contributing to. This line of questioning was further publicised in the ST after the NKF outcry, highlighting on the particularly rude manner in which student volunteers were interrogated while collecting donations. Either way, singaporeans do question organisations before make a decision.<br><br>have you actually conducted interviews? wherehence do you obtain the information to make such claims?<br>here, allow me to speak from having being a flag day volunteer myself. virtually nobody, as in *nobody* have ever asked me *why* or *where* the money is going. perhaps you would like to tell me that all your friends, uncle &amp; aunties, siblings and cousins always asks why? or have you ran around asking people if they do?<br><br>but i digress, because 20cts is clearly different from $600,000.<br><br>you see, if we were just dealing with facts the nkf saga is as follows<br>1) t.tdurai, through a series of unfortunate events (hee) got his salary and gold tap exposed.<br>2) singaporeans feel conned. wonder why they weren't told about his pay.<br>3) stop donating.<br><br>had they done their homework, why would singaporeans feel conned? or do you think that singaporeans didn't feel conned about the salary but only about the NKF reserves? </strong><br><br>I never said that Singaporeans felt cheated solely based on salary alone. Again, that was your suggestion. It was a series of events and incidents that brought a public outcry; gold tap, designer toiler bowl, the patron claiming 600K as peanuts, audacity of Durai to sue two men for defamation, that among other things he had a fleet of chauffeur driven cars etc.<br><br>Singaporeans should indeed do checks on who they are donating to. IÂ’m not disputing that. But I reiterate that it is unfair to say Singaporeans should do <strong>extensive</strong> background checks right down to cash reserves, internal audit report findings and classify this as Â‘homeworkÂ’. If everyone did that, who will want to seriously donate?<br><br>Do you do a lengthy research to ascertain an organisationÂ’s well-being both in monetary and in goodwill just so you can contribute <strong>20 cents</strong>?<br><br>And for that matter, being a volunteer and sharing your opinion doesnÂ’t amount to a global view. Just because nobody asked you doesnÂ’t mean nobody asked.<br><br><strong>It would be unfair to expect singaporeans to ask to a level that includes funds auditing or level of reserves before making any sound judgement.<br><br>why so? are you suggesting that we cut out the auditing process for charities altogether?<br>it's a simple matter of simply asking them for their financial statement. FYI, it is *not* uncommon practice. you could strut into NCSS in ulu pandan community centre and they'd have their financial statement color printed in nice 180gsm paper, bounded and ready for you.<br>or have you never tried doing that before? oh wait, i dare say a vast majority of people who donate to presidents challenge don't have a copy of that, including your said self.<br>do i make my point clear? it's there, but *people don't bloody ask*. now wait, i know you're tempted to stray into areas entirely irrelevant, such as 'but t.t durai lied about the reserves anyway!!' but perhaps you might be better off answering why singaporeans don't ask before we go there. </strong><br><br>As above.<br><br><strong>With regards to Huang Na's case, at this point, has it been proven that the cash collected was indeed used to fund the renovation of the parent's house? Is there an active investigation into this matter? Or are we once again being fed blown-up media reports filled with half-truths trying to influence us? As it is, their neighbours probably said it best: what they do with their money is their business and no one elses.<br><br>this is a classic example of how i fail to see you're making a point here, what with the questions and no conclusions.<br>HuangNa's case, in the format as above<br>1) HuangNa murdered. search initiated, huge press generated<br>2) found. people stream in in droves to start donating money for 'white money'<br>3) seems like the money isn't accounted for. singaporeans start asking why the final sum is so high, and wonder where all the excess money goes....<br><br>my point was, why didnt' they ask before? why is it the final step in the process? it dosne't matter what they used the money for, that is irrelevant. i hope you have understood that by now. what is more important is, why didn't singaporeans ask why they are donating? why do they start grumbling after the final amount was revealed to be so high?<br>~~~<br>you seem to be very enamoured and insistent with the fact that people question their donations. but it'd be nice if you actually start to make points in case and case in points.</strong><br><br>Your sarcasm notwithstanding, people contribute to the parents out of sympathy.  What they do with the money is really their business. This is not a charity organization. You canÂ’t give them money out of your own wallet and then tell them how to spend it. And to clarify, who are the Singaporeans who are complaining? Are there hundreds of letters to the press stating their displeasure? Or are you basing your assumption on the few interviewed individuals and their comments to represent the whole?<br></div>
