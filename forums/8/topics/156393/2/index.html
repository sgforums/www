I personally don't believe in doing so; and had she done that i'd have thought that was silly, since greed is not unusual. it's the way singaporeans are so absolutely undiscerning that she's concerned about. Like sheeps to the slaughter, so as to speak.<br><br>so why use the word gullible? because it strikes the nail on the head. i could think of other words and ways of phrasing this, but i wouldn't have done it in any degree of lesser humility (or nonhumility).<br><br>why risk alienating herself? to begin with, was she close to us? she's a surgeon, not a politician. at best, one might describe her as socialite. that being the case, she would clearly know better about donations then any of us would. but once again, she didn't demonstrate that either; since donations are clearly personal and the money is sitting in your wallet.<br><br>does that do us any good? no. absolutely not. why should it? it's a message, not a charitable act. it's interesting tha tyou mentioned nkf; i hope you're not suggesting that it has done anything to help singaporeans, for i'd say it is a 'case in point' for Prof Lee. Note that after the revelation of the 'golden peanut', everybody simply tightened their purse strings without really questioning why. that's just as guilty as being gullible. and verily much, all the mainstream media within SPH simply stopped short of saying 'singaporeans deserved it'.<br><br>I don't know how you read her letter, but simply put, it's a reminder that we should donate to causes that we understand, and not because of hyped up media etf.c.. she simnply spelt out what we already knew but never acted upon. it is in no way a personal attack to singaporeans, i think it's quite shallow to think so otherwise. might be a good idea to start learning how to read things in context instead of ingesting parts that appeals or are easy to understand.</div>
