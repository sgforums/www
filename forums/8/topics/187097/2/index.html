            <div class='col-md body'>Yep, I have sleep paralysis many times!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Many of my experiences occurs during exam period where stress level is high  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> Till one day, I decided to sleep only for a bit every day (like 4hrs) because it is really terrifying! Something like near death experience (I couldn't breath properly during many of the attacks)<br><br>Anyway, my most memorable one is me seeing a ghost with her messy hair drape over (something like sadako)..she was pointing fingers at a direction and it was scary!! The feelings at that time was really overwhelming that I wanted to scream but I couldn't. I heard that to counter sleep paralysis, you have to sleep on your stomach or get older (younger gets it more often).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: violet;">I posted the same topic some time ago...<a href="http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=155977" rel="nofollow">http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=155977</a><br><br>anyway, I get it alot of times, like about 2 times every 1 - 2 weeks? *sigh* after awhile you get used to it, and you know what to do what it happens to you. you can even feel it coming before you fall into sleep paralysis mode.<br><br>All these "things" you see, feel or hear, I believe is all made up in your mind.<br><br>I never had the "sitting on chest" thing, but there were some times where I woke up, paralyzed, and I had difficulty breathing.<br><br>Apart from that, everytime I fall into sleep paralysis, my entire body seems to just shake. I just see everything shaking, and I feel as if my entire body is shaking vigarously.<br><br>A few times I've also experienced hearing distorted sounds. I once heard this annoying clicking sound, as well as this awful monster roaring. Turns out that the clicking sound was the timer of my fan (like those on your oven), and the "monster" was the engine of a SBS bus passing by.<br><br>I also imagine seeing things sometimes, and they are VERY real. Sometimes I see random stuff (like all those wavey stuff on the windows media player), or at times I imagine that I have already woken up from sleep paralysis, only to wake up for real a few seconds later and realizing that was fake.<br><br>So far the scariest thing that has ever happened to me up till today, once when one night I stayed up really late, and as I was walking to my room I told myself that I knew I was going to have sleep paralysis. And guess what? It did, and it was bloody scary. I woke up, only to see a ghost about 5 metres floating towards me, and of all the days, I was sleeping alone that night (I usually sleep together with my siblings). Can you imagine what it's like? Seeing a ghost that you believe is real coming towards you, and you can't move? Anyway, after I woke up I took my pillow and blanket and ran into my parent's room to sleep. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>That's about all the stuff I experienced, although both my sisters and my mum get sleep paralysis too. Apparently my sister experiences the out-of-body-experience, where she kinda "floats" out and sees her body below.<br><br>How to wake up from it? Usually I try to muster all my strength together just to move my wrist about 10 - 20cm. I usually wake up after that.<br><br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>has anyone who experienced sleep paralysis been affected physically (get hit, attacked) by the shadow entity before? i hear that the shadow entity is the manifestation of FEAR itself during sleep paralysis that almost every sufferer sees or feels or hears, it is dark, faceless, tall as a man and never speaks, sometimes it hides in a corner watching u, sometimes it holds your shoulders down, sometimes it sits on you, sometimes it stands behind u, looking down into your eyes, sometimes its hanging on the ceiling, sometimes its standing by your bed...</div>
