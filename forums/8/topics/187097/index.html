            <div class='col-md body'>Sleep Paralysis: When the mind wakes up before the body does, we find ourselves unable to move, but feel a terrible fear within us. We sometimes see creatures from our dreams in our rooms, or feel a crushing weight on our chests (once thought to be succubi), or feel a malevolent presence beside us. I have experienced sleep paralysis once a few months ago and it was really scary. I heard a flute being played, a creepy tune, at 1am in the morning on a saturday. Then, I heard scuttling sounds, like footsteps beside me and I felt terrible fear, so afraid was I that I tried to scream to force myself to wake up, but I couldn't because I was already awake. I endured this for a few minutes before my body could move but by then I was already trembling and shivering with fright...<br><br>Anyone of you experienced this anytime in your life?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>since sleep paralysis occurs while the body is asleep and the mind is awake (you are conscious), then i have a sure-win method of inducing sleep paralysis. allow yourself to focus on a significant object while your eyes are closed and try to be as relaxed as possible while u are still focused. you'll feel yourself sinking as if your muscles are going numb. this is a sign of your body going into sleep. now, if you are still focusing on that object in your mind, you'll soon feel as if you are falling into a black, bottomless pit and moments later you'll hear strange sounds around u or realize you are unable to move, except your eyes can open and close and u can look around, but the rest of your body is asleep and frozen. nightmares can then enter the real world but cannot affect u physically, but u can see demons and angels or ghosts or a dark shadow entity that causes extreme fear in everyone who has seen it. this dark shadow entity is the 'evil side of man' that takes on the form of a faceless man during sleep paralysis.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>here is a recount by someone who has experienced sleep paralysis:<br><br>i woke up and became aware of a shadowy figure sat on my brothers bed with what looked like spikey hair.<br>my best friend at the time was a chinese guy (we were 17) called richard leunge, who had spikey hair. i thought it was rich so i said<br>'alright leungy?' and there was no reply it just looked at me (its face was featureless apart from red eyes, but it had 3d depth).<br>i remember thinking, 'why has leungy got red eyes' and being very puzzled but at this point i wasnt scared.<br>i asked again 'alright leungy?' and agin no reply.<br>at this point i thought 'i must've done something to wind him up' and said 'look leungy, have i done something to annoy you?' again no reply.<br>i then got up walked towards it saying 'look leungy, if ive done something wrong please tell me so i can put it right'<br>as i reached the shadow it stood up and grew in heght from 5'7"ish to 6'4/5" in front of me and its hair became spikier.<br>at theis point i became very very scared and i was suddenly paralysed.<br>it then thrust its sharp long boney fingers into my abdomen, and proceeded to pull my intestines out.<br>i could do nothing but scream in pain. it felt terrible and i was powerless to stop it. at one point the shadow had a small rack that it was winding my intestines onto.<br>i woke up after what seemed like an hour of this torture absolutly sh**ting it!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if you sleep with your arm stretched out straight and touching the floor, you are more liking to get sleep paralysis<br><br>Little is known about the physiology of sleep paralysis. However, some have suggested that it may be linked to post-synaptic inhibition of motor neurons in the pons region of the brain. In particular, low levels of melatonin may stop the depolarization current in the nerves, which prevents the stimulation of the muscles.<br><br>There is also a significant positive correlation between those experiencing this disorder frequently and those suffering from narcolepsy. However, various studies suggest that many or most people will experience sleep paralysis at least once or twice in their lives.<br><br>Some report that various factors increase the likelihood of both paralysis and hallucinations.<br><br>These include:<br><br>Sleeping in a supine position (facing upwards)<br><br>Irregular sleeping schedules; naps, sleeping in, sleep deprivation<br><br>Increased stress<br><br>Sudden environmental/lifestyle changes<br><br>A lucid dream that immediately precedes the episode<br><br>Medium to long-term imagining of involuntary movements with your eyes closed before sleep.<br><br>wikipedia.org<br><br></div>
