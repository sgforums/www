Women shopping happens once every 4 days and it lasts forever.<br><br>3) 70% knows nothing. They can't tell Michael owen from Owen Wilson<br><br>4) 15% now something. They can tell Michael Owen from Owen Wilson, but only because they think both are "cute"<br><br>5) 10% think they know something. they can tell you that Michael Owen is an English striker and will try to recite a few statisticss. But does he fits into the England formation, and should be played as a lone striker against Sweden? "Uh...... don't know"<br><br>6) 5% knows everything. but they don't know who Owen Wison is (He's a Hollywood actor lah)<br><br>7) Women should stop acting as if they know the game when they are insterested only in the player's abs.</span><br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Talk back<br>Do you agree with Teo Cheng Wee that women should just keep quiet when it comes to football?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br></div>
