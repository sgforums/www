            <div class='col-md body'>DO YOU THINK OUR GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO SPEND 65 MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY?<br><br>***<br><br>World Cup: How Norway did it<br><br>Annual budget of $65 million<br>Build 50 soccer pitches yearly<br>Catch them from age of six<br>By G. Sivakkumaran<br><br>HAVE a budget of $65 million a year, build 50 football pitches annually, and reach out to children from the time they are six.<br><br><img src="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-01-28/28sports.jpg"><br>When in Singapore, do what Singaporean Chinese do. The Norwegian team joined their hosts in tossing yusheng for good luck yesterday. Later, they trained in the downpour (below) in preparation for tonight's game against the Lions. -- WONG KWAI CHOW<br><br>That is Norway's model for youth development, which reinvigorated football in the Nordic country and helped them reach the World Cup Finals in 1994 - 10 years after their plan was first cemented.<br><br>As Singapore go into the fourth year of a 10-year project to reach the 2010 World Cup, it would be timely to ask: Is there a lesson to be learnt from Norway?<br><br>Speaking to Timesport, the Norwegian Football Association's (NFF) president Per Ravn Omdal said his country's World Cup dreams started in 1983, following Norway's 2-1 defeat of England in a 1981 Oslo friendly.<br><br>'That showed we could make it to the top too,' said Omdal, the NFF boss for the past 13 years.<br><br>'So we started a plan in 1983 for our team to be in the world's top 25 and qualify for the World Cup.'<br><br>The Norwegian project had an uncanny resemblance to Singapore's Goal 2010, so why has Norway made it while Singapore's own plan seems to be floundering, especially as both countries have similar-sized populations - Singapore with 3.4 million people and Norway with 4.5 million?<br><br>The difference, perhaps, lies in the effort, money and location.<br><br>The NFF's annual budget is around $65 million, while the Football Association of Singapore's is about $7 million.<br><br>While the FAS started a professional league and tried to work downwards, the NFF did the opposite.<br><br>As Omdal put it: 'We had to get the basics right first.'<br><br><img src="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-01-28/s6c.jpg"><br>MILESTONES<br>1902 Norwegian FA founded.<br><br>1936 Their only medal in an international championship, bronze at the Olympics in Germany<br><br>1938 Their first World Cup<br><br>1981 Beat England 2-1 in a friendly in Oslo - turning point for football<br><br>1983 Start plan to be in world's top 25 and reach World Cup Finals<br><br>1992 Bronze at Euro Youth C'ship<br><br>1994 USA '94 - Group stage<br><br>1997 Qualified for 1998 World Cup<br><br>1998 Lost 0-1 to Italy in 2nd round<br><br>2000 First time in European Championship final rounds<br><br>2003 Failed to qualify for Euro 2004 after play-off loss to Spain<br><br>To give Norwegian children opportunities to play football, the NFF created clubs in every neighbourhood for children to join from the age of six.<br><br>These clubs were affiliated compulsorily to Norway's league teams, which in turn built a wider talent base that now numbers about 350,000 players at every level.<br><br>The NFF also built 50 artificial and grass pitches every year to give footballers of every level the space to train and play.<br><br>The clubs also did their bit.<br><br>As Age Hareide, who was head coach of champions Rosenborg before becoming Norway's national coach last month, pointed out: 'At the club level, there are Under-12, U-14, U-16, U-18 and U-21 teams, so there is a natural progression for the younger players.'<br><br>Norwegian stars like Manchester United's Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Liverpool's John Arne Riise started at modest clubs before hitting the big time.<br><br>Another case in point is Harald Martin Brattbakk, 33, who started at Rosenborg before joining Scotland's Celtic.<br><br>The striker, now back with Rosenborg, told Timesport: 'Without a proper structure at youth level, we would not have been able to make it up the ladder.<br><br>'Every young boy has a chance to play football in Norway, that's the key for us.'<br><br>With players like him, the nation began to make an impact, starting with third spot in the 1992 European Youth Championship.<br><br>By 1994, they reached their first World Cup since 1938, though they were knocked out in the first round on goal difference.<br><br>Four years later in France, they sensationally upset holders Brazil 2-1 to qualify for the second round, where they lost 0-1 to Italy.<br><br>'Against all odds, we beat the best country in the world. That was a fantastic achievement for a tiny country from Europe,' said Omdal.<br><br>Since then, however, Norway have failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup, and did not make it to Euro 2004 after losing to Spain in the play-offs.<br><br>'Football is cyclical,' added Omdal, 'and frankly, I feel now is the time that we are on the up again.'<br><br>So what are the lessons for Singapore?<br><br>Omdal, diplomatically, said different cultures suggest that what would work in one country may not work elsewhere.<br><br>Still, he pointed out: 'We succeeded because our plans were simple: promote grassroots football, provide facilities, and make sure everyone works together.<br><br>'You do need the money to succeed. But if you don't have the three things I just mentioned - and the will to succeed - no amount of money can help you.'</div>
