Ya, rich kids!  They are so lucky, but I won't say that for their parents.

If there is one person like that, I will feel damn sorry for him of course.  But not that many this kind of case lah.  And also, these ppl will already have their sickness diagnosed long before and seeing the doc is just to get the paper.  This is different from seeing the doctor to diagnose new problem.<br><br>What I mean by seeing several doc is consulting them to diagnose new unheard of problems before enlistment.  If the person is genuinely doing is for health sake, it is ok, cuz we never know what existing sickness we may have and not discovered.  But if the person is really concerned about his health, why wait until enlistment?  They should do it much earlier so that they can receive treatments.<br><br>But of course you may think what if the person only suspect he's ill just before enlistment.  Then I will say how often do you find such coincident timing.  I dun mean there isn't.  But really there isn't many.<br><br><blockquote>As for defering, thats silly.

They are just making use of the school to get deferment letter.<br><br>But some courses require minimum attendance, or else will flunk and get kicked it.  So these boys will drag their butt to the school just to fill up the minimum attendance (eg. if they are required to attend 8 out of 12 lesson for each subject, they will attend only 8 lessons and then disappear or go on MC).<br><br>For those who use private A level course, A level allows retaking if you fail.<br>So those boys will flunk their A level again and again (I dunno whether there is a limit to the no. of retakes).  They will either purposely fail to siam NS, or really cannot pass the exam (cuz they are interested in studies in the first place).<br><br>In summary, not all ppl sign up for courses to further their education.  And those examples that I listed, I am not talking about those who honestly/genuinely want to study.  I am mainly talking about those dishonest ones who use school enrolment to delay going into NS.  And yes, they are silly and stupid.  This is just self deception cuz ultimately they still have to head to NS.  But even if they know they are being stupid, they will choose to do that.  To them, siam for two or three years is better than none.<br><br>All these cowards are the product of good life in Singapore and parents' pampering.<br><br>I have to use the word coward cuz I really mean it.<br>I dun think any woman with the right frame of mind will want to marry such guys.  You see... if the guy is so afraid to face the training which only last for two years, how to expect him to care for and protect me?  If anything happens, he will hide under my sleeve maybe.<br><br>And yes, many girls do look down on such guys.  It's just like guys dun like it when girls only want to stay at home, shake leg and count on the husbands instead of making themselves useful to the society just because they find working too stressful ( this I got from a group of married colleagues complaining to me ).</div>

I dun mean these other groups of ppl are stupid.  But they are lacking this certain streetwise factor and maturity.  I especially notice the difference during tutorials when they talk (you know lah.. tutorials always must present this present that).  The postORD ones tend to be more resourceful and handle things well, while the others tend to be a bit clumsy and lack confidence.  I see the same thing in other places like in church, among my friends etc.<br><br>*Note : my definition of Post ORD in my example refers to those who went thru tough training... not those who serve in pes C, D, E as clerk.</div>
