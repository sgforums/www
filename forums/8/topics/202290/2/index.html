I've always believed that if you migrate somewhere and are granted citizenship, the very least you could do is to give back a little to that community.</div>

It depends on how an individual handles it.<br><br>You could be pretty bitter about it, adopt a heck care attitude and just avoid all responsibilities, arrows, duties etc. Generally you become invisible until the day you ORD aka "Serve and f*** off".

Instead of letting it get to you, you could use it as a motivating factor to do well in the future and avoid getting a job in the government sector. Or if you genuinely want to serve the country, work towards getting into a position where you make a change.<br><br>I was in the former group and after I orded I wished I was the latter.</div>
