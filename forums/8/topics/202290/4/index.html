Cuz no guys in that branch office and I was the only one young enough to carrying those goods.<br><br>But of course, it's nothing compared to what guys go thru lah... running &amp; exercising every morning, every afternoon, every evening...Even just before lunch also have to do chin up.  HEHEhe<br><br>I dunno how the girls you see in Uni perform in their studies.  Maybe the passion in the studies is still there since they enter straight from A level.  That's why you see them studying better than the guys.<br><br>But being in poly before and having classmates who are post ORD and some before enlistments. I somehow see a certain streetwise factor in them, which I dun see in the girls (no offence to girls cuz I am charbo also), the boys who are not enlisted yet and those who serve in NS admin side.  I dun mean these other groups of ppl are stupid.  But they are lacking this certain streetwise factor and maturity.  I especially notice the difference during tutorials when they talk (you know lah.. tutorials always must present this present that).  The postORD ones tend to be more resourceful and handle things well, while the others tend to be a bit clumsy and lack confidence.  I see the same thing in other places like in church, among my friends etc.<br><br>*Note : my definition of Post ORD in my example refers to those who went thru tough training... not those who serve in pes C, D, E as clerk.</div></blockquote>It got nothing to do with army,it just that the guys are older.<br>In fact in NS we are more childish,everyday in camp playing with pillows,cut grasses,playing with fishes,pull my friends pants,etc Doing nothing at all waiting for time to come then go running train go back bunkthan eat continue playing with fishes</div>

Spent three years slogging in some american firm, before I decided that I need minimumly a degree to go to a managerial position in this firm (of course also subject to my performance).  So I quit and used my saving to do a degree in USA.<br><br>Frankly, I don't remember having problem going back to student life.  In fact, I studied better and managed my time and priorities well, lived a disciplined &amp; organised life at the campus hostel.  Maybe I should be thankful to the stress &amp; heavy workloads I've been thru in the american firm.  I got good GPA in the end (when I didn't perform this well during my poly days).<br><br>Maybe I'm just a one off case.  Or maybe I am just lucky.<br></div></blockquote>Its very very difficult to find the momentum after 2.5 years break from studies, at least it is for me and my friends. During my 1st year, I got a C average  because I have completely lost touch with the subjects and studying skills that I have used during my JC years.<br><br>Most importantly, its because I still brought over that slacker mentality that I am used to having during NS. It took the remaining 3 years just for me and my friends to catch up and to change that mindset. Thats the main difference between your previous american firm and NS. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Granted there are those who can quickly find the momentum but then there is a huge number of guys like me as well.</div>
