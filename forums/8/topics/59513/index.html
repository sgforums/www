            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there,<br><br>I know that I've agreed not to "disturb" you anymore, but I feel that I must have this opportunity for, some sort of "closure" on my part. Since I've already acted on my part and now have no means of contacting you, or rather, I'm resisting the urge to give you a call, I'm resorting to using the forums. Hope you do read this.<br><br>As I've already mentioned, as per my agreement, I've cleared all means of which I can contact you by. I hope you have done the same too, for what is the use of having in your phone, a number which you would not call?<br><br>I know that through these 4 years, I have not been as good as I could have been, as can evidently be seen by your posts in this forum prior to 2001. I did make mistakes, and didn't cherish you as much as I could. I realized it eventually and strove to improve our relationship. And I'm sure now when you look back you'd see that too. This past year or so, I thought that we enjoyed the greatest of bonds together, I thought our love would never die. But without warning, I suddenly meant nothing more than a stranger on the streets to you. I just could not understand why.<br><br>These 2 months, I had been hoping and praying, that somehow I was wrong, that you still cared for me. I thought that by having the space that you needed, by not being tied down, that you would somehow remember and realize the feelings we had in the past. That you could still see the strong emotional bond we had. I could, and I still feel the same for you. However I've finally found out the truth that the same could not be said of you.<br><br>It is impossible to be able to forget about someone who had shared 4 years of your life in a short span of 2 months. It is evidently so that you had forgotten me more than half a year back. Even though physically you were beside me, you were not. I can only say with regret that it took me more than half a year to realize that. And even up til now, I'm still wishing it wasn't so.<br><br>Now I finally realize my fears. But it seems already too late for that. For I now know my mediocrity in your eyes. After 4 years, the only thing I that can be said of me was that I am a knowledgeable person. You remember nothing of my touch, my words, the songs I played and sang for you on the guitar, the warmth I gave to you.<br><br>So now, I promise you, after this, I will never call you, email you or interfere in your life ever again. It will be terribly hard for me but I will keep my promise. You do not need me to be in your life anymore, and I will respect that. This will be the last time I am visiting this forums to catch a glimpse of what is going on in your life.<br><br>However I still will hope and pray. That one day I'd receive that call from you. It would really mean alot to me if you really did dial my number from memory, and not by my name in your phonebook. The words you said to me so long ago still echoes in my mind. And although I have proclaimed them to be nothing more than a lie, in my heart I still hope that it's true somehow. That somehow I really am the one for you as you said. That somehow, you still believe in those words you said yourself.<br><br>Until that day comes, I wish you all the best in your career, your family, your life. If in the event that you do get attached to someone anytime, I wish to say all the best and may that relationship not end as ours did.<br><br>Maybe one day, I'd be proven wrong. Maybe one day you'll call. Or maybe it's possible that by this time, you already do not know who I am. Whatever the case, just know this, that someone whom you knew 4 years ago, is waiting for a call.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">But then a farewell thou didst give<br>Without warning, without a say<br>And know I did I cannot live<br>My life did end that very day</span><br><br>- JustJoe</div>
