            <div class='col-md body'>ST Forum 7 Nov 2006<br><br>MY MOTHER-IN-LAW was referred to Singapore General Hospital in March for nerve problems.<br>After a scan and x-ray she was given a follow-up appointment in May.<br><br>The doctor told her that it was the pinching of nerves and nothing much could be done at that stage to treat her.<br><br>We were told that she could call to make an appointment if her condition worsened within two years.<br><br>Recently she complained of a tingling sensation in her left hand. About two weeks ago, I called the hospital and was given an appointment on Dec 20.<br><br>Since then I had called the hospital thrice to get an earlier appointment in case another patient cancelled his. I had no luck in this.<br><br>On Oct 31, my mother-in-law complained of numbness in her index finger. On Nov 1, I called the clinic again and was told the next available appointment was on Dec 27.<br><br>And if I couldn't wait until then I should take her to the A&amp;E department despite my plea that it would not be able to do much except to refer me back to relevant doctor.<br><br>I had no choice but to proceed to the A&amp;E department, a place where I thought we should go to only in an emergency.<br><br>True enough, the doctor there told me that my mother-in-law should see her specialist again.<br><br>Her condition is not so severe that it requires immediate attention but then it cannot be ignored for too long.<br><br>I was at the hospital by 10.15am and left at 11.45am. Total cost: $80. The diagnosis : Refer patient back to her doctor in two weeks on Nov 16.<br><br>My questions to the relevant authorities are:<br><br>1. Do I have to go on a merry- go-round just to get an earlier appointment?<br><br>2. Do I have to spend $80 for this?<br><br>3. Spend an hour and a half to do this?<br><br>4. Doesn't this contradict all that had been said and done to free our Accidents and Emergency department for precisely what the name specifies?<br><br>Please help me as I am quite disillusioned.<br><br>Balbinder Kaur (Mdm)<br><br><span style="color: red;">I thought somebody mentioned that this will not happen in Singapore?</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, i don't mind if they charge me a nominal fee or something if they can do something about, say, my case where extreme pain from a slipped disc or the pain in the case of a trapped nerve (i've suffered that before too.. it's not funny how painful and nauseating the feeling is)<br><br>but it's ludicrous to tell a person who is in so much extreme pain that he cannot even sit down that he has to wait 3 months to be treated after being referred everywhere and nothing can be done...<br><br>for cases like the trapped nerve and slipped disc, no doctor will do anything because there is potential for severe and worse damage if they do something wrong so they are forced to refer the matter to the specialists..<br><br>unfortunately, you can't blame the specialists too.. they are swamped with patients and can barely cope with the load...<br><br>maybe the "medical hub" bit is for the "elite".. those who can afford a king's ransom in order to be treated immediately, those who can walk into a place like Gleneagles...<br><br>however, how many of us working hacks can?<br><br>i'd be bankrupted if i went to Gleneagles for treatment for my back problem...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if you think your condition is serious, just go to a&amp;e. i found out (the hard way) that being admitted means every test to be done is faster. as long u got insurance cover, just go for a b2 plus or b1 ward and your medical problem looked at.<br><br>if you leave it to outpatient, it would take eons for anything to be done. btw, you can actually request to talk to your doc over the phone. i have done that a few times with my specialist (they gave me the wrong meds and i nearly got admitted again <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ). Just tell them wat you wan, usually they are ok.</div>
