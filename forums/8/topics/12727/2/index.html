Well...all I can say it's terrible going near there and the worst is the spot they smoke at is near the toilet cos it's the only place that is open-air. And inside the toilet also can smell the second-hand smoke. Sigh...I how see also think that I'm a short life person...three years in my current school...cut short my life by another three more years ah.</div>
