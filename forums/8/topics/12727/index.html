How about the times, when everyone is asleep at the chalet and you out for a walk thinking about your past few years wasted? There's no one to be wif you, only your ciggie. Give smokers some credit. We dun smoke to irritate, we smoke ro find comfort. Blame it on the wind for carrying the smoke to your face... i try to blow away all the time.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Next time, you see a smoker, think about why he/she smokes... maybe got sad history... i know i have...<br><br></div></blockquote>give smokers some credit? what ever for? you may not see the smoke, you may try to blow it away but will it disaapear. That is childish thinking that a simple puff will blow things away. <strong>PUN intended</strong> The chemicals and pollutants remain the air , then drift into the atmosphere. With many smokers and the amount of cigarettes they consume, they are like smoke stacks patrolling the environment. dID YOU KNOW THAT<br><br>2ND HAND SMOKE is more dangerous than the 1st hand smoke. if you dun believe, next time when you smoke, bring a mask or a fishbowl along, when you take a puff, breathe the smoke back into your lungs instead of inhaling it back into the air. see how it feels plus smells.<br><br>On the other hand, you may say it is way of occupying the time, but seriously can't you find something else to do with your life. Do you know how much you can save??<br><br>It is just a VERY lame excuse to deny that you have an addiction and continue puffing away. But since you are alreadi on it fer so long, you may continue, so we non-smokers can see less of you.<br><br>------------------<br><strong>I consider myself an Expert tomato gardener since all of my friends tell me I have the most colourful and sweetest tomatoes.<br><br>"Life is too short to bother with tasteless tomatoes."<br></strong></div>
