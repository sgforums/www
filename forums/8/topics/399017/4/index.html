              No money, no honey, no marry is true. 
              
              Then again, got money what for marry is also true!
              
              Times have changed. The way the government is courting foreigners at the expense of Singaporeans being neglected and left to fend for ourselves, you think we are going to care about Singapore's future if they are not going to even care for us now? No present, how to have future?
              
              Sharing of weal and woe, till death do us part..... has become a myth like "... and they live happily ever after"........... What commitment.... it's every man for himself these days - survival of the fittest!

              <p>Skyline63 has this to say 5 years back:</p>
              <p>Who is blaming the Singapore woman for high standard ?<br> <br> No one is ! It's their choice. But why not get something when you
                                      are young ? In your 30. Right time for marriage and get it done.
                                      Not until 45++ go to vietnam find wife. Then shame by the public
                                      for "BUYING WIFE". No feeling or love. Why not get a foriegn wife
                                      like most of friends did ! And they all do it at the age of 28 to
                                      32 years old. Nobody can say anything about that ! Get it done and
                                      forget about upgrading at that age of 28 to 32. Do it after
                                      marriage !<br> <br> Your upgrading can do it after marriage. After marriage, you still
                                      can take part-time course. Still can work hard. Still can do more
                                      Overtime. Still can study a degree. Still can do a lot of thing.
                                      Who say you must do it b4 marriage and cannot do it after marriage
                                      ?<br> <br> If Singapore woman prefer to buy instant successful man calling man
                                      to upgrade themselves. Until they get the status then Singapore
                                      woman willingly to get married.<br> <br> What make the differents between Vietnam woman and Singapore woman
                                      ?<br> Same ! Both want money. So......... Singapore woman like that call
                                      more class ?</p>

              <p><br>i agree, but its very few. darei tell you even those not pretty ones also behave the same. you just treat them a little good only they swamp over like tio 4d toto. what i want to see is tehm w/o makeup. i see them everyday and i like them  the rest no need to say. makeup can only not only enhance, but they can also spoil.</p>
              <p>cameralla is just a tool, just like paintbrushes and airbrushed. but alas the technology in a camera is more advance and complicated than what an average human being can do with the bare hands, film or digital, chemical or electronics or mechanice. the technologgy in an airbrusg is only precision pnuematics and just like the hand it needs some practise and gift to be a good artist. A camera can do most of the work in capturing features and colors unlike an artiste who has to create it with bare hands.</p>
              <p>makeup has it own uses too. not knowingly to many besides special effects how do you think they create a ghost of dead walking corpse iin movies? its makeup. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>From a guy's perspective, seriously do you really want to marry a girl who thinks like that?</p>
              <p>I've an cousin who is in his late thirties, he looks good, drive a merces, lives in a condo, have a stable career in temasek holding (quite high position too), but he go marry a vietnamese instead.</p>
              <p>I've seen girls who make it their goal in life to find someone rich, so they can live in a good house, have no worries in life etc but they end up having divorce(when their husband go bankrupt, business failed)(rich husband find mistress) etc, or end up being mistress themselves and get ditched.</p>
              <p>I've also know a lady who have a normal marriage with a poor husband, and together they craft up a career, her husband is now the boss of a few trading companies and she's rich now.</p>
              <p>Wat i can say is there's truely ironies in life.</p>

              <p>You are right in a sense but Vietnam has 84+ million people. All of them lie, greedy &amp; rude? I dont think so.</p>
              <p>For 1 to marry a Vietnamese girl, its good to fly there &amp; understand their cultures, lifestyles, etc, alothough a bit similar to Chinese customs.</p>
