This chinaman deserves the public shaming. He's been going around undetected, getting people to add him on MSN and then insulting and harressing them on MSN. If you do not recognise it when people are doing us a service, the least u could to is to keep quiet about it. And if u're just letting your unfair biasedness against Xinyi to cloud the issue, u should also keep quiet about it. Its not hard to see that u're clouded on the issue already, just seeing how u simply ASSUME Trendz is Xinyi.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
