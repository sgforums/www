            <div class='col-md body'>though i'm a fan of the morning express, there's something i find irritating about glenn ong...it's his constant raving about his "baby" jamie yeo...we know that she's pretty, young and sexy and all, but i dunno why he keeps mentioning his wife during the morning express...if you do not know, he was once married to Kate Reyes quite sometime back, they were both on perfect ten then, and why is it that he didn't mention anything about kate during his shows? was it because she wasn't as pretty and sexy as jamie?<br><br>and before glenn married jamie, FD and rod were teasing him all the time about him not having the experience of being married, i have no idea why they are doing that, probably trying to hide the fact that glenn was divorced...<br><br>i wonder how kate feels everytime glenn mentions his "baby" or prethtends that this is his first time getting married...sometimes, i feel like calling him up and asking him how's kate coping...i probably won't get thru, and even if i did, they probably won't air the conversation...</div>
