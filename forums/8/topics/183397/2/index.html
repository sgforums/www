            <div class='col-md body'>I understand why you feel put off by Glen's actions.  However IMO your arguments are based on speculation.  Nobody knows what happened in the marriages.  We're strangers!  What we learn from the media is hardly enough to make judgements.<br><br>Another point I strongly believe is that everyone has a right to celebrate "Seconds".  Even if we assume Glen screwed up in his first marriage, he still deserves to be happy in his next.  He has a right to be proud of it and celebrate it if it is working out.  One cannot carry the burden and guilt of a past failure his whole life.<br><br>And lastly, IF Kate were really hurt by Glen's "insensitive" remarks..... then I think she has issues that should be resolved.  She can't go through life with everyone pus<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>syfooting around her failed marriage.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Schwing:</div><div class="quote_body">imagine you in her shoes...years have passed and you've moved on...then one day, you tune in to the radio and hears your ex husband ranting and raving about his new wife...almost everyday...and you start to think..."why didn't he do that when we were married?"
