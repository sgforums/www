            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by ilovethesun:<br><strong>Hi guys.. I just so frastrated with my experience shopping at OG Orchard Point yesterday. Typed an extra long complain.. yea.. its reali long..<br><br>Here it goes:<br><br>for a minimal amount spent within the mall within the same day, they would be entitled the free 1st hour parking.<br><br>Orchard point parking management have been practicing manual redemption coupons.Sometimes an attendant  at the entrance will be there giving out the coupons, sometimes on other storeys , sometimes no luck. So you can see there are many ways to obtainin the coupon from him.<br>But as long as you purchased the valued amount  , it was never a problem to claim the redemption.<br><br>Yesterday,  I left my vehicle there as usual, and this time no carpark attendant there. Problem came when I was making my purchase. The cashier rejected my redemption for parking fee when I said I did not receive any on my way in. She then aptly informed me that in that case its too bad, I will not be able make any redemptions. I was taken by surprise and she said that, with effect from 1st of Feb, no redemptions can be made without the coupon, which is no longer distributed by the attendant and instead, manually ticketed at the carpark entrance.<br><br>I had no idea that I have to manually obtain the coupon and of this new change of implementation and itÂ’s the 1st time I  patronized the mall since then. much more noticing the small signage that was painstakingly placed at the side of the entrance. How can they penalize me for that? And no matter what, they just refuse to accept my situation.<br><br>"There was a signage at the side of the carpark entrance, clearly stating this." I told her i realy din see it, besides OG was practicing ticketless cashcard parking system and it is not unusual not to observe such nitty gritty signage at the side!<br><br>She then shrugged insisting still , that I cannot claim my entitlement despite my purchase. She phoned her assistant supervisor and urged her (in harsh Chinese) to come quicky because there was a customer making a racket demanding for a redemption.<br><br>Unbelivable! As a customer service staff, she not only branded me in public, disregarding my presence and accused me of demanding for redemption. She then volunteered her name to me, in a bait to dare me to complain about her. This service attitude??<br><br>IsnÂ’t the parking redemption is the shopperÂ’s entitlement with courtesy from the management to shop at their mall? Why is it that now it became demanding for? And the shopper became a unreasonable pest?<br><br>By then, the issue is no longer with the $1.20 worth of parking redemption.<br>===================================================<br><br>The asst sup came. I was hoping for more authority to be able to resolve this issue in a better way. However, she  basically  came to tell me the exact same thing the cashier said earlier. I repeated myself again.<br>Then, I was referred fr the cashier -&gt; asst supervisor -&gt; supervisor.<br><br>ANd all I get from OG management is Â“ From 1st Feb onwards, , no redemption can be done for shoppers who park at orchard point without the redemption ticket which have to be manually ticketed.Â”<br><br>The sup confidently and  easily suggested the only way out for me is to write in a feedback to the management.<br>[b]Is that how OGÂ’s customer service is ALL about?  When there is a dispute, the shopper have to Write in ? IsnÂ’t there much talk about going the extra mile in customer service? </strong><br><br>I left my contact as she promised speak  to "higher management" regarding my issue.<br><br>The next day, customer service manager called. Finally relieved that they did address this issue promptly. but the end of the conversation made me even more frustrated and helpless.<br><br>He politely put it across to say that he is unable to accede to my request of parking fee redemption, and explained that there is a signage XXXXÂ…Â…<strong>and </strong>the whole explanation repeats again.<br><br>I wish to re-emphasize the issue now is not about the $1.20 worth of parking redemption , but the competency of the customer service standard in OG Orchard Point.<br><br><strong>Did the SUp address the issue by getting the manager tell me the same thing as I was told more than 10 times the day before? </strong> I told him that it was not justifiable to penalize the shopper of the redemption for not knowing the inefficient policy recently imposed. He just kept silent.. Yes.. silent for a whole 30 seconds! So whatever comments and questions i posed to him , were answered in silence..<br><br>Why does he need to call me again the nexr day when he has NO solution for me at all?<br>Is it because they felt that I need to be educated again about their new policy?<br><br>There is no use speaking to higher level of authority because they just side and trying to shield each other . ItÂ’s dis-privileged to be a shopper at OG Orchard Point as there is no point making yourself heard. Because Nobody cares.<br><strong>Looks like patrons have to learn it the hard way before being able to redeem the $1.20 parking fee from OG Orchard Point, that is entitled only After making purchase in their Mall. </strong><br><br>Thanks for reading my plight. And lesson learnt from my experience. Remeber to press the ticket button before entering the carpark.<br>[/b]</blockquote>Then how do you want them to tell you that there is a change in policy? Phone every single customer? Anounce maybe for 3 months for shoppers like you who hasnt patronized the mall for a while?<br><br>Wake up man.</div>
