            <div class='col-md body'>Amidst the morning mist of the swift returning tide<br>I set out on my daily run, my walkman on my side.<br>Lost within my private world apart from cares and woes<br>I ran along the moistened shore, the sand between my toes.<br><br>In the distance, I saw a boy, as busy as can be.<br>He was running, stooping, picking up, and tossing in the sea.<br>Just what he threw, I couldn't tell, I looked as I drew near.<br>It seemed to be a rock or shell - as I approached him I could hear:<br><br>"Back you go, where you belong. Your safe now hurry home.<br>Your family's waiting for you little starfish, hurry on!"<br>It seemed the evening tide had washed the starfish on the shore,<br>And the swift receding water left a thousand there or more.<br><br>And this self-appointed savior, was trying one-by-one<br>To toss them back into the sea, against the racing sun.<br>I saw his plight was hopeless, that most of them would die.<br>I called out from my private world, "Hey Kid, why even try?"<br><br>"Must be at least a thousand here, strewn along the beach,<br>And even if you had the time, most you'll never reach.<br>You really think it makes a difference, to waste your time this way?"<br>And then I paused and waited, just to hear what he would say.<br><br>He stooped and took another, and looked me in the eye.<br>"It makes a difference to this one sir, this starfish will not die!"<br>With that, he tossed the little life, back where there was hope.<br>He stooped to take another. I could tell this was no joke.<br><br>The words that he spoke to me cut like a surgeon's knife.<br>Where I saw only numbers, he saw only life.<br>He didn't see the multitude of starfish on the sand.<br>He only saw the little life he held there in his hand.<br><br>He didn't stop to argue, to prove that he was right.<br>He just kept tossing starfish in the sea with all his might.<br>So I too stooped, and I picked up, and I tossed into the sea,<br>And I thought, just what a difference, that this boy has made in me.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One day a fisherman was lying on a beautiful beach, with his fishing pole propped up in the sand and his solitary line cast out into the sparkling blue surf. He was enjoying the warmth of the afternoon sun and the prospect of catching a fish.<br><br>About that time, a businessman came walking down the beach, trying to relieve some of the stress of his workday. He noticed the fisherman sitting on the beach and decided to find out why this fisherman was fishing instead of working harder to make a living for himself and his family. "You aren't going to catch many fish that way," said the businessman to the fisherman. "You should be working rather than lying on the beach!"<br><br>The fisherman looked up at the businessman, smiled and replied, "And what will my reward be?" "Well, you can get bigger nets and catch more fish!" was the businessman's answer. "And then what will my reward be?" asked the fisherman, still smiling. The businessman replied, "You will make money and you'll be able to buy a boat, which will then result in larger catches of fish!" "And then what will my reward be?" asked the fisherman again. The businessman was beginning to get a little irritated with the fisherman's questions. "You can buy a bigger boat, and hire some people to work for you!" he said.<br><br>"And then what will my reward be?" repeated the fisherman. The businessman was getting angry. "Don't you understand? You can build up a fleet of fishing boats, sail all over the world, and let all your employees catch fish for you!" Once again the fisherman asked, "And then what will my reward be?" The businessman was red with rage and shouted at the fisherman, "Don't you understand that you can become so rich that you will never have to work for your living again! You can spend all the rest of your days sitting on this beach, looking at the sunset. You won't have a care in the world!"<br><br>The fisherman, still smiling, looked up and said, "And what do you think I'm doing right now?"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One day a father and his rich family took his young son on a trip to the country with the firm purpose to show him how poor people can be. They spent a day and a night in the farm of a very poor family. When they got back from their trip the father asked his son, "How was the trip?"<br><br>"Very good, Dad!"<br><br>"Did you see how poor people can be?" the father asked.<br><br>"Yeah!" "And what did you learn?"<br><br>The son answered, "I saw that we have a dog at home, and they have four. We have a pool that reaches to the middle of the garden, they have a creek that has no end. We have imported lamps in the garden, they have the stars. Our patio reaches to the front yard, they have a whole horizon.<br><br>When the little boy was finishing, his father was speechless.<br><br>His son added, "Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor we are!" Isn't it true that it all depends on the way you look at things? If you have love, friends, family, health, good humor and a positive attitude toward life, you've got everything!<br><br>You can't buy any of these things. You can have all the material possessions you can imagine, provisions for the future, etc., but if you are poor of spirit, you have nothing!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
