What the f*ck? I can clearly see that you are possibly not even an Indian in the first place! Asscrack..<br><br>The video is from a movie and it was from a Telugu movie. Telugu is a south Indian language and it has the third biggest production house in terms of movie production in India.<br><br>And the actor whom you didn't even mention, went on to become one of the most respected actors in the whole of India. He was recognised for his contributions to the Telugu movie industry as well as the social services he had done.<br><br>His name is Chiranjeevi.<br>From Wikipedia:<br>In January 2006, Mr Chiranjeevi was honored with the Padma Bhushan.[4], the third highest civilian award in India. In November 2006, Chiranjeevi was awarded with a honorary doctorate[5] by Andhra University for his services to the Telugu film industry and for his social work.<br><br>The full linK: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiranjeevi" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiranjeevi</a><br><br>F8cking clone. U r not only a stupid clone but also extremely ignorant and dumb.<br><br>The actor (and actress) are not dead. They are still in the industry and are in fact doing very well then most of the young actors.<br><br>The video is of course retardly funny and hilarious. He had just entered the movie industry back then. The movie is from 1983 if I am not wrong.<br><br>TS, you are so damn screwed la. You had to post this kinda dumb thing about an actor who also happens to be my favorite..<br><br>Blardy hell..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

Make sure you got your sources right and not blabbering some nonsense.<br>I'll be on you like a tiger the second you say something wrong about Indians.<br>For one thing, you and your f*cking clone dynasty has already utterly ruined Indian reputation in this forum. You are not promoting any "Indianism" here. Understand? You are just ruining it for all the other Indians.<br>In fact, I won't be surprised if you are some other race out to make fun of Indians and pull stupid pranks.<br>With me around, you will get whacked everytime you pull a funny stunt.
