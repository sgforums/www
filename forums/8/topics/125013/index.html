Like...you really really like this lady, and she likes you too, but you hold back from getting into a relationship with her, cause you have this great fear that you might hurt her in the future, and you KNOW that you guys won't be together forever, cos face it, marriages also can be broken up...kinda disillusioned lah crap.

But if the person genuinely is afraid, well just put in your real efforts day by day, week by week, month by month. and focus on the view you get, the higher up you go. It isn't about conquering the person for life... it's about the quality of your journey as you move along, for yourself and for someone else ba.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The First Secret - The Power Of Thought<br>***********************************<br>Love begins with our thoughts. We become what we think about. Loving thoughts create loving experiences and loving relationships. Affirmations can change our beliefs and thoughts about others and ourselves. If we want to love someone, we need to consider their needs and desires. Thinking about your ideal partner will help you recognize her when you meet her.<br><br>The Second Secret - The Power Of Respect<br>************************************<br>You cannot love anyone or anything unless you first respect them. The first person you need to respect is yourself. To begin to gain self-respect asks yourself, "What do I respect about myself?" To gain respect for others, even those you may dislike, ask yourself "What do I respect about them?"<br><br>The Third Secret - The Power Of Giving<br>**********************************<br>If you want to receive love, all you have to do is give it! The more love you give, the more you will receive. To love is to give of yourself freely and unconditionally. Practice random acts of kindness. Before committing to a relationship ask not what the other person will be able to give to you, but rather what will you be able to give them. The secret formula of a happy, lifelong, loving relationship is to always focus on what you can give instead of what you can take.<br><br>The Fourth Secret - The Power Of Friendship<br>***************************************<br>To find a true love, you must first find a true friend. Love does not consist of gazing into each other's eyes, but rather looking outward together in the same direction. To love someone completely you must love them for who they are, not what they look like. Friendship is the soil through which love's seeds grow. If you want to bring love into a relationship, you must first bring friendship.<br><br>The Fifth Secret - The Power Of Touch<br>**********************************<br>Touch is one of the most powerful expressions of love, breaking down barriers and bonding relationships. Touch changes our physical and emotional states and makes us more receptive to love.<br><br>The Sixth Secret - The Power Of Letting Go<br>*************************************<br>If you love something, let it free. If it comes back to you it's yours, if it doesn't, it never was. Even in a loving relationship, people need their own space. If we want to learn to love, we must first learn to forgive and let go of past hurts and grievances. Love means letting go of our fears, prejudices, egos and conditions. "Today I let go of all my fears, the past has no power over me - today is the beginning of a new life."<br><br>The Seventh Secret - The Power Of Communication<br>********************************************<br>When we learn to communicate openly and honestly, life changes. To love someone is to communicate with them. Let the people you love know that you love them and appreciate them. Never be afraid to say those three magic words: "I Love you." Never let an opportunity pass to praise someone. Always leave someone you love with a loving word - it could be the last time you see them. If you were about to die but could make telephone calls to the people you loved, who would you call, what would you say and..why are you waiting?<br><br>The Eighth Secret - The Power Of Commitment<br>****************************************<br>If you want to have love in abundance, you must be committed to it, and that commitment will be reflected in your thoughts and actions. Commitment is the true test of love. If you want to have loving relationships, you must be committed to loving relationships. When you are committed to someone or something, quitting is never an option. Commitment distinguishes a fragile relationship from a strong one.<br><br>The Ninth Secret - The Power Of Passion<br>***********************************<br>Passion ignites love and keeps it alive. Lasting passion does not come through physical attraction alone; it comes from deep commitment, enthusiasm, interest and excitement. Passion can be recreated by recreating past experiences when you felt passionate. Spontaneity and surprises produce passion. The essence of love and happiness are the same; all we need to do is to live each day with passion.<br><br>The Tenth Secret - The Power Of Trust<br>*********************************<br>Trust is essential in all loving relationships. Without it one person becomes suspicious, anxious and fearful and the other person feels wrapped and emotionally suffocated. You cannot love someone completely unless you trust them completely. Act as if your relationship with the person you love will never end. One of the ways you can tell whether a person is right for you is to ask yourself, "Do I trust them completely and unreservedly?" If the answer is "no", think carefully before making a commitment.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

We don't choose to love people around us because we think they are always going to stay as we know them forever. There are many reasons why people love, but thinking that the relationship would never change is seldom, if not ever, one of them.<br><br>People change. Some people die, some people grow. Some change for the better, some for the worse. It's the same with relationships. And how could we expect relationships to remain status quo when the parties involved are changing all the time? If we don't want the relationship to die, then we'd have to make sure it grows. If it still perishes due to reasons beyond our control, at least we have benefitted from the experience and would hopefully become wiser in future relationships.<br><br>Some say it is the inconstancy of life that makes it worth living.
