            <div class='col-md body'>Actually this is a reply to H20's qn of whether to quit smoking for your bf or gf. Instead of only answering to him, i would like to also make my views known to others as it is through my own meandering experience. Well i used to be a smoker and i've started smoking not during the days when policemen wore shorts but when a pack costs just $1.90, a far cry from the $3.10 that it costs now. There wuz a period of time, a year or so in fact, when i managed to quit but it was for the sake of my girlfriend who disliked smokers(actually to impress her lah). But my abstinace did not last long as i soon went back to my old ways and smoked behind her back, i felt so guilty. It became worse during my NS days cause most of my army mates were smokers and the urge was even stronger...i was basically a walking chimney when i was in camp.  My girlfriend found out, many arguments and quarrels soon came, it was horrible times....BUT it was when i was about to ORD that i "finally" realised that this was not only "killing" me bit by bit but also too expensive a "relaxing" hobby that i can carry on wif...Then it happened, i told myself that i had to STOP once and for all! Boy was it tough! for a long period of time, i had to endure runny noses, the torture of not being to puff after every meal and not being able smoke while i was resting after long day of work. But hey, it was really worth it as i DID it! and i am proud to say that i've been "clean" for about 2 months now and still going on strong...so proud that i've proved my army frens wrong and most importantly proved myself wrong when i thought i could never quit. So to all the smokers out there who are trying real hard to quit...hang in there and u'll succeed! Never quit for somebody else coz only u LOVE yourself the most.</div>
