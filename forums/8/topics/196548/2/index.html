Remember you are not superwoman.<br><br>3) Do not accept jobs from Jobstreet or JobDB or any online agency in future. Usually the jobs they offer are those that have high turnover rates / nobody wants. Sent CV to companies directly to get job offers instead.<br><br>4) Alternative, you can leave the job and hope that the job agency don't come after you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi storywolf,<br><br>thanks for your reply. yeah, it's what my aunt told me as well.<br>yea, i will DEFINATELY not pay the 2k, it's in my plans to call Shin Min or Wanbao if things dun work out. Even my aunt, who is a devoted Christian, feels sorry for me and says that i should not care abt the agency and this company is not right for me. i might as well look for other jobs once i leave rather than stay there 2 months and take the s*** and cannot go for potential interviews.<br><br>i am on 2 day mc, tomolo go back. remember i say i supposed to divert the office phone to my mobile each day? well, i did not do that on tue, cos i very unhappy, actually i did, but later i deactivated again. heng dun have if not how to rest these 2 days.<br><br>then yesterday morning, i sms him say that i mc cannot go in, i went to take mc and was given 2 days. at night, i sms him that i still not feeling good, will take the 2nd day as well. he never replied. just now, i woke up, saw missed calls from him in hk and a msg in mailbox, haven go listen. but he sure wanna know why i din divert my phone. anyway i will tell him that maybe i din activate properly lo.<br>i am so sick of working for him now.<br>just listened to the msg, he wants me to call him. sickening, he is in HK and i dun think i can ever claim back my phone charges and sms.<br><br>told my friend and she said dun call him, but i want to make sure i get my claims and pay first, so wun wanna let him guess that i may quit. cos he may have some contingency plans worked out, esp he knows of my 2 months bond with agency.<br><br>i am also quite worried that the agency will argue that it is between me and employer and they have delivered what they should have,  cos part of the probs are not just job scope related but pertaining to having 'no system'. Like the shipping matters i was told that i am supposed to liaise these few months, but i am unhappy cos it forms the bulk of my work and though i need not prepare the documents (should be my boss), he held up things and i am unhappy cos it's very inefficient<br>my friend says i really worry too much and see too muxh into details. yeah, i think it's just me, my bad habit. cos i feel really scared at times esp i am alone there. hope all will go well.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Debt agencies can make sure you cannot get another job. It's easy to track you down to your new job in Singapore..one of their usual tactic is to go to your new office and make a scene asking you to pay up. They will make sure your new colleagues and employer know that you owe them money...<br><br>If they initiate legal action against you, you will not be able to work in many 'sensitive' jobs like banks anyway, 'cos they will require you to declare you do not have such actions pending against you...<br><br>In addition, they can submit your data to credit agencies, so you will not be able to apply for credit cards etc..<br><br>Think carefully...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi , recently through I went through some shit training from this big company in Singapore. Was actually outsourced from the company that I signed with. I didnt know anything about it until on the first day of work. I was supposed to be a customer service ( no mention of phone calls ) . That was not a problem. I was supposed to undergo on job training , no problem.<br><br>After signing the contract , I left for my outsource company. Its pretty far from my home to office. No mention on any transport allowance, never mind. First day of work , they tried to force all the information on me and expected me to know my stuff by the end of the day. The training sucks because 3 different people taught me with different methods confusing me with what should I do when I encounter this problem. This is the problem , when I am with person B , I used person A's solution , person B makes lots of noise and insist that I follow his method ...so on and so fore. Such a big company and they cant train newbies properly, it's a shame really. Those that had experience before had a hard time struggling in.I wouldnt recommand this company to anyone really . I kept highlighting to them that I need time to digust all the information to my head especially the spare parts which I am not so sure of. 2 weeks later , decided I had enough. 1. Low pay 2 . No transport allowance and distance far from home 3. Screwed up management ( Increase our working hours from 44 to 49 hrs, no increment of pay ), lousy job training .<br><br>I discussed with my original company , she told me she received complaints against me because of mistakes , the problem I already told them that I need time to settle down and to go through PROPER training.Of course I make mistakes especially with the lousy training I went through.Putting me on the phone straight away on the first day make me lost and confused. Mediocue is the word to describe the way they work. Even in my previous companines, I was given at least a month to settle down. For them, its a day and they expect me to know everything, that is how I felt . Anyway, I told her that I like to be transfer to the company itself if its not possible , I quit . So that was it , I quit the next day.<br><br>I got another job , starting this coming monday. This time , I checked my facts before agreeing to join them . Lesson learned from that bad experience.<br><br>I wont buy that companies's products. Especially I heard of  lots of complaints with their household products. Rubbish.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lessons are meant to learn but what matters is don't let this setback affect you. There are other oppounities , don't worry. I dont recommand going through job agency , it's better to work directly with the company. So yeah.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Even my aunt, who is a devoted Christian, feels sorry for me and says that i should not care abt the agency and this company is not right for me. i might as well look for other jobs once i leave rather than stay there 2 months and take the s*** and cannot go for potential interviews.<br><br>i am on 2 day mc, tomolo go back. remember i say i supposed to divert the office phone to my mobile each day? well, i did not do that on tue, cos i very unhappy, actually i did, but later i deactivated again. heng dun have if not how to rest these 2 days.<br><br>then yesterday morning, i sms him say that i mc cannot go in, i went to take mc and was given 2 days. at night, i sms him that i still not feeling good, will take the 2nd day as well. he never replied. just now, i woke up, saw missed calls from him in hk and a msg in mailbox, haven go listen. but he sure wanna know why i din divert my phone. anyway i will tell him that maybe i din activate properly lo.<br>i am so sick of working for him now.<br>just listened to the msg, he wants me to call him. sickening, he is in HK and i dun think i can ever claim back my phone charges and sms.<br><br>told my friend and she said dun call him, but i want to make sure i get my claims and pay first, so wun wanna let him guess that i may quit. cos he may have some contingency plans worked out, esp he knows of my 2 months bond with agency.<br><br>i am also quite worried that the agency will argue that it is between me and employer and they have delivered what they should have,  cos part of the probs are not just job scope related but pertaining to having 'no system'. Like the shipping matters i was told that i am supposed to liaise these few months, but i am unhappy cos it forms the bulk of my work and though i need not prepare the documents (should be my boss), he held up things and i am unhappy cos it's very inefficient<br>my friend says i really worry too much and see too muxh into details. yeah, i think it's just me, my bad habit. cos i feel really scared at times esp i am alone there. hope all will go well.<br><br></div></blockquote>Your friend is not giving you good advice ! How can she ask you not to call your boss till you get your claim and pay first.  If you still want your pay, which is for this month job, at least you should do your work - answer and talk to your boss till month end. If you not month end decide to stop working and disppear, then how to pay you for the month ?<br><br></div>
