            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all,<br><br>I have recently signed a 2 yr plan with Starhub using my old plan (PowerPlay, $22/mth). As you know, Starhub has already ceased to sell this plan (now revised as PowerPlay II, $2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. When I tried to re-contract to buy a phone, they wanted me to change to the $28 plan (ie. pay $6/mth additional for 2 yrs) as I was on the old plan. Alternatively, I could pay a "special" one-time payment of $60 and stay on the $22 plan so i can save $84 ($6x24 - $60). I refused both offers on the spot.<br><br>I then checked the Starhub website and found this clause under FAQs:<br>"Existing subscribers can choose to remain on their price plan when they recontract (ie. PowerPlay price stays at $22.8<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. They would enjoy the same handset price meant for PowerPlay($29.14) and PowerTalk($91.52)"<br><br>They have since changed it to:<br>"Existing subscribers can choose to remain on their price plan when they recontract (ie. PowerPlay price stays at $22.8<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. PowerPlay subscribers would have to pay an extra $60 on top of PowerChat 100 handset price"<br><br>I printed it out and subsequently lodged a complaint with the customer service. After more than a week of calls from me to Starhub, they decided to waive the $60 for me. Using the marketing ploy of "you save more if you pay $60 now", Starhub had profited from us, the loyal customers who have supported them all along. This could be an enormous amount - for example, 10,000 customers doing an upgrade = $600k.<br><br>After my case was settled, I called up the press who in turn checked with Starhub. Starhub have since called me and said they would do a refund on a case-by-case basis for my friends who have since paid the $60 while doing an upgrading during last month's promotion. I believe they are trying to keep this a hush-hush affair.<br><br>I felt Starhub should advertise and apologise and ask all affected customers to contact them for a refund but unfortunately they are not taking the initiative.<br><br>So fellow subscribers, please spread the message!!! Please quote my name "Khim Chuan" while asking for your $60 refund. Good luck!!!<br></div>

If i have to do that... i rather go for Singtel iTWO considering Starhub reception still sux compared to Singtel and both cost the same price...<br></div>
