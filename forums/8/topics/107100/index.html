            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, in the end you realize all that you do here dosen't really matter and that you are just passing time to die in the end eh?<br><br>In 100 years it wouldn't have mattered if you existed or not, because you would be dead and nobody would remember you.<br><br>And there's really no point in the human race's achievements after all isn't it? Because in the end the only thing we can be sure about is that the human race is going to go extinct and the universe is going to finally run out of energy and die itself, collasping into a series of singularities. Eventually, time and space itself would not cease to exist, they themselves being created finites with an ending. That's what science tells us.<br><br>So in the end, everything is really meaningless, that is, if you believe death is the ultimate end in itself. There's really no point in debating about truth or doing what's right or wrong if death means that everything would end in the end, because what good is ultimate good if nothing really lasts? It dosen't matter.

And everybody should just do what they want and believe what they want without paying much heed to him, or anybody else.<br><br>What's the point of being so good in life and trying to do good when a similar fate awaits both the good and bad?

What Hitler, Stalin and the like did isn't really wrong in the end, come to think of it, because the entire universe is still going to die in the end and what they did wouldn't really matter. There is no right and wrong, just people doing stuff. Right and wrong are just your EMOTIONS, so moot them and live life as you see fit.<br><br>Bah! So is death being an end to itself such a simple notion? It's not.<br><br>So is death in itself the ultimate end? These are questions we seriously need to ponder instead of writing it off with a simple motion that everything would just end, because they have serious consquences about what we will finally make of this world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry man, we should believe in the truth, not a lie. If you got cancer tat cannot be treated, it is a fact an no matter how u like it to be some simple stomach cramps. No matter how u like to believe a"magic stone" can cure u, it is still a lie nevertheless. Instead of believing a lie, why not accept the truth and try to make out the best of wat is available to u ?<br><br><blockquote>Hmm, in the end you realize all that you do here dosen't really matter and that you are just passing time to die in the end eh? </blockquote>U r living in here and certainly wat u do now will affect u in future. Instead of dwelling about death, u should consider how to make the best of your life instead.<br><br><blockquote>In 100 years it wouldn't have mattered if you existed or not, because you would be dead and nobody would remember you. </blockquote>Tat is the cold hard reality of it. Tat is why there r some people who strive to be a scientist etc so tat they can leave their name forever.<br><br><blockquote>And there's really no point in the human race's achievements after all isn't it? Because in the end the only thing we can be sure about is that the human race is going to go extinct and the universe is going to finally run out of energy and die itself, collasping into a series of singularities. Eventually, time and space itself would not cease to exist, they themselves being created finites with an ending. That's what science tells us. </blockquote>True, but certainly if u r successful and satisfied, u get to enjoy a lot of happiness in your life. Tat is wat all men strives for isn't it ? Try to be happy for as long a time as possible. Although civilisation may falls in the end, u had already enjoyed your life and get the maximum out of it.<br><br><blockquote>So in the end, everything is really meaningless, that is, if you believe death is the ultimate end in itself. There's really no point in debating about truth or doing what's right or wrong if death means that everything would end in the end, because what good is ultimate good if nothing really lasts? It dosen't matter. There's no need for moral law, we are just nothing more then bags of proteins compelled to arrange these concepts to pass on our genetic codes, nothing more nothing less. </blockquote>It matters because u can get prepare if u know the truth. There is still a need for moral laws because otherwise there will be chaos making u unhappy. If u help other people, u also get happiness for it as well and make it a higher chance where others will help u too. It is better than believing some being want u to have morals when it doesn't matter anything to him in any way. We just obey him because we wanna beg for a place in heaven ?<br><br><blockquote>Come to think of it, if what he has been saying all this while is true, then I can postulate in the end, that whatever Stupidissmart is saying wouldn't really matter in the end wouldn't it? And everybody should just do what they want and believe what they want without paying much heed to him, or anybody else. </blockquote>It matters because there r stil many people living isn't it ? Why think of the death of the galaxy which will be few billion billion billion, or shall I say near infinity years away when u should be thinking of now and how to live your life now. Truth is, do wat u want but be prepared for the consequences.<br><br><blockquote>What's the point of being so good in life and trying to do good when a similar fate awaits both the good and bad? Why be faithful to your girlfriend? Why value your friendships? Why show loyality to your family and friends? It would just all not matter in the end, wouldn't it? </blockquote>U do good because u want to help other people, NOT because u actually want some form of reward. I am faithful to my girlfriend because I love her and do not want to hurt her. I value friendship because I sincerely hope they to be well and not because I can make use of them in future. I show loyalty to my family because they show me the same loyalty. <strong>I do not do all these because I fear some form of punishment or expect some form of reward ! </strong> Do u have tis mentality ?<br><br><blockquote>We should just all do whatever makes us the happiest before we are gone, since this is the only life we are going to get and nothing more, what's the point of trying so hard to be all these arbitary notions of "good", just enjoy life at any cost lah, it dosen't matter if you hurt others, they like you, will come to an end and it wouldn't matter anyway, nothing has eternal consequences.

There is no right and wrong, just people doing stuff. Right and wrong are just your EMOTIONS, so moot them and live life as you see fit</blockquote>We should do watever tat makes us happy. But take note tat to be happy on the long terms, u need friends and people to be around u. This is simply because lonelines will not generate happiness. Doing good thing not only generate happiness in itself, it make the society a better place to live in. Tat is why people still do good things because they got <strong>compassion</strong>. They r not utterly evil at heart and do good things just because they want to score at some unknown points to heaven. Tat is why u see freethinkers to perform good deeds as well. So if there is no god for u, u will go around and create all the evil things around u ?<br><br><blockquote>Bah! So is death being an end to itself such a simple notion? It's not</blockquote>It is. tat is a fact.<br><br><blockquote>So is death in itself the ultimate end? These are questions we seriously need to ponder instead of writing it off with a simple motion that everything would just end, because they have serious consquences about what we will finally make of this world.</blockquote>I see billions of free thinker around inthe world and everything is still normal. Wat do u think will happen ?</div>
