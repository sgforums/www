Why be faithful to your girlfriend? Why value your friendships? Why show loyality to your family and friends? It would just all not matter in the end, wouldn't it?<br><br>We should just all do whatever makes us the happiest before we are gone, since this is the only life we are going to get and nothing more, what's the point of trying so hard to be all these arbitary notions of "good", just enjoy life at any cost lah, it dosen't matter if you hurt others, they like you, will come to an end and it wouldn't matter anyway, nothing has eternal consequences. What Hitler, Stalin and the like did isn't really wrong in the end, come to think of it, because the entire universe is still going to die in the end and what they did wouldn't really matter. There is no right and wrong, just people doing stuff. Right and wrong are just your EMOTIONS, so moot them and live life as you see fit.<br><br>Bah! So is death being an end to itself such a simple notion? It's not.<br></div></blockquote>Why am I good? Because I care about how people look at me and how I look at myself.<br><br>Why am I faithful to my girlfriend? Because I love her.<br><br>Why value your friendship? Because I care.<br><br>Why show loyality to your family and friends? Because I care.<br><br>If you are doing all the above just because you want to go to Heaven, then I seriously doubt you are genuinely good or just because there is reward and punishment for being good or bad. In conclusion, you do not really care about anyone whom you claim to care since you are just trying to go to heaven.<br><br>The happinest moment is when you can share a feeling and having or giving others the feeling of being loved and wanted.<br><br>So, if the above is the reason why you believe in existance of a god, then I pity you. If, however, you genuinely believe in the existance of god without condition, then good, I respect you. Although I would still think in all probability, chances are, a god do not exist.</div>

Because I am still living and I strive to make it as meaningful as possible. Debating and search for the truth is meaningful. Tat is wat almost everyone in the world is doing isn't it ? Human knowledge changes and improve with time. The world do changes.

If you got cancer tat cannot be treated, it is a fact an no matter how u like it to be some simple stomach cramps. No matter how u like to believe a"magic stone" can cure u, it is still a lie nevertheless. Instead of believing a lie, why not try to make out the best of wat is available to u ? </div></blockquote>Because there is no "best" that is available to us. What good is disillusionment when it provides no advantages over illusionment in the end? The value of knowing truth in your worldview is questionable because the ultimate end of everything would be no different from if we knew the truth or not.<br><br><blockquote>We should do watever tat makes us happy. But take note tat to be happy on the long terms, u need friends and people to be around u. This is simply because lonelines will not generate happiness. Doing good thing not only generate happiness in itself, it make the society a better place to live in. Tat is why people still do good things because they got compassion. They r not utterly evil at heart and do good things just because they want to score at some unknown points to heaven. Tat is why u see freethinkers to perform good deeds as well. So if there is no god for u, u will go around and create all the evil things around u ? </blockquote>Noble aspirations, but I don't see how good and evil can even exist in a finite universe with the end as the only consequence.<br><br>Yes, you have pointed out correctly that we can be good to others if they are good to us, it is advantageous behaviour. But really, what if it suddenly becomes in our advantage to be bad, betray those good to us? What really, I ask, stops us from doing all that when nothing really matters in the end. Why make soceity a better place to live in when it hardly advantages us before we die, and they are going to die anyway?<br><br>Is it any more wrong to make soceity a worse place to live in, buy my way to happiness fame and friends and derive the most sastifaction from my life (aka. Hitler, Stalin), rather then make it a better place but not derive the most sastifaction from my ONLY life and settle for arbitary values like good, happiness and family, when it all ends in the end.<br><br>And what is good and evil really? What is compassion? Aren't they all just arbitary values invented by a feeble human intellect trying to justify an existence that is ultimately meaningless? All of it just created by man to control a soceity and prevent it from falling into chaos so that the human race can contuine. Arent good and compassion are not values to help us, but are values to restrict us from deriving the most happiness from ourselves so that we can keep human soceity moving forward in the relentless drive to pass on our genes? A journey in itself that will end anyway and is just is because it just wants to be.<br><br>Like eusocial ants in a colony, aren't we just drones working for the greater "good" but giving up our own sastifaction in the process? We are working for the good of a organization that we will never see nor feel nor experience in the end.<br><br>Why Mr. Stupidissmart? Why get up? Why keep trying? Are you living for something other then your own survival? Can you tell me what it is? Do you even know? Are you living for compassion? For justice? For freedom? Could it be for love? Illusions Mr. Stupidissmart! Delusions created by a feeble human intellect try desperate intellect trying desperately to define an existence that is ultimately meaningless! And all of it as artifical as the Matrix itself! Although only a human mind could invent a concept as insipid as love. Why Mr. Stupidissmart? Why do you carry on?

What good is disillusionment when it provides no advantages over illusionment in the end? The value of knowing truth in your worldview is questionable because the ultimate end of everything would be no different from if we knew the truth or not. </blockquote>The end is not important, the journey is. The meaning of life can only be achieve when u r living, not when u r dead. It is the same as watching a boring 2 hour movie or watching an interesting 2 hour movie. The end is the same, but the journey toward the end is different.

Why make soceity a better place to live in when it hardly advantages us before we die, and they are going to die anyway? </blockquote>Again the word compassion and love have to appear. If u love your loved ones, surely u will not harm them isn't it ? If a situation occurs where it becomes our advantage to be bad, then let his conscious and compassion be his guide. EVen if u r religious, u still employ the same thing. Religious people also r human and commit some bad deeds in their lives as well isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>Is it any more wrong to make soceity a worse place to live in, buy my way to happiness fame and friends and derive the most sastifaction from my life (aka. Hitler, Stalin), rather then make it a better place but not derive the most sastifaction from my ONLY life and settle for arbitary values like good, happiness and family, when it all ends in the end. </blockquote>Hitler is a deeply religious person as well. Does religion prevent tat from happening ? There r also a lot of religious leaders tat start crusaders, witch burningm inquisition, wars and terrorists as well. I can only say those who people like hitler and stalin do not get real happiness since they r at a constant fear and stress for their whole life. In fact I see more terrible acts being commited because one got religion. The world had becoem a worse place because of it<br><br><blockquote>And what is good and evil really? What is compassion?

A journey in itself that will end anyway and is just is because it just wants to be. </blockquote>Good and evil is just plainly good for society or bad for society. Tis definition is teh same as wat religion teaches. The other religion tat do not practise all these will be branded as a cult and weeded out. Compassion is just wat u think compassion is. We have compassion because we want people to treat us with compassion as well. When we perform a good or bad deed, we will think of wat will we do if we r put in their shoes. Obviously if everyone got compassion, the world will be a better place to be and u will be happy. U r happy when people do some acts of kindness towards u isn't it ? U will feel happy when u perform some kind acts to other people as well isn't it ? U don't feel these things ?<br><br><blockquote>Like eusocial ants in a colony, aren't we just drones working for the greater "good" but giving up our own sastifaction in the process? We are working for the good of a organization that we will never see nor feel nor experience in the end. </blockquote>We go with this "greater good" as well. Rise and we will rise with it. Fall and everyone falls as well. Surely tis beats believing we work like slaves just because some ancestors eat a fruit.<br><br><blockquote>Why Mr. Stupidissmart? Why get up? Why keep trying?</blockquote>Sounds liek the matrix  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>Are you living for something other then your own survival?

Why Mr. Stupidissmart? Why do you persist? Why? </blockquote>U know why ? It is because I believe. I believe tat some religion is a lie and trapped people into it, wasting their resources in it. I believe the world will be a better place if religion becomes less relevant. As such I believe I will be happy if I carry on.<br><br>On the other hand, why do u want to stop me ? Surely your end will be the same to u whether u stop me or not stop me isn't it ? Or perhaps the reason why u r stopping me is because u can get extra points to go to heaven ? From all your argument so far, u appear not to believe your religion as the truth, but yet keep believing in the lie just because u can't handle the truth. Why do u believe in your religion ? U believe just because u can't accept the fact tat men die and universe collapse ? U don't have a choice isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>Smith was right, he was always right</blockquote>U had watched too much matrix.

I'm not making it any lesser, it's strange you have not understood my point yet. All I'm saying is that there is no difference in the way you obtain happiness, not debating on the value of happiness itself. You seem to have missed the entire point. Very strange.<br><br>Since the only end is the end in itself, as you have put it across quite clearly yourself in absolute terms and now, yet strangely, you seem impose bizzare and contradictory restrictions on how a meaning can must be found in a universe that is ultimately without meaning or purpose, just organization and purpose for the sheer sake of carrying on because it was the net result of all the reactants. I have no idea where you are pulling your values out from, but as of yet, don't all our values remain as illusionary, and bearing no difference in the end?<br><br><blockquote><strong>On passing out our genes to the younger ones, we do it because we love children and we do indeed remain in this world as some part of us had been passed to our decendents. On the contrary, according to your religion it makes absolutely no sense to have children as well. </strong></blockquote>Erm, we don't exactly do it because we love children. Love is not the end, it is the means to an end. More correctly it should be said that children are the reason that there is love of them. This is because our brain reward centers, being evolved by the passing down of genes in the first place, are compelled to carry out the purpose of rewarding us with pleasurable chemicals when we reproduce, hence making sure these genetic patterns get passed on. Love is a chemical illusion bearing no eternal value whatsoever, many animals can reproduce without feelings of attatchment, just because we are animals that reproduce through chemical pair-bonding (ie. love) hardly gives any value to the emotion that we value so much.<br><br>We don't remain in this world, I'm afriad. The awareness that is us, our individuality is gone, kaput when we die. In a sense, we are very much the slaves of our genes, to which we are nothing more then vessels, to be discarded once we had done our duty to pass them on. All the stuff we dream up, soceity, love, values, good and evil, they are illusions holding no real purpose other then to make sure we hold our act together to pass on our genes. There is indeed no sense to have children, it's just our genes telling us so, there is no value, no purpose in such activity in a universe that's about to die anyway. Nothing counts for anything in the end.<br><br>To what purpose? There is none. Purpose, like value does not exist in the metaphysical universe. We hate to think it's true but it is, we do not have any real purpose, because we just are resultants of a series of accidents and very lucky breaks.<br><br>It's bizzare that you drag religon into this, particularly mine. After all, as you have said, religon is just one of the other illusions in the grand human delusion of a purposeful life, it is not any more delusional, nor irrational then an atheistic outlook, because human value itself does not really exist, men are fighting over ghosts in the end. Rationality is not any better then a faith-based worldview, indeed, when both still go kaput in the end.<br><br>In the end, the question that remains is this. What is there indeed, to stop an enlightened individual who has factored in the final fate of this universe, from harming you and your family to make sure he gets the best of his life before he checks out? Nothing, and many people in positions of power have done that, much to the dismay of those who are indisposed to help themselves.<br><br>Since what you say is so true, then indeed, we should all just go on our merry way believing in whatever we want to, because in the end we will just all die and become nothing. We can never know things for sure, and all hard talk about truth is just poppycock and a waste of our precious time, like so much I have spent here?<br><br>Meaningless, everything is meaningless. The same fate awaits all, both rich and poor, happy and unhappy, faithful and faithless. It's all the same in the end, the final singularity. Nothing counts for anything in the end.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Die mean The End. No more. Non-existence. Ur body is nothing more than an object.<br><br>What happens before ur birth? U got any feelings/thoughts before u were born? It is similar to what happens after ur death.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>The world goes on, with or without u.</strong></span><br><br>It's the same with the human species on the whole, as well as on a higher scale. The world goes on, with or without the human species, with or without Planet Earth. That's the way it is, short and simple.<br><br>If u fully understand that concept, many people will be very afraid. That is why all religions explains after-life - in order for people to feel safe after death. Introduction of rules to control your behaviour, so that people live their lives in an orderly fashion. People like to think that they are special in some way or another, thus the idea of after-life.<br><br>As for why people chose to do good, it is because we have something called 'wisdom' - we know how to think. it doesnt mean atheists will definitely do evil coz we don't have a god or higher authority to check us. Instead atheists who chose to do good do it out from the bottom of their hearts, not out of fear or retribution or judgement.<br><br>I am an atheist. I dont do evil because i know it hurts when I'm at the receiving end. It also hurts me to see others being hurt. I do good because it makes me happy when others are good to me. I also feel happy for others when I see them being treated well. I understand what is called universal compassion. Judging from what you have written, you seem to mean you will do whatever you want, including evil deeds, if there is no higher power to keep u in check. That is exactly why religion is created in the first place. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> And I'm glad you're under control.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

All I'm saying is that there is no difference in the way you obtain happiness, not debating on the value of happiness itself. You seem to have missed the entire point. Very strange. </blockquote>And so ? I have said before to obtain long term happiness, it is recommended that u do things that u will feel at ease and proud about. If u do things tat will give u happiness only in the short run, then u have clearly miss out a lot<br><br><blockquote>Since the only end is the end in itself, as you have put it across quite clearly yourself in absolute terms and now, yet strangely, you seem impose bizzare and contradictory restrictions on how a meaning can must be found in a universe that is ultimately without meaning or purpose, just organization and purpose for the sheer sake of carrying on because it was the net result of all the reactants. I have no idea where you are pulling your values out from, but as of yet, don't all our values remain as illusionary, and bearing no difference in the end? </blockquote>I have said tat the end doesn't mean anything. The important thing is the journey itself. I have given the analogy of the movie isn't it ? All the differences lies during the process, not the end. The only thing u keep mentioning about is the universe is gonna end. However it has not end yet and it is not going to be so for many years to come. U don't like it ? Sorry man, but tat is the harsh reality of life that u got to accept. So wat r u going to do about it ? I had said many times before u don't choose wat truth is. If all things are gonna end it is gonna end no matter wat u believe in. Wat is important and meaningful is to live your life to the fullest now. U r still alive, your friends and families r still here and u still have a life. Live it. Otherwise wat do u think tis life is ? A test to see if u qualified to go to heaven ?<br><br><blockquote>Erm, we don't exactly do it because we love children. Love is not the end, it is the means to an end.

There is indeed no sense to have children, it's just our genes telling us so, there is no value, no purpose in such activity in a universe that's about to die anyway. Nothing counts for anything in the end. </blockquote>I have one word for u. Pessimist. U can have a life and enjoy it. Instead u just keep harping on the end which was almost infinity number of years away. Why have children, it is because we love them. U can put in into scientific terms but it still boils down to the fact tat we have children because we love them. They can make u happy. Tat is it. Everything have an end. Tat is soemthing everybody should know. U can keep brooding about it and have a lousy sad life or u can be optimistic about it and think of the infinite possible ways to make yourself happier. I know wat the ultimate ending will be like, but I only think of things I can do when I am living rather than just being pessimist and do nothing.<br><br><blockquote>To what purpose? There is none. Purpose, like value does not exist in the metaphysical universe. We hate to think it's true but it is, we do not have any real purpose, because we just are resultants of a series of accidents and very lucky breaks. </blockquote>Value had a purpose in society. We r living in society. Tat is it.<br><br><blockquote>It's bizzare that you drag religon into this, particularly mine.

Rationality is not any better then a faith-based worldview, indeed, when both still go kaput in the end. </blockquote>Tis is because your religion is the other alternative of the truth. Some of  the things u said won't change even if u had a religion. Tat is why I pull in your religion to it. And again I had to reiterate, <strong>The end is not important. Everything ends. Wat is important is the process, the journey of living now. </strong> However u just went straight past tis point and keep talking about the end, the end, the end etc. If the world will end, it will end regardless of wat u believe. It is best u know wat is the truth rather than believing in a glorious lie. U think tat heaven exists ? U think tis heaven will never end ? Sorry man, u r believing in an obvious lie.<br><br><blockquote>In the end, the question that remains is this. What is there indeed, to stop an enlightened individual who has factored in the final fate of this universe, from harming you and your family to make sure he gets the best of his life before he checks out? Nothing, and many people in positions of power have done that, much to the dismay of those who are indisposed to help themselves. </blockquote>Morals r there, and it had nothing to do with religion. Do u see free thinkers killing people when they r dying ?<br><br><blockquote>Since what you say is so true, then indeed, we should all just go on our merry way believing in whatever we want to, because in the end we will just all die and become nothing. We can never know things for sure, and all hard talk about truth is just poppycock and a waste of our precious time, like so much I have spent here? </blockquote>True. U should go on your merry ways and believe in a religion which u believe it to be true. HOwever again I have to reiterate, the end doesn't mean a thing. The journey is. Why keep talking about the end when i had said tis fact ?<br><br><blockquote>Meaningless, everything is meaningless. The same fate awaits all, both rich and poor, happy and unhappy, faithful and faithless. It's all the same in the end, the final singularity. Nothing counts for anything in the end.</blockquote>The chinese had already believe tat when u r borned, u didn't bring anything to the world and when u died, u cannot bring the things back. Everyone die, whether u r rich or poor. HOwever u can still decide thigns like how many people to like u when u die, how much contribution u had made to society and how happy a person u r when u r alife. Tat r the thigns tat were important.</div>
