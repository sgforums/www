            <div class='col-md body'>HOHHOHOHOHOOHHOH<br>WAHAHHAHAHHAHAH  !!!<br><br>I have discovered a new Zerg strategy that can counter the 12 zealots rush !!!<br><br>If you follow the way below of building the Zerg base, you sure can counter the 12 zealots.<br><br>1. When the game starts, start mining and hatch the first Drone with the 50 mineral you have.<br><br>2. For every 50 mineral you have collected, start hatching a Drone....repeat this untill you have 7 drones altogether , stop hatching drones and produce the first Overlord once you reach 100 mineral. You have to be fast in this stage.<br><br>3. Immediately after you start hatching the OverLord, wait for 50 mineral and hatch the 8th Drone. Wait for 50 mineral more and hatch the 9th Drone then wait for 200 mineral for spawning pool. The eighth Drone will roughly hatch just before the OverLord.<br><br>4. At this point just after the Overlord hatched, you'd have collected enough 200 minerals , start building the spawning pool<br><br>5. Continue to hatch Drones for every 50 mineral you have untill the 11th Drone, wait for 100 mineral and build the Extractor.<br><br>6. Continue to produce Drones. Start collecting vaspene gas by Now, using at least 3 Drones for the Extractor.<br><br>7. Build 1 sunken colony near to the Spawning Pool. Now upgrade the Hatchery to Lair. Collect another 100 mineral 50 vaspene and build Hydralisk Den close to the spawning pool.<br><br>8. Continue to produce drones untill the mineral field queue is full.<br><br>9. Once the Lair is ready, research Lurker aspect at the Hydralisk Den. Immediately after, research Burrow at the Lair.<br><br>10.Produce 3 Hydralisks and 1 OverLord by now, and wait for 300 vaspene gas and meanwhile build 1 more sunken colony near the spawning pool IF YOU HAVE more than 300 minerals.<br><br>11. Once the Lurker aspect is ready, evolve your hydralisks to Lurkers. Make sure you have 300 minerals savings so that if the 12 Zealots destroy your Lair, you still can build another one.<br><br>12. By now the 12 zealots are at your doorstep, AND IF YOU HAVE BEEN VERY FAST ENOUGH, your 3 Lurkers are just in time to meet the 12 zealots.<br>Depending on the way you build your base,  you can burrow 2 Lurkers near your Spawning pool and Hydralisk Den and 1 near the Lair.<br><br>13. Now the Zealots will be attacked by the sunken colonies and the Lurkers, sustaining casualties. Smart Protoss opponents will try to go for your Drones, but YOU ARE SMARTER -Burrow ALL Your Drones!<br><br>14. Now the zealots can only choose to attack the buildings or the sunken colonies, in either way they are sure to be wiped out by your Lurkers with the help of the Sunken Colonies!           <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">           <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">           <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>KAkakakakka!!!<br><br>This tactic is TESTED and PROVEN a 100% Zealot rush counter-measure!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Having transformable 2-legs-2-hands robots such as Marcross or Gundam in the game is really out of question.<br>It's really impractical to have 2-legs-2-hands robots in a warfare, otherwise the US would have such robots in their military long ago because they already have the ability to produce such robots.<br>2-legs-2-hands robots just dont serve the purpose in mobility, recoil-absorbing, heavy equipment loading and they are too expensive to produce.<br><br>They only exists in Anime, not in a true warfare. If StarCraft2 has such robots I will be very disappointed with Blizzard.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pang sai (edited 13 November 2001).]</div>
