This applied both to team play and FFA. In FFA, most pple will go defensive and anyone who tried to rush are running a risk cos they can only get rid of one player even if he succeed and the possibility is very low due to the long distance of travelling unless the opponent is near. Furthermore, by rushing, he slow down his building progress. In a team play, it's also the same case cos when the team are eliminating one of the opponent, they themselves are slow in building up their tech, and the remaining opponent player might had gotten enuffs advanced troops to wide out all.<br><br>In large land map with little resources, abundant low tech troops would be better to secure more base either by exploration or by eliminating your neighbours.<br><br>For island map whether big or small, you will always need to build gas first then defence then transport or air.<br><br>I can tell you also, real experts don't need to know the map well at all, cos they will change their style of playing depending on the variable circumstances. Those who play well just because they know the map in and out are called seasoned player. Once they are asked to play in a new map, they become newbie again.</div>

The larvaes are so hard to kill that it take some time even for zealots.<br>Build your buildings to surround the sunken colonies so that the zealots can't directly attack them. They've got to destroy the building first before they can attack the colonies.

            <div class='col-md body'>double zealot rush is the usual strategy i use when i play 2on2 and both of us are protoss. its very difficult to stop the rush if your ally sits around and does nothing, whatever race you are. the most important thing is to scout and once you find that they are going for a zealot buildup, you have to consider your options. if you are terran, bunkering is the most obvious solution, unless you can lock the zealots out with supply depots while having enough marines shooting from behind. without any of these 2, terran is gone case. but careful and constant repairing of the bunkers will keep you alive. meanwhile, your ally should attack one of the protoss. try to go for the probes, since quite frequently attacking players don't watch their bases. if you are zerg, sunkens have to be made, preferably with zergling support. place the sunkens with buildings around to shield them. how many you make depends on the number of zealots coming for you. the big problem defending is when you are protoss. making zealots-you have only half their number. sometimes, lucky players get off with making a shield battery to support their zealots. a good try that works if there is an opening to block(eg.bgh). what is done is that 2 gateways are made nicely such that the only way for zealots to pass thru is the slit between the gateways. then, place 1-2 cannons behind the gateways. in the slit, place 1-3 zealots and HOLD them. this can hold off easily 3 times the number of zealots, more if there is a shield battery to recharge the zealots in the slit, simply because when the opposing zealots are hit first by the cannon, they try to walk thru the slit, and get hit by the zealot in the slit supported by 1-2 cannons.<br><br>still whatever defense is made, the winner often is the team that coordinates best.</div>

That'll be 5 minutes.<br><br>The 1 minute difference between the 12 zealot rush and the 3 Lurkers+ 2 Sunken colonies is quite critical. If the 12 zealots took an extra 1 more minute to rally and explore to find the enemy base, they are dead meat.      <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>So basically, whether the 12 zealot rush will be successful depends on whether the zealots are faster in finding the enemy or the Lurkers are more lucky to meet the Zealots after they hatched.<br>But in a small map, most likely the Lurkers are too slow.<br><br>I also found out one thing:  FireBats are especially good in killing zealots.  About 5 FireBats can defeat 6 zealots.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pang sai (edited 09 November 2001).]</div>
