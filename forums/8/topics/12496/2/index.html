I'm talking about building the ultimate combo within the shortest time - Devourers and Guardians will be best.<br>Dont forget that you need to research different abilities like the psionic storm, arbiter stasis field, +4 interceptor, faster scout movement, +energy to templar etc , and also you need to build citadel of ardun, templar archive, observatory, robotic facilty, fleet beacon, arbiter tribunal.<br><br><strong>While for me I only need Hive and Greater Spire ready.</strong> Some more Mutalisk are much cheaper than your scouts and carriers.<br><br>If you are talking about scouts, carriers, templars and arbiters,  before you have this combination ready I would have already wiped your base clean with 12 Guardians and 12 Devourers.<br><br>[This message has been edited by SilverWings (edited 22 October 2001).]</div>

Impressive. Ultimate defensive tactic. That's the first thing most newbie do. .

            <div class='col-md body'>If i am playing zerg, the first thing i will build is zergling rush followed by mass hydralisk. There would never be more than 2 sunken and spores inside my main base. And most probably all my sub base will have none but only drone, OL and lots of troops coming out from these sub base gathering most probably in the centre.<br></div>

On the contrary, they are very on the offensive path and would normally coordinate among one another who to take out first.<br><br>For Zergs, actually, Lurkers are good offensive and defensive troops on the on-start.
