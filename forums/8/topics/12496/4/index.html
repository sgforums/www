If he goes zealot rush then he wont have the mineral to go for Archon or Dark Templar or Air unit. If he goes for Scout and Arbiter he wont have the mineral to go for dragoons or reavers etc.<br><br>Even if he can combine many different rush together, most of the time they are very weak becoz the shields and armours/weapons are not upgraded and they also didnt research the psionic storm / stasis field/ faster scout movement etc<br><br>so there's still a big chance of defeating them.  Remember they need to built 7 kinds of different advanced building which slows them down alot       <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Zerg only needs 2-3 advanced buildings.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the pro games, the first few minute will always be a rushin game, no one will ever go air or advance troops unless they really feel safe from the other's protection or having lots of defence.<br><br>In battlenet, it's always offensive and never defensive in order to win. Rushing is norm. If the zerg is to be on the defensive with lots of sunken, then tat's it. what protoss player need to do is just to camp outside his base with cannon and zealots and don't let zerg expand and let the game drags. Zerg will always be the weakest in long war game.<br><br>In term of rushing, zergling/hydralisk is the keys. It depend on whether the mass zealot win or the mass zergling/hydralisk win. In a team play, If every team player rush while the opposite team are having one or two players playing defensive, then that's it. One of their team mate got to go.</div>

Use your Lurkers to get rid of his Turrets. Once his Turrets gone, he has only 2-3 chances of Com Sat Scanning. Try to waste his com sat scans by sending the Lurkers one by one. After you are sure that he has wasted ALL his scans, it's time to rush all your lurkers and have a nice party.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the game depends on the map. in ladder games where money and gas are limited like Lost Temple, zerg usually, in fact nearly always will go a 2nd hatch before making a spawning pool. sometimes the hatch is placed at the expansion, sometimes at the ramp. this build order has become popular especially after the v1.08 patch because the zergling rush is seriously weakened. and usually there is always an attack in the first 5-6 minutes. terran usually have marines/firebats/medics as the first wave. protoss is more variable---pretty difficult to use it on lost temple. zerg always get attacked, cos they go for the early expansion. if they don't, its easy to get locked up. these sort of maps require extensive scouting and reconnaisance because of the lack of resources.<br><br>but in big maps like Big Game Hunters, its different. its much more brute force. if its 2v2 or 3v3, a common strategy is where one side will quickly triple or double-team one of their opponents. but sometimes people lock themselves in for a while. this can work because the resources are enough to last the whole game, and supply exceeds demand until at least the middlegame. as for 4v4, its always one word: RUSH.<br>note that the player at 5 oclock in BGH is at a disadvantage in the early middlegame because terran can tankdrop at his ledge. the other bases cannot be tankdropped.<br></div>
