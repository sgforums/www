            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. However this kind of scenario only happen during a long game that drags in map with abundant resources. With protoss, you can control triple the amount of troops (carriers &amp; scout, battle cruises &amp; science vessel, devourers &amp; guardians)to destroy your enemy. Furthermore, all your mixed troops can move and attack with added advantage provided by the protoss arbitar, o accompanied by the deadly templars in transport and the invisible observer.<br><br>Normally in Free for all game, then i will use this tactic in a long game with large map against the other players. Otherwise in team play, it will be very risky unless you are on the winning side of the teams controling much area of the map.</div>
