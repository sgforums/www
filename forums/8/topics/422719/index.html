              <p>I've been pondering reality for a long time and had been doing quite a lot of reading, with my main interest in physics, philosophy, psychology, various religions etc.</p>
              <p>My findings is as follows:</p>
              <p>1) There is no soul, no self, no free will, all that is an illusion.</p>
              <p>People might thought of buddhism from the above statement, but it is very true that our perception of self is just an illusion brought about by our various sensory receptors, such as eyes, ears, mind. When each sense are doing their job and our human instinct kicks in, a self develops. The notion of self disappears when we sleep and our sensory receptors shut down.</p>
              <p>From a scientific point of view, the universal law is that every effect is the result of a cause. That is the cause and effect theory. To put it plainly, every thoughts that go through your head right now is the resultant effect of the configuration of hormones, DNA coding, personal experience and it'll obey the rules of physics.</p>
              <p>In theory, a person who had the exact genetics coding with you and who happens to lead a life experience identical to you in every aspect will think exactly like you everytime. There is no water who can choose not to be composed of hydrogen and oxygen, and there is no wood that refuse to be a conductor of fire. Likewise, we as a being make up of physical atoms and molecules, has no control of our own self.</p>
              <p>By saying we have a free will, a soul, capable of making our own decision is a joke! It's the same as suggesting a water or wood has a mind of its own, which we know is not possible. The difference here is we're a complex biological being, which lead to the illusion that we've our own soul, free will etc, which in reality is really an illusion caused by the various cells in our body doing its own work.</p>
              <p>2) We're eternal, ever changing(reborning) from one state to another, never truely born and never truely die either.</p>
              <p>Buddhist believe in reincarnation, but the real reincarnation might be not what they think it is to be. The scientific community had given a really good answer to that.</p>
              <p>According to quantum theory, reality is in an ever continuing state of flux, nothing stays in the same state for a long time, they are constantly moving from one realm to another, from one state to another. It is impossible to have a stationery singularity, since it will move through the fabric of time anyway.</p>
              <p> When we die, all the atoms we have will be returned back to nature, some of the atoms will be remake into plants. some into another living creature, some into the air. I believe this is the reincarnation in reality. In another words, we're make up of all the atoms which are previously from other creature, state and which all combined to make up our temporary body for the time being.</p>
              <p>Another pillar of modern physics, E = mc(square), states that matter is convertable to energy, matter and energy is essential the same thing, they're the same thing in different state and convertable. Since we know energy can never die, but can only be convert from one type to another, so is it hard to see that our own very essence, the very thing that we're make up of, is eternal?</p>

              <p><br>You'll still be around, the very substance that make up your body, including your mind, the millions of brain cells which combined to form your perceive soul will never die, never perish, but they'll not stay in this formation long, and when they're reshuffled into nature, you will no longer be there. In human terms, we call it death, but it's simply a changing of state of the atoms and molecules. </p>

              <p>Okay. I think I want to comment in this post which I have interest in.</p>
              <p>What TS mentioned is just the surface level. Actually go deeper into atoms and molecule level, there is a topic called "quantum mechanics" which is about the particles that made up atoms and molecule. There are also few theories in this topic namely string theory etc etc.</p>
              <p>One thing that I want to say is... acutally we are a type of organism that has our own thoughts. We are able to generate thoughts... Even though we are made up of 99.9% same material, it's the 0.0000001 that made us different. That probably explain why we have different thoughts...</p>
              <p>E=Mc^2 is a very powerful formula. You said energy can never die based on the equation, but I say... energy can be release.</p>
              <p>It's a nerver zero-sum in the Earth context... If you a drumstick, and take a 10km marathon... you are actually burning away calories in order to sustain the run. Intake of energy is less than output of energy :-D if every human being keeps running, one day, our Earth will run out of energy source...</p>

              <p>The ability to generate thoughts is common among other animals too, such as cats or dogs, although their thoughts is not as complex as ours. Thoughts is merely a products of the chemical reaction in the brain. When you have the right conditions in a brain, a perceived self, or soul develops.</p>
              <p>Energy can only be convert from one form to another, never to be make or release. Thats the reason why we're still relying on oil and have not create a so call clean energy yet.</p>
              <p>Basing on your example, if one guy eat a drumstick and run a 10km marathon, the energy provided by that drumstick can't sustain the sufficient energy needed for that run, so what will happen? He will lose weight or water etc since energy is taken out from elsewhere beside the drumstick.  </p>

              <p>There can be only 1 state of true reality. If there seems to be many realities, chances are, all of that is an illusions. The many illusions that you see as reality are merely the different state of the real reality.</p>

              <p>are her premonitions made of energy or chemical reactions then? how can energy itself be an indicator of the future? energy does not have self awareness let alone be a psychic.</p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dreamlander:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I've been pondering reality for a long time and had been doing
              quite a lot of reading, with my main interest in physics,
              philosophy, psychology, various religions etc.</p>
              <p>My findings is as follows:</p>
              <p>1) There is no soul, no self, no free will, all that is an
              illusion.</p>
              <p>People might thought of buddhism from the above statement, but
              it is very true that our perception of self is just an illusion
              brought about by our various sensory receptors, such as eyes, ears,
              mind. When each sense are doing their job and our human instinct
              kicks in, a self develops. The notion of self disappears when we
              sleep and our sensory receptors shut down.</p>
              <p>From a scientific point of view, the universal law is that every
              effect is the result of a cause. That is the cause and effect
              theory. To put it plainly, every thoughts that go through your head
              right now is the resultant effect of the configuration of
              hormones, DNA coding, personal experience and it'll obey the rules
              of physics.</p>
              <p>In theory, a person who had the exact genetics coding with
              you and who happens to lead a life experience identical to you in
              every aspect will think exactly like you everytime. There is no
              water who can choose not to be composed of hydrogen and oxygen, and
              there is no wood that refuse to be a conductor of fire. Likewise,
              we as a being make up of physical atoms and molecules, has no
              control of our own self.</p>
              <p>By saying we have a free will, a soul, capable of making our own
              decision is a joke! It's the same as suggesting a water or wood has
              a mind of its own, which we know is not possible. The difference
              here is we're a complex biological being, which lead to the
              illusion that we've our own soul, free will etc, which in reality
              is really an illusion caused by the various cells in our
              body doing its own work.</p>
              <p>2) We're eternal, ever changing(reborning) from one state
              to another, never truely born and never truely die either.</p>
              <p>Buddhist believe in reincarnation, but the real reincarnation
              might be not what they think it is to be. The scientific community
              had given a really good answer to that.</p>
              <p>According to quantum theory, reality is in an ever continuing
              state of flux, nothing stays in the same state for a long time,
              they are constantly moving from one realm to another, from one
              state to another. It is impossible to have a stationery
              singularity, since it will move through the fabric of time
              anyway.</p>
              <p> When we die, all the atoms we have will be returned back
              to nature, some of the atoms will be remake into plants. some into
              another living creature, some into the air. I believe this is the
              reincarnation in reality. In another words, we're make up of all
              the atoms which are previously from other creature, state and which
              all combined to make up our temporary body for the time being.</p>
              <p>Another pillar of modern physics, E = mc(square), states that
              matter is convertable to energy, matter and energy is essential the
              same thing, they're the same thing in different state and
              convertable. Since we know energy can never die, but can only be
              convert from one type to another, so is it hard to see that
              our own very essence, the very thing that we're make up of, is
              eternal?</p>
