With their childishness, they will abuse the authority. No offence, in my opinion, i feel tat MY UNIT JC officers r all so childish n kiddy when doing things compare to those Poly grad officers.<br><br>I'm from ITE hence i'm not trying to be bais toward those JC n Poly officers. All base on my 1.5 yrs of observation in MY UNIT.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Although I'm an A-level student myself, I really believe that grades should not have too big an influence on OCS selection.God knows what screwed up Specs and men we already have.To take a 3mth recruit , with no knowledge of Army politics in units/formations, with no experience in relating with many differnet types of superiors or subordinates, and throw him in a course for 9-10 months and then ask him to lead a platoon all of a sudden, it does not benefit us or him.Granted,there are good officers out there but that's more of personal integrity and willingness to learn and be humble than the system's merit as a whole.<br><br>We need to make sure that the psychological evaluation is stricter.We're talking about leaders of men here.No way we can play hell with the selection process.I feel that officers should only be selected after at least half a year stint as a Specialist, to let them have a taste of junior command leadership first.What do you think?</div>

I assume that you will be a poly student and a PES B enlistee without getting downgraded/OOC in the future...<br><br>When you are 17.5 years old you will be told to register for NS and you will register NS in that period but don't forget to send your deferment letter from the poly to CMPB. Then in the next 2 years plus SAF will not be 'harnessing' you except that they will send lots of brouchures to you asking you want to sign up.<br><br>Then in the final year of your Poly (i.e 6-9 months before enlisting) you will be told to go CMPB to do medical checkup but the checkup is useless one as CMPB's MO are horrible.<br><br>Also you will required to do NAPFA test in your campus or TPY stadium after the check ups. Details will be reveled by your poly.<br><br>Then 1-2 months before enlistment you will receive the enlistment letter.<br><br>NS starts with BMT... You will take 10 or 16 weeks of BMT (depends on whether you pass your NAPFA or not). After BMT, you will post to the vocation you are suitable with. Be it services (clerk, storeman, mechanics), combat (MP, commandos, guardsmen) or commanders (SISPEC).<br><br>After 2 years of NSF you ORD but NS doesn't stop here. You will be required to take 13 cycles of in camp training until you are 40 years old. Also mobilisation and IPPT tests are also required after you ORD.<br><br>Peoples who exempts from NS are: Physically/Mentally disabled and people with very sick illness like AIDS, Cancers etc.<br><br>For admin work, most are for those PES C and E people where there have medical problems that prevent them from chiong suah but there are also PES A and B people doing clerks too.
