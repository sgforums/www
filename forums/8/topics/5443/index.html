            <div class='col-md body'>Hey listen up, dont kept blaming chief ok. WE WERE THERE like u all. As what i have posted up to firewire's topic, i was already there at 5pm. I waited more than anyone of u all did. And i aint complaining. The fact that we walked around with the word MADZZIE written on a paper around the cafe is more than we should do. What do u expect us to do? Walk around and ask everyone whether if they r there for the outing? First and foremost, its aint chief who organise this "outing". We r just like u all who got played out. Yes we did saw firewire and his friend, but he looked really fierce and pissed off (becos he waited so long). Moreover, we couldnt confirmed if that was him! I aint trying to shift the blame to anyone, its just that it so unfair that chief got blamed for no reason, esp someones comment on him in this topic. Shall we just say this is really a poorly organised outing and lets patch up and forget? Come on, didnt we bring u enough excitment from this forum and not forgetting SGGIRLS ? Again, sorry to those who did turned up and couldnt catch us. We r really sorry.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dear people, why get so worked up?<br>there's always next time and better planning with lessons learnt......<br>organizing an outing for 40 strangers is not easy....although i think its a case of 'dispersed' responsibilitiy shared between everyone.....everbody thinks somebody will go and missing it wont make a diff<br><br>and to firewire....all those things you said about Singaporeans (including those in other topics)  i hope you said it in a fit of anger (in which case you should apologize in due course) coz it really isnt good to hear somebody criticize and entire population.......<br><br>your western upbring may provide a more vocal expression when u feel really pissed.......but dont forget juz cos we keep quiet doesnt mean we arent pissed with you or anything</div>
