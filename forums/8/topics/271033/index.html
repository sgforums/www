            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys<br><br>I really need your advise.<br><br>Last year, my ISP Pacific Internet has overbilled me.  The total amount was totalling more than $400.  I only came to realise this early this year.  I called and they confirmed their mistakes.  They have credited the overbilled amount to my pacnet account which brings a credit balance to my statement of account.  I called again and spoke with a staff Ms F---- to request for refund of this amount.<br><br>Month after month, nothing has happened.  In early May this year, I called and spoke with another staff Ms N-- A----.  This time, I demanded for an emaili confirmation of our conversation to be sent to me.<br><br>This is what she sent:<br>_____________________________________________________<br>From: Pacific Internet [mailto:wecare@pacific.net.sg]<br>Sent: Wednesday, May 09, 2007 5:53 PM<br>To:<br>Subject: Pacific Internet Account: <span style="color: blue;"><span class="small"></span></span><br><br>Dear <span style="color: blue;"><span class="small"></span></span>,<br><br>Thank you for contacting us.<br><br>Referring to our telephone conversation, we wish to confirm that an urgent refund had been processed to your account. The refund which had been raised is as follows:<br><br>Total amount to be refund is $329.89 - 2 months subscription ($19.90 x 2) = $290.09<br><span style="color: blue;">(They minused the two months sub because they claimed that I will get my refund in two months' time)</span><br><br>From the above calculation, you are not liable to pay for the next two months subscription as both subscription fee had been deducted from your initial credit balance of $329.89.<br><br>Once completed, the cheque refund will be sent to your mailing address as per our record at:<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span class="small"></span></span><br><br>We hope the above explanation will revert to you satisfactorily. If you have further enquiries, please feel free to reply to this email or call our Customer Service Executives at 6336 6622 (Option  3), from Mondays to Fridays, 8.30 am to 6.00 pm.<br><br>We look forward to be of continued service to you in the future.<br><br>At your service<br>N-- Am--- | Customer Service Executive, Customer Care<br>Pacific Internet Limited<br><br>Email: wecare@pacific.net.sg<br>Tel: +65 63366622<br>Fax: +65 68726347<br>_______________________________________________________<br><br>Now the month of August is coming, I still have not received anything from Pacific Internet.  I made another call three weeks ago.  A guy staff Mr A---- told me that I can have his word that I would definitely get my cheque before last week.<br><br>Still I didn't get anything.  I called again last week on a Wednesday.  I spoke to a Ms G-----.  I was utterly disappointed after I asked her how she could assist me in following up on this.  She said that she would get Ms N-- Am--- to call me on the following day as the latter was not in on that day.  I got really furious.  I told her she should do her job and follow up on my case instead of making me wait for another day for her colleague to call me.  Then she said she was going to drop an email to the Finance Dept.  I suggested to her that she should make a call instead of emails because I know by her saying that, it's either the customer service would not do any follow up (as proven in my experience with them in the last few months) or the finance dept would not respond immediately.  I told her that she must get back to me on the status within the same day.  As I expected, this Ms G----- failed to get back to me and not even on the following day.<br><br>(to be continued)</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>On the following day, I had to call again (I can safely tell you, in all the follow up, I was and I had to be the one calling them).  I spoke with a girl and she put the call to Ms G----.  Ms G---- said that she already emailed to Finance, but there was no reply.  I told her that I was shocked and disappointed at her service.  This was not a new case or new request.  It was dragging for months and she showed no urgency in resolving this.  When she claimed that she could not reach anyone in Finance Dept on the phone, I told her "If I were you, and if I was committed to my job, I would have gone to the Finance dept to speak about this and not just simply drop an email and wait for something to happen."  She continued to bullShit me by saying that the Finance Dept was very far away.  I told her off by saying that I was familiar with Pacnet internet office structure.<br><br>I further threatened her by saying that I would look for her in her office.  Then she put me on hold for very long time, and came back to me to say that I had to wait 2 weeks for the cheque.  I again got furious and told her off again.  Another two weeks would be August.  That contradicts with their promise earlier that I would get the refund in two months from May.<br><br>It was not that I didn't want to wait for two weeks.  From the work ethics of this batch of customer service staff, I am afraid that two weeks later, I will still not be getting the refund.  And by then, if I call again, they will give me the same kind of bad service (not bother to follow up) and eventually tell me to wait for another two weeks or two months.<br><br>Being unhappy with her answer and the customer service work ethics, I demanded for her superior's name.  She just simply said "Azlina".  I asked for the full name, and she just said "We only know her by Azlina".  So thinking that Ms G---- was trying to play games with me, I now requested for the Customer Service Manager's name.  She put me on hold again for a very very long time.  Then she came back to me and said that the finance dept has already mailed out the cheque and I should be getting it in my letter box by Friday, 27 July 2007.<br><br>On Friday evening, I cleared my letter box and as I expected, the cheque was not there.  Pacific Internet not only provides poor customer service, its customer service staff has poor attitude and little integrity.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I really want to know what kind of legal action I can do against Pacific Internet.  You see, it's my money, my cheque and they are not releasing it.<br><br>Please give me some advice.  Thank you.  </span><br><br>In the meantime, I am contemplating whether to terminate my account with them at all.  I have been with them since 1996 and all my contacts know my pacnet email address.  I really want to stick to the same address for fear that I will lose touch with some of my friends.  It is really difficult for me to decide.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe their reason of not wanting to refund you is because on how their computer systems are programmed.<br><br>You did overpay them but at the same time you still remained a customer. So most companies usually just credit your account and carry on.  Usually they send a refund cheque after you terminated services and still having a credit balance.<br><br>You wanting them to refund you while still a customer usually requires manual override.... so i guess it is human error/non-action on this part.<br><br>In my opinion, you should first try to write in a formal letter to Pacific Internet and see what happens from there.<br><br>As for bringing it to small claims court, it will be quite contentious on few points because pacific net did not "cheat" you of money. They admit the overpayment and that they credited you the $.<br><br>Also, the fact that you were overbilled and you paid up is not going to help in the courts</div>
