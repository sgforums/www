            <div class='col-md body'>How's the market?<br><br>Is it worth it to sell:<br><br>1) HDB Exec Flat -- My friend's friend has been waiting.  But the price is still going down.  Well, she bought at the peak (in 1996) and paid about $526,000.  Very ex hor?<br>Location is at Eunos, near PIE expressway and Kaki Bukit Industrial.<br><br>Will it continue to go down or should she wait for a while more?<br><br>2) Private Condo  -- My another friend's friend has a private condo (about 126 sq metres) in the west side, very near MRT. But it's 99 years leasehold.  Just bought two years and TOP last year.  Paying $690,000.<br><br>She wants to downgrade to HDB, hopefully in the East side.<br><br>What do you think?  Advice please.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The demand of exec. HDB isn't very high cos there are oversupply of new flats &amp; many are now buying 3- 4-rm cos economy not good.<br>For the price of an exec., u can get a 99 yrs condo. with facilities.<br>If your friend gets a good offer, then don't wait any more cos all prop. 99 yrs. start depreciating  as the prop. ages.<br>Freehold prop. are still better cos they appreciate faster.<br><br>Majority of pple loses money cos they bought during the boom period.<br>One of my fren recently cut lost (she lost over $100K), when she sold her 99 yrs. condo &amp; upgrade to freehold.<br><br>Downgrading from condo to HDB will save maintenance fees &amp; utilities etc are cheaper esp. 3- 4-rm. Ask your friend whether she is willing to take the loss.<br><br>U can check with some prop. agts. for the latest HDB prices transacted.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well I have a different perspective on the property market.<br><br>2 years ago I would say HDB market was rock bottom we bought our twin unit jumbo for ard $400k.  2 years before that(dat means 4yrs ago)  we asked another unit a smaller 4 bed rm single unit was asking for 600k+ we told the owner to go fly a kite.<br><br>I think today HDB units are surplus but prices are firming.<br><br>On the private property sector, whether 2 or 4yrs back was hardly any activity, but today take a long bus ride anywhere you will see there is much construction development, flip thru the papers any day of the week you will find public showroom events for property launches going on, in the sunday papers normally in lifestyle every week you will find a section filled with glossy pictures on new homes.<br><br>In the recent news is the massive Sail at marina condo launch by city development<br><br>Wheelock another premier property developer &amp; listed company has also been busy increasing it's land bank &amp; snapping up properties &amp; enbloc sales everywhere &amp; is due to launch it's behemoth 500+ unit condo the seaview(I think is the name) in late 2005<br><br>Then we have launches like the SOHO and others<br><br>- these are the signs &amp; clearly the direction is set already, if property valuations have not improved developers will not risk a loss. If private property does well HDB valuations set to improve.<br></div>
