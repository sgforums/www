Spare a thought for the children' (ST, Oct 15).<br><br>My parents divorced when I was 12 and my brother was 18. Though at the time their divorce was painful for us, I view it now as a period that has made me who I am.<br><br>Their divorce taught me about the endurance of the human spirit and made me confident I would be able to deal with any hardship.<br><br>When my mother was going through her divorce, many well-meaning friends told her not to do it, to think about us.<br><br>However, she was thinking about us. She knew that an unhappy marriage was not a conducive environment in which to bring up two teenagers. My mother went through with her divorce because of us, because she wanted us to grow up without the constant sounds of anger and discord.<br><br>Today, my parents are good friends. I recently graduated from an Ivy League university in the United States and my parents attended my graduation - together.<br><br>People should not stay in an unhappy marriage for the sake of their children because subjecting them to that harsh environment could be more detrimental than it would be if the parents were to go their separate ways.<br><br>Instead, parents who do choose to get divorced should be mindful of their children. Don't engage in lengthy custody battles with the sole purpose of hurting your spouse. Don't force your children to take sides.<br><br>Put your differences aside and make an effort to be cordial because even if you are no longer married to each other, your children will always be a bond between the two of you and you still have to play the role of parents.<br><br>I do not believe that a divorce has to mean the end of a child's future. I believe that, sometimes, a divorce is necessary and how parents choose to handle themselves during and after the divorce is the deciding factor.<br><br>And please don't call my home a broken one. It was broken all along and it became fixed when my parents got divorced.<br><br>SHANTINI SUPRAMANIAM (MS)New York, US<br></div>
