            <div class='col-md body'>Depending on your stage of gestation, the procedure is normally done through the vagina to access the uterus. Like someone already said, the head of the foetus is crushed by forceps then the foetus is taken out. After that, the placenta is then scrapped and vaccumed out also. This works for a foetus that is in the first to mid-second trimester. Any later, and they may suggest that you re-consider to allow the baby up for adoption or to go for a still born through induced delivery.<br><br>Do consider all this carefully. Its not easy, but carrying the baby to full term and then giving it up for adoption may be the better option though more painful as you still give the baby a chance in this world. Further more, abortions can seriously damage your uterus linings and prevent you from conceiving later on in life due to complications. And yes, most abotrions are ambulatory procedures and so you can be discharged on the same day or one day after the procedure. The problem would be finding a qualified surgeon to do this procedure as many would rather turn it down.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just so that you get the correct picture...I will tell you what actually happens.<br><br>The normal pregnancy is divided into three thirds or trimesters. In most cases, termination occurs when the pregnancy is in the first trimester, the fetus is small and there is no need for the graphic 'crushing of the head' story you hear. It is done under general anaesthesia. Everything is done through the vagina. The cervix is gradually dilated with instruments and a vacuum suction device is inserted to suck out the products of conception (which includes the small, developing embryo/fetus, placenta and amniotic sacs). Then another instrument is used to scrape out the lining of the uterus to remove whatever is left behind. The entire operative procedure takes about 30-45 minutes and iis usually done as a day procedure, so the woman can go home on the same day or the next day, depending on when the operation is done.<br><br>For mid-trimester abortions, it is necessary to 'ripen' the cervix with hormones. Then an injection is given to induce premature labour and the fetus is delivered through the vagina like a normal birth. There will be contraction pains but of a lesser degree than normal labour. The fetus is extremely premature and either is dead on delivery or does soon after delivery. Depending on how long the labour process takes, the woman usually may have to stay a night in hospital.<br><br>There is a potential legal problem with mid-trimester abortions. As the fetus may show signs of life after delivery, the doctors have a dilemma as to whether they should resuscitate the extremely premature fetus. This is particularly problematic if the woman is unsure of dates and the fetus turns out more mature than expected, though still within the period for legal abortions. The doctors have a legal obligation to render care to a baby, however premature, as long as it shows signs of life after complete separation from the mother. This is known as 'separate existence' and the fetus becomes a legal entity. (Before that, fetuses do not have legal identities, in other words, they don't 'exist'.) But if the doctors successfully resuscitate the fetus they may be sued for breach of contract since the woman came for an abortion, not a baby. To overcome this problem, some doctors in the West kill the fetus before delivery using high salt solutions (dangerous and now defunct) or crushing the head etc..To my knowledge, that is not a problem in Singapore and premature fetus after abortions in Singapore are simply allowed to die.<br><br>I will not comment on the ethical or moral question of abortion. This is just to answer your question as to what it involves.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If it is you who is considering an abortion, I don't think you can get any better and proper advice than those from our social services. Call up their hotlines and make an appointment with them.  Any decision you make, it should be done under calm and delibrate circumstances. The social services are able to provide you that umbrella. If you are too afraid to approach them alone, call up a trusted friend/ family member/ your boyfriend to go along with u.</div>

They are all performed under GA in a sterile operating theatre.<br><br>In Singapore, abortions are legal and only the consent of the woman is required.
