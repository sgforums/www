            <div class='col-md body'>I had a gay friend who tried to commit suicide before. He wasn't doing it for attention or sympathy. He just couldn't imagine how the future would be like.<br><br>He was young, hunky, and highly educated (law undergraduate in London). By right, he would succeed in life. But he has to face a lot of discrimination in getting a job, housing (in London) etc.<br><br>He also feels that it's much harder for him to have a long-term relationship because of the higher promiscuity rates among gays and the inherent instability of gay relationships( he gave a very complicated explaination; can't remember half of it now).<br>And he can't find many people to talk about it. He can't tell his parents because they'll freak out (it's especially bad for him becos he's the only child). And he doesn't want his other male friends to know in case they become scared of his sexuality and shun him. He only had me and one or two others.<br><br>He has tried to look for positive examples. But he couldn't. The life of some of the older gays looked really pathetic to him.<br><br>He was just a really depressed stage of his life. I find it hard to understand the kind of life he has and even if I don't approve, I dun criticise because I don't know how to make it better for him. I just hope that being there to listen helped.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 19-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My gay friend said he was born with it. He knew he was gay since he was ten years old and he had been supressing it half his life.<br><br>I don't think he was ever forced into it. He's gentle and soft-spoken but he doesn't look or sound effeminate. There's even been girls who's had crushes on him. In fact, being gay is something he had rebelled against because he's Catholic.<br><br>Ponders, I'm very sorry to hear about your friend. Mine had it a lot better becos he doesn't look the part.<br><br>I may sound very liberal about this now but I had a really rude shock when he told me. Gays had been disgusting creatures to me up to that point. Now, because of him, I'm not that judgemental anymore. I even have fun talking about about guys with him. It's much easier to be frank with him than with my girlfriends.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm will everyone out there not be so harsh on these minorities who slash their wrists or do other silly things? I used to think that such people were silly to be wasting their life, moping around and destroying their own body. Until I witness the growing number of friends doing this...<br><br>I spent my wonderful secondary school days in a Catholic girls school. We were all really close and one day, I saw a bandage on my friend's wrist. I was really curious and asked her what happened. Out came a series of stories about liking another girl, family problems and falling grades. She was really worn out and I tried my best to help her see that there is still hope and there is nothing wrong with her because she likes another girl.<br><br>Despite my comforting, she did slash her wrist again. I see her need for attention not from anyone else, but from the girl she likes and perhaps her family.<br><br>But although I am angry with her for being so silly, I could sense her helplessness... She told me she felt numb about life and when she slit her wrist and saw the blood coming out, she could feel that pain so consciously in her body... Only then did she realise that she is alive... How can someone be so hopeless in life? I stood by her and now she is fine.. she has gone straight, and when we recall these incidents, she will smile and gimme a hug.<br><br>If you know of a friend who is doing silly things to herself, take it as an appeal for help. Show concern for her.. and stand by her... else she may not be here the next day</div>
