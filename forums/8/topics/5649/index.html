            <div class='col-md body'>You might want to take a look at Nokia 6150 or Motorola V3668. For the Motorola V3668, teleshop was selling at abt $1000 last yr when it made its debut. Not sure abt the price now, but the v3668 is one solid one. If u dun really need a powerful one, go for 6150 or the startac x. the nokia 3000 series is quite okie too. It comes with a vibrating battery i think. I think Nokia 8810 might be out of your budget but its solid too. Last yr teleshop is selling at abt $1100<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mind (edited 11 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I recommend the Startac X, which I'm carrying now. I bought it last Sept at nearly $500 (this includes a deposit of $100 which M1 will return after 6 months if you don't switch to Singtel).<br><br>The reception is very clear and it's compact. It has the essential features like vibrator mode, divert etc. But if you want to play games or send emoticons, get something else. Check out the features first, it's not as extensive as some phones in the same price range e.g. Nokia 6110.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another thing, after choosing your model, is to choose which service provider. Personally i prefer singtel cos only singtel has 100% coverage. It makes a lot of difference for guys going to tekong, which is all guys. If u are posted to commandos, which means 10 months at tekong, singtel is highly recommmended. My frens tried using m1 at tekong and the reception was real bad. And of course the cost. I think Singtel is more affordable than M1.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I echo Mind's reply....those going to do BMT at Tekong...if your service provider is M1 and you dun want to change(because it is comparatively cheaper than Singtel,I presume?)...then leave your phone at home for your BMT period...not worth your trouble and risk....Tekong really cannot receive M1's signals.....<br><br>------------------<br>Rationale : the use of intelligence to avoid the truth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Couple of quick notes:<br><br>1. Motorola Phones are pathetic. THeir only saving grace is their size. Small. And flat. And they're userfriendly. Why? Cause they have so few features!<br><br>2. Nokia phones are good. The 5110, 6110 and 6150 are really good phones. A tad big but with a slim li-ion battery, the phone's realiable and not that thick. Nokia phones generally have very good reception. Games are a plus too. The 6110 is particularly good since it's a very good fone and it's cheap at $250-300 2nd hand. I would get this phone.<br><br>3. Why would anyone spend &gt;$1000 on a mobile phone? or &gt;$500 for that matter? As long as it works, looks decent, what else matters?<br><br>CDMA Rates: 2cents/min, 4cents/min, 9cents/min during the 6 month promotion. Double it after. BUT M1 is having some deal now when u purchase their CDMA phones but I've never paid much attenion to the ads so I'm not sure what it's all about. Anywya, I think GSM is a better choice. It's not that much more expensive (mind u u get $20 credit compared to $8 for CDMA so it evens out), u can change phone easily and YOU CAN SEND SMS (it's really very very useful!)<br><br>And I don't see how Singtel can be cheaper than M1? Because as long as Singtel gives their free credit in fixed minutes, and M1 gives their credit in dollar credits, M1 will be cheaper right?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yours truly is using a Motorola StarTac X CDMA. The reception is good; better than my previous phone: A Siemens S6 PCN.<br><br>This, I believe is due to the seamless link with the base stations which, no surprise, are provided by Motorola.<br><br>The talk quality ie clarity is superb on the other party's phone; they mentioned that I sound as thou I was like using a fixed line.<br><br>However, there are some gripes about this: The talk quality that U hear will become wobbly when u walk but not when u're in a moving vehicle. I attribute that to the irregular pace when walking.<br><br>However, be prepared to be cut off from your calls in certain areas, esp indoors. M1 CDMA network coverage is inadequate.<br><br>This is actually a wish - I wish the GUI is like Nokia phones; they have the best GUI around.<br><br>Personally, I feel Motorola is more for business while Nokia comes out with funky &amp; interesting phones.<br><br>Samsung has just launched a newer CDMA phone SCH-6000 that is even smaller than SGH-600! I wonder how's the performance of this most expensive CDMA phone......<br><br>I see the potential in M1's CDMA network - It has invested S$10 million - I anyhow guess one, $10 million sounds nice to me!  so far &amp; is going to invest another <a href="http://www.m1.com.sg/m1/corporate/press/150699.html" rel="nofollow">S$15 million</a>.<br><br>The most attractive element of using CDMA is the lower rate compared to M1 GSM and much more cheaper than Singtel Mobile.<br><br>The charge rates for M1 CDMA mobile comms service are as follows:-<br><br>The Chat 188 Plan     Regular Promotion<br>Subscription per month  $18       $18<br>Free talktime per month $8 worth  $8<br>Peak rate per minute     18 cents   9 cents<br>Off-peak rate per minute  8 cents   4 cents<br>Super off-peak rate       4 cents   2 cents<br><br>*Based on super off-peak rate and applies only to local calls.<br>Promotional offer for 6 months.<br><br>And it gets even better!<br>M1 is now offering Free 6 Month Subscription<br>Free 2400 Minutes of Talktime(up to 400 mins of free talktime per month). Free registration and 6 months subscription for Caller Number Display and Voicemail with Digital Paging. Refer to <a href="http://m1.com.sg/m1/new/free6.html?1" rel="nofollow">M1</a>.<br><br>Here are the prices of the currently available CDMA phones:<br><br>Motorola StarTAC  $258<br>Samsung SCH-6000  $488<br>Hyundai HGP 1200  $168<br>Hyundai HGP 230E  $338<br><br>This is a really great deal. Think abt it. M1 is trying to boost its CDMA subscriber base before StarHub comes into operation. This is what U call an pre-emptive strike.<br>Singtel is not even doing anything........yet.<br><br><strong>Who needs the umbrella when U have the nice, warm sun! U only need one Sun and that is M1.</strong><br><br>PS: I do not work for M1 nor Singtel. I'm just a M1 CDMA user, that's all.<br><br>[This message has been edited by LoneStar (edited 12 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Basically, there are a few things about handphones.<br><br>Size, weight, battery lifespan, reception and functions<br><br>Let's assume first that you just want a phone. That's it. To make phone calls and such.....<br><br>Nokia phones generally have the best battery lifespan, since the days of the Nokia 8110, our old fave "banana" phone. Which other brand gives u 5 hours of talk-time? Nokia phones are also the most user-friendly and have the most functions and got the most nice sounding melodies.<br><br>However, Nokia phones suffer from a rather well-known flaw. They're the real fragile phones. The LCD display of a Nokia 6110 is well-known to screw up if u drop it and the phone is not protected by a cover. Likewise for the Nokia 3210.<br><br>Ericsson phones has the advantage of being melody-programmable. U can program just about any song in it. Besides the infamous lid problem of the 768 and the 788, the 377,388,628 and the 688 are quite hardy, with the VERY old 377 being the best of the lot. Though apparantly Ericsson solved the lid problem with the new T18 and T28.<br><br>Let's move on to my phone, the Motorola StarTac X. The StarTac X is the joint 3rd lightest handphone in the market, after the v3688 and the Ericsson T28s, tied with the Philips Genie at 95g. Even the Nokia 8810 weighs 120g.<br><br>Contrary to popular belief and stated by some earlier posts, the StarTac X does NOT suffer from any fragile problem. the StarTac 70, 80 and 90 does, but not the X. The X is DEFINITELY more "drop-proof" than any Nokia handphone. In fact, my X has actually flew and whacked a car (accidentally of course) and nothing happened. My X was bought in November 1998 in its early days and it's still in great condition.<br><br>Though I must admit that all Motorola phones have terrible limited functions and are not user-friendly. They also suffer from the common problem of not being able to tell you the date and time of your missed calls. However, they do (from the X onwards) have the great benefit of having a built-in vibrator. The L-series' vibrator is a bit weak compared to the X's and the v3688.<br><br>Reception wise, the most powerful phone in the market is the Philips Genie. Without a doubt. I'm from the Navy and we "field-tested" just about every phone in the market out at sea, taking into account the different networks of course.<br><br>The Genie wins hands-down, followed by the Nokia 6110. The StarTac X surprisingly comes quite close after them. The Nokia 8810, 3210 on the other hand is terrible. A disgrace to the great 6110. The 5110 is terrible too. Likewise for all the Samsung phones.<br><br>How did we test? Simple. Out at sea, there is no network. We put all the phones together (same network) and approach land. The phone with the strongest reception will be able to receive the network first. So we look at the time discrepancy between the phones receiving the same network.<br><br>This little experiment also taught us one thing. M1 is great in Singapore, but it SUCKS big time the moment u go to the coastal regions. Of course, everyone knows that M1 doesn't work in Tekong. Actually M1 doesn't work anywhere away from the mainland, except Sentosa.<br><br>So what's the moral of the story?<br>If you value weight and compactness, is willing to charge your battery everyday, get the StarTac X. If you want long battery lifespan, and are sure u won't drop your phone, get a 6110. The Motorola L-series is also worth a try. If you want style, get the 3210. The T28 and the v3688 are just not worth the money.</div>
