            <div class='col-md body'>Please forgive me if this has been posted before. Just wondering what do people think about this.<br><br>We always say how prepared the SAF is, the government is prepared, the Civil Defence Force will be able to respond well etc.<br><br>But what about the General Public? Are Singaporeans prepared?<br><br>How do you think Singaporeans would react to a major emergency ie. Terrorist Attack, Earthquake, Viral Outbreak, War, your general Sh1t-Hits-The-Fan situations? (I'm coming up with BS situations so work with me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>-How many people you know have knowledge about basic First-Aid?<br>-Do people know where the bomb shelters are? (Newer homes with the built in bombshelters not included... find the idea rather odd in the first place but that will be another topic)<br>-Do you have a First-Aid kit at home?<br>-Reactions of the general public after any emergency/major situation? (Terrorist attack, people start blaming local Muslims for it. Looting when Law &amp; Order breaks down etc.)<br><br>The Government has been encouraging Singaporeans to get a 'Ready Bag', just in case of an emergency. And there has been a increase in talk about being prepared for an emergency since the Dec 26 Tsunami. Generally talk about be ready for an emergency.<br><br>My question at the Singapore Armed Forces forum in the topic "CAn singapore really defend itself??", not much response from that end.<br><br>Here's the post<br><blockquote>Here's my question might be a little off-topic, How would the situation be like among the civilian population in Singapore once the fighting reaches our shores or even before? Your average Singaporean isn't even prepared for a minor incident let alone a full scale war. If the war is a long one we will be in deep trouble.<br><br>If there is a long term conflict, food supplies would run low once the ships stop coming, the government may have set aside a certain amount of food just in case the brown stuff hits the fan but how long can the supplies last. Soon after the supplies run out, you'll have people fighting over food and I doubt your local NTUC would still be stocking up food by then and I think they would run out of stocks once war is declared. Like the rush to buy masks during the SARS period.<br><br>Why would people fight over food? Why should your child eat while mine starve.<br><br>Would there still be Law and Order on the streets even with panic among the population? Once law and order breaks down the situation may go from bad to sh1t. Looting?<br><br>I'm confident in the SAF, what I'm not so sure about is the local population.</blockquote>So as the topic describes 'Would Singaporeans react well?'<br><br>There is no need to flame, I just wish to see the opinions of people.</div>
