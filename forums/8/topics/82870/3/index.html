The route i took is the same as the 1 i described above except tt this time after east coast park, i use Tanah Merah Ferry road instead of Changi COast road.<br>Tanah Merach Ferry rd is slightly better lar.....in the sense tt the road is wider and u will feel less threatened by the passing construction dump trucks.(THey are currently constructing the NeWater plant there)<br><br>I believe the no man's land u r referring to is the plot of land between Tanah Merah Ferry ROad and CHangi COast rd..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
