            <div class='col-md body'>The govt encouraged us to use more public tranport and yet wants to increase the transport fees. Maybe it will become an annual increment. What do you think? I am definitely against it.<br>By increasing the fees, the public transport will expensive.

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha, an increase of 5-20 cents has already made people imply that Singapore is a hell to live in. Well, Millennium, why not you join in our discussion at "Contented In Life" ? We'll see what you've got to offer.<br><br>Well for this fee hikes, let's not be myopic. Don't get me wrong, i am not a PAP fanatic. Let's look at the market of public transport in Singapore.<br><br>Public transport is no longer government owned (with the exception of MRT which is partially owned by the government, but the government has the intention to fully privatise it "when the time is ripe"). The public transport companies involved in this hike are :<br><br>TIBS Holdings Limited<br>Singapore Bus Services<br><br>Since they are privately owned, their main interest is to make money from the services they provide. We can't expect a company to sell you something at a price lower than the manufacturing price right ? So how are these companies performing in terms of revenue ? Let's see.<br><br>The last fee hike is in 1997.<br><br>The sales growth of TIBS Holdings (1400 workers, 184.7 million Singapore dollars market capitalisation) are :<br><br>1997 = 13.7%<br>1998 = 8.9%<br>1999 = 3.6%<br><br>Do you see a decrease in sales growth ? At this rate of decrement, if you do a little bit of Maths, you'll discover that the sales growth will be about -1.5% in year 2000. Negative ! That means the company is not growing anymore, in fact, growing negatively !<br><br>SBS is owned by the private corporate Delgro Corporation Limited (8500 employees, 618.4 million Singapore dollars market capitalisation). It operates about 200 services with more than 2,400 buses daily. SBS carries 2.5 million passenger trips a day and <strong>relies entirely on fare revenue to finance its operations</strong><br><br>here's the sales growth of the company :<br><br>1997 = 28.7%<br>1998 = -11.8%<br>1999 = -5.2%<br><br>as you can see, the sales has already become negative.<br><br>Public transport is very different from other industries in any country because the revenue of the company relies fully on the transport fees and it can't "expand its market" cos the market is limited by the population of the country which is more or less constant over a few years. So with the other prices (bus servicing, repair and maintanence, employees' salaries etc) increasing, how can you expect the revenue of the company to remain stagnant ?<br><br>In market analysis, it is definitely reasonable to increase the transport fees annually since our inflation rate is not zero. But because the fee hikes involve the interest of the public hence a government body (Public Transport Council) is set up to monitor it and any increase in fees can only be implemented if the body gives the green light.<br><br>As for the case of the MRT, it is NEVER earning money. This is also part of the reason why it is "not the time" to privatise it fully since who will want to operate an organisation which is not making money ?<br><br>Hope this information gives you people a better understanding of the fee hikes.<br><br>------------------<br>"Life is about making choices.

            <div class='col-md body'>For your info :<br><br>The Public Transport Council yesterday stressed the requirements it has laid down for operators for the rest of the year, to justify the fare increase.<br><br>They include: Reducing overcrowding during peak periods and providing more direct and more reliable services.<br><br>When contacted, the main operators listed quickly the efforts they have recently made to improve their services.<br><br>Tibs, for example, has invested over $100 million in 300 buses since 1997, and will boost its fleet by 30 per cent this year to 780. It is also looking to introduce up to eight new direct services this year. SBS is bringing in more low-floor Superbuses, and introducing more short trips along the popular routes.<br><br>On its part, SMRT has ordered 16 new trains costing over $200 million and has upgraded MRT stations. It said that improving train frequency had upped costs by $200,000 each year, and will continue similar efforts.<br><br>The fare hikes are also meant to help operators meet rising costs.<br><br>A Tibs spokesman noted that manpower and fuel costs had ballooned by as much as 19 per cent, compared to 1997.<br><br>SMRT added that cooling the interior of its trains by an additional 1 deg C increased its electricity bill by $1 million.<br><br>THE Public Transport Council has laid down the challenge for public-transport operators here to better their services, in return for the higher fares it has approved. Among the improvements planned:<br><br><strong>MRT: </strong><br><br>Sixteen new trains worth over $200 million.<br><br>More frequent service during high-peak hours.<br><br>Fewer delays and higher reliability of trains.<br><br>Better and cleaner facilities at the MRT stations.<br><br><strong>Buses: </strong><br><br>More direct routes to cut down transfers.<br><br>New feeder routes to serve new towns.<br><br>More buses.<br><br>More low-floor buses for easier access into the buses.<br><br>More frequent service during high-peak hours and along popular routes.<br><br>Better bus maintenance to improve reliability of buses on the road.<br><br>Remember : Fee hikes is not INITIATED by the government, it is initiated by the private corporate. And for every increase in fees, the corporates have to justify for it and at the same time, state their future plans for improvement.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Belittled (edited 21 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well Belittled, looks like i am out to get you, hahahaha  :p<br><br>Looks like you have done your homework on TIBS Holdings and Delgro. Well done ! But it is just your luck that you have met me. I am here to prove that your market analysis of the 2 companies is WRONG.<br><br>Your figures are correct. But sales growth does not reflect the revenue of a company. If a company earns 1 million in 1996 and 1 million in 1997, his sales growth is 0 % but he still earns 1 million.<br><br>A look at sales (not sales growth) is more accurate here<br><br><strong>Delgro</strong><br><br>sales of Delgro for the past 3 years :<br><br>1997 = 902.495 millions<br>1998 = 796.180 millions<br>1999 = 754.904 millions<br><br>so they are still earning 700++ millions in 1999, although their sales growth is negative.<br><br>Delgro's corporate performance is usually compared to these 3 companies :<br><br>Niigata Kotsu Co. Ltd<br>Fuji Kyuko Co. Ltd<br>Meiko Trans Co. Ltd<br><br>and among these 4 companies (including Delgro), Delgro performed best in terms of sales with 443.536 millions in fiscal year 1999. So is Delgro doing badly ? NO ! In fact, he is outperforming all the rest in the same market ! Delgro has also been giving dividend for 6 straight years. Will a company who is not doing well be giving out dividend to share holders for 6 straight years ? Even during the economic crisis ?<br><br><strong>TIBS </strong><br><br>Sales of TIBS for the last 3 years are :<br><br>1997 = 176.869 millions<br>1998 = 192.591 millions<br>1999 = 199.484 millions<br><br>Increasing isn't it ?<br><br>TIBS is usually compared to these 3 companies :<br><br>Hong Kong Ferry (Holdings) Co. Ltd<br>Keishin Warehouse Co. Ltd<br>Sugimura Warehouse Co. Ltd<br><br>and among these 4 companies (including TIBS), TIBS performed BEST in the fiscal year 1999. In fact, it is the ONLY company which still enjoy a positive sales growth of 3.6 % ! The rest are having -7.7%, -14.9% and -5.5% as their sales growth. So is TIBS performing badly ?  NO ! Like Delgro, it is outperforming everybody else in the market ! TIBS has also given share holders dividends for the past 6 years.<br><br>How do you explain this now ?<br><br>------------------<br></div>

So let's take a look at the profitability (expenses taken into account) of the 2 companies :<br><br><strong>Delgro</strong><br><br>In 1999, earnings before extraordinary items at Delgro Corporation Limited were 66.52 million Singapore Dollars, or 8.8% of sales.

This was <strong>significantly better</strong> than the 1.3% return the company achieved in 1998. (Extraordinary items have been excluded).<br><br><strong>TIBS</strong><br><br>In 1999, earnings before extraordinary items at TIBS Holdings Ltd. were 7.38 million Singapore Dollars, or 3.7% of sales. This profit margin is <strong>an improvement</strong> over the level the company achieved in 1998, when the profit margin was 1.6% of sales.<br><br>The company's return on equity in 1999 was 5.4%.

            <div class='col-md body'>Why don't we just accept the fare increase as it is now and see if the improvements the transport companies they promise will come along with the fare increase happens,if the improvements happens,then i think the fare increase is justifiable,but if the improvements like more buses,more routes etc etc do not happen.then that time we make a fuss about the fare increase is still too late,what we say now will not delay or affect the fare increase in any way,so let us just sit back and observe if the transport companies promise us all the benefits which comes with the fare increase  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

I am not against the fees hike but is this the right time to do it ? From the corporate analysis i presented, you can see that the company is not "hard up".<br><br>We have just emerged from the economic crisis.

Have the salaries of the people being restored after the crisis ?<br><br>Our non-oil export may be overwhelming in this Quarter, in fact, it is a new high for Singapore. But it takes time for these money to reach the commoners. It takes time for the citizens to enjoy the robustness of the economy.<br><br>Should we wait some more time before increasing the transport fees ?<br><br>Is this fees hike a continuation of the taxi fees hike which took place not too long ago ?</div>

It is also looking to introduce up to eight new direct services this year. SBS is bringing in more low-floor Superbuses, and introducing more short trips along the popular routes.<br><br>On its part, SMRT has ordered 16 new trains costing over $200 million and has upgraded MRT stations. It said that improving train frequency had upped costs by $200,000 each year, and will continue similar efforts.<br><br>The fare hikes are also meant to help operators meet rising costs.<br><br>A Tibs spokesman noted that manpower and fuel costs had ballooned by as much as 19 per cent, compared to 1997.<br><br>SMRT added that cooling the interior of its trains by an additional 1 deg C increased its electricity bill by $1 million.<br><br>THE Public Transport Council has laid down the challenge for public-transport operators here to better their services, in return for the higher fares it has approved. Among the improvements planned:<br><br>[b]MRT: </strong><br><br>Sixteen new trains worth over $200 million.<br><br>More frequent service during high-peak hours.<br><br>Fewer delays and higher reliability of trains.<br><br>Better and cleaner facilities at the MRT stations.<br><br><strong>Buses: </strong><br><br>More direct routes to cut down transfers.<br><br>New feeder routes to serve new towns.<br><br>More buses.<br><br>More low-floor buses for easier access into the buses.<br><br>More frequent service during high-peak hours and along popular routes.<br><br>Better bus maintenance to improve reliability of buses on the road.<br><br>Remember : Fee hikes is not INITIATED by the government, it is initiated by the private corporate. And for every increase in fees, the corporates have to justify for it and at the same time, state their future plans for improvement.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Belittled (edited 21 April 2000).][/B]</blockquote></div>

BUT in order to reduce overcrowding, YOU NEED MONEY.<br><br><blockquote><br>a. Sixteen new trains worth over $200 million.<br><br>b. More frequent service during high-peak hours.<br><br>c. Fewer delays and higher reliability of trains.<br><br>d. More direct routes to cut down transfers.<br><br>e. More buses.<br><br>f. More frequent service during high-peak hours and along popular routes.<br></blockquote>all points a to f reduces overcrowding during peak hours and they need money to be implemented.
