            <div class='col-md body'>This bring to another face of the problem faced or to be faced by SATS.  Its outsourcing exercise will cause 1000 to lose their job.  What happen to those not retrenched, how they will feel, how they will react in future?<br><br>In the past, if you stick to your company through thick and thin you will be rewarded by longer leave allowance, long service award, long-term carrer path = regular promotions.<br><br>Now, you will be ask to go for reason such as improving efficency by outsourcing.  No body will be spared.  There is no more talk of loyalty and dedication, rather talk of "when I can make use of you I will pay you, if not out you go".<br><br>"No wonder some body start to cut wires in the planes."<br><br>Will somethings similar happens to our own carrer to make it stay on the ground as ditzy said.
