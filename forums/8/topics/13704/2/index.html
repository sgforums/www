Sigh. I'm in a fix now. Dunno should go or not. But I really wanna go cos all my life I've been living under my parents' wings and I would really like to go there and experience different things and also lah..my bf is going, then got company mah. If I work for two yrs then go for my Masters, he already graduate liao lor.<br>Maybe by then, I might get married liao leh? When get married liao, got family committment...cannot say wanna go overseas to study then go like that mah. So I think this is the best time.<br>But I have so many considerations lor. Money is the least of my problems...just whether it is stupid to spend so much money on a Master degree but in the end the Master degree is like no use cos I no working experience.<br><br></div>

In SIM, RMIT cources are offered. If you take it here, the cert will be exactly the same as the cert you'll be getting if you study there. No diff lor. Not like what I'm doing. Mine is a University of London cert...but on my cert, there'll be an 'external' word...showing I'm an external student. And that 'external' makes alot of diff! And my friends all say RMIT fees are damn expensive. Dun think expensive means good lor. What I heard is that it is just an average school. And I can tell you, alot of people are holding RMIT certs...and alot are from SIM. So if you want to get an RMIT cert, might as well get it in SIM...final yr get to go Aus RMIT for a few weeks or so to study on campus there lor.<br>Monash is not a bad school. Heard it's mainly for business too...not so sure about for other courses. That's one of my choices too. But I most probably will be opting for Uni of Western Aus cos my bf is probably opting for that school too to study IT stuff. And my friend said UWA is not bad for business too..so that is probably my choice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well seriously whether or not the school is good or bad really doesnt matter that much. Cos all schools are good, it just depends on whether or not if u r hardworking enough to excel. So what if you went into Yale or Harvard to do a degree and got all C for it? Your degree may be famous but your grades sux. Similarly if you go to a not so famous University, and u get all Ace, now thats a different case. Cos nowadays employers dont look at where u get the degrees cos everyone is flying out of sg to get one. Of cos i didnt say they dont care, but they dont place so much emphasis anymore, what they want is whether or not you excel when u r in school. Get involved with a professor and help him/she in a research project or something like that. Gain experince and do well in your courses. Who knows that once u graduated with distinction, u r offered a scholarship at some other big Universities in US or UK or u r head hunted before you graduated.<br>Well if lets say u r really intending to go Aussie, why not do a bachelor there and then go North to America or UK to do a Master? I can tell u that a bachelor in business, or info tech or engineering is no longer enough in the ever power hungry sg. Now everyone is asking for a Master in this or that.<br>Its a cheaper alternative to do three yrs in Aussie to get a Bach and then one or two yrs in US or UK to do a Masters.</div>
