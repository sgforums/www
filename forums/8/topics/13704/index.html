            <div class='col-md body'>Depends on what courses you r intending to major. Generally good Universities are UMel, UNSW, USyd, ANU, UQ. But if u r intending to do something in technology, then its best u go to Unis that r specialise in technology stuff like QUT, RMIT etc.<br>It also depends on ya budget and your personalities. If you dont mind spending more, than go to Sydney or Melbourne. If on tight budget then consider Perth or Queensland. If you are very anti social, then ANU might be suitable for you. Melbourne is pretty dead also. If you r a party animal, then consider Queensland or Sydney.<br>Consider other places instead of Aussie, what about Canada? I am studying here and the Unis here r excellent in computer stuff but your grades must be high to enter (generally straight Ace.. at least B+)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Potato: read my posts above for a list of some US colleges.  Costs vary from country to country, state to state, and even city to city.  Private schools are generally more expensive due to better facilities and smaller class sizes.  I think AU will be a better option for you, as you have to put living expenses into consideration, on top of tuition fees.  Check the school's website for more details on the estimated annual costs, and maybe add around $5000 for living expenses.<br><br>monkeying: In my opinion, RMIT is over-rated, partly due to the name of the school (typical Singaporean mentality).  Its tuition fees are extremely high compared to other schs, but its accomplishments pale in comparison to its peers.  To put it bluntly, they are there to suck your $$$.  I think other reputable schs shld have sufficient facilities for their students, but you'll probably get your own computer instead of working and sleeping in computer labs.  Most private colleges generally have better facilities anyway.  From what i know, Curtin receives pretty generous fundings for research purposes.<br><br>Monash is not bad, and a very popular choice among Singaporeans.  But its more of a business school, rather than a technical one.  If you want to do some networking, that's a rather good place to be.  Most ppl I know go there for business and communications.<br><br>[This message has been edited by delerium (edited 22 February 2002).]</div>
