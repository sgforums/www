            <div class='col-md body'>I just started new relationship with this girl. I took her to a fancy restaurant. She think I am very rich. So she ordered a lot of expensive foods and costs up to 988 SGD. I lan lan paid all and drop her home. Before she left the cab, she said goodbye and I asked me whether the foods serve her is nice. She called me out from the car and kick me in the nuts. I fell down and she said Game Over to me. Is she too harsh?</div>
