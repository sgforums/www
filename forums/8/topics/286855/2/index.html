            <div class='col-md body'>I was eating pizza at home today when I saw a my neighbour and a guy dining at a fancy restaurant on the right side of my house. They ordered a lot of food which looks like about 988 SGD. I saw the guy paying the waiter and then they both get inside a car and drive from the right side of my house to the left side of my house which is her house. Before she left the car, I heard him say goodbye and ask her whether the food was nice. I then saw her call him out from the car and kick him in the nuts. He fell down and she shouted Game Over to him. Was I too harsh?<br><br>btw there is a conti prob in the story. she havent get out of the car how she ask him to "come out" and kick him? read the original story n u noe wad i mean.</div>
