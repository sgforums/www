            <div class='col-md body'>Liu Huimin<br>06 Jun 2002 08:31 am    Singtel, SBS &amp; SMRT fare adjustment<br><br>I am grossly disappointed that when the country's economy is still in the woods, there are so many fare adjustments. It reflects on the unbridle greed of the management of these corporations.<br><br>Pls know all these are necessities that even the poor and those out of jobs need them. Which of them can we do without nowadays?<br><br>Take the case of Singtel, is the public responsible for the poor investment it made in Australian Optus? They have the monopoly of the telecommunication industry for so long, God knows how much they had fleeced from the public ( a pager subsription used to cost about $100 per month!). I wonder why IDA has to compensate them. This is what we call too much hand-holding, a cradle for greed also.<br>As for SMRT and SBS, they are providing ''public'' transport! The fact that they hv the monopoly of the whole industry more or less has make them very sensitive to a slight dip in the profits, Mind you, the whole world is in recession and you still expect to maintain the same big fat profits?<br>The fact that they make a loss in the wrong investment decision like the newspapers, Today should not mean that the public have to make good the losses. Outsiders not known to the truth will never know that SBS paid out huge bonuses to its staff the year when the bus fare was increased. Who gets the bulk of it, the management of course! And when the management made a wrong investment decision that caused a dip in the bottomline? The public has to be bear it for them. I think it is time the top management grow up &amp; learn to take rsponsible for the wrong deicsions they make and not make the public pay for them.<br><br>How unfair, in good times, they pay themselves big fat bonuses on the grounds that they have lead the company well. In bad times, in order to enjoy the same, the public has to bear the heat. In the US and Japan, management would take a deeper cut in salary or even forfeit their bonus so that the staff keep their jobs. Here, we chop off the lower rung first so that the top management still even bonus that even they are embarrassed to announce.<br><br>Now that the government has done so much for corporates, it is time the manangment learn to take responsibility and not pass on the burden to the poor general public.<br><br>The rich is never affected by all these changes, likewise the top governemnt officers as they don't take public transport.<br><br>Pls spare a thought for the poor. I have just taken a pay cut yet all other expenditure that is so basic is increasing. Life is really hard.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> So what say you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH</span>[/b]</div>
