            <div class='col-md body'>difficult to say things in BGR stuffs, caused no matter how you view it, only the 2 of them knows what is happening...the best thing to advise is to ask both of your frenz to sit down and talk over it, escape from reality is not a good way to solve things. In BGR, comunication is the MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR!!! If you can't do that, your marriage will failed. It is also very important to GIVE and TAKE...but in this case, the girl is GIVING TOO MUCH and the guy is TAKING TOO MUCH...no good too...must be balance...YIN and YANG<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>The important thing was to love rather than to be loved.

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, I would like to conclude that I am the G that Kyo23 is mentioning.<br><br>I am not demanding towards my bf and I had actually giving in at all times. I always hope that he can accept me for what i am and love me for who I am.<br><br>Indeed I had spurge a lot of money on him, KYO23 is wrong because the wedding package I had paid for myself. My bf is the one who wants to ROM because he wants to give me a certaincy.<br><br>Do u guys know that I paid the ROM $26 fees as well??? I did not said that he is poor or what and I need material. My bf is the one who wants me to have the wedding package. He is the one who said that he wanted to marry me in the first place. Kyo23, y didn;t u mentioned that?<br><br>I am working in Jurong Island and I stayed in the central. My company provide lodging for me over there and yet my bf is the one who wants me to move in with him. He stayed in the west and I need not get up so early everyday.But less then 3 months, he had asked me home for 4 times. He said he wanted his own life without me and I dun understand y... He wants his time he can have it all. NOw he is driving th car and I had to spend another $800 extra on my transport per month. I really wonder who am I to him...<br><br>For God Christ sake, If I am demanding, I would have turn the table over long time. Y do I have to torture myself in this case?<br><br>My ex bf, yes we almost got married. He backen off the idea because his ex gf came back to him and he beats me up. I made a police report.... and my long hair had been cut off by him. It was a nitemare and in the end he apologized and he wanted the things to go on. I am the one who dump him because I hate guys to abused woman.<br><br>My bf is the one who treats me like puppet. I feel that at times, when he is happy, he would treat me extremely nicely. If not he just throw me in a corner.<br><br>Now to me, the bf I used to know is no longer here. The guy who I am facing now is a stranger to me at all. I am mentally break down already and I even suicide last nite. All I am asking for is a complete love and care because I dun have it all from my family. My bf gave me so many promises that I believed that he is the guy that I can trust and love but ,,, it turns out to be that I am nobody in his life. He said that from his own mouth.<br><br>How hurt can i be no body knows. I am been neglect and like a begger begging for his love and care. I feel that I am carrying a hatred bag more than a normal person.<br><br>I had never recieved any materials things from him except cards and a watch. All I wanted him is to save his money but he is spending it on those lan games. 24 hours a day is not enuff for him to play. I cannot say much too but do u know that I had lost my friends and time because of him?<br><br>If he had not became this way now, things would not happen. He is more self centred and he dun care about how others see him, He is always the right party.<br><br>I am tired of all these .... he had played me out on marriage for 3 times already. I did not asked him to do this ...<br><br>DUN POINT THE FINGER AT ME</div>
