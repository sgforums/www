Naturally G feels that B's love for her is questionable; hence possibly her increasing amount of demand and request for their marriage to test and c B's sincereity. I do agree with G's method to test B's love for her.after all, even u urself feels that B is starting to take G for granted liao and G somemore is a gal, so naturally she would want to marry a guy who can offer her a sense of security like most gals do( correct?)<br><br>Well..what B can do now is to really have a nice talk with G and assure her that he will try his best while at the same time making his words worth every cent. After all, u haven't mention much bout whether B did show his effort in wooing G's heart back so i wouldn't really trust B's sincereity. Who can definite ensure that B won't get back to his own self , living off on G when they get marry? it'll be unfair to G rite? As a frz to both of them, wat u can do now is to encourage and persuade ur B frz to buck up and sweet talk G at the same time loh for the moment while B works hard liao loh...<br><br>I believe that when G starts to be convinced that B really loves her and shows her his sincereity, G will definitely lower down her expectations and demand for the marriage loh (remember , if she really love B, she won't bear to c B slog like hell juz to provide for her unneccessary demands de loh).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MayBe these are their problems:<br>1) Pressure that comes from financing (eg. $200K for 5-room flat, $25K for renovation, $3K for wedding photo, $10K for hotel booking, $4K for honeymoon). This is only an eg. but look at that figure !!! Unless both earnings adds up to at least $5K per mth. and they are working for at least 2 years.....quite a task u noe?<br><br>2) G might feel that B is not putting enough effort to help her thru' the pressure of organising the series of events for starting a family.<br><br>I have seen couples that went thru' thick and thin in their wedding prep. It's a beautiful sight to behold when u see 2 people from diff. background working together and striving towards one purpose.<br><br>Quarreling is common among new wedding couples becos of the pressures but they must learn to overcome their differences.<br><br>I felt that G should wake up and face the reality. Playing CS is good for reliefing stress but after that you still need to face it. So why not solve it earlier???<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah!!! that's a whole lots of serious advice. Thanks guys.<br><br>1stly, staying out of marriage is what i think the ger does not hope for cause she really want to get marry. She was once on the verge of getting married with her ex when her ex suddently back off. That's a really sad case and her $20k for the downpayment for their new flat was hence confiscated and her ex din lose anything. I donno why she want to chip in anyway. Maybe her ex was also a poor chap or conned her into it. Well as for my friend to take devil1976, hm...it seem to be a way out but not being appropriate after being with the girl for so long and the girl sacrificing until like that. Anyway think my friend is already tired of bgr after so much past failure with those younger one.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DarkSimon &amp; MCD<br><br>That's a very great help there with your detailed analysis and advice.<br><br>1stly, Ger G is indeed getting frustrated and losing confidence for the marriage due to B's recent bad performance.<br><br>2ndly, marriage prep or even a ROM can really cause alot of quarrel to occur between couple even for me and my wife. But we will go thru thick and thin in the preparation like MCD had said.<br><br>Well, i think B is putting in effort (always trying to help my frn) or else he would not had slept at the staircase outside his gf G's flat for one nite when ger G was terribly upset over these thing. Some of disappointing thing that my frn did was he had a nice tok with the girl and assure her but in the end he did not keep his promise to accompany ger G for a wonderful christmas nite shopping thru orchard but instead spend the day and ni playing CS. Peng!! really donno how to help him liao. CS so much attraction meh?? I myself also playing CS sometime to release work stress but not as hard-core as him. Almost everyday after work can see him there. Go back home also play.</div>

Thanks guys.<br><br>1stly, staying out of marriage is what i think the ger does not hope for cause she really want to get marry. She was once on the verge of getting married with her ex when her ex suddently back off. That's a really sad case and her $20k for the downpayment for their new flat was hence confiscated and her ex din lose anything. I donno why she want to chip in anyway. Maybe her ex was also a poor chap or conned her into it. Well as for my friend to take devil1976, hm...it seem to be a way out but not being appropriate after being with the girl for so long and the girl sacrificing until like that. Anyway think my friend is already tired of bgr after so much past failure with those younger one.</div></blockquote>CONSIDER this, there MUST have been a REASON why the EX of G wanted to back out from the marriage during the last min?

But i guess the reason why G's ex back off is maybe becos he got another affair with a much prettier girl. You see the point is that i never mention G being pretty at all. To me, she look average and maybe abit over her age 23yrs old and also abit on the plump side but still ok. I really don see any major problem with her then.<br><br>Well, it's really complicated, i m just doing my small part to help them by consoling G and telling off my friend B for his wrong-doing and avoid a breakup between them two. It's really up to both of them in the end.<br><br>All in all, i can really see the negative comment about their relationship. Just can't bear to be like the rest to break them up although it is maybe for their own good like what devil had suggested.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 28 December 2001).]</div>

It would not hurt her TOO much to put off the wedding, come on, be realistic, she is only 23? Time is on her side. The impetus lies on B instead. Instead of grumbling about her high Demands for the wedding..blahblah.. he should at least take a good look at himself first before criticising his gf. I don't think G is trying to extort himsince she very well know about B's financial stuff. Maybe she is just trying to get him to 'wake up' and 'face the music'.<br><br>Honestly, the couple ain't ready for the commitment. A word of advice to all aspiring husband-and-wife wannabies, before taking the plunge, go a marriage prep course. It brings the couple on a journey on the different aspects of life after marriage.
