              <p>My dream place is a place where it is a rural setting. Not many people, and with wide open spaces. Close community bond, close relation with family and relatives and neighbours. There is no fence. There is plants and trees, and shrubs, and small rivers. The temperature is pleasant all year round. Ideally, early morning it would be a little cool. People do siestas during midday. This place is also friendly to dogs and other domesticated animals.</p>
              <p>In front, there is small river. Beach would be ideal but maybe I'm asking too much for it. Then there is some hills nearby. Mountain would be ideal but lets not get too greedy.</p>
              <p>During some months there is a gentle thin mist. Well, it looks like a fog. But a mist would do.</p>
              <p>In this place, there is little technology, little hurry, and little haste. Everything is peaceful and tranquil.</p>
              <p>Most importantly, the human relations. The community should be strong and consist of families living together. Relatives are nearby. Clans are nearby. There is a focal point like a village hall or a temple / church.</p>
              <p>The land is fertile and can produce fruit trees. You can plant mango tree, banana tree, jackfruit tree, and you can pick it directly and use it often. You can plant potato, melons, and so on. Everything is fresh from your own garden.</p>
              <p>This place has no mosquitoes, no snakes, no cockroaches, no lizards and spiders. But there are some cats, dogs, some four legged animals (horses and cows would be Ok, but not too many)</p>
              <p>During early morning, the water would be cool. The floor cool.</p>
              <p>Yes, I love this place.</p>
