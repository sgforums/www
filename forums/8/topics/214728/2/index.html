It looks easy but it in fact is tough as hell. Easy to say start small. In fact, the smaller your business, the harder you work. Too small a business with no/ little  funds, you can't employ pple. End up, u do everything. It's 24/7. No holidays, no leave...... Work for other pple is different wor.  8 or 9 to 5 or 6, mebbe a bit of ot here &amp; there. Got leave, can take mc. If u run a biz and fall sick, no such thing as mc. See doctor, means $. Dun open for biz means jia kaki. Oso u think that wenu run your own biz= no bosses? If u really think so, U r completely wrong. U'll have even more bosses as every customer is your boss and u have to please every single one with very different character. Think so easy to run your own biz.......?

If you think you like that kind of job as a managing director (reach organization targets, strategies to hit targets, employee's satisfaction, innovation, resources allocation, threats from competitors ...and so on and so fo) then go ahead.
