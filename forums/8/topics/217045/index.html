            <div class='col-md body'>i thought about these issues before and true, what is life about? afterall, everybody's gonna die and whatever you do in life becomes nothingness isnt it. so why bother to work so hard?<br>i learnt something as i grew up and went through the stages of kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. what we achieve then really seems so insignificant and unimportant to us now. it was a big deal getting first in class in p1 but if you talk about it now, its like peanuts; there are more things to worry about now. what im trying to say is that achievements do wear out and when you reflect upon them now, you wonder how you work so hard for?<br>my conclusion is that while life may pass, it may be worthwhile to just give the best as you go through it, live life to the fullest, and dont limit yourself to what you can do. try new things, after all, you only live life once and since you are going to die anyway, why not go take some risks, have fun, instead of stressing yourself up with academic achievements<br></div>
