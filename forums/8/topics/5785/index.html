            <div class='col-md body'>This will certainly cause anger in a lot of Christians.  But my question applies to all religions as each has their own "sacred verses".  Chirstianity is just taken as an example.<br><br>I base my argument on the following:<br><br>Those who studied chinese Lit. would have known that In the olden times of China, anyone who dares to insult the authorities / the comment on the foolishness of the emperor would be beheaded, if not heavily punished.  Thus, the only way is to tell stories, like "Liao Zhai"... to indirectly criticise the unfairness in the society.  Stories like Ne Zha, the legends of God.  E.g Taoism, where there is this Emporer (Yu huang da di) with the lower-level gods.  The heavenly beings, being heavenly, also fight against each other.  Ok, i think u get my point.  However, this probably resulted in some foolish ppl, or maybe the govt at that time,  taking the stories literally, and started worshipping the "gods".<br><br>That being so, i shall proceed to the main topic.  The bible is afterall, written by humans.  Story writters who knows how to write a more realistic story would know how to mix the truth with fiction, just like movies.  Precisely because in movies, it relates to human society so much unlike most cartoons like sailormoon (sorry another example) which seems  too ridiculous to be possible, that ppl would think "hey.. such things are possible.  It may happen".<br><br>So what do u think of the chances are that its because the ppl who wrote the bible, integrate it with their real world at that time...that certain parts of the bible seems so real. So much so that we can find "evidence" in some stories (e.g. Noah's Ark).  The evidence can only proof that indeed a big flood happened before... and there was this "lost" civilization.  But who knows... it may be another life story put to glory.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Asure,<br>Just some things I know. The bible is a written by human authors, agreed. Much of the accounts found in the New Testaments are also found in history records. The authors of the each books came from different backgrounds. David was a king who the psalms. Luke was a doctor who wrote the gospel of Luke. Paul was a religious teacher who wrote many of the letters in the New Testament. There were other authors who were shepherds, fishermen, etc. All of different educational levels. Different books of it were also written at different periods of history. Yet, if you read through the whole bible, they are intricately woven.<br><br>Let me illustrate a hypothetical experiment. If you ask 10 different people of different nationalities, different races, different age and sex, put them in 10 different rooms. Ask them to write on let say, their deifinition of love. I don't think much of their points would be the same.<br><br>Think about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
