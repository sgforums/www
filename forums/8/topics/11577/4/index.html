            <div class='col-md body'>Gosh seems like I've ignited a war here...<br>I would like to salute Rainbowpriness, Ashley<br>and Bear for believing in love...<br>I'm not ashamed to be known as naive and gullible at the age of 23, cause that's me. I still believe in happy love relationships  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> even I had none coming my way...yet.<br>Why I started this tread is because I do found that there's really a alarming number of gals who are really materiallistic( of cos there exceptions like the above mention...)<br>they ditch their poor guys once that they are wiser and mature... they don't want their future to be uncertain, hoping to lead a comfortable life instead. But isn't future just great to to uncertain??? They don't give the poorer guys a chance that they might be sucessful later.<br>And people like Babypink, Sassy and (of cos no. 1 marriage disbeliever) Illegal Operation are really sad. Marriage is a personal thing<br>and you just flamed it like that... you must have experienced terrible things back then while you're a kid...I sugguest you<br>seek for help before spending your every last<br>dimes in Batam. Marriage can be easily voided<br>I agree but still have to go through a separation period of 3-4 yrs unless you got<br>proof of adultery... What I believe is, you<br>don't have to get married to proof or certify<br>your love... What we're going through is a kind of custom set by others a long time back. So wat's the point of agruing abt formalities, so long as you truely love each other... So wat if he/she have wrinkles once<br>55yrs old, you age too wat... Even you found<br>that he/she digs his/her nose... everyone do<br>that wat whether you do that in public or hid yourself in toilet... still the same. Learn<br>to accept each other and that's why so meaningful right?<br><br>------------------<br>Mosquitoes are my No.1 Arch enemies!!! :&lt;</div>

Please do not misunderstand my posting. Never once did I say that gers get more materialistic. In fact, I said they got wiser and less naive. There's a difference. Being materistic means they go all out to get rich men, regardless of whether there is love involved or not. But the latter simply means that love is now no longer the ONLY consideration when attempting a relationship. The ability to provide me with a comfortable lifestyle matters too.<br><br>The second thing is that I have never said that I don't believe in love. In fact I do. I myself love my gf. Both of us came from poor families. Both of us have to support our parents, and yet still have to work hard for our future. But that is something both of us look forward to. Yes..I really do believe in love. But I DO NOT believe in love ALONE.<br><br>Like I have mentioned before...while it's true that there are happy marriages, how many of them happen in families whereby the guy is NOT able to support his family???? Give me one example of that and I am sure I can find you 10 whereby families broke down for that very reason.<br><br>As for the bear, I am not getting personal. As for my comments about living off parents, it is just a question that applies to all. What you said about him typically brings out my point. If he is NOT working hard for their future, do you think his partner would be willing to suffer with him. Do you think she would be willing to feed him while he loaf at home??? Maybe she will *shrug*. But how long can that last??<br><br>I am not being cynical. Neither am I forcing my views upon anyone. I just want to highlight the fact that love ALONE is no longer enough. If you are not prepared to work your a** off for that someone you love, be prepared to have no future. Simple as that.<br><br></div></blockquote>Dear seifer,<br><br>LOVE is not the only thing we need, but love is the beginning of everything.<br><br>I understand what you have been through,and to a certain extend i actually agree with you. Like what i've said earlier, a family will not have happiness if they were to worry about money matters every now and then. But do we have to be so practical everytime?? I strongly believe that if both parties love each other, its not hard to maintain a family with a reasonable lifestyle. You don't have to be rich inorder to be happy, to be able to be with the one you love, that is what i call happiness  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take.

Like what i've said earlier, a family will not have happiness if they were to worry about money matters every now and then. But do we have to be so practical everytime?? I strongly believe that if both parties love each other, its not hard to maintain a family with a reasonable lifestyle. You don't have to be rich inorder to be happy, to be able to be with the one you love, that is what i call happiness    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote>So, are Singaporean women getting more materistic??? Well, that will depend on how we define materistic. If being materistic means that girls look for the 5Cs, that the guy must have a 6-digit annual income, have a string of gold cards, a BMW, etc...then, I believed the answer is no.<br><br>But if being materistic means looking for a guy who is able to provide you with a decent life, who holds a stable job, contributes to the family and work hard for the future...then yes, women has become more materistic.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Seifer (edited 08 May 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that there's nothing wrong with women being materialistic just because they want a better lifestyle, a husband that can provide for them or credit cards that allow them to purchase the things they so badly want all their lives.<br><br>I'm a rather materialistic person too. I often want the best in everything I do and possess.

But to me, a woman is considered materialistic if she only dates guys whose earnings are above average and he can provide her with a luxury lifestyle.<br><br>This type of woman that i've mentioned above is indeed increasing. But i wouldn't say all woman in singapore are materialistic.<br><br>However i do see some examples of girls becoming more materialistic after they finished their study and come out to work.<br><br>I have a friend who has been together with her ex for 4 years, however, after she graduated and went out to the society to work, she begin to feel that her bf is not good enough for her(he is only a diploma holder), thus she dumped him and married a first class honours degree man.<br><br>Well, personally i feel that i can't say she is wrong, cos what she want in life is to have a confortable lifestyle, but i really feel sad for her bf...<br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take. If you<br>think  something will make you happy, go for it. Remember that we pass this way only  once.<br>Bottomline :<br>Time don't wait. If you think you might have found the  right one, treasure him/her. Don't let he/she go away. Don't let fear hold you  back.<br>Give it a try else you might regret later...
