What i know is, for me, if i love someone, i can't say i don't want to love you then i don't love you liaozz. Love is not something that you can control, thus if you gf really kicks you out of the bed, you can be sure what you have found yourself with is not love.<br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take.

Its just what do you want in life. To some people love is a secondary thing,bread is the primary thing, thats why they want to find a rich husband so that they wouldn't have to worry about money matters.<br><br>However, you shouldn't stereotype all the girls to be materialistic.

The Bear is a personal fren of mine, n AFAIK, he's been supporting himself.

Some CHOOSE not to follow nor conform to Society's rubbish.  If tt's the case, ev. one wld be looking for cute guys n girls, everyone wld be looking for a rich man.<br><br>YET, there HAVE been Marriages tt lasted the distance.  NONE of u haf been able to Refute this Statement.  WHY haf there been Marriages tt lasted?  These pple aren't rich by Sgrean standards, so why has their Union withstood the test of time?  How do u Explain this when u say love does not exist?<br><br>No offence, but I'm getting kinda tired of u guys trying to convince others tt Love doesn't exist, simply cosh it is NOT the truth.<br><br>RP</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To both Ashley and RainbowPrincess. Please do not misunderstand my posting. Never once did I say that gers get more materialistic. In fact, I said they got wiser and less naive. There's a difference. Being materistic means they go all out to get rich men, regardless of whether there is love involved or not. But the latter simply means that love is now no longer the ONLY consideration when attempting a relationship. The ability to provide me with a comfortable lifestyle matters too.<br><br>The second thing is that I have never said that I don't believe in love. In fact I do. I myself love my gf. Both of us came from poor families. Both of us have to support our parents, and yet still have to work hard for our future. But that is something both of us look forward to. Yes..I really do believe in love. But I DO NOT believe in love ALONE.<br><br>Like I have mentioned before...while it's true that there are happy marriages, how many of them happen in families whereby the guy is NOT able to support his family???? Give me one example of that and I am sure I can find you 10 whereby families broke down for that very reason.<br><br>As for the bear, I am not getting personal. As for my comments about living off parents, it is just a question that applies to all. What you said about him typically brings out my point. If he is NOT working hard for their future, do you think his partner would be willing to suffer with him. Do you think she would be willing to feed him while he loaf at home??? Maybe she will *shrug*. But how long can that last??<br><br>I am not being cynical. Neither am I forcing my views upon anyone. I just want to highlight the fact that love ALONE is no longer enough. If you are not prepared to work your a** off for that someone you love, be prepared to have no future. Simple as that.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

Work is juz a means to an end tho, it's not necessary to aspire to great heights @ the expense of ur family, @ the expense of time spent wif ur partner.<br><br>The thg is this: IF the guy juz decides to be such an OAF n lolls ard @ home whilst the poor wifey slogs away, I think it wld be UNFAIR n UNREASONABLE of tt man to do so.  BUT, if he were Retrenched n times r hard, it wld be perfectly Understandable tt jobs r hard to find.  During this period of time, it wld be gd if the lady is understanding n reasonable, as well as being a source of encouragement n support for the guy...<br><br>IF the guy were to simply laze ard n haf a gd time whilst his poor wifey slogs like a Cow, wld it be love @ all?  If he truly loves his wifey, he wld seek to lessen her burden, rite?  Even IF he doesn't manage to find a job, main thg is tt, he wld TRY.  And Try n Try again n again.<br><br>Personally I'm getting really tired of this topic, simply cosh there're many Cynics out there, who wan to bring up all the Worst Examples of human behaviour, yet Conveniently Forgetting tt there're always shining lights in Society.<br><br>Suffice to say tt a gd r'ship does exist, but ONLY if both parties r willing to Give as well as Take, n both parties r willing to Make the Effort.  U can't juz open ur mouth n declare u love ur partner, but do NOTHING to lessen ur partner's load n burdens.  That wld simply be Empty Words.  Like many Empty Words, there's NO Basis, there're Many ways to Refute tt Hollow Statement made.<br><br>I've said my piece, will be outta this thread.  See u guys in another thread or somethg... cosh it's not ez Convincing those who wld rather take the ez way out n not see...<br><br>Oh yesh, I noe u're not getting personal  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  No hard feelings... *shakez hand*<br><br>RP</div>
