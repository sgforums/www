My Guy now still isn't rich... n I think he likes tt I dun ask for prezzies, juz lots of affection n care, which I return.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm...<br><br>I don't think i am materialistic but i do hope to have a good life. I don't expect my bf to be very rich, i don't expect to live on him, i don't expect him to buy me expensive stuff, but i do expect him to have his own earning power.<br><br>We don't have to be rich, but at least we can maintain a reasonable lifestyle. A family is no longer happy if every now and then you have to worry about money matters etc. Money is not the most important thing in life, but it provides a sense of security for you and your family.<br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take. If you<br>think  something will make you happy, go for it. Remember that we pass this way only  once.<br>Bottomline :<br>Time don't wait. If you think you might have found the  right one, treasure him/her. Don't let he/she go away. Don't let fear hold you  back.<br>Give it a try else you might regret later... No one other than  yourself<br>knows what can truly make you  happy.</div>
