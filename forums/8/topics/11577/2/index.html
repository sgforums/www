Legally, marriage and divorce are purely legal contracts.<br><br>Happiness is a state of mind. Society dictates that one should marry, and then breed. Women who do not find men to breed with her when she reaches 30 are quickly considered hags, left-on-the-shelves.. whatever name you had heard your collegues calling that poor 35 year old lady at your workplace.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that marriage in singapore is now being increasingly driven not by internal factors like love,maturity.But other external factors like finances,flats etc etc.And since it's so easy to get a divorce nowadays,i wonder why are divorce rates climbing now when in our parents era,it was virtually unheard of,eheh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Theory Of Relativity<br>Eating a lot of good food will make 1 hour seem like 5 minutes while eating lotsa horrigible cooked veggies will make 5 minutes seem like 1 hour <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Waiting for Diablo 2 Add-on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Its a legal contract.<br><br>The marriages that lasted eternally are not unlike contracts that hadn't been broken because both parties are perfectly happy as both are excecising the contract religiously.<br><br>Then again, society speaks out seriously against contract breeching. Marriage included.. so pressure is a factor when one ask why the couple who smacks each other every other day, and sleeps in different rooms still lives together even though they seriously wants each other dead.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have been following this thread, and sadly, I must say that I agree with Illegal Ops, and the original poster. I wouldn't say that gers get materistic as they get older. But rather, they become wiser, they become less naive. When they r young, gers fantasised about the perfect love, where savvy guys come and sweep them off their feet. But as they come out to work, as they are left to fend for themselves, they become hardened to the fact that $$ talks in Singapore. That's when they are conditioned to look for a partner who can at least present them with a decent standard of living.<br><br>And while it's true that there are many marriages that last, how many of those unions actually happen between couples with wide differences in earnings (esp the guy earning much less)?<br><br>And to those many people who profess to love their other halfs unconditionally etc. Let me ask you a simple question. How many of you are still living off your parents?? If you are still living off them, of course you can love your partners unconditionally. Why? Coz your parents feed your basic (or sometimes luxurious) needs. You can afford to love, because you dun have to worry about your next paycheck. You dun have to worry about the utilities bills, the telephone bills. You dun have to worry about when the next meal is coming. All you have to do is to stretch out your hand, and $$$ automatically drops into it. Next time when you step out into society. When you have to worry about all the bills every month. When you have to feed your parents instead. When you have to work for your own $$$. Now, then I would really like to hear your views again.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>
