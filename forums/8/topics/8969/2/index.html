            <div class='col-md body'>Okie, okie, dat day i was hopeing he wun call, but he did. At 9:45 i tink... told him we'll meet at 10:30. He asked for 10:45. I said okie, since we'll be waiting for a few ppl, we wun be dat punctual too.<br><br>Then hor... i was later than dat... tink i came after 11. N i didn't c him. I asked my frd to go in first. I worried he didn't know how to come here, so i went carpark look fer him, eben go hotel lobby look fer him. U dun tink he toopid, coz while i was outside, i oladi had 2 guys asking me where's the place.<br><br>I wouldn't be so mean as to go in w/o him, and i dunwan him to, i could have signed him in.<br><br>Then hor... we waited till 11:30. He poped up in front of me. I was scared oladi... :s cb lah, y so close!!! Wanted to tell him to stay away from me. Then he asked me how long ahve i been waiting.. i told him not long, abt half an hour. He told me he was late. I wanted to strangle him. Live so near n yet, he was late! A guy somemore!!! He told me he arrived at 11. Didn't see me, tot i went in first, so he went in on his own. Toopid ass. Duno how to call me ah!!!<br><br>Nvm, nvm, i still pretended to me nice to him.i brought him in and went to look for my frds.<br><br>Duno y the hell my frd go order a bottle of wine from a toopid promoter. Nevertheless, we planned to finish it b4 we hit the dancefloor.<br><br>There were onli 3 chairs... and 3 gers... so the guys let us sit. N i dunwan to, so i went to make fonecalls. I want to admit i was being toopid oso loh... i was wearing sumting beri low-cut and i dun realli trust him. Then duno y, when i was halway thru, he suddenly appeared in front of me and stood there a while b4 farking off.<br><br>Then boh bian, on the fone beri long liao, i went back and still saw the farking seat empty! Worse still, he was standing rite beside it!!! I no choice got to sit down, if not, beri pai kua wat. Then after dat, duno where he got a chair and sat down in front of me. Oh great!!!<br><br>Then i duno y he so kpo!!! Whenever my eyes roam to other guys, he will also turn to look at what i'm looking!!! I feel so sick! Like i'm being scrutinized all the time!!!<br><br>Then i realli hate it!!! Keep tapping me whenever he toks to me! NBCB LAH! Juz tok lah! I will know u r toking to me one!!! Hate it k! Feel like telling him i onli let local handsome chinese guys touch!!! Then eben one time, i joke joke wif him, he eben used his hand to slap me on my arm playfully!!! CB lah!!! I slap guys like dat doesn't mean u can do it to me too k!!! U &amp; me not same race &amp; nationality k!!! Then dat idiot eben try touching my bag on my waist! Feel so sick!<br><br>K, k, when we outside waiting for him, and eben at the time inside there, i kept telling them to shield me from him at the dancefloor. I wouldn't want to dance wif him!<br><br>Then when i asked him to finish off the wine, gave me some cock answers. he said dat while waiting fer me, he had oladi drowned 2 beers. And when he drink beer, he dun like to mix wif wine. To hell lah, got my prob ah! Cannot drink, say cannot drink lah! As if we'll luff at u! Give us this kind of macho answer fer fark lah! Dun drink betta, we rather throw away!<br><br>Cb lah, then i had to finish it. Finally, we got to the dance floor. I was leading. Coz me usually is best at wriggling thru the crowd to kai lu for them. Tink it's gd too. Coz he was at the back.<br><br>I finally stopped at this gd spot, where i was at one end, and him, at the other. Then hor... duno how he dance one! Dance dance dance till diagonally behing me!!! I scared, so asked frd to block!!! Then hor, cb still no give up! Stand till rite behind me! Cb lah! Frd block again! Tink he realli cock head k!!! He cannot moved back ah! We looked damn toopid k!!! One group ebside us, and the 3 of us in a single line, feel like farking him there n then!!! Neber moved elsewhere u know! Not even once! cb lah! cb cb cb!<br><br>I realli dulan liao! I eben told my frds if he ever got close to me, i'm leaving the dance floor! U should have seen my face! Scared + dulan!<br><br>Then he tapped me on my shoulder again! Oi farko lah! What u want!<br><br>He told me he's going to the bar for a drink. I happily replied him 'ok! ok!'. Then he kept quiet. So i asked him if he's staying put there or is he coming back. He reeated him again. Then i ok ok again. Then he cb one lah!!! CB ONE U KNOW!!! Got a group of guys behind him, taller also taller than him! They seow one lah. Holding one another across their backs and jumping like monkeys. I tink they sorta bumped into him. N this cb kia used his elbow to block them! Nabei lah! This is Singapore k! U tink u do this beri sak ki ah! I dunwan to get into a fight becoz of u k! U die ur own prob ah! Then i got to *sniff sniff* xi shen mei se *sniff sniff* and pull his hand back. cb man! feel like sterilizing my hand. then he repeated himself and tell me he going to the bar. Then my answer still the same. U know what shamelessly asked me! " u mean u're staying here while i get my drink?"!!! i so shocked u know! I turned to look at this frd who was btw us and asked in mandarin, 'he seow ah! He expect me to go wif him izzit!". Then duno y, he suddenly say it's ok, he's not going anymore. Fine loh.<br><br>Then later, my frd (a ger) said she's not dancing anymore. She went off on her own.<br><br>A while later, this arsehole tapped me again! WHAT! WHAT! WHAT U WANT! HE told me he's going to the bar. Ok, ok! But i told him he can look fer dat ger, she's at the bar too. Immed after he left, another guy frd left too. Hmmm... sumting smells fishy... but nvm, he's not the main topic today.<br><br>So i &amp; the rest continued, happier w/o him. I now look like i belong to the rest of the group. LOL<br><br>But gd ting dun last. He came back after a while. I saw him in a distance liao, but no time to format myself oladi! This time he was beside me! Sian man... after a while, a frd &amp; i decided to call it a nite.<br><br>Then i turned to a group of frds and told them i'm leaving. Eh... i know thos group of guys juz dat we neber acknowledge each other or even join them.<br><br>Well, he did offered me a drink once from a jug and then drank from the same straw after i'd taken some sips :s Not dat it matters, but i realli feel weird. hahaha!!! Duno y lah, muz be dat arse driving me crazy. He even came up to dance wif me but onli fer awhile b4 he went bcak to his frds. In short, he seemed more like trying to pick me up, which he's not.<br><br>N he looked surprised when i turned to them. Hate dat. None of his business. Hate it even more when he looked on!!! We were at somewhere near the stereo, of coz i had to be near to him lah! My face was practically pasting on his, but onli by a bit wat! But muz he looked until like dat!!! Cb lah!<br><br>When we were outside, we got to know dat he came by cab, coz he lives beri near onli. U know what this arse told me. he told me he can take the cab, send me back home, n then go back himself again. Bwahahaha! No thx ah! I told him i'm going bcak wif my frd coz we living near each other and we can drop him coz it's on the way. Then while we were discusiing abt sumting else, he told me he can take a cab on his own. I insisted on dropping him.<br><br>Then after dat, he beri toopid lah. Told me he realli enjoy himself, thx 4 inviting him. Ya rite, it'll be the last time. N i realli regret doing this.  Even when he got off, he turned back to look, but i continue talking to my frd.<br><br>I know i'm bad loh. But he's very irritating leh!<br><br>------------------<br><strong>I thought that you'd be loving me.<br>I thought you were the one who'd stay forever.<br>But now forever's come and gone<br>And I'm still here alone.</strong></div>
