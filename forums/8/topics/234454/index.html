            <div class='col-md body'>I rather feed and grow my bank accounts than try to raise kids in Singapore.<br><br>Here's why:<br><br>&gt;&gt; I hate the education system here, period. Doing it my way, will mean overseas education all the way, but that will be expensive.<br>&gt;&gt; If I have a son; he will be obligated by nationality to serve NS much of his life, and in the end his career here will be impeded by the many foreigners here who DO NOT serve NS. Getting a better career would mean going overseas, which is quite LPPL - i might as well migrate and have a son abroad.<br>&gt;&gt; if I get a daughter; she might very likely be attracted to a foreigner and fly away eventually<br>&gt;&gt; and in decades into the future, general costs of living will be exorbitant, considering that GST might very well be over 10%! Effects of globalization can potentially mean a meaninglessly tough living just because our go wants to make more money<br><br>As such, I'd rather bank on lots and lots of money, which will take care of me and my wife when we retire elsewhere. I'm gonna demand all our CPF back.<br><br>And tell em to shove it!<br><br></div>

Depends on the purpose of them getting married.  Some marry to have companion, some marry to have their own family- to give birth!!  Whether to have kids or not for the married ones, think the difference between cohabiting and marriage is - we all know, marriage is registered, it is legal!<br><br>Some wanna have kids, but have problems conceiving, so we can't just blah blah blah, gotta look at situation mah!  some wanna have kids but don't want to give birth so soon.
