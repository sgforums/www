You mean SG couples like to stare at each other till they are old and dead?<br><br>Although having kids is tough cause of the costs, the challenge of bring them up as good citizens, fillal and responsible is what a parent will be proud of.<br><br>So what if you are rich, hav damn lots of assets like cars/ condos and all the 5Cs.. you see parents with kids so happily together.. you will feel lonely too.<br>Anyway i can see most parents take pride in bring their kids up.<br><br>I am father of a baby boy and i see my family enjoying travels/fun/laughters/company and love and also grandchildrens when i am old.<br><br>So having kids make yr life more meaningful. I doubt those views above are really the views of unmarried couples.  I know alot of couples planning or already have kids. Why adopt when you can have yr own? Aint the costs are the same?<br><br>Think about it..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>well-said! i agree  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>i also think that kids motivate us to be better people and enhance our views on morality because we want to work hard to provide the best for our children and want to set good examples for them to follow<br></div>
