Why can't she accept guys between the age of 25 to 29? Simple.

              <p>when it comes to affairs of the heart, it is very hard to tell.</p>
              <p>it could be that given her status, she has problems finding people with true sincerity.</p>
              <p>however, i am 100% certain that money is a factor. surely need to drive a nice car and have the ability to afford a nice home one</p>

              <p>Just wondering, besides being beauty, obliviously for a beauty queen, what else does she have to offer that most chio bu dun? Oh and her self proclaim low maintenances. Kinda typical mind set most ppl have in mind ie. chi bu = high maintenance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To me if u r a celebrity and really wish to use the help of dating agency, dun u wanna keep ur real identity anonymous? At least till the actual meeting.</p>

              <p>Wah... a beauty with such a low criteria!!??? So easy to meet. I already know a handful of unattached man who can meet her needs.</p>
              <p>Being able to join a beauty pageant, she is probably quite mature in nature so I don't find anything wrong with her age requirements.</p>
              <p>I agree though that it's a advertisement gimmick! Hundreds of man will seek that agency liao!!</p>
