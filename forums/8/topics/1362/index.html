            <div class='col-md body'>I like Wizard of Oz &amp; Alice In Wonderland.<br>Find both very surreal, esp. the latter. I can relate to it coz sometimes I do get dreams so real that I wake up remembering everything clearly. This deja vu feeling....<br>And both stories had very interesting characters! Boy..would I like to have a pair of magic slippers or meet the Queen of Hearts<br>&amp; the Mad Hatter.... And The Magic Piper(?) where he led all the children in town away for not getting paid for his getting rid of the mice. Talk about getting your revenge! Enid Blyton's The Faraway Tree &amp; The Wishing Chair had me mesmerized too! Favourite of all times!<br><br>Prodigal&gt;&gt; Little Prince? What's it about?<br>Heard of Little Princess, The Prince &amp; the Pauper &amp; The Happy Prince... but Little Prince? Care to tell the story?<br><br>Everyone altogether now:-<br>"We're off to see the Wizard..the Wizard..the<br>wonderful Wizard of Oz....."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Jubilee,<br><br>"The Little Prince" is a fairy tale children book written recently, and it deals with various issues, and you should read the book and see the pictures drawn on the book. Some stuff may seem trivial at the first glance, but you see the depth later. It is difficult to explain the story to you. You have to read it to see for yourself.<br><br>Yes, you mentioned "Alice in Wonderland", which is one of my all-time favourites and I have read the original version of "Alice in Wonderland" and "Thru the Looking glass". For some of you who might not know, Lewis Carroll is a mathematician who specialized in geometry, and he encoded a lot of wierd geometry in his book which is still worth of study and think about. For example, the chess board is using a concept in pure maths called Banach spaces. You can read that in the story, in a subtle fashion.<br><br>I recommend another children book entitled "Flatland" written by Abbott, and it is about how a 2-dimensional being encounters a 3-dimensional being.. It is quite funny, and for those who are interested in geometry...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember somebody recommended The Little Prince to me, but I forgot to heed it.  Is it the same little prince who's actually a statue and he stands on a pedestal overlooking the city?<br><br>From all stories, it seem that Cinderella is the one that is often blasted with comments like "So what is the moral of the strory, sweep enough floors and you'll marry a prince?" and the use of a derogatory term "Cinderella complex".  Wait till they scrutinize Sleeping Beauty, she doesn't even sweep the floor.<br><br>Speaking of which, I remember reading that actually fairy tales did not have happy endings.  Sleeping Beauty married her prince and ended up being a depressed mother of a brood of brats and keeping the castle for her adulterous charming prince husband.  It was said that at that time people believe in exposing children to harsh realities of life as early as possible.  Only when HC Andersen or Grimm Bros and Disney want to retell the stories were the sad endings clipped off and we had "happily ever after".<br><br>------------------<br>Have you ever started dating because you're too lazy to kill yourself?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well MayaJade and Jubilee and the rest of the people whom I fail to mention,<br><br>Actually, I am presently reading a book which seemed like a children book, entitled "The Tao of Pooh" and "The Te of Piglet" by Benjamin Hoff. It is quite funny but in depth in explaining Taoist philosophy, especially, I have heard from a friend that a spoof is written about it called "The Pooh Perplex".... Somehow, I feel that it is very line with the "Little Prince"...<br><br>Fairy tales are what gives us hope and dreams....<br></div>
