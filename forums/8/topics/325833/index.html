              <p>He uses dud cheques to scam bank of $2.1million<br>YOU could say he was a bank robber with a difference.<br>By Andre Yeo<br><br><br>30 July 2008<br><br>YOU could say he was a bank robber with a difference. <br><br>Instead of a gun, he hit banks with just a simple plan. And it made him $2.1 million richer - until the law caught up with him.<br><br>Quah Lai Meng, 33, was working in a handphone shop when he noticed what he thought was a chink in the armour of the banking industry - the cashline facility.<br><br>Through this facility, banks provide ready cash to consumers who then repay the amount with interest.<br><br>In November 2007, Quah forged an application form for a DBS Cashline facility using the particulars of his friend, Luah Kian Hing. Luah has been charged and his case is pending.<br><br>DBS issued a credit card and cashline cheque book in Luah's name but sent them to Quah's address.<br><br>The credit limit was $5,000.<br><br>Quah, who has only PSLE qualifications, then executed his plan to defraud DBS, according to court documents.<br><br>Quah, who is single and was engaged to be married, withdrew the maximum $5,000 from the DBS Cashline account.<br><br>LIMIT REACHED <br><br>He knew that before he could make more withdrawals, he had to make repayments into the account since the credit limit had been reached.<br><br>He prepared several cheques, which belonged to some friends, to make payments into the account.<br><br>Court documents did not identify these friends nor explain the role they played in this scam.<br><br>These dud cheques belonged to accounts that had no money. His plan was to dupe DBS into thinking he had already settled his outstanding debts.<br><br>Quah knew it would take one to two days for the bank to realise this.<br><br>On 27 Dec 2007, he deposited a UOB cheque for $46,700 into the DBS Cashline account. Two days later, he went to the POSB branch at Hougang Central and withdrew $3,000.<br><br>It was easy money for him and he did it again on 9 Jan this year.<br><br>He deposited an OCBC cheque for $570,000 into the DBS Cashline account.<br><br>The next day, he got his sister-in-law, Lim Wee Ching, to withdraw $128,000 from the POSB branch at Hougang Central. He then got her to keep the money for him.<br><br>On another occasion, Quah got his brother, Lai Huat, to keep $200,000 for him. He had got the money as a result of cheating DBS.<br><br>Quah struck again on 15 Jan, at the POSB branch at Funan DigitaLife Mall. He left the branch with $240,000 in cash.<br><br>DBS finally got wind of what he was up to and lodged a police report.<br><br>NABBED <br><br>On 22 Jan, Quah was arrested at Ang Mo Kio Central.<br><br>Between 10 Dec 2007 and 22 Jan, he had cheated DBS of a total of $2.13m.<br><br>Quah faced 46 charges of cheating, forgery, transferring benefits of criminal conduct, and possession of four Erimin 5 tablets, a controlled drug. Two charges come under the Customs Act of buying 13 cartons of cigarettes with unpaid duty worth almost $1,000.<br><br>The prosecution proceeded with 13charges while the rest were taken into consideration.<br><br>In the Subordinate Courts last Friday , Quah was convicted after pleading guilty to all charges.<br><br>In mitigation, his lawyer Ms Gloria James said there was no elaborate plan by her client to cheat the banks.<br><br>Quah had readily admitted that he had taken advantage of an 'inherent flaw in the banking system'.<br><br>In a handwritten note to the court, he said he had no plans to commit the crime until he tried his luck to see if the cheques would clear.<br><br>He said it was a gamble and added: 'I just kept rolling on it until the sums grew and I was eventually caught.<br><br>'I did this out of greed...'<br><br>About $1.6m has been recovered.<br><br>Ms James said Quah spent $80,000 of the $500,000 that has not been recovered.<br><br>His next court appearance will be on 15 Aug when corrective training and preventive detention reports will be submitted.<br><br>Police investigations are ongoing.<br></p>

              <p>DBS pride itself to be bureaucratic and stringent in its processes. Yet, it allowed the borrower to exceed his $5,000 exposure limit and allowed cheque books be sent to an address not found in borrower's record.</p>
              <p>Can depositors be assured their cash savings are well taken care as well?</p>
