              <p>Maybe somebody from hell comes to earth and tell his son that he is hungry in hell as he has no money to eat and hell is like earth, need to pay money for anything that you want. Than the son goes around and tell everyone about this and from than on until now everyone has been buring money for their dead ancestors.</p>

              <div class="article_pics"><br></div>
              <div class="article_pics"><a href="http://www.sxc.hu/photo/1131233"><img src="http://www.labspaces.net/images/news/1131233_monkey_.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a> <br><em><br></em></div>
              <p><em>Wednesday, June 17, 2009</em><br><br>Scientists at Harvard University have 
              shown, for the first time, that intelligence varies among individual monkeys 
              within a species – in this case, the cotton-top tamarin. <br><br>Testing for 
              broad cognitive ability, the researchers identified high, middle, and low 
              performing monkeys, determined by a general intelligence score. General 
              intelligence, or "g," is a hallmark of human cognition, often described as 
              similar to IQ. The effect of "g" in primates may offer insight into the 
              evolution of human general intelligence. <br><br>The study, published this week 
              in the journal PLoS One, is the first to examine differences of broad cognitive 
              ability in primates within a single species. Previous studies of general 
              intelligence in primates primarily concerned variation between species. 
              <br><br>The research was led by Konika Banerjee, a research assistant in the 
              Department of Psychology at Harvard University. Banerjee's co-authors are Marc 
              Hauser, professor of psychology, and James J. Lee all of Harvard, along with 
              Christopher Chabris of Union College, Fritz Tsao of Hillsdale College, and Valen 
              Johnson of the University of Texas Medical School at Houston. <br><br>"We found 
              that there was substantial individual variation in performance on these tasks," 
              says Banerjee. "A significant proportion of that variation can actually be 
              accounted for by something that looks very similar to the general intelligence, 
              or 'g' factor, in humans. It appears to be the case that tamarins have something 
              very similar to our general intelligence." <br><br>General intelligence, or "g," 
              refers to the positive correlation of an individual's performance on various 
              subtasks within an intelligence test. Banerjee and her colleagues found that "g" 
              accounted for 20 percent of the monkeys' performance on the tasks in the study. 
              The remaining 80 percent of the variation in performance was due to 
              task-specific or environmental circumstances in testing the monkeys. 
              <br><br>While not a direct comparison, human "g" accounts for 40 to 60 percent 
              of the variation in an individual's performance on the various subtasks of an IQ 
              test. It may be that an increase in the magnitude of "g" was integral to the 
              evolution of the human brain. <br><br>"General intelligence is an important 
              component of human intelligence, but it is also possible that it relies upon 
              ancient neural substrates," says Banerjee. "If different primate taxa differ in 
              the magnitude of 'g,' with humans standing out from the rest of the pack, this 
              might help explain how we, uniquely, can combine thoughts from different domains 
              of knowledge to create new representations of the world. This cognitive domain 
              general ability, captured by 'g,' is something that you might see to varying 
              degrees in other primate taxa." <br><br>This study was conducted among 22 
              cotton-top tamarins, who were administered 11 unique tasks designed to assess 
              different cognitive functions including working memory, executive control, 
              information processing speed, and inhibitory control. For some tasks, the 
              monkeys' goal was to obtain a piece of food, but this was not the case for all 
              of the tasks. Monkeys with higher "g" scores tended to outperform monkeys with 
              lower scores across the various subtasks in the cognitive task battery. 
              <br><br>This particular set of tasks was developed for this study, but Banerjee 
              hopes that it or other similar task batteries might be applied to future studies 
              of primate general intelligence, to develop a standardized test for cognitive 
              ability that could be administered to many species. <br><br>"We called our 
              cognitive task battery the 'monkey IQ test' very crudely," says Banerjee. "It's 
              a fun way to think about it, but to be more accurate, I would say that we are 
              looking at global cognitive ability across an array of tasks that span multiple 
              cognitive domains." <br><br>### <br><br>Harvard University</p>
