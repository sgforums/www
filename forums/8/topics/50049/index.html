            <div class='col-md body'>I have got a gut feeling that I'm gonna be flamed by posting this article I wrote. Yes, I wrote it quite sometime ago for a dating seminar. But then what the heck, many some woman out there will appreciate me for teaching the men who are going to read this. *laffs* Here goes...<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Many people ask me alot of stuff about woman....they seem to think that I know so much, but you know what? I tell you, most of it are from guesses based on facts or simply anthopology....<br><br>No man, I am an inexperience man when it comes to woman, I am no Duan Juan Demarco nor Cassanova, just a guy with a slightly obese childhood and a lot of patience when it comes to the woman I love. So what's  the key point here to understanding a woman? Nothing much really and it is all common sense.<br><br><strong>1) Woman are hungry, they are asking for your attention.</strong><br><br>Yup, they are hungry, hungry as hell, but the problem is that they are like a void, it is never enough, but then again, they can't take too much at once, or they overflow and break down. what's the best way to describe them?<br><br>Attention given to woman should be the serving of the Bingo burger. Little but cheap, and you can give them lots of it....they will never have enough of it. But too much and you will be sick of it. So I figured that buying a Diamond ring and a nice warm meal to them comes around having the same effect. So it is simple, just treat them good .... but not too good...all the time.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>2)<strong>They call me a flirt</strong><br><br>Yeah, I have a bad reputation, rumors goes around me like wild fire, the moment they see me with a girl I must be interested in her, what a load of bull I say. Yea, I am cheeky sometimes, but all that sleazy, I make jokes, some dirty, some clean but I know where the line is, and woman are drawn to me sometimes because of that....it took me a while to understand why.<br><br>You see, a clean man is always nice, but he is boring, if you drawn the line well, knowing where to stop, you can still pull it off. Nobody likes dull john, they want fun and a different experience from the mundane life they are having, so be a little wild sometimes. there is never any harm trying to be a little silly in a crowd, in fact you most probably stand out, in my company most of the guys are clean, decent looking, me? I dyed my hair, but I still wear my tie and my L/S shirt. It makes me look professionally funky. And yes, I like to conversate wih woman, they always intrigue me in some way....but what the hell, that does not make me a flirt, talking and blowing your bullets are completely different things. but I just add some spice to the conversation....that's all. A bad boy image always bring out intrigue in woman, just like we man often have fantasy about a bad ass sexy chick picking us up in a bar. But then if underneath that exterior, is a responsible and intelligent personality, they will be hook. The bad boy cover will be blown and they will treasure their prize find in the rubbish heap.<br><br>In the end, A man too clean is a man too boring.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>3) <strong>Be apart from the rest....even if you have to be a clown</strong><br><br>The many problems we guys normally have is that we try too hard to do better that the other person. I find it manly, chauvinistic and mostly stupid. In the end why bother? Just be different. I have a friend who is extremely sucessful with this, he is not too good looking with crooked teeth, a small scar on the left side of his lips, not rich and not very tall. But he can manage to get a different gal to chauffer him to school everyday(No I am not talking about mothers). Gals ask him out all the time and they all adore him like a god. His secret? Be loud when all is quiet and be silent whe the world is talking.<br><br>Example, he will just sit coolly in a corner when all the guys are trying to impress a gal, or in public where the public eyes are so judgemental, he will break all standards to impress the gal. If everyone is trying to outdo each other by buying gifts, he does nothing at all, but when no one dare to do anything, he will do something dramatic to catch attention. I figured that in the end we all want our partners to be someone unique, someone who we can say is special. A woman hearts is extremely careful and concientious when it comes to this. character in a man can only go so far, but an interesting character who is diffirent from the rest can go as far but makes the other party drawn to you.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>4) <strong> Romance melts the cold heart of the Ice maiden</strong><br><br>Romance, a term sounding alien to many of us, we men, fumbled to understand the term romance to woman many atimes. It is nothing alien, nor rocket science, it is just psychology.<br><br>Ever feel very touched by some event or place that makes you go soft? Yeah romance is something liek that, though the effects of romance varies amongst us men, woman are generally more sensitive to such a mood.<br><br>Candle lights, chocolates, moonlight, etc....these are what woman term romance as? Not really, It is a setting that makes you stand out. Forget about expensive resturants and firvalous spending if you are on a tight budget. Though they do help with the mood, you can create them yourself. Some examples I have done before,<br><br>I took my ex to Loyang beach, with a can of petrol I wrote the words "Happy birthday Sharon! Lots of Love Cal" on the sand. then I light the fire and the sand was ablazed. it was quite a sight and we had to get away quickly before anyone come and catch us for arson, but we did manage to have a 3mins to bath in it's glory. She definitely appriciate the idea and can't stop telling her friend about what a great guy I am to go through all these trouble to celebrate her birthday for her in such a big way.<br><br>I carried my ex-gf to the doctor when she sprained her ankle. though it is quite embarassing to so something like that in public, I carried on, she soon forget about the embarassment and start to hug me very tightly and started to nibble on my ears. Yes, it might seem funny to many people, but it is the thought and the effort that made it romantic rather then funny. Though we broke up eventually, she still talked that incident so clearly as if it just happen yesterday when we broke up. In fact, it was one of the things the held her back during our broke up.<br><br>I celebrated V'day in a small way....giving my ex-gf a surprise when she came out from the shower with the whole house lighted up with home made candles. Tears flowed from her cheeks at that very moment and I knew she loved what I did for her. It was followed by a candle light home cook dinner and with Jazz music playing in the background.<br><br>As you can see, it is not that expensive, and yet all you need to do is to show effort(Woman are not that sensitive to that as explain in the first part) and you can surly secure your woman's heart. Dun be that humble, they need to know that you really did do something for her. Forget all that background effort that you were taught to behave in, the times no longer allow us to be like that. Woman have better things to do than to try and find out what we have done for them.</div>
