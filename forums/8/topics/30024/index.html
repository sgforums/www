            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Forummers,<br><br>I have a problem which needs insights. When I was younger, i suffered minor paralysis which gave me some walking problems. Thur yrs of training. I have very much gotten on my own feet.<br><br>REcently, my parents requested me to see a Chinese physician for regular massage. The Physician has a clinic in the same bldg as my parents shop.<br><br>After a few sessions, the doctor started to scold me loudly every session. He said that Im am not training enough. He ORDERED me to walk 2-4 km per day. The Thing i hate most is he likes to ask me work along the corridors on the shopping centre, so that he can see how I wallk. From there, he will start shouting at me. "Walk This", "walk there", "look in front", "dun put ur hands in the pockets". All these with every 1 staring .<br><br>The thing is I am a working IT Professional Age 20++ . I work shift 12 hrs per shift. 4-5 days per week. I tried explaining to the Doctor that its impossible for me to train daily. He will rebuke me saying that I work 12 hrs, stil got 12 hrs wat. For god's sake, I reach home around midnight and I have to wrk the very next day. Today, he really pissed me off. I told him I can only trtain on my off days. He scolded me saying that my sickness does not wait for off days to recover. I very much wanted to scold him back saying " Do u think My housing loans, my work, my part time studies can wait until I free then do meh?"<br><br>I will very much ot give the doc a piece of my mind . But then he's a friend of my parents and their shop is near each other. The other thing is my parents think the doc is a god. They listen to watever he say.<br><br>Do u think I shld scold him back next session. Any gd ideas on how to suan him back..<br><br></div>
