UCLA not top 20 however if U grad from there, high demand in SG, even for Gov sector.<br>If U grad from Brown Uni, I bet U can find ppl that laugh at it and say U sure Brown? not Black? never heard of it must be bad..<br><br>Hmm... even if U grad from a top 10 Uni in UK or top 50 Uni in USA, U want to work in Gov Sector? starting $$ might be good by annual increment slow as snail!

Case in point : I had 2 friends from my course(graduated with different standing for the same major) who applied to two seperate jobs and yet, the one with the lower standing is doing much better(from every aspect imaginable from pay to renumeration to job satisfaction - and I mean there is actually quite a substantial difference in each of those aspects) in life.<br><br>Clearly, if you took a cosmopolitan outlook and are talking about looking for jobs with the big firms/MNCs, your degree is essentially nothing more than a  lottery ticket(amongst you lot of applicants who are similarly outstanding in your academic achievements) - there's a host of other factors that will ultimately determine whether you get the job and how far/fast you'll be progressing in your career. Basically, it's the personal qualities that will make a difference in these instances and it's certainly fallacious to believe that someone who graduates with Masters from MIT will definitely do better than another bloke who gets a first class Honours from UC Berkeley, for instance.<br><br>I believe that policy/culture is widely applicable to the reputable international firms in Singapore anyway - I can't comment for the civil service as I have never been involved with them in the remotest way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>well ... there are more than 2000 universities in the US for instance, your standard aunties and ah mahs will probably only know the standard harvard and stanford and not much else .... ditto for some myopic local companies I suppose .... (and perhaps, some smug local grads ? ) ... but yes you're right, international companies do value international companies more, though I suspect it's simply because their exposure to western societies would better enable them to understand and fit into the corporate culture ? ....<br><br>and of course, while it's certainly true that lots of people who CMI to local unis took up the overseas option, there are plenty of people who actually got their places in local unis, but chose to head overseas for a different experience .... but oh well, if one is the sort that thinks any sort of foreign degrees from any place other than harvard or MIT is useless, then what's said here doesn't matter anyways ...<br></div>

Read this!<br><br>-----------<br>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060730/7qa.htm<br><br>Yale graduate Alexandra Robbins knows a thing or two about driven students. For starters, she says she was one. Her new book, The Overachievers (Hyperion), follows a group of students from her alma mater, Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, Md., as they apply to college. They are competing for a prized slot in a freshman class, a race for what they see as the universal measure of their success, at a time in their lives when image means everything.<br><br>Has education always been this competitive?<br><br>Simply put, there are more high school students, and they are applying in far greater numbers to the same amount of schools. The idea is that in order to win you must go to an elite college--to some people that means it's necessary to go to an elite high school, grade school, even preschool. ... Education is no longer about a learning experience; it's a game of Survivor where kids are strategizing to work against each other and beat the system.<br><br>But most students don't at tend top schools. Do we have a nation of profoundly disappointed graduates?<br><br>We have a myth. It's a myth that enrolling in an "elite" college guarantees success. There are ample studies to show that your undergraduate college doesn't affect your average salary or whether you'll be a CEO.<br><br>What does it mean for high schoolers?<br><br>One of the students I followed turned to cutting and burning himself. More than one turned to drinking. (And they sound very much like adults when they'd say, "I just need a drink to wind down after a stressful day.") Many said they were depressed, and three of my main characters talked about having suicidal thoughts. I also think that the cheating rate among high school students has something to do with the pressure they're under.<br><br>What is a defeat for these kids?<br><br>Sadly, in some cases, it's an A minus.<br><br>How widespread is this?<br><br>A lot more than I thought. It's a trickledown problem where the behavior of the top students impacts everyone else. The sad thing is that there is no middle ground anymore. Either you are a high achiever, or you're below average.<br><br>In what ways has this competitiveness changed school?<br><br>School is no longer about the love of learning. It's become a Machiavellian exercise where students and parents feel they have to do whatever is necessary to get an edge. It's a system that turns students into little more than their test scores.<br><br>Was school ever really about the "love of learning"?<br><br>When I graduated from high school in 1994, we could take classes for enjoyment and not worry about how it would look on a transcript. Today, many kids can't take classes like music, photography, journalism, or yearbook because they fear they will fall behind in class rank.<br><br>Are their goals to actually become professionals or just to get into a college that will allow them to do that?<br><br>It is just the undergraduate college that they are fixated on. So many students are focused on college because of that period at the end of junior year and the beginning of senior year when they are all asked by their parents' friends: Where are you applying? No one wants to explain a school on their list that no one has heard of.<br></div>
