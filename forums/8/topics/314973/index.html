              <p>Just yesterday, i called this skin clinic which i visited in order to bring forward my appointment a week earlier, due to the fact that my rashes are starting to spread throughout my entire body which initially started on my arms. My condition was pretty terrible and i felt devastated.</p>
              <p>My encounter with the nurse which i called to bring forward the appointment was exceptionally <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">unpleasant.</span></strong> I asked if i could do that and explained to her that my condition is worsening such that its affecting my daily life and the itch is causing me troubles sleeping. What she did was to repeated mentioning that the whole week's appointment was filled and i could only wait for 1 and a half weeks, which was my original appointment day. Of course, i tried to plead with her saying that my condition is really serious and said that it would be helpful if she can please help me out this time. However, she was so blunt and immediately rejected me saying that " no, i cant help" explaining that she has no means to do that.</p>
              <p>This really annoyed me. Im sure my case was much more serious than any other patient who goes to skin clinic for cosmetic reasons. Did she fail to notice that? And obviously she didnt even sympathise with my condition to provide adequate help. Do we go visit dermatologists and spend like 100 plus dollars per visit if we dont have a genuine serious case?</p>
              <p>Im sure all of you experienced such incidents, i frequently experienced such cases when booking for dental appointments, however, it wasnt serious, so i could afford to wait. However, this time i really feel so strongly about it that makes me mad whenever i think about it !!</p>

              <p>Well, they seems to be full and unable to squeeze you in for another appointment. In my opinion, you can always seek another doctor during this period preferably in the same place so they can retrieve your files and maybe even consult your doctor before they give you advise.</p>
              <p>Since you already can state that you don't give 100plus per visit for fun then the other patients in the queue do not do that as well... Do you know if you got your fingers cut off, you will still be waiting in the queue in hospitals? It is because the condition is not life threatening... and I guess it applies to you as the itch does not seems to be able to kill you...</p>

              <p>sorry for ranting and complaining. i understand her difficulties. however, i just hoped that she handled it a little better.maybe  to consult the doctor if i really need immediate consultation or smth , instead of a downright refusal. and from what i see, many people go to that dermatogolist for cosmetic reasons, pimples or freckles etc.</p>
              <p>The derma that i visit is a private practitioner not the one at skin center, i cant afford to wait for a months appoinment thats why i have to settle for a private one.</p>

              <p>Go Mt E or gleneagle. make a appointment with no fuss, see the specialist, immediate medical attention provided. But of course $$$ is needed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, i find them very professional and experience, only 1 or 2 appointments, they start to operate or give good medical attention and advice to you. As for SGH, SKIN care centre, TTSH, NUH, AH, everytime appointment and next appointment but nothing come out of it. So in long run, you spent the same as visiting Mt E and yet u waste alot of time and get frustration.</p>
