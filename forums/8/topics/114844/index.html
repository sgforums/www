            <div class='col-md body'>i think the ceiling should be strong enough to hold the punching bag. If you are living on the 10th floor, the person on top of you will have furnitures that weigh more than a few hundred kilograms...<br><br>But, you need a strong hook to hold the punching bag..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br><br>My friend had email the hdb regarding the punching bag thingy and this is their reply:<br><br>"For suspension of any object directly from the ceiling, the<br>allowable<br>maximum weight of the object should not exceed 6 Kg. As the weight of<br>the<br>punching bag has exceeded this limit, you would have to provide an<br>independent supporting system resting on the floor to suspend the<br>punching<br>bag. Such activities should not cause nuisance to the neighbours."<br><br>Just for everyone information in case u're all thinking of installing a heavy bag in your flat.that's all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the go-ahead fedor....<br><br>(1) The actual static weight of the bag is 70 kg.  But the true downward force is much more than 70 kg.  A 6 ft, 70 kg sandbag is used mainly by kickboxers, which means that your friend will be tugging on the bag, hugging it, pulling on it, etc.....at times, in laymen's terms, the actual downward force = weight of bag + weight of your friend + momentum.  Clearly, this could easily exceed 150 kg in actual weight.<br><br>(2) A 6-ft bag swings a lot.  Your friend will need at least 3-4 m radius or free space around the bag (including space for your friend to jump around).  I'm not sure if this kind of empty space can be found in a HDB flat, considering there must be furniture, etc around.<br><br>(3) Such a bag will require a qualified contractor to hang, probably with a few bolts, bracket, etc....its definitely not just a simple bolt fixture.  I don't think any HDB-certified contractor will do it (or risk their licences, since they're breaking HDB's rules of 6 kg).<br><br>(4) If the bag is hung from the ceiling, you will slowly feel powder falling onto the floor because the cement around the bolts are rubbing off part of the plaster.  Soon, the bolt may come lose and the bag will drop.  The ceiling will be safe....just that there will be a hole there.  The bag would probably need to be hung from a support beam, but thats definitely not allowed.<br><br>(5) Lets say that 6-foot long bag is hanging from the ceiling, 1-2 feet from the ground.  This means that the chain is very short (1-2 feet at most).  There are lots of forces when the bag flies sideways - the bag flies sideways, it pulls on the chains, etc.  Something must give way.  In the last few months, I've seen 5 bags being damaged this way - because the chain was too short and there was not enough provision for the bag to fly sideways without tugging on the chain too much.  (If the ceiling is high enough and the chain is long enough, the bag just swings like a giant pendulum - there is less stress on the chain).<br><br>(6) This is the main reason why not to.  When the bag is hit, the bang sound is VERY loud.  It will be heard easily from a few floors up and down, even during the nosiest hours.  The HDB flat will also act as a 'trumpet' and will echo the sound all the way to the next few blocks.  Definitely neighbours will complain and when HDB comes to check and finds something more than 6 kg hanging there....oooooh, your friend is in trouble.<br><br>Sorry, as I said, its all bad news.....<br></div>
