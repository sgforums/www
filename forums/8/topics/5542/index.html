            <div class='col-md body'>Well..<br>Recently I "met" again this girl I met about 4 years ago during my JC days on irc again, back then I chatted with her on alamak.com. Coincidentally, after all these years, I met her on galaxy.net again, and better still, she was in the same course as me in NUS, and also, in the same lab for a module! Imagine my delight, and we did meet up...only at the lab of course. She's cute, but her reaction to me?? I don't really know..she doesn't seem to have much negative reaction, except that it became a bit weird to chat up on irc and icq anymore because the mystery is no longer there. Well..I don't really expect much because I'm not exactly a GOOD LOOKER .... you all must agree for this kind of thing...looks are first thing.<br>Will keep you guys informed of my progress....or decline! oh btw this is my first post.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Meeting guys/gals whom you met over the IRC is perfectly normal, as long as you are not actively, purposefully seeking a mate on the IRC.<br><br>Of course, if a relationship flourishes from such a meeting it's perfectly alright, as in the show "You've Got Mail"<br><br>Just don't be a beast and turn around and flee when you find out that your newfound friend isn't exactly gorgeous,.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well said Enigma, I forgot about the "not good looking so forget about any "friendship"" part..<br>I know of some who after seeing any ugly pics of yourself will totally ignore you, even on irc or icq. I think that's downright sad and I'm quite disappointed with this kind of people. I did a little test with my "female"(provided they are really female) friends on irc and icq to test out their reactions when I sent them a urmm....not so attractive pic of myself (when I was in BMT pic..hahahah) and one actually told me some bull about she being attached and stuff like that when I asked for her opinion on my mug. The other just said "average"..which is acceptable, since she's being frank. Then of course, after that incident, I just totally scolded the one who gave the bull excuses...and told her personally that I cursed she will get a very ugly and no personality guy as a husband in the near future. Well, another gradually stopped talking, so good riddance to her too. The last two did continue talking, it does show a lot about their character. The one I mentioned in my same lab group actually told me I looked so different from the pic I showed her, but did not want to comment further. Anyone can guess how she actually felt? I'm more handsome or more ugly than the pic???<br><br>------------------<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I went out in a group once and it was actually ok.  I actually was't on IRC.  My female friend asked me to accompany her to this meeting.  I didn't realise that it was an IRC meeting until half way thru the night, when they started talking about who was attched to what nick...<br><br>It was ok though because they were all quite nice.  There were 3 girls and about six guys..me included in that.  Apparently they all been talkin 4 long time on that channel so they decided to meet.  Suffice to say that the guys weren't really good looking, but there was one good looking girl there and she kinda was only interested in the better looking guy...She was really nice you know, but there u go...can't escape the facts ...they do prefer looks first.<br><br>"no army can withstand an idea whose time has come."<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 27 October 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well....I've had about 6 irc meetings...5 with girls and one with a guy.<br><br>The first few were rather strange and the girl was subdued and shy as compared to over the phone. Things did not really hit off too well...and we lost touch some time after that. It was not a matter of looks actually...most of them were average to slightly above average...it was more a matter of being comfortable with each other.<br><br>There was also one that behaved like a total asshole and ignored me the entire night (maybe bcos I wasn't yandao ??)....ok so she is small and rather cute but with her kind of attitude I really felt like stuffing her in the nearest recycle bin along Orchard Road.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Another was NOT good-looking at all, but I still asked her out because of the thought that maybe we could hit it off in character ? Guess I was wrong on that because half the night she couldn't keep up with my chatter and failed to express her opinions (a.k.a boring !).....and didn't even bother to thank me for the date (I paid for the meal + movie tickets)....so that was a bad experience I guess.<br><br>Currently I am not planning any further irc meetings until I really know the person better first. Period.<br><br>Take care everyone !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>man, I must admit, there are some reason interesting people here.  I'm not kidding.  I wouoldn't mind meeting up one day for coffee with evryone from this board.  It would really be interesting to see what everyone is like in real life.<br><br>I wouldn't even mind meeting up with the asshole ones, but not many tho so that 's good.<br><br>What d'ya say people?  When all ur exams are over?  Interested parties?<br><br>It probably won't be soon though as I got lots of work to catch up on...been spending too much time on this board...heh heh.<br><br>Now u see, i would have thought that the IRC would be the one place where poeple can intereact just based on character.  It's much different when ur interacting using just one element of ur tools of interaction, and a totally different thing when u have to interact in real life.<br><br>It involves more than just the mind.  It's all about the engagement of the senses.  Body movement, motor skills(keep spitting chunks of food on her when u talk and she will run), smell, sight, sound, maybe even touch(to a degree).  Then there's that all elusive chemistry thing.  Once u meet someone, all these things are intereacting with all her "things"...and definately there will be a lot of variations...Which is why sometimes people can get along so well on IRC and those types of chat lines, but not even have a spark or even hint of it in real life.<br><br>There's just too many variables..When u think about it, although it sounds clinical to put it this way, it makes some kind of sense.<br><br>Hmmm.  Just a thought.<br><br>"No army can withstand an idea whose time has come."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally have went out with a few girls from IRC or ICQ. I would say that many people go into this for the sake of finding a bf or gf. When you meet the people, I think it's still better to know each other for a longer time despite how long you've chatted on the net or on the phone before you decide whether to go steady. I'm sure all of you would agree that seeing the person personally &amp; talking to the person face to face is different from talking over the net or phone. Sometimes you have so good an impression of the person on the net but when you meet, the looks don't meet your requirement. Then you face disappointment. Again, looks is the culprit. I've rejected all the girls I met in the net till date. Not because of looks all the time but also because there was no chemistry. I do have to admit that even though looks are important, if there's no chemistry, all you get is a pretty vase with no soul in it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do have quite a few experiences with meeting people from irc or other chatlines. From my personal opinion, the scale tends to tip towards the side where first impression counts more than anything else. Alot of people like to live in this world where they think the person who they are talking beyond the screen is someone who is similar to the glam beings that only exists in the tv tube.<br><br>First of all, i would like to say that I'm a guy if the handle appeared misleading to you but it has sentimental values to me.<br><br>Several years back, I met this girl who proposed a meeting with me. It was a catastrophe. I don't blame her for avoiding me soon after. I had bad hair, bad posture, TOTALLY nerdy with NO sense of dressing (Bright pink tee and bright blue jeans). Its lucky I didn't get killed out there.<br><br>Not long after that i had another meeting with another female chatter. Sigh, sadly again bad hair,posture and dress sense. Notice the pattern I didn't learn my lesson. The sad part is that she was totally trying to squirm out of it and leave as soon as possible and she was on her handphone all the time. Finally, she managed to come up with one dumb excuse that her friend injured his hand while playing that "Sonic blastman" arcade game and she got to go and visit him at the hospital. Funny to say that its already quite late at that time and visiting hours were long over. Self esteem hit a new lowdown peak, but anyway looking back at myself I still couldn't help but laugh.<br><br>I'm much better off now and my dress sense improved, better groomed and there are friends who still keeps incontact with me after meetings and we are still good friends.

            <div class='col-md body'>I share your pain man......during my first year at teh university, I met this girl online that chatted me up. We got along great and were sharing many intimate moments va email then the phone and all. Then after half a year of chatting, I asked her to be my gf and she agreed. She asked to meet me, I was like thinking great now maybe the relationship's going somewhere. Then when we finally met up, well, she didn't look as nice as I thought she would. Maybe I'm just being plain mean if I'd liken her to a horse. But she wasn't anywhere near pretty. So I asked myself if I had done something stupid by asking her to be my gf. But I thought of the nice moments that we shared conversing with each other and I relaised that a relationship should go beyond looks.<br><br>Thats when the bomber came after a week, she dumped me cos she said I didn't look good enuff. Imagine the nerve? I guess I was pretty hurt when I had decided to accept her as she was but she couldn't do the same.<br><br>From then on, I've been really apprehensive about online relationships.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i've met a few guys i've chatted w over the net, or rather, accompanied my frens for such meetings. i guess we play it safe cos we always go with at least 2 more girls, and have an excuse planned beforehand, ie can only go out for a few hrs cos: my mother not happy, i gotta study, meeting other ppl, need to bathe my dog, etc. like tt, if you dont like the person (not tt he/she isnt gd looking!) you can have a quick yet polite getaway.<br>but mostly, the ppl i meet up w are schmates, or during channel meetings. most are actually ppl i already "know", in the sense tt they're FOFs. in one of my reg channels, all of us already know each other through regular channel outings and it's more like we're "real" frens rather than net frens, who simply chat online cos it's more convenient.<br>but the sad thg is, many online friendships come to an abrupt end after such meetings. perhaps sometimes, the other person is really a total asshole/jerk/nerd/wannabe/beng/gangster, but more often than not it's because he/she doesnt measure up to your preconceived notions of what she/he looks like. sigh.. how sad.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*sigh*, it's real sad isn't it<br>I agree, this type of 'desparateness' is really disheartening but I suppose it is unavoidable. Just make sure one is states clearly at the start what he or she wants before the other party gets hurt. =)<br><br>Btw, I wouldn't mind meeting up. What firewire has said sounds rather promising =)<br>Just organise the meeting after my 'A's, hehehe<br>The last date of my exam is 26th nov =)<br><br>Take care all. Good night!!</div>
