            <div class='col-md body'>I doubt the gov't intended for the whole lot of only storerooms to stay standing while the rest of the building collapse around them, the rest of the buildings will probably be full of cracks and all but not neccesarily collapse totally, even if they do, the guy on top shouldn't worry abt getting down, he can crawl down the debris, the guy at the bottom levels will however be stuck , trapped by all that debris (discussed all these in class a few years back when I was still in primary school, I'm in sec 3 next year. . .)<br><br>dun worry abt the bombs that can penetrate concrete and all, the bombs that US have are mainly two types if I'm not wrong, one was mostly made just before the Gulf War using spare artillery tubes packed with high explosive to penetrate the underground bunkers of Saddam, the other type is mainly those used for destruction of chemical or biological weapons in their underground bunkers itself while minimising the size of the crack in the concrete it penetrates to reduce the amount of bio or chem weaponry that escapes into the atmosphere<br><br>point is that nobody will use nukes today. . .unless really totally pushed to a corner, even US, China, Russia, will all only use nukes if someone uses a WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) against them first.  These include biological and chemical weapons like smallpox, anthrax, mustard gas, etc. . . and they'll probably do this only if a whole lot of their people kenna. . .<br><br>Other countries such as Iraq, North Korea, etc, will only use nukes (if they have them) in the event that someone drives them to the brink of extinction as a state. . .<br><br>dun see why all of you are so worried abt having to use the bomb shelters itself, consider this, if enemy bombers can get throught Singapore's air defences, that means most of the airforce is probably kaput already, (because Singapore is very small and they dun need alot of time to scramble to any part of Singapore to repel invaders) if the airforce is kaput, you shouldn't be worrying abt the enemy bombers, those you can do nothing about, you should be thinking of the best way to arm yourself against the enemy soldiers who are going to come for you soon and shoot you if you are not lucky<br><br>the other way Singapore can be bombed is by terrorists, those you can't guard against unless you camp in some bomb shelter 24/7 all the time, which is not possible<br><br>my two cents</div>

These include biological and chemical weapons like smallpox, anthrax, mustard gas, etc. . . and they'll probably do this only if a whole lot of their people kenna. . .<br><br>Other countries such as Iraq, North Korea, etc, will only use nukes (if they have them) in the event that someone drives them to the brink of extinction as a state. . .<br><br>dun see why all of you are so worried abt having to use the bomb shelters itself, consider this, if enemy bombers can get throught Singapore's air defences, that means most of the airforce is probably kaput already, (because Singapore is very small and they dun need alot of time to scramble to any part of Singapore to repel invaders) if the airforce is kaput, you shouldn't be worrying abt the enemy bombers, those you can do nothing about, you should be thinking of the best way to arm yourself against the enemy soldiers who are going to come for you soon and shoot you if you are not lucky<br><br>the other way Singapore can be bombed is by terrorists, those you can't guard against unless you camp in some bomb shelter 24/7 all the time, which is not possible<br><br>my two cents</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Yes. The bomb shelters in HDBs are never meant to withstand "direct" hits. Since it is not envisioned that bombs will hit and destroy the entire block, the shelters are just an enhancement to the building, it  is not designed to stand alone and will not. As for rescueing people out of these shelters, I believe SCDF is well prepapred for such contingencies.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Those bombs don't come cheap anyway, and no countries in the region has them.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Second last paragraph. Fully agree. But the bomb shelters were meant as first line defences against a sudden enemy raid. There are sure to be enemy planes that will leak through the defences.<br></div>
