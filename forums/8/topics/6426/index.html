            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously speaking...a lot of people..both guys and girls are very easily fooled by words behind a screen.  They see it as romantic...have this image of this dashing romantic guy....and they fall for it...<br><br>I for one know that words are very powerful...I find that usign it so carelessly in attemtps to woo someone over the net is a bit underhab\nded as you have never met before and either one or the other can or cannot be what they seem to be..most times they are not what they seem to be.<br><br>I think that it is a situation of preying on other people...unless you both know what you arte doing...<br><br>which is why I will never write sweet words to girls over the net.  If I know them in real life then I would...but otherwise I feel that it would be taking advantage of the situation...something i am not totally in agreement with....<br><br>ehh personally speaking only ok...what everyone else does is really up to them.<br><br>Maybe I sound like one really unromantic guy, but I'd rather not lead someone else on, have them fall for me, then dissappoint them and break their heart.<br><br>Ack!!1 but  for those who have found something nice, all the best and 3 cheers from my corner...but for the oh so many who are in bad situations because of sweet words from callous strangers...i wish them hope, stregnth and vision.<br><br>I may become very unpopular for saying this...<br><br>but int he word of Erriegal: "HEH~"<br><br>kekekek<br><br>MAYA- WHY U LOOKING FOR SOMEONE YOU NEVER MET?...i'M HERE BABY!!!!...WHY YOU SAY U NEVER MET...:-)</div>

And what happens if you do finally meet, he or she doesn't turn out like the way you imagined or if they simply don't fit in the category of looks you would normally be attracted to, would it affect your internet-relationship?<br><br>And what happens if let's say both of you have progressed beyond the internet, that's there're additional contacts like talking on the phone &amp; going out &amp; you discover through time that the persona that was presented in the internet realm differs greatly from their true self, what would you do?<br></div>
