            <div class='col-md body'>Religious leaders must guide followers, says PM (Straits Times, 2 January 2001)<br>--<br><br>They should restrain and admonish overzealous followers or the Government will step in, he says<br><br>RELIGIOUS leaders were reminded of the need to be alert to overzealous followers who may threaten Singapore's religious harmony.<br><br>The message came from Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who pointed out yesterday how trouble in the Maluku Islands demonstrated just how delicate this harmony was, and warned that in the Internet era, intolerant views could be spread swiftly.<br><br>But while the Government would prefer religious leaders here to guide their followers, it would not hesitate to 'take firm action' against those espousing extremist views, he warned.<br><br>He was speaking at a charity dinner organised by Jamiyah and the Singapore Buddhist Lodge. He applauded the two bodies for jointly organising the dinner, which was attended by religious leaders and delegates from more than 10 different countries.<br><br>He praised them and others for their 'excellent examples of inter-religious cooperation that will help enhance cohesion and harmony in our society'.<br><br>On religious tolerance and harmony, he said: 'Let me stress that as religious leaders, you have the heaviest responsibility.<br><br>'The practitioners of your faith look to you for guidance on religious matters. They will take the cue from your words, your tone and your manner in dealing with other religions when they themselves relate to others from different faiths.'<br><br>He told the leaders: 'There are times when some of your followers and activists may become overzealous in promoting their faiths.<br><br>'With Internet and the ease with which websites are set up, a few of them may become bold, insensitive and reckless in expressing their views.<br><br>'It is better for religious leaders to restrain and admonish these few, than for the Government to do so.'<br><br>However, the Government would not allow things to fester. 'If necessary, the Government will take firm action against such extremists and fringe groups whose actions threaten Singapore's multi-religious harmony.<br><br>'We have seen how countries have been destroyed by religious strife.<br><br>'We have no intention of allowing our delicate racial and religious balance to be disturbed by any insensitive group of whatever race or religion.'<br><br>His speech came in the wake of a wave of bombings on Christmas Eve in the Maluku Islands and other parts of Indonesia. The bombs, set off at churches to target Christian worshippers, left up to 15 people dead - the latest casualties in the religious strife which has seen 5,000 killed since 1999.<br><br>His reference to the Internet was also pertinent in the light of increasing use of the medium to defame secular and religious leaders.<br><br>Even Singapore has not been spared. Last week, Mr E.S. Ebrahim Marican, secretary of the South Indian Jamiathul Ulama religious group, admitted unjustly accusing Mr Abdullah Tarmugi, Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, through e-mail, of instigating Malay MPs to act against the Indian-Muslim community's interests. He has since made a public apology to the minister.<br></div>
