            <div class='col-md body'><strong>NOTAR:</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/helicopters/helicopter/notar.jpg"><br><strong>NOTAR rotor configuration </strong><br><br>By far the most recent yaw control strategy developed for helicopters is the NO TAil Rotor (NOTAR) design. NOTAR was first developed by McDonnell Douglas during the 1980s and applied to a modified OH-6 Cayuse. The concept proved so successful that the company began marketing dedicated NOTAR spinoffs of the successful MD 500 family including the MD 520N. The NOTAR system operates by forcing moving air out of slots located on the tail boom. The interaction of this air flow with the downwash of the main rotor is such that it creates a force that opposes the torque of the main rotor. While there are some complex aerodynamics involved, the general idea is to replace a spinning tail rotor with a jet of compressed air squirting out of one side of the tail boom. Varying the strength of the jet gives the pilot yaw control over the helicopter. The NOTAR system is currently available on a number of commercial helicopters including the MD 520N, MD 530N, and MD 600N, and has even made some Hollywood appearances (such as Speed, featuring the lovely Sandra Bullock and the "talented" Keanu Reeves). Though the NOTAR arrangement still requires a long tail boom, the need for a spinning tail rotor is eliminated. This reduces the danger to ground crew, and also allows the pilot to maneuver into positions that he or she normally would not even consider. For example, NOTAR allows a pilot to stick the tail boom into a tree. Try that with a standard tail rotor, and it will be time for an unscheduled landing.<br><br>We hope that this in-depth discussion satisfies any questions you might have about helicopter tail rotors. Of course, someone might come up with a better, simpler way of counteracting the force of the main rotor in a few years. Then again, someone might perfect flying saucer technology too, making helicopters a thing of the past. As for me, I'll put my money on helicopters being around for a while...</div>
