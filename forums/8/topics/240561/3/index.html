            <div class='col-md body'>Tricky thing is learning a language is not like learning some skills. Age really matters and another thing is quality input from the environment. Singaporean children are educated in English at a very early age, which in a way wires their brain to be English speaking. Compare an average educated Singaporean with an average educated Korean or Japanese, you will see that the difference is categorical. Bear in mind that in those countries learning English is greatly emphasized.
