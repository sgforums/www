This is the final stage of practice, we don't need to worry about it. Why does the observer finally collapse? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When nothing sees nothing, what do we have?

You are programmed by your genes and your environment. The only difference there is between us and robots is that our programming evolves. Machines are defined by 1s and 0s whereas we humans can deal with grey areas. To us there is no ultimate right and wrong but to a robot there is.</div>

What im very sure bout is that AI thing is getting more and more advanced now..<br><br>First, Japanese only created robots to mimic animal movement like monkey or mouse or snake or watever. Then now they created human-like robot and they perfecting the robot's movement into human-like movement. Now they are creating the faces on the robot that can move its eye-brow, eyes mimicking human even though the movement of the eye-brow and eyes are still lagging, not as smooth as human..<br><br>Now they are this advanced.. how bout the nex 200 years?<br><br></div>
