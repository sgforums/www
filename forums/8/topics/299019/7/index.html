            <div class='col-md body'>What is undisputed about this topic is that AndrewPKYap is a fucking idiot who can't handle opinions that differ from his own. Obviously the amount of philosophy he knows couldn't even fill a shoe box yet he goes on and on just blabbering like a wino by the side of the road. And just like a wino he thinks I'm using 'big words', that I'm a 'clone' and that Descartes is the undisputed founder of scientific thinking. 1st of all everything about Philosophy can be DISPUTED. That's the fundamental basis of Philosophy. 2nd of all you don't even know that the point you've been arguing is basically substance dualism. 3rdly please don't try to act smart. Stick to things you THINK you know about (like the financial markets where your ridiculous thoughts and projections are torn to shreds like so much confetti).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hm this is not a good thread..<br><br>Why dont we all learn more bout self-existence instead of critisign each other..<br><br>We have someone who learnt philosopy and someone who has wide knowledge bout Buddha learning. Both of them can give us better knowledge bout self-existence. Why dont we learn something from philosophy and Buddha way ?<br><br>Andrew.. what i can see here is that people are here to post what they think or to share bout what they know.. and you? You are here to try to "brainwash" people into your ideas? Dont you realise it ? You think yourself as a human with a perfect flawless thinking ?<br><br>From what i can see, no one starts to tell anyone stupid or idiot or dense.. it is you who started this calling to people who dont agree with you? So you think you're smarter than all these people who just wanna share their thoughts in this topic?<br><br>Have you forgotten that you said "in trying to look smart, makes a fool of himself" ? Well, mayb thats wat u see in most people here but we think that sentence suits you better. Let me add something " .. and a fool doesnt realised that he is actually trying to look smart"<br><br>I would have respect u better if you keep your thinking but since u started calling people stupid and so on, i lost my respect to you.. It just proved how ignorant you are and how childish that you have become. This is sad. You really dont know what is going on with your attitude.</div>

That is, mindfulness and awareness.<br><br>The be aware, is to know what is beneath the surface.

It says authenticated with <strong>every</strong> arising. So it's NOT only the sound.<br><br>'Just the sound' means there is no extra imputations (i.e a perceiver and a perceived) but experiencing it in bare, naked, awareness, i.e. mindfulness/awareness.

            <div class='col-md body'>HAHA Demon I feel your pain. Relax friend, its not worth the stress trying to reason/debate with this guy. I've done some philosophy and work on existentialism, but my knowledge on this subject pales in comparison to yours.<br><br>Nevertheless, I'm quite amused by the fact that Andrew starts all this without even the ability to use any philo terms (which reflects his knowledge/comprehension of the topic at hand).<br><br>To be honest, I think Andrew has had an interest in this subject (which is admirable in its own right) but hasnt read up enough on it or done enough research. Therefore although he seeks to debate and discuss the topic, his abilities to do so falter when someone more knowledgeable comes along.<br><br>And to Andrew, I didn't really take the time to understand 7 pages of what you're getting at (the original post was too basic). But medical research has in fact shown that our self-awareness, consciousness and ability to choose are simply the workings of the neurons in our brain. For example, a person with a failure in the posterior parietal cortex in his brain would not have free will. While people who are very severely autistic actually have no sense of a "ME".<br><br>So medically, there is no self, but neuron functions. And self is simply the name that we apply to what these neurons make us feel. If you take an alternative, non-medical stand, then SELF does indeed exist, as the concept that we create to explain what we feel or to romanticise the dull reality; and will die with the brain.</div>
