This belongs more to the Hindu concept.<br><br>Awareness/consciousness cannot be separated from conditions... There is no 'One Absolute' behind everything... but rather every conditioned arising, dependent arising is an absolute in itself!! The chirping of the bird outside... is an arising of an absolute... is itself pristine awareness...<br><br><strong>Understanding this, thoughts is the universe, the experiences arising in the 'field' of the individual being is the universe... there is no 'universe' apart from that arising.. When you eat an apple, it is the entire universe that eats the apple.</strong><br><br>The problem when nonduality is glimpsed but not the nature of emptiness and dependent arising is that the practitioner will be inclined to form concepts of a Monistic all pervading subtrate behind all things... and make funny concepts like "you are me" and "i am you" as if we share the same soul... In fact if nonduality is seen very deeply, one would see that this is false..<br><br>You'll never see anything about a universal soul in Buddhism. Yet, our true nature is all pervading and all manifestation have one taste, the manifestation of our pristine awareness.</div>
