This belongs more to the Hindu concept.<br><br>Awareness/consciousness cannot be separated from conditions... There is no 'One Absolute' behind everything... but rather every conditioned arising, dependent arising is an absolute in itself!! The chirping of the bird outside... is an arising of an absolute... is itself pristine awareness...<br><br><strong>Understanding this, thoughts is the universe, the experiences arising in the 'field' of the individual being is the universe... there is no 'universe' apart from that arising.. When you eat an apple, it is the entire universe that eats the apple.</strong><br><br>The problem when nonduality is glimpsed but not the nature of emptiness and dependent arising is that the practitioner will be inclined to form concepts of a Monistic all pervading subtrate behind all things... and make funny concepts like "you are me" and "i am you" as if we share the same soul... In fact if nonduality is seen very deeply, one would see that this is false..<br><br>You'll never see anything about a universal soul in Buddhism. Yet, our true nature is all pervading and all manifestation have one taste, the manifestation of our pristine awareness.</blockquote>Just to emphasize that.. in Buddhism... we only have individual mindstreams (Even though the mindstream is of the nature of Anatta or 'not-self', and there is no self within nor apart from that mindstream), but never any high concepts like 'universal consciousness', 'universal soul' of that sort that belongs to hinduism and new age. Sometimes things like telepathy or remote viewing can occur, but it has to do with the nature of non-locality and dependent origination, which is something different.<br><br>Just recalled, I posted this in <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=291164&amp;page=5" rel="nofollow">dependent origination and middle way</a>:<br><br>BTW quite recently, I have showed Thusness some of the quotations from an E-Sangha administrator and dharma teacher, Loppon Namdrol. Thusness commented (from these posts) that the writer is an enlightened persons.<br><blockquote>But in the end, one's rigpa is one's own rigpa, and not anyone elses.

It is like, for example, when two people are looking at the same thing and both recognize it at the same time, at that moment, though their experience is personal, it concerns the same thing.<br><br>N</blockquote><blockquote>You should not focus on words like "primordial state" other than to understand it refers to the union of dependent origination and emptiness in a Dzogchen context.</blockquote>------------------<br><br><strong>more recently... by the same poster</strong><br><br><blockquote>QUOTE(Durkhrod Chogori @ Dec 9 2007, 07:50 PM)<br><br>Moreover we have the concept of Universal consciousness...<br>*<br><br>No, actually, we don't. </blockquote>Oh yeah, and this comes from an interesting topic that AndrewPKYap may want to read, its called <a href="http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/index.php?showtopic=61802" rel="nofollow">the logic of rebirth</a><br><br>it's funny how similar clyde is to andrewpkyap in some ways.<br><blockquote>QUOTE(clyde @ Dec 21 2007, 12:34 PM)<br>Namdrol;<br><br>The starting point is not the assertion or denial of rebirth, but whether the physical or mental is primary.  I understand that materialists hold that consciousness is an epiphenomenon of the body.  I also understand that some Buddhists hold that the physical is dependent on the mind.  My view, and I believe it is shared by some Buddhists, is that consciousness and body, the physical and the mind are co-dependent occurrences, each arising in mutual interdependence with the other.<br>*<br><br>Mind and matter are held to be mutually conditioning [rather than mutually dependent] by all Buddhist schools. This has to be the case, for example, in order for there to be a percept of a physical object through a physical sense organ.<br><br>Even so, as I implied above, the consequence of an absolute mutual dependence between a given body and a given mind still leads to a physicalist assertion, i.e. without that specific body, that specific mind is not possible. You might argue, it is also the case that without that specific mind that specific body is also impossible, but where as it is easy to see where the raw material for a body can come from, it is not so easy to see where the raw material out of which a coherent consciousness might arise from, it is not arising from a neural net.<br><br>Even if you argue that they arise together i.e. using some emergent property theory ala complexity, it is still a fundamentally physicalist argument.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notions of universal consciousnesses are non-Buddhist beliefs entirely and can be left out of this discussion.</span></strong><br><br>N </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From a conversation a while ago...<br><br>(11:54 AM) Thusness: if there is no universal consciousness, then what is the ultimate in buddhism?<br>(11:55 AM) AEN____: emptiness, dependent arising<br>(11:55 AM) Thusness: yes<br>(11:56 AM) Thusness: so what is buddhist teaching about consciousness?<br>(11:56 AM) AEN____: they're conditions?<br>(11:56 AM) Thusness: what do u mean by conditions?<br>(11:57 AM) Thusness: first u must understand AEN stream is AEN stream.<br>(11:57 AM) Thusness: Thusness stream is Thusness stream of consciousness<br>(11:57 AM) Thusness: consciousness is non-dual and empty<br>(11:58 AM) Thusness: and after understanding, to live as what we truly are.<br>(11:58 AM) Thusness: that is all.<br>(11:58 AM) AEN____: oic..<br>(11:59 AM) Thusness: all experiences are non-dual and empty<br>(11:59 AM) Thusness: this stream of Thusness consciousness is not AEN stream of consciousness<br>(11:59 AM) AEN____: oic<br>(12:00 PM) Thusness: and the purpose of practice is to live as what we original are.<br>(12:00 PM) Thusness: pure luminosity<br>(12:00 PM) Thusness: and know that our nature is empty.<br>(12:00 PM) AEN____: icic..<br>(12:00 PM) Thusness: therefore the entire experience is oriented into DO (Dependent Origination).<br>(12:00 PM) Thusness: there is no universal consciousness<br>(12:01 PM) AEN____: oic.. yea<br>(12:01 PM) Thusness: the ultimate understanding is to know what consciousness is and know manifestion is what DO has expressed.<br>(12:02 PM) Thusness: to correct see consciousness as it is.<br>(12:02 PM) Thusness: nothing else.<br>(12:02 PM) AEN____: icic..<br>(12:02 PM) Thusness: to experience clarity of our luminosity and its emptiness nature.<br>(12:02 PM) Thusness: the problem is we don't<br>(12:02 PM) Thusness: we continue to speculate even after the glimpse<br>(12:02 PM) Thusness: that is propensity<br>(12:03 PM) Thusness: we don't tune ourselves into actual practice<br>(12:04 PM) Thusness: into experiencing the fullest clarity of our luminous and empty nature.<br>(12:04 PM) Thusness: we do live as pure awareness<br>(12:04 PM) Thusness: don't<br>(12:04 PM) Thusness: that is the problem.<br>(12:04 PM) Thusness: we continue to engage in arbitary thoughts because of propensities.<br>(12:04 PM) Thusness: we give importance, meanings<br>(12:05 PM) Thusness: when u hear sound free of symbols, is it important?<br>(12:05 PM) AEN____: the experience is impt not the meaning<br>(12:06 PM) AEN____: ya its not impt<br>(12:06 PM)

grasp the experience?<br>(12:09 PM) Thusness: and what does that mean?<br>(12:09 PM) AEN____: tat means the mind can never 'understand' or 'know'<br>(12:10 PM) Thusness: knowing has not taken its proper place.<br>(12:10 PM) Thusness: first u must know what is the conventional mind about.<br>(12:10 PM) Thusness: it is about views and meanings are derived from these views.<br>(12:10 PM) Thusness: it is about constructs.<br>(12:11 PM) Thusness: the conventional mind is full of meanings and purposes.<br>(12:11 PM) Thusness: taht is what it is about.<br>(12:11 PM) Thusness: therefore the mind cannot understand because understanding is not the way.<br>(12:12 PM) Thusness: but to such dualistic mind, it immediately concludes that if there is no 'knowing' then we become a dumb dumb...a rock..<br>(12:12 PM) AEN____: lol<br>(12:13 PM) Thusness: because our mind is full of abitary thoughts and views, it is loaded meanings and purposes.<br>(12:13 PM) Thusness: when bare attention is taught, the mind cannot 'see'.<br>(12:14 PM) Thusness: because it has no meaning, purpose, views, constructs whatsoever.<br>(12:14 PM) AEN____: icic..<br>(12:14 PM) Thusness: the essence cannot be intuitively grasped.<br>(12:14 PM) Thusness: however when the mind settles and is calm<br>(12:15 PM) Thusness: it is not looking for meaning<br>(12:15 PM) Thusness: is a person sitting still meaningful?<br>(12:15 PM) Thusness: is absorption meaningful?<br>(12:15 PM) Thusness: a practitioner when engaged in such activities experiences differently.<br>(12:15 PM) AEN____: no<br>(12:16 PM) Thusness: it touches the world of luminosity, presence and spontaneity.<br>(12:16 PM) AEN____: icic<br>(12:16 PM) Thusness: the unconditioned, the aliveness, spontaneity, oneness<br>(12:16 PM) Thusness: the Presence<br>(12:17 PM) AEN____: oic<br>(12:17 PM) Thusness: is not about meaning.<br>(12:17 PM) AEN____: ya..<br>(12:17 PM) Thusness: it is just that Presence that replaces all and the knowing is immediate and intuitive.<br>(12:18 PM) Thusness: it is to see understand our nature and experience in all circumstances, Presence is always there.<br>(12:18 PM) Thusness: and know to be truly alive, presence must be experienced.<br>(12:19 PM) Thusness: u can say this is the direct knowing in contrast to the dualistic knowing of a conventional mind.<br>(12:20 PM) Thusness: so a practitioner entire experience is oriented into experiencing its luminous empty nature and realises all as its manifestations.<br>(12:21 PM) Thusness: but saying all as its manifestation is not to say i am u.<br>(12:21 PM) AEN____: icic..<br>(12:21 PM) Thusness: that is a dualistic subject and object view.<br>(12:22 PM) AEN____: oic<br>(12:23 PM) Thusness: u must know the advaita sort of experience when they say all is consciousness<br>(12:23 PM) Thusness: is different.<br>(12:23 PM) Thusness: they are talking about the sensor, the knower<br>(12:23 PM) Thusness: cannot be known and is ultimate<br>(12:23 PM) Thusness: from the known.<br>(12:24 PM) AEN____: icic..<br>(12:24 PM) AEN____: then how is that 'all'<br>(12:24 PM) Thusness: but to a buddhist taht is non dualist, the sensor is known through the known<br>(12:25 PM) Thusness: the sensed/known is the instrument for sensing the sensor<br>(12:25 PM) Thusness: the sensor is also the instrument for sensing the sensed<br>(12:26 PM) Thusness: both the sensor and the sensed are equally unknowable and known<br>(12:26 PM) AEN____: oic..<br>(12:26 PM) Thusness: both having one taste.<br>(12:26 PM) Thusness: inseparable.<br>(12:26 PM) AEN____: the 'sensor' is the citta rite<br>(12:27 PM) Thusness: yeah<br>(12:27 PM) Thusness: purity is not being free of anything<br>(12:27 PM) Thusness: is to know our empty nature that is ever manifesting<br>(12:27 PM) AEN____: icic..<br>(12:28 PM) Thusness: citta is consciousness of the conceptual mind<br>(12:28 PM) Thusness: the knower<br>(12:28 PM) Thusness: the knower can only exist in analysis and thinking<br>(12:29 PM) Thusness: it does not exist in complete bare attention.<br>(12:29 PM) Thusness: an observer exists when we try to reconfirm an experience<br>(12:29 PM) Thusness: when we recall<br>(12:29 PM) Thusness: and arises as a result of comparision<br>(12:29 PM) AEN____: oic..<br>(12:29 PM) Thusness: seems to exist but does not.<br>(12:30 PM) Thusness: a manifestation taht is non-dual in nature is not a stage<br>(12:30 PM) Thusness: it is not a stage that we eliminate our 'selfs'<br>(12:30 PM) Thusness: the observer<br>(12:30 PM) Thusness: it is to know that the 'observer' is an illusion.<br>(12:31 PM) Thusness: so that the DO and luminosity emptiness nature is seen.<br>(12:32 PM) Thusness: DO is the right perspective of non-dual experience for the conventional mind to 'see'.<br>(12:33 PM) AEN____: icic..<br>(12:33 PM) Thusness: once this is seen, we must 'turn' and allow that 'dualistic propensity' to dissolve<br>(12:33 PM) Thusness: there are many ways but bare attention and naked awareness to me is best.<br>(12:34 PM) Thusness: once the nature is understood, the 6 paramitas is understood.<br>(12:35 PM) Thusness: we do not enaged ourselves into useless speculation further knowing that it is propensities that blind.<br>(12:35 PM) Thusness: instead, we work at all levels to allow conditions to meet and allow propensities to manifest<br>(12:36 PM) Thusness: practice the parimatas in all circumstances to all conditions to mirror the latent deep and dissolve that sense of self.<br>(12:36 PM) Thusness: it is not to create useless construct and understand meanings<br>(12:37 PM) Thusness: but experience that luminous empty nature in all activities by dissolving the sense of self.<br>(12:38 PM) Thusness: so when one continue to make sense of after non-dual experience, he will confuse himself further.<br>(12:38 PM) Thusness: he has no clarity of the unconditioned, the unborn, the aliveness yet</div>
