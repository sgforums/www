Otherwise the possibility is as good as a delusion.<br><br>I wonder if you know the concept of 'falsifiability' if not, you should google it.<br><br><blockquote>Falsifiability - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>Falsifiability (or refutability or testability) is the logical possibility that an assertion can be shown false by an observation or a physical experiment. ...<br>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability - 96k - Cached - Similar pages - Note this</blockquote>When something is not falsifiable, it is useless to consider it other than for entertainment or for beliefs.<br><br>God exists. Not falsifiable, useless other than as a belief.<br><br>The statement <strong>"the belief in God/ a God/ Lord Shiva/ Yahweh/ Ganesh/ Tua Peh Kong/ Jesus, is beneficial"</strong>, that statement is falsifiable, and you can actually conduct an experiment to show whether the statement is true or false, it is "falsifiable".<br><br>Just that believers are not willing to agree on what constitute "proof" whether that statement is true or false.<br><br>For example, we can say the statement is "true" or "false" depending on whether praying to any or one or all of the God/s will result in a miracle. "no miracle, then false. Miracle, then true. The statement is falsifiable.<br><br>The believers are not so stupid as to do that, shatter their beliefs. So what they do is to define "beneficial" (in that context) to be unfalsifiable.<br><br>For example the believers can say, "it is beneficial if I feel that it is beneficial". That is unfalsifiable and if you define beneficial like that, then the original statement of unfalsifiable, and useless (other than as beliefs or entertainment, or to make you feel better).<br><br>So your sentience theory, is not falsifiable. Your theory that "The end result can be anything including the extermination of the human race or the next big advance to humanity" is not falsifiable and thus useless other than as a belief or for entertainment.</div>
