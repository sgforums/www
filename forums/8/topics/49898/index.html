            <div class='col-md body'>I was flipping through my old materials which I studied during my training and I came across this article which I thought should be quite useful to many people out there. I suddenly realised that I do have a hugh pool of knowledge to draw from (My old Materials) and I think I will share them with you people when I'm free to type them out. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Meanwhile enjoy this piece...<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>10 Ways to Know When Your Relationship is "Right"</strong><br><br>I spend much of my time pointing out where things went wrong with people's relationship. I thought it might be time to look at what makes a relationship "right". That is, how do you know you're in a relationship that can last?<br><br>Here's 10 of them which I thought can give you a pretty good idea of what is happening in your relationship:<br><br><strong>1. You feel good about yourself and your world.</strong><br><br>A good relationship makes you feel great. It should fill in your "gaps" and make you feel whole. It should give you emotional strength and help you to feel that everything is ok - and will continue to be.<br><br>Another good sign is that you're better able to survive disasters at work, at home, etc. - not because you know someone will be there to solve them, but because you know that YOU can.<br><br><strong>2. You look forward to spending time together.</strong><br><br>Far too many couples stay together out of habit. They don't really look forward to being together and try to find ways to avoid it. For example, they always try to include other friends, go to an event so that they'll have something to do, etc.<br><br>Another sign is fear of the "conversation lag" where nobody has anything to say. If your relationship is "right", you'll enjoy spending quality time together - even when it's quiet.<br><br><strong>3. You respect your partner, and "talk him or her up."</strong><br><br>Is there anyone that agrees with everything someone else says or thinks? (I can tell you - nobody agrees with everything I say!) There's no reason you have to agree with everything your partner says or thinks either. However, you should RESPECT them for it - right or wrong.<br><br>Further, when you respect someone - really respect them - you find yourself "talking them up" to people. You say things like, "You know, my girlfriend said something that I don't agree with, but it really made me think" or "My husband really knows about wood working - you should ask him about it."<br><br>What this really shows is your focus - if you find you're always talking about yourself, you're not focused on your partner - or the relationship.<br><br><strong>4. You are really interested in what he or she thinks.</strong><br><br>Along with respect, you'll find that you are interested in your partner's thoughts on different things - and you ask. You might have heard the President of your company say something and you ask your wife to get her take on it. Or, you may have come up with an idea that you want your boyfriend to think about - and you're not afraid of getting shot down.<br><br><strong>5. You are aware of, but ignore their quirks.</strong><br><br>Everyone (even YOU bunky!) has his or her little quirks. Your partner's quirks might even appear cute to you, or at least harmless. If they're getting to you, you should look more closely at your relationship in general.<br><br><strong>6. Problems don't make you think about breaking up.</strong><br><br>All relationships have problems. It's natural and healthy. However, if every time you fight you feel ready to break up, you should re-think your relationship. People that have good, solid relationships see disagreements as a chance to learn more about their lover, and to get closer. Thus, they don't fear them, but they don't create them either!<br><br><strong>7. You aren't scared about losing him or her.</strong><br><br>Once you start investing your feelings in a relationship you risk being hurt. This isn't my rule - it's just the way it is. However, if you dwell on the possibility of being hurt, you can't really enjoy the relationship. Further, you shouldn't be concerned that your lover isn't happy. If the relationship is secure - you'll know it.<br><br><strong>8. You're together "just because."</strong><br><br>Many people start dating and then coordinate their lives such that they have to be together - either for finances, kids, family, work, the dog, etc. Is there something keeping your relationship together?<br><br>If you're together just because you both want to be, you've got a good reason to stay together! If you're together because you have to be, you'll likely to start having problems.<br><br><strong>9. You appreciate other attractive people, but aren't interested in them.</strong><br><br>There is someone more attractive than your boyfriend, girlfriend, husband or wife. I don't care whom you're with! If your relationship is good, you still like the way other people look, but don't find it necessary to compare them to your partner. After all ...<br><br><strong>10. You are in love.</strong><br><br>If you don't know that you're in love, you're not. Love is very difficult to explain, but one of the best explanations I've seen is this:<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">"Love is when you are more concerned with the well being, safety and happiness of someone else than your own."</span></strong><br><br>That's a pretty powerful idea, and something I hope everyone gets to experience.<br><br>Good Luck And much love to all your relationships. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

When you love a person you love him/her as a whole. And those negative parts about them are also part of them. And if you can't accept them, did you really accepted and love him/her for what he/she is?<br><br>This brings me to one event here, a ex-gf of mine once ask me what I love her for, and my reply...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I love you for the fact that you are so blur at times and for having such a short attention span. And I love you for the way you dress, which sometimes makes you look like a clown and for the overcooked food that you always cook for me, which gives me tummyaches. I love you for the way you wake up in the morning, when your hair is in disarray, and for the way you shout at me when I try to wake you up. I love you for the fact that you are so concern about the way you look, asking me every 5 mins whether you look good. And most of all. I love you for all that is you, all good and bad, ugly and beautiful and of course young and old, for it is only just you.</span><br><br>And that is when she felt most loved by me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

I suddenly realised that I do have a hugh pool of knowledge to draw from (My old Materials) and I think I will share them with you people when I'm free to type them out. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Meanwhile enjoy this piece...<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>[b]10 Ways to Know When Your Relationship is "Right"</strong><br><br>I spend much of my time pointing out where things went wrong with people's relationship. I thought it might be time to look at what makes a relationship "right". That is, how do you know you're in a relationship that can last?<br><br>Here's 10 of them which I thought can give you a pretty good idea of what is happening in your relationship:<br><br><strong>1. You feel good about yourself and your world.</strong><br><br>A good relationship makes you feel great. It should fill in your "gaps" and make you feel whole. It should give you emotional strength and help you to feel that everything is ok - and will continue to be.<br><br>Another good sign is that you're better able to survive disasters at work, at home, etc. - not because you know someone will be there to solve them, but because you know that YOU can.<br><br><strong>2. You look forward to spending time together.</strong><br><br>Far too many couples stay together out of habit. They don't really look forward to being together and try to find ways to avoid it. For example, they always try to include other friends, go to an event so that they'll have something to do, etc.<br><br>Another sign is fear of the "conversation lag" where nobody has anything to say. If your relationship is "right", you'll enjoy spending quality time together - even when it's quiet.<br><br><strong>3. You respect your partner, and "talk him or her up."</strong><br><br>Is there anyone that agrees with everything someone else says or thinks? (I can tell you - nobody agrees with everything I say!) There's no reason you have to agree with everything your partner says or thinks either. However, you should RESPECT them for it - right or wrong.<br><br>Further, when you respect someone - really respect them - you find yourself "talking them up" to people. You say things like, "You know, my girlfriend said something that I don't agree with, but it really made me think" or "My husband really knows about wood working - you should ask him about it."<br><br>What this really shows is your focus - if you find you're always talking about yourself, you're not focused on your partner - or the relationship.<br><br><strong>4. You are really interested in what he or she thinks.</strong><br><br>Along with respect, you'll find that you are interested in your partner's thoughts on different things - and you ask. You might have heard the President of your company say something and you ask your wife to get her take on it. Or, you may have come up with an idea that you want your boyfriend to think about - and you're not afraid of getting shot down.<br><br><strong>5. You are aware of, but ignore their quirks.</strong><br><br>Everyone (even YOU bunky!) has his or her little quirks. Your partner's quirks might even appear cute to you, or at least harmless. If they're getting to you, you should look more closely at your relationship in general.<br><br><strong>6. Problems don't make you think about breaking up.</strong><br><br>All relationships have problems. It's natural and healthy. However, if every time you fight you feel ready to break up, you should re-think your relationship. People that have good, solid relationships see disagreements as a chance to learn more about their lover, and to get closer. Thus, they don't fear them, but they don't create them either!<br><br><strong>7. You aren't scared about losing him or her.</strong><br><br>Once you start investing your feelings in a relationship you risk being hurt. This isn't my rule - it's just the way it is. However, if you dwell on the possibility of being hurt, you can't really enjoy the relationship. Further, you shouldn't be concerned that your lover isn't happy. If the relationship is secure - you'll know it.<br><br><strong>8. You're together "just because."</strong><br><br>Many people start dating and then coordinate their lives such that they have to be together - either for finances, kids, family, work, the dog, etc. Is there something keeping your relationship together?<br><br>If you're together just because you both want to be, you've got a good reason to stay together! If you're together because you have to be, you'll likely to start having problems.<br><br><strong>9. You appreciate other attractive people, but aren't interested in them.</strong><br><br>There is someone more attractive than your boyfriend, girlfriend, husband or wife. I don't care whom you're with! If your relationship is good, you still like the way other people look, but don't find it necessary to compare them to your partner. After all ...<br><br><strong>10. You are in love.</strong><br><br>If you don't know that you're in love, you're not. Love is very difficult to explain, but one of the best explanations I've seen is this:<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">"Love is when you are more concerned with the well being, safety and happiness of someone else than your own."</span></strong><br><br>That's a pretty powerful idea, and something I hope everyone gets to experience.<br><br>Good Luck And much love to all your relationships. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">[/b]</blockquote>If u think u r right then u r wrong....
