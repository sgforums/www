            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Singapore has potential to be exporter of solar energy technology </strong><br><br>Singapore may not have oil - but it has sunshine, and lots of it.<br><br>And solar energy experts at an energy efficiency seminar say there's potential for Singapore to develop and sell this technology.<br><br>The experts say Singapore has twice the potential for solar energy, compared to Germany, a leader in the field.<br><br>Dr Volkhard Reichmann, Head of Department of Energy, Coal and Mining at the Economic Affairs Ministry in Germany, said: "Also you have the big buildings, you can use photovoltaic energy on the roof but also on in the facade."<br><br>For example, there's an ongoing pilot project to use solar energy to light common areas in HDB blocks.<br><br>But solar energy is still costly.<br><br>And Dr Reichmann acknowledged that governments still have to sponsor the technology through subsidies or loans.<br><br>In Germany, for instance, utilities companies pay households which help to contribute solar energy to the power grid 50 Euro cents or 80 Singapore cents per kilowatt hour.<br><br>Mr Christophe Inglin, Managing Director of Shell Solar Pte Ltd, said: "At today's prices, one could argue that it doesn't compete against the power stations so it does need financial support.<br><br>"But we see from examples in countries like Japan, US or Western Europe, that support doesn't cost the government very much and it is contributing to a vast expansion of the solar power market which in turn is driving down prices, as you get the economies of scale."<br><br>In Singapore, the Energy Authority Market has estimated that the cost of solar photovoltic cells to be between $ 0.25 to $0.38 per kilowatt hour.<br><br>And this is considerably higher than Power Supply's current $ 0.1651 per kilowatt hour.<br><br>EMA adds that solar energy is viable, if consumers are prepared to pay the higher price.<br><br>Still, Singapore is already looking at implementing it.<br><br>Dr Balaji Sadasivan, Minister of State for Health and the Environment, said: "We are working with several private and public sector partners to explore and develop test-bedding opportunities."<br><br>Solar thermal energy for hot water requirements is already implemented in several hotels and even private homes.<br><br>But Dr Balaji said the major challenge was to harness solar energy for other applications, such as electricity generation - which is affordable, with a high energy yield."<br><br>When that happens, Singapore can reap the benefits.<br><br>Mr Inglin added: "Singapore itself, with its capacity doesn't need additional generating capacity. Asia Pacific generally certainly does.<br><br>"There's a lot of region that's remote from the grid and where the grid is very expensive to install because you don't have a dense urban population like Singapore, so the advantage for Singapore in developing the know-how and technology is to export this as a business in the region."<br><br>(taken from CNA website)<br></div>
