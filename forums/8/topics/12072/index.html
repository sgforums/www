Not really good.<br><br>That Aki from the FF Movie really looks like Changi Village's Bapoh to me.<br><br>I would say the most chio girl from FF series would be Tifa from FF7 and Rinoa Heartily from FF8.<br><br>Sephiroth also not bad, quite chio.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I went to see FF Movie: The Spirits Within.<br><br>The Visuals are great. You can say it is number.1 in the visual effects. The creatures, mechanical and transport design are so-far the best.<br><br>But I must say that I think the Japanese should stick to making games better, at least they wont disappoint the movie-goers.<br><br>All I can remember about this movie is patches of glow of red and blue flashing here and there. Dont know what the hell was going on,..wat 8th spirit, wat phantom bla bla bla...<br><br>The story is boring, and I can see it's the same BORING AND CONFUSING style as Parasite Eve, XenoGear , Vagrant Story and Final Fantasy 7 - you wont know what the hell they are talking even when the game finishes.<br><br>I hate to say this but, I think the story sucks like Parasite Eve and XenoGear.<br><br>The characters lack facial expression. Even when they are terrified or scared, they dont seem to be.<br><br>One thing I hate about this show : Why in a group of alien-hunters there must always be a good-looking leader, a beautiful and gentle doctor, a tough and act-cool rugged singlet-wearing girl, a like-to-talk-rot joker, a strong looking negro and an old professor ??????????<br>Obviously they're trying to do it the HollyWood Style, but they should've known that Japanese Games and HollWood Movies do not mix, or else it's dead meat.<br>Ever seen a creature that looks like a tiger and at the same time looks like an elephant?<br><br>One last thing to mention, this movie has really (or almost) nothing to do with the FF series. No Guardian Force, No Odin, No Bahamut or Shiva, Not to mention Ice 4, bio  3, Chocobos,  materias ....<br>It's just another SuperNova or Lost in Space....or Starship Troopers...<br>Then why call it Final Fantasy??<br>Think they're just trying to make it big with the name that's all...<br>I thought they'd be making the movie their own Japanese style, but alamak, they were trying to copy the ang-mohs all along.<br>What a disappointment !!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aki is chio in the sense that she looks real and with a little imperfection... To me, that makes me thinks she's real. Riona and Tifa is very sweet andd simply too good to be true...  Of course lah... they will drawn out.. Can make until super nice, but can't find this type in real life... Maybe it might be possible to find someone who look like Aki in this real world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in FF movie, the story is more or less related to the games. in fact, i noticed that they took 2 or at least 3 games and placed the elements into the show.<br><br>*claps to producer*<br><br>from what i gather, Earth is taken over by aliens, known as Phantoms. and this is a result of a piece of the alien planet crashing into the earth. and the military forces took upon them as an invasion. but they did not eliminate the phantoms, but awoken more of them.<br><br>many years later, Cid developed a special shield whereby the phantoms cannot penetrate. and aki is his student. during aki's study with Cid, she was infected with phantom cells, and she almost died from it, if not for Cid's implantation of the spirits into Aki, she would have died long ago.<br>Hence, Aki's quest here, is to collect spirits, otherwise known as Life sources.<br><br>and, once the council found out about Aki, they gave her the go on more research. but the General was too narrow minded, and only the vengence to wipe out the Phantoms was in his mind.<br><br>further into the show, when gathering the 7th spirit, Aki becomes weaker, and the Phantoms are attracted to her; They treat her as the same kind due to the phantom cells living in her. and further on, the General arrested Aki and Gang, and they finally found out the reason of the Phantom's attacks; they are from their own planet's Gaia, and they are lost because they are in a foreign place, with no resting place, and are being attacked constantly.<br><br>Next the General caused New York to be destroyed, and after that, he went to outer space, while Aki, Cid and Grey, went on to find the 8th spirit.<br><br>When they find it, the General got on Zeus and fired at the core, and destroyed the final spirit. but all hope is not lost when Aki and Grey saw the Gaia for the first time, therefore proving Cid's theory.<br><br>and then, at the end, just when the alien planet's Gaia is about to take over the Earth, Aki recieves the Final Spirit, because the Gaia merged with Aki's Phantom, and then with that, they almost got rid of the Phantom Gaia, when Zeus fired directly into Earth's Gaia.<br><br>Then Grey decided to sacrifice himself to save the earth, and Aki cannot be with Grey, even though she is cured. and when Grey died with the Phantom, we can see the Phantom breaking into a million pieces and flying out of earth in a pillar of bright light.<br><br>The Phantoms are released from their torture, and Aki is cured, but Grey and the rest will never return again.<br><br>Summary of FF movie done.<br><br>------------------<br>Let me embrace u in my arms, to protect u from harm.<br><br>Let me be the one to feel your pain, for I can't bear to c u in suffering.<br><br>Let me show u what my love can do for u, touch my heart the way I am going to touch urs....<br><br>I promise that the road that we will be taking is worthwhile, and full of happiness.<br><br>..........................................<br>Visit me at #SSF, to talk abt gaming stuff.<br>#SSF - <a href="http://www.sgforums.com" rel="nofollow">www.sgforums.com</a>  's gaming clan.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey! Aki Ross is CHIO man... one of the best CG babes every created ever.  Yes Rinoa is pretty too, but Rinoa Doesnt have a voice, and skin texturin is also not as well done as Aki's.<br><br>Best of all, Aki was not meant to look too pretty, simply becos, they are in an era of conflict and fighting.  Who goes around wearing lipstick and all searching for lifeforms admist thousands of phantoms would would like to just walk past u?  Also remember, she's a dying person, no reason to make her look too pretty.. lol.  But still, most of the people who saw the movie feel that she is the prettiest CG babes ever made, not just because of the looks and figure, but also the character shown in the story. + SHE HAS A VOICE!<br><br>Sure some of the expressions are not as well done.  But the trouble with CG movies is animating expressions. Its not as simple as telling them to frown or cry, like it is telling real life actors.  Every animation has to be stretched and pulled, and even redrawn.  I say FF:The spirits within has set the standard for CG movies.  Compare it with Shrek, which was also released roughly the same time... compare the 2 protaganist.  FF definitely has taken to the extreme virtual reality movies.  Who knows? One day they will blur the edge between real and CG, eg, Finaly Fantasy : blah blah, starring john travolta, ghurmit singh and aki ross?</div>
