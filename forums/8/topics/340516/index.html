              <p><strong>standard international shipping is usually around the US$7 - US$14 range, but you need to check Amazon.com for that.</strong></p>

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">You go to your order page to see if it has been shipped yet. If it says it has not, then you can cancel or modify your order. It will then say the order is cancelled. That's it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">I'm guessing you are thinking of a last second cancellation situation. I've never had one of those, so I can't tell you what happens in those cases. But it is very unlikely, because even if the item is in stock, they still have to pack it, then have it picked up by UPS, or FedEx, or whichever courier they use. This takes a little time, even if it is a day.</span></p>

              <p>not that i wanna rant, but this whole international shipping crap in BULL-S***.</p>
              <p>based on my personal experience recently, i ordered some stuff from a big, well-known US retailer and the products never came after even more than a month.</p>
              <p>the problem is that international shipping doesn't provide tracking numbers, so even if your product is stuck in Gulf of Aden or already being taken by Somali pirates, nobody knows where it is. Or maybe it's in the home of that postal guy. U never know.</p>
              <p>i wouldn't say the chances are 50-50%.....it's more like 70 - 30%.</p>
              <p>70% being the amt of chance you'll see your product, and 30% being the amt of chance you'll never get it.</p>
              <p>and when you call or e-mail the company, they can't do anything either.</p>
              <p>they'll just claim they've shipped the **** out.</p>
              <p>it's a total utter shame that even in the year 2008 now and 2009, international shipping still can't provide tracking numbers. it's like we're living in a 21st century with 2500 B.C. shipping.</p>
              <p>also, if the product is a gift for someone, make sure you order it as early as possible, because sometimes, the product can get delayed for MONTHS. Yes, MONTHS.</p>
              <p>some companies (but few) also provide express international shipping (by DHL, UPS etc.) where they give you a tracking number, but the cost is insane.</p>
              <p>it's around US$34 (minimum end) to hundreds of dollars.</p>
              <p>i tried to order a US$10.99 mug from USA and go by express shipping.</p>
              <p>the express shipping fee was US$36 and i gave up.</p>

              <p>Yep, they charge in USD.</p>
              <p>Use a currency converter to chnge USD to SGD. I use yahoo, out of long habit.</p>
              <p>But the relationship between USD and SGD has been quite stable for at least 3-4 years. Roughly USD$1.00 = SGD$1.40 to $1.50 . You can make approximate calculations in your head using this.</p>

              <p>not that i wanna rant, but this whole international shipping crap in BULL-S***.</p>
              <p>based on my personal experience recently, i ordered some stuff from a big, well-known US retailer and the products never came after even more than a month.</p>
              <p>the problem is that international shipping doesn't provide tracking numbers, so even if your product is stuck in Gulf of Aden or already being taken by Somali pirates, nobody knows where it is. Or maybe it's in the home of that postal guy. U never know.</p>
              <p>i wouldn't say the chances are 50-50%.....it's more like 70 - 30%.</p>
              <p>70% being the amt of chance you'll see your product, and 30% being the amt of chance you'll never get it.</p>
              <p>and when you call or e-mail the company, they can't do anything either.</p>
              <p>they'll just claim they've shipped the **** out.</p>
              <p>it's a total utter shame that even in the year 2008 now and 2009, international shipping still can't provide tracking numbers. it's like we're living in a 21st century with 2500 B.C. shipping.</p>
              <p>also, if the product is a gift for someone, make sure you order it as early as possible, because sometimes, the product can get delayed for MONTHS. Yes, MONTHS.</p>
              <p>some companies (but few) also provide express international shipping (by DHL, UPS etc.) where they give you a tracking number, but the cost is insane.</p>
              <p>it's around US$34 (minimum end) to hundreds of dollars.</p>
              <p>i tried to order a US$10.99 mug from USA and go by express shipping.</p>
              <p>the express shipping fee was US$36 and i gave up.</p>
