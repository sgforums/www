Shuttle bus A, B and C. One follows the bus 179 loop, the other follows the bus 199 roue and service C is the combined service 179 + 199 loop in opposite direction.<br><br>The lecture theatres are located at the spines. North spine is mainly for CEE, MSE, MAE AND CE students. Also, library 1 and 2 are located there. So you can expect thousands of students and staff at Canteen A during lunch time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>South spine is mainly for EEE and NBS students. With the demolishment of Canteen 3 soon, Canteen B will be very packed as well. The HSS library is located just outside the Popular bookshop.
