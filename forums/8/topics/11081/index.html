            <div class='col-md body'>Well, 2 more weeks and it's my 3rd year anniversary with Jared (aka. Rulakir)...<br><br>Well again, had the thought of sharing with all how we got together ... it's very the ridiculous, a bit the mission impossible, but here we are, 3 years and still counting...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>We knew each other from a BBS (nvm... it's just a private bulletin board  system...). Anyway, to cut a long story short, our first contact was through irc (though he was just a name to me then). It just happened  that on that first nite I chatted online, there was a irc gathering the next day... we went to watch a movie, and typical of rulakir  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> he was  very late... and appeared only after the movie ended  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I mean... if a guy is so late for a gathering 'cos he overslept by so long, what will any gal think? Well, that's what I thought.<br><br>Nothing much happened after that gathering (didn't have a good impression of him yeah...), though we went out once after that...but pls hor... it wasn't a date... go sim lim only...<br><br>It happened that our birthday are 2 days apart... So when our birthday were near, me...being a nice nice person (dun vomit hor...), ask him what present he wants... would get it for him if within my ability...<br>Well, his first wish was something maybe only fulfillable by God, and his second one was to find a girlfriend... well, I dunno what's wrong with me then, but somehow, maybe I was in a naughty/daring mood, well, I agreed to be his girlfriend for just one day... Dun ask me why... I also dunno...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Anyway, oh well, our birthdays happened to fall around the Chinese New Year holidays, and he happend to have a close fren whose birthday happened to fall just in between ours. So, Rulakir came up with this conspiracy to trick his frens into believing that he found a girlfriend... So, we arranged to have the conspiracy on that fren's birthday (well, that's yesterday...) and his frens celebrated our birthdays for us, then went for movie... All along, we held hands and chat... We got to know each other better while pretending to be a couple... All his frens really got tricked into beliving that we're attached and when we told them the truth, it was like !!!!!!!! Well, I think we really deserve the Oscars for our acting... maybe best couple... there was another couple who were among his frens also, and they were not even as "real" as us  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">should win oscar for best couple  :p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(Continued from above... I think the server can't handle my long post, so posting in two parts...  :p)<br><br>After that day, I had the feeling that I knew Jared for a long long time, as if I knew him all along, and the feeling with him was so<br>right... This feeling was reaffirmed when we went out together (to ACJC fair). After going through a few disappointments in my love life, I decide not to let another chance pass by me again...<br><br>Guess what I did? I left him a msg on his pager (that time alphanumeric kind) saying that "Still in school, but thinking of you"... Dun want to elaborate everything liao... too mushy... suffice to say that he asked me out of Valentine's Day, which was exactly 2 wks after my birthday... And nothing much happened on V-Day, just that we got attached lor...<br><br>All our friends were shock, partly becos acting become real... also, at that time, irc relationship wasn't that popular and it was very new... and I was like testing water like that... doing something so 'innovative'<br><br>Oh well, it's exactly 3 years (plus 1 day...I wanted to post this yesterday nite) from that fateful day that conspiracy happened...<br><br>To all of you who are reading this: Happy Valentine's Day...<br><br>To those who are still single: Dun lose hope... miracles do happen...<br><br>To my love,<br>Dear ah, you got regret getting attached to me or not?<br><br>Just to say... I love you... *kiss*<br><br>[This message has been edited by Shervon99 (edited 31 January 2001).]</div>
