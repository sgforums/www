Cos some gals r very insensitive thinking tat u r taking her granted. so mayb surprise her a small gift which wil brighten up her day. sometimes girls need to be "hong(3)".<br><br>Like my bf, he wil feel guilty if he's tired or feel tat he has no time for me. He wil tell me he wil feel guilty n sorry abt it the next morning. n i wil b understanding.<br><br>btw, wat makes her feel insecure abt u? she dun trust u? y is tat so? any incidence which makes her to change? tink carefully abt it.<br><br>Mayb u can help her to change if u really want to.<br><br>Anyway, good luck in ur relationship!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

We didn't talk all the time, just talk, silence... wait.... sing a bit... wah lao, tak boleh tahan man.  I just didn't know how to say no back then.<br><br>Maybe u can just be decisive, and say things like,  "hey, i'll call u back tommorrow, i am very hot and sticky now, need to shower badly" , things like that lah.
