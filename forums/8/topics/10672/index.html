But, The Sunday Times' WENDY TAN discovers that there is quite a lot more you can catch from a kiss<br><br>YOU may be young and madly in love, but those passionate kisses you exchange with your beloved could make you sick.<br><br>Pucker up and you could land yourself in bed for weeks with the "kissing disease", like Miss Anna Lee (not her real name), 20, a Singaporean undergraduate studying in California.<br><br>She caught mononucleosis -- mono for short -- early this year. Usually spread through saliva and mucus, it is nicknamed the "kissing disease" because kissing is a common way of spreading the virus.<br><br>"It started as a bad cold and my doctor thought it was the flu because I also had a sore throat, fever and felt tired constantly," said Miss Lee.<br><br>But after a week, her fever was still high and the doctor noticed that her liver was enlarged.<br><br>"Finally, another doctor did a blood test and found out that it was mono. I had to have complete bed rest and couldn't do any sports for two months," she said.<br><br>Mono strikes those between the ages of 10 and 35, and is most common in people 15 to 17 years old.<br><br>The US Food and Drug Administration says that 50 out of 100,000 contract mononucleosis in the US, but it can strike as many as two out of 1,000 people in their teens and 20s.<br><br>The viruses responsible the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes about 85 per cent of all cases, and cytomegalovirus belong to the herpes family.<br><br>Dr Wong Sin Yew, a physician in private practice who specialises in infectious diseases, said: "Most people get infected in their late teens because that's when they start getting attracted to the opposite sex.<br>"But it is entirely possible for someone in his 30s to get it."<br><br>The flu-like symptoms include fatigue, fever and sore throat.<br><br>Sufferers have swollen glands in the neck, which is why the illness is also called glandular fever.<br><br>A common complication is hepatitis or inflammation of the liver.<br><br>Not every patient realises what illness he has caught.<br><br>Generally, the older the patient, the more likely the symptoms will show and the longer they will last.<br><br>Mono is usually self-limiting and once someone has had it, chances are he will not get it again.<br><br>But the virus can remain in the saliva for as long as 18 months after the initial infection.<br><br>The Epstein-Barr virus can recur later in life and has been associated with certain cancers, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, oral and throat cancers.<br><br>Another virus which can be transmitted through kissing is herpes simplex. All it needs is for one party with a break in his skin or who has herpes sores to be able to infect another.<br><br>The receiving party need not have a break in the skin to catch the virus.<br><br>The sores may not be obvious, especially if it is not the infected person's first outbreak, but that does not stop the transmission of the virus.<br><br>Dr Wong said: "If someone has sores, it would be logical not to kiss him but that's often not practised."<br><br>In very rare instances, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) -- which causes Aids -- has been transmitted through kissing.<br>But such infections are extremely rare with just two cases reported worldwide.<br><br>Dr Wong said: "It also requires both parties to have breaks in the skin, in order for it to be transmitted."<br><br>Otherwise, you cannot catch HIV through kissing.<br><br>With some diseases, you do not even need to kiss to get sick.<br><br>Just getting close enough to pucker up is enough for you to pick up tuberculosis and meningitis. Meningitis is an inflammation of the brain and can be fatal.<br><br>Dr Wong said: "These illnesses, as well as influenza, which is caused by a virus present in nasal and oral secretions, can be transmitted through close contact."<br><br>Sometimes, it just does not pay to get up close and personal.<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>What you could catch<br><br>*	Mononucleosis<br>Nicknamed the "kissing disease", it is spread through saliva and mucus. Symptoms include fatigue and fever.<br><br>*	Herpes simplex<br>Infection can occur if one party has a break in his skin or has herpes sores. The receiving party need not have a break in the skin to catch the virus.<br><br>*	HIV<br>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been transmitted by kissing in two reported cases.</div>
