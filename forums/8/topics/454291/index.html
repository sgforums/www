              <p>We all know that local successfully "creative" talent like Mr Sim Wong Hoo they made their achievement only in overseas, but definitely not in Singapore. In fact how many of us know that the invention of thumbdrive is invented by an Singaporean name Henn Tan from Trek company, but we didn't know because in the end it is overseas company like IBM that owned "his" thumbdrive which become an "fashion" to replace DVD. This also prove that in Singapore there seem to be no "Intellectual Property" of it own to promote local creativity and every product that an fellow singaporean create are view as common "thing" and are just taken for granted just like an cup of kopi and it take an influential outsider like US to prompt it.</p>
              <p>  In fact, even Steve Wozniak said that Singapore is not creative and his reasons : <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/searealtime/2011/12/15/wozniak-apple-couldnt-emerge-in-singapore">http://blogs.wsj.com/searealtime/2011/12/15/wozniak-apple-couldnt-emerge-in-singapore</a> , it is no wonder he came up with this idea because some start-ups from Silicon Valley did tried to move to Singapore and they doesn't find it equally awesome as the Silicon Valley itself, that why their branches in Singapore are just an "dummy" office for show.</p>
              <p>  "Creative" people are often treated with "bias" because Singapore is an academic society (no different from Ancient China's Scholar exams] - hence, the inventing process is often seen by gahmen as a "burden", not an investment item on the national development policies.</p>
              <p>   And to forget to mention entrepreneurship was ruined by education ladder like ITE, Poly and finally NS to Uni if they are lucky. As for our education system are run by meritocratic guidelines - no one will risk implement any worth of brilliant but risky proposal. Some gahmen bodies will stated like all creative applications with related to multimedia must be "technically solid" with the proper "technological credentials" - in other words that as "only certified degree holders in any field may apply for a creative media grant", hence artists without cert may or may not have any chance.</p>
              <p>Finally, I think most society like Singapore are mad about iPhone or Angry birds that they will rather leave the "creativity" to overseas market.</p>
