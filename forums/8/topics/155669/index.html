Sometimes you may even feel well, but over time, you will feel nauseous and unwell (with fever and a distended abdomen) with localized pain over your right upper groin region. On light touch or palpation, you will feel a hard mass, its an abscess that has accumulated over time because of continuing inflammation and nothing has been done to it. Some may perforate before becoming abscess, whereas some becomes abscess because the intiating cause is minor.<br><br>The symptoms can come all at once in 1 second, or over a few days. 6 months of illness is considered chronic, less than 1 month is acute whereas in between we usually call it subacute.<br><br>Erm... there is really no known cause as to why it can happen, but a very good hypothesis states that constipation is the number one cause compounded by the factor that the patient does not eat fiber (fruits, vegetables and juices). So what happens is that the feces (sh.it) is hardened and it is tough to pass through the large bowels, and they get impacted on the lumen (small hole) of the appendix leading to stasis. This will eagerly attract bacteria to colonize the area leading to inflammation.<br><br>Acute appendicitis favors the young mostly, adults don't really get it probably because their lumen of the appendix is matured and hence larger than that of the child.<br><br>The typical tale of don't run around after eating is not proven yet. A good counter-discussion to this tale is that the food remains in the stomach for up to 4 hours, the small intestine for up to 6 hours, and only reaches the site of appendix after the 10 hours, so you shouldn't run around after 10 hours of eating... but that again is not proven yet.</div>

If you go and ask those people who have it removed, you will see a long scar just under your right rib cage. It is quite large right?<br><br>But nowadays, removal of gall bladder can be done through laporoscopic method, meaning they use real-live camera to view the site of the organ and remove it by using the appropriate instruments.<br><br>For Laporoscopic Cholecystectomy, they punch 4 small holes around the site of the gallbladder and then remove it. I personally seen 5 operations of this method before. Very quick, efficient and painless. Slightly hard to extract the gallbladder once it is removed, because the hole punched is quite small, but hey, amazingly, it came out.<br><br>Used to keep some pictures, but I don't have it now.<br><br>You can view more of these pictures by going to google and type in PathLab, then click on the first best search link.</div>

Felt like dying....<br>Can't sit up or walk without help. Keep on vomitting some green stuff. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>But about a day or two later, gets slightly better. Can walk and sit on my own, but still painful.</div>
