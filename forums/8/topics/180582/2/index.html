However, reality isn't always so perfect, if not never perfect. You'll to a certain degree throw in a few "accented" words into a singlish-american speech, no matter how you firmly believe you should use standard English.<br>Let's assume a hypothetical situation. You're learning Japanese. Would you prefer to speak Japanese the way Japanese do or would you speak it the Singjap style? Hm?</div>
