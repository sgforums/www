              <div><strong>A Famous Musician goes Busking in a Metro
              Station as a Social Experiment!..Interesting
              Read!!!</strong><br></div>
              <p>&lt;!--- blog body ---&gt;</p>
              <p><span>Washington, DC Metro Station on a cold January
              morning in 2007.<br> <br> The man with a violin played six Bach pieces for about 45 minutes.
              During that time approx. 2 thousand people went through the
              station, most of them on their way to work.<br> <br> After 3 minutes a middle aged man noticed there was a musician
              playing. He slowed his pace and stopped for a few seconds and then
              hurried to meet his schedule.<br> <br> 4 minutes later:<br> <br> The violinist received his first dollar: a woman threw the money in
              the hat and, without stopping, continued to walk.<br> <br> 6 minutes:<br> <br> A young man leaned against the wall to listen to him, then looked
              at his watch and started to walk again.<br> <br> 10 minutes:<br> <br> A 3-year old boy stopped but his mother tugged him along hurriedly.
              The kid stopped to look at the violinist again, but the mother
              pushed hard and the child continued to walk, turning his head all
              the time. This action was repeated by several other children. Every
              parent, without exception, forced their children to move on
              quickly.<br> <br> 45 minutes:<br> <br> The musician played continuously.  Only 6 people stopped and
              listened for a short while. About 20 gave money, but continued to
              walk at their normal pace.  The man collected a total of
              $32.<br> <br> 1 hour:<br> <br> He finished playing and silence took over. No one noticed. No one
              applauded, nor was there any recognition.<br> <br> <strong>Findings:<br></strong><br> No one knew this, but the violinist was Joshua Bell, one of the
              greatest musicians in the world. He played one of the most
              intricate pieces ever written, with a violin worth $3.5 million
              dollars. Two days before, Joshua Bell sold out a theater in Boston
              where the seats averaged $100.<br> <br> This is a true story. Joshua Bell playing incognito in the Metro
              Station was organized by the Washington Post as part of a social
              experiment about <strong>perception, taste, and people's
              priorities</strong> . The questions raised: <strong>"In a common
              place environment, at an inappropriate hour, do we perceive beauty?
              Do we stop to appreciate it? Do we recognize talent in an
              unexpected context?"<br></strong><br> One possible conclusion reached from this experiment could be this:
               If we do not have a moment to stop and listen to one of the
              best musicians in the world, playing some of the finest music ever
              written, with one of the most beautiful instruments ever made....
              How many other things are we missing?</span></p>

              <p>One wonders who is the talented ones?</p>
              <p>The busker or the passers-by.</p>
              <p>The busker at least has <em><strong>some</strong></em> talent. Maybe too little for comfort. but at least there is.</p>
              <p>The passers-by couldn't care less. Those that do, are little. Some contribute.</p>
              <p>Licence? The government wants to control everything, and I mean everything. Very soon we can only do what is permissible, and can't do anything that is not allowed or not mentioned.</p>
              <p>Just move and eat  your meat pao. Presently you don't need a licence for that, but be mindful of where you are when your eat your pao. You could get into trouble!</p>

              What's wrong with Singaporeans?
              
              Singaporeans complain that Singapore is so bland and boring. Then when there are buskers, acrobats here and there, they say ban them.....? Tampo tampo ban. KNS.
              
              Yes, lots of them can't sing or even plain irritating but can't we just let them do what they want?
