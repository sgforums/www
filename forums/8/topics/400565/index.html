              <p>I think you should get a life and be a little more benevolent about them. Some choose to busk, while others do not have a choice.<br><br>The fact that you feel that your mood is spoiled due to their poor performance shows that you have little patience and is a self centered freak who has no compassion for others. Had you ever dropped a coin for better performing ones then?</p>
              <p>Unless he is blocking your path and not allowing you to go till you drop a coin or so, there is nothing wrong with what they are doing.</p>

              <p>No sorry, but your definition of noise pollution is wrong. It is subjective as well. Some people do not consider this as noise pollution, some yes, some might not even care. Btw, they are there for a reason. That is to earn money. Nobody wants to sing to the air getting unpaid.</p>

              <div class="blogSubject"><strong>A Famous Musician goes Busking
               in a Metro Station as a Social Experiment!..Interesting Read!!!</strong> <br></div>
              <p></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Washington, DC Metro Station on a 
              cold January morning in 2007. <br><br>The man with a violin played six 
              Bach pieces for about 45 minutes. During that time approx. 2 thousand 
              people went through the station, most of them on their way to work. <br><br>After
               3 minutes a middle aged man noticed there was a musician playing. He 
              slowed his pace and stopped for a few seconds and then hurried to meet 
              his schedule. <br><br>4 minutes later: <br><br>The violinist received 
              his first dollar: a woman threw the money in the hat and, without 
              stopping, continued to walk. <br><br>6 minutes: <br><br>A young man 
              leaned against the wall to listen to him, then looked at his watch and 
              started to walk again. <br><br>10 minutes:<br><br>A 3-year old boy 
              stopped but his mother tugged him along hurriedly. The kid stopped to 
              look at the violinist again, but the mother pushed hard and the child 
              continued to walk, turning his head all the time. This action was 
              repeated by several other children. Every parent, without exception, 
              forced their children to move on quickly.<br><br>45 minutes:<br><br>The 
              musician played continuously. Â Only 6 people stopped and listened for a 
              short while. About 20 gave money, but continued to walk at their normal 
              pace. Â The man collected a total of $32.<br><br>1 hour:<br><br>He 
              finished playing and silence took over. No one noticed. No one 
              applauded, nor was there any recognition. <br><br><strong>Findings:<br></strong><br>No
               one knew this, but the violinist was Joshua Bell, one of the greatest 
              musicians in the world. He played one of the most intricate pieces ever 
              written, with a violin worth $3.5 million dollars. Two days before, 
              Joshua Bell sold out a theater in Boston where the seats averaged $100.<br><br>This
               is a true story. Joshua Bell playing incognito in the Metro Station was
               organized by the Washington Post as part of a social experiment about <strong>perception,
               taste, and people's priorities</strong> . The questions raised: <strong>"In a 
              common place environment, at an inappropriate hour, do we perceive 
              beauty? Do we stop to appreciate it? Do we recognize talent in an 
              unexpected context?"<br></strong><br>One possible conclusion reached from 
              this experiment could be this: Â If we do not have a moment to stop and 
              listen to one of the best musicians in the world, playing some of the 
              finest music ever written, with one of the most beautiful instruments 
              ever made.... How many other things are we missing?</span></p>

              <p>Wow....all are contra opinions......some are strongly criticizing me.....I didnt expect that...</p>
              <p>By the way, I specifically say about the underground tunnel....</p>
              <p>Because for that location, there is no way to avoid their "performance"</p>
              <p>different with open-air wide space location....</p>
              <p>When you encounter one in a long underground tunnel.....it is quite noticable and it will last for a longer time....</p>
              <p>I hope u understand....</p>
              <p>Other than this, how come some of u be so personal against me??</p>
              <p>By the way, this is an online chit-chat forum, and it is open for users to come and post new topics, as some of you who criticized me also did. In other words, I am using an infrastrucure as per how it is meant to be used. This is different with impromptu street buskers who suddenly plonk down with their musical instruments in the middle of pedestrian tunnel uninvited, yeah?</p>

              <p>You find it acceptable to shoot street buskers from behind on an online forum. They cannot reply to your backshooting.</p>
              <p>Yet you make noise when people shoot you in plain sight on the same forum. At least you can reply to that. So what's your beef?</p>
              <p>Oh, and that extra air pollution I said you caused by creating this thread? Its effects are far more lasting than that 'noise pollution' you heard. People with bronchitis, asthma and COPD must be cursing at the extra air pollution that you brought upon them.</p>
              <p>On top of that, you have helped to increase the acidity of rain over Singapore and helped to damage the plants and buildings. Something for you to think about.</p>
