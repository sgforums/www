This will serve a small warning<br>to ppl. It is really a difficult job to moderate a forum, it is not as simple as one thinks. If you closed too many thread, ppl might leave. If you dun, ppl will complain that Ah_Nic is not doing his job. Everyone played a part in a forum like you say, it is not your own world, but at the same time, it is yours to make it your own.<br><br>Look at each of the postings, from different postings, you will get some idea what a user is behaving, his virtual character. Some like to make ppl feels he is bad, some wants ppl to feel he is funny, others wan to have different virtual life.<br><br>Religion are sensitive, so is sex, prono. Diferent ppl have different likings. some may like it, some may not. If you really think that religion is not your cup of tea, then skip it, go for your sex/porno/crap postings. You can't change ppl postings just becuase you dun like it. jus as i dun like craps, sex, i dun complain, i will jus skip it.<br><br>There are 6 billions humans on earth, if ppl were to think about if my postings will affect who, then i guess it is better for the person to stay at home. A forum is a place to share views, be it sensitive or insensitive. It is a place where minds can interact in cyberspace minus the sound, sight. If you dun like someone, said it if you wan, if you like, said it too.<br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.<br><br>[This message has been edited by obiwan (edited 29 January 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As people have mentioned above, religion is a sensitive issues. That I would have to agree. Nonetheless, issues can still be raised based on this topic, be it anyone who put posts across the forum, treat it with respect and not make jokes out of it. Discussion can still be put across with due respect.<br><br>Forums are meant to express your ideals and opinons, no doubt about it. But such opinons of yours with no respect for the religious are best kept to yourselves.<br><br>Discontentment with the forum, choose to leave it and go? That is not the way things could be change. You can evade, but the problem is still there. Maybe it is a small matter, just a forum page, but everything starts from small, if things are not going in the right direction, things will never be right eventually.<br><br>Resistance to change will be the key issue, opinons of such should be heard out. Voicing it out does not necessary mean things will be the way you wanted, but if you never do it, you will never be able to know that changes can be made.<br><br>Put it across with tactfully and matters can be solved. Society and upbringing may have played a major role in scrupturing you to what you are now. But if the roots are wrong in the beginning, you will probably be thinking you were right all along! Never blame it on that.<br><br>Please understand I do not have the intentions of demeaning any individual.<br><br>Have a good day.<br><br>T.L</div>
