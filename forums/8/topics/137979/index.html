            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Chupacabra Carcass Discovered in Nicaragua</strong><br><br>Nicaragua-  Jorge Talavera, owner of the San Lorenzo Farm near Malpaisillo, took matters into his own hands after an average of 5 sheep a day were being salughtered on his farm by what is believed to be a Chupacabra or "Goatsucker".<br><br>Talavera inflicted a fatal wound upon the monster with his shotgun.  The Chupacabra was discovered some time later, when vultures were noticed circling overhead 80 meters away from where the creature was shot.<br><br>According to reports, the Chupacabra kills its victims by attacking their necks with its huge fangs, then draining the blood.<br><br><img src="http://www.geocities.com/hyperdigm/chupabody.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.geocities.com/hyperdigm/chupaop2.gif"><br><img src="http://www.geocities.com/hyperdigm/talavera.jpg"><br><br><strong>Chupacabra</strong><br><br>The chupacabra ("goat sucker") is an animal said to be unknown to science and systemically killing animals in places like Puerto Rico and Mexico. The creature's name originated with the discovery of some dead goats in Puerto Rico with puncture wounds in their necks and their blood allegedly drained. According to UFO Magazine (March/April 1996) there have been more than 2,000 reported cases of animal mutilations in Puerto Rico in the last two years attributed to the chupacabra.<br><br>Puerto Rican authorities maintain that the deaths are due to attacks from groups of stray dogs or other exotic animals, such as the panther, illegally introduced in the island's territory. The director of Puerto Rico's Department of Agriculture Veterinary Services Division, Hector Garcia, has stated that there is nothing unusual or extraordinary about the cases they've observed. One veterinarian said "it could be a human being who belongs to a religious sect, even another animal. It could also be someone who wants to make fun out of the Puerto Rican people."<br><br>Like other creatures in the cryptozoologist's barnyard, the chupacabra has been variously described. Some witnesses have seen a small half-alien, half-dinosaur tailless vampire with quills running down its back; others have seen a panther like creature with a long snake-like tongue; still others have seen a hopping animal that leaves a trail of sulfuric stench. Some think it may be a type of dinosaur heretofore unknown. Some are convinced that the wounds on animals whose deaths have been attributed to the chupacabra indicate an alien presence. However, they do not attribute the "mutilations" to the aliens themselves, but to one of their pets or experiments gone awry. Such creatures are known as Anomalous Biological Entities [ABEs] in UFO circles.<br><br>Those who think the chupacabra is an ABE also believe that there is a massive government and mass media conspiracy to keep the truth hidden from the people, probably to prevent panic. This view is maintained despite the fact that the President of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives Agricultural Commission, Mr. Juan E.[Kike] Lopez, has introduced a resolution asking for an official investigation to clarify the situation. And Inside Edition sent a crew to Puerto Rico to investigate the ABE story. They allegedly ridiculed the Mayor of Canavanas, a witness to the chupacabra, and basically made fun of the whole idea.<br><br>Jorge Martin, a Puerto Rican journalist, reports that it has been brought to his attention that the U.S. and Puerto Rican governments have captured two of the creatures. Perhaps there will soon be a film on the ABE autopsy to rival the discredited alien autopsy film. Martin cautions us not to exclude other reasonable possibilities.<br><br>The ABEs can also be the product of highly sophisticated genetic manipulations by human agencies. A Chinese-Russian scientist by the name of Dr. Tsian Kanchen, has produced genetic manipulations which have created new species of electronically-crossed plant and animal organisms. Kanchen developed an electronic system whereby he can pick up the bioenergetic field of the DNA of living organisms and transfer it electronically to other living organisms. By these means he has created incredible new breeds of ducks/chickens, with physical characteristics of both species; goats/rabbits, and new breeds of plants such as corn/wheat, peanut/sunflower seeds and cucumber/watermelons. These are produced by linking the genetic data of different living organisms contained in their bioenergetic fields by means of ultra-high frequencies biological linking. If the Russians have created this technology, then without doubt the US and other powers have too. Therefore, it is quite possible that the "Chupacabras" or ABEs could have been developed by humans. [Martin]<br><br>Martin goes on to report that a chupacabra has been killed and blood tests have been done on the creature.<br><br>The genetic analysis so far has revealed that the blood is in no way compatible with human blood nor with any animal species known to science. The traces ratio of magnesium, phosphorous, calcium and potassium are incompatible with those of normal human blood, they are much too high. The albumen/glouline [RG ratio] was also incompatible. The ratios found do not allow the results of the analysis to be compatible with those of any known animal species.<br><br>At present, we can't place the sample with any earthly organism. Therefore it could well be the product of a highly sophisticated genetic manipulation, an organism alien to our own environment or perhaps extraterrestrial. [Martin]<br><br>On the other hand, the sightings may not be all that accurate, the "mutilations" not all that strange, and the evidence for these bodies, autopsies and blood tests remains little more than speculation.<br></div>
