            <div class='col-md body'>talk to school first, see what is their response. Normally they stand by the students as u pay school fees and if u really never do anything or try anything funny.<br><br>Last time, during my IA time burnt their prototype and company also LL as ask me to go and try to figure out how to go abt doing the prototype. No one to teach and ask. there do sai kang.<br><br>anyway, u think company so stupid as to hire IA without any strings attached?<br>the fact is that they had some benefits from the school if they take in IA students.<br><br>So in other words, u r the boss as u can inform ur school that the company F. up. next time they will reject their application. But for your case, already done the IA so LL.<br><br>anyway, most of the case is small company try to be funny.<br><br>maybe next time , u can try to attach to big company . as they always on the look out for talents thru IA . as got frds once attachment over, the company offer post to them. think no need to stress on after grad is it = to retrenment. hahahahaha</div>
