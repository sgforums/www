I have friends who gave up on them already.  A couple of them got so fed up even terminated their mobile and residential phone subscription with Singnet.   WE all are overcharged by Singnet.

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, u have to pay $65 for the wii bundle plan. Without the console, its abt $50.<br>This means that u are paying $15 for the Wii per month.  Multiply that by 24 and u get  $360. So in fact, u are just getting are marginally discounted Wii and nothing else. So pls make your decisions carefully.</div>

I recontract through phone as I served the web the message on web said to call to sign up/recontract.<br><br>Can you and friends/relatives guarantee that you are lucky to come across the miserably minority of service staff professional enough not to overcharge.

Then when I get my bill, it is hell.  They are good to talk people into signing up or recontracting thereafter you die your business when they overcharge you.   Now I still refuse to pay the overcharged bill.  Ridiculous, my subscription is $31/32 per month with one month free subscription. ON second month, they sent me a bill with amt more than $100.</div>
