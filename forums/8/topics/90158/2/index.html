It definitely isn't about self-consolation and self-contentment that my current bf is better.  Just stating facts. No need to stay single for a while to understand it. All you need is reflection and after time you will know for sure if your thoughts are straight. By the way this is a 5 year relationship I walked out off and he was like my childhood friend.<br><br>The main reason why that relationship broke down was because he was not willing to make changes and he is always the one taking and IÂ’m always the one giving in. As well, I feel that he was taking me way too much for granted.<br><br>Whenever there is a problem, he doesnÂ’t try to fix it and hopes it goes away and when I try to talk about it he uses his temper and nothing gets fixed.<br><br>As well, would you ask your gf out and forget all about it and sleep past the clock and let her wait for you for over 2 hrs? It didnÂ’t happen once, it didnÂ’t happen twice. It happened so many times that I lost count.<br><br>He doesnÂ’t even treat my stuff with respect. Anything I lend him will come back in a less than desirable condition and I got sick of his emotional blackmail and him putting me down all the time.<br><br>I tried breaking up with him lots but he will come back begging and crying and my heart will soften. Breaking up with him was easy and yet tough. I didnÂ’t love him anymore for one so that makes it easy. I was with him out of habit now when I reflect upon it. Tough because he will start stalking me and turn up at really weird hours of the day and calls up like 2 am in the morning.<br><br>I wasnÂ’t looking for another bf when my current bf turned up. I was touched by his sincerity and his concern for me. His gentleness and his understanding. I am not looking for any goodies. When I said that he is better in every way, IÂ’m talking about the personÂ’s personality and character and not about anything else.<br></div>
