If she don't, of course people are just going to assume that everything's alrite, and go do what they want. I know, the gf maybe want her bf to be happy, so keep quiet and never say anything, but if that's the case, then its just too bad.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It all boil down to compromise. It allright to go do your stuffs and enjoy yourself while your spouse wait there for you, but just don't do over the limit la. When u sense that you had taken too much time and that your spouse is showing sign of bored or tired, then it time to stop the thing and pay attention to her...<br><br>it just like your gf wanted to go shopping and you company her even though you may find it bored, or you went playing snooker with your friend, while your gf just sit at one corridor watching your play..<br></div>
