Next, what makes them think that I owe two years of my life to SAF just because i was born here, in the f***ed up trash country? Most people wouldn't do their NS seriously, as they are not doing it willingly. The men in the Army were painstakingly raised by their parents from birth till they were 18 years old. But what happens here in stupid SG? Get sent to "NS" to serve this country shit and in the end get mistreated as if NSmen were dogs. Can u imagine the pain of the parents if their child had been killed or injured due to mistreatment? And whats more, they were forced into doing NS, so they deserve better treatment. If I had a chance, i wouldn't be staying in this damned place.</div>
