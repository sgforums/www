            <div class='col-md body'>One of my friends was lucky, several years ago, his MO wanted to upgrade him and send him for re-course BMT, despite him having suffered from a spinal injury previously(injure one more time become cripple liao). Fearing for his life, he bypassed his chain of command(haha!!) and spoke to his MP. Luckily for him the MP in question was a woman so got some maternal instinct lah, wrote letter to his CO and MO, both of them were damned frightened and pissed off and threaten to charge him but cannot do anything since MP is involved liao. So he finally managed to avoid the upgrading and is alive and well today.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  He might not have gotten any sympathy if his MP was a man, or god forbid, one of the ministers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>I've had my own bad encounters with MOs, can you believe I've held 4 different PES status during my 2.5 years?
