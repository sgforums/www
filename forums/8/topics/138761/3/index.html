There is really no concrete basis to suggest that the doctor involved did not know his medicine. Contrary to what would apparently be a widely held Singaporean belief, medicine is not black and white; the 'shaken baby syndrome' cases is just one example where medical opinion is split. Doctors have to make judgements to the best of their ability, based on the information available to them at the time, and those judgement calls may not always be correct. It is said that hindsight is always 20/20. Unfortunately, Doctors do not have the ability to predict the future. To punish them for honest mistakes would be unjust, unfair and detrimental to healthcare in Singapore.<br><br>Also, i think that our doctors are largely speaking NOT slacking "after getting their papers".  Quoted below is an excerpt from a study conducted on the sleeping patterns of Singapore doctors:<br><br><blockquote><br>Sleeping habits of new housemen<br><br>Since beginning work, the house officers reported that<br>they were sleeping 1.0 h (Â± 2.0) on previous nights of call<br>and 6.0 h (Â± 1.0) on non-call nights. The difference between<br>the sleep obtained on call nights and non-call nights was<br>significant (p=0.00). Fourteen (36.8%) of the 38 housemen<br>reported not having had any sleep at all on previous calls.<br>Twenty seven (71.1%) of the 38 housemen felt they were<br>not getting enough sleep since they became housemen.<br><br>Assessment on the night of call<br><br>Thirty four of the 38 h officers managed to get sleep during<br>the night on call, while 4 had no sleep at all. For those who<br>managed to sleep, the total and uninterrupted sleep time<br>measured only 2.0 h (Â± 1.6) and 1.0 h (Â± 1.5), respectively.<br>The housemen who slept were interrupted out of sleep with<br>a median of 5.0 (Â± 5.0) times.<br><br>Night duty and mood<br><br>Thirty four of the 38 house officers studied found night<br>duty to adversely affect their mood. Of the 34 participants,<br>all felt more tired, 24 felt more ill tempered, 13 felt more<br>depressed and 14 disoriented, while 9 reported night duty<br>to have made them more anxious<br><br>(K.
