            <div class='col-md body'>This is quite possible, although no one can confirm it. If they really cut-off the water supply, very likely that S'pore will invade 50-80 KM into south Johore. Not only that allows S'pore to get hold of the vital water-supply areas, but also it will prevent their artilleries from hitting S'pore.<br><br>Since there are plans by M'sia to purchase the MLRS (Multiple-Launched Rocket System) which have an effective range of abt 90KM, then I guess S'pore will have to invade at least 100KM into Johore in the future (provided M'sia really possess the MLRS by then) if war really happens. No choice.<br><br>So, don't be surprise if one day S'pore really has to invade Johore if M'sia try something funny on us.<br><br>The advice is "Be prepared for anything that could happen to S'pore &amp; give your full-support when S'pore do anything in return. S'pore will WIN".<br><br>Tell all your friends about this, so there'll lesser "surprise" in the future.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nick34:</div><div class="quote_body">heard from a frenz of mine saying that there was a time malaysia was trying to shut down all water supply to singapore ... but malaysia only say this ... most active units in singapore was already on stand by ...<br><br>and also heard from him that our weapon are aiming at malaysia at that time and if malaysia really shut down our water supply ... we are going to invade malaysia before they invade us<br><br>dunno this is true anot anyone heard this b4 ???<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

If they really cut-off the water supply, very likely that S'pore will invade 50-80 KM into south Johore. Not only that allows S'pore to get hold of the vital water-supply areas, but also it will prevent their artilleries from hitting S'pore.<br><br>Since there are plans by M'sia to purchase the MLRS (Multiple-Launched Rocket System) which have an effective range of abt 90KM, then I guess S'pore will have to invade at least 100KM into Johore in the future (provided M'sia really possess the MLRS by then) if war really happens.

How do planes fly or ships resupplied? how do transportation work with vehicle radiators emptied? How do factories and commerce function when employees have no water to drink? what  about hygeine when there is no sanitary water in all toilet system? how do hospital feed the mounting number of dehydrated patients? could the poor sanitary and hygiene problems create widespread diseases like cholera and dysentry?<br><br>so we will perish unless we fight. the m'sians know this and thus they wun cut so easily wan lah. then u never know so better to be prepared.<br><br>to all nsmen, if not for ns and our superior millitary, then it will be an easier decision for them to cut water. maybe for a month and bring us to our knees to accept all their unreasonable demands. when that happens, we are like the palestinians, second class citizen in our own country. worse, they may even invade us and destroy our infrastructure to ensure that we will never recover again. then they can pull back and watch us wilt away without even occupying our land as we have nothing for them except excellent infrastructure for our survival.  this  proved the theory of " To have peace, one must be ready for war."   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> DuH<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by blurblop (edited 30 March 2002).]</div>

For there is not enough buffer for us to absorb the attack. The only way is to attack them first, but we do not have enough manpower to back the forces to guard against the flanks and the back then. And also if we attack others first, we may incur the wrath of other muslim countries and we will be surrouded.<br>So the morale of the story is:<br>Pray hard that war is not coming or you and me will be either dead or circumised.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hm...sometimes i jus wonder,why isn't singapore lucky enough to have water for its own consumption? the leaders were always troubled by the water issue with msia for dunno how long liao.To think that Msia is acting like a big bully,twisting us around their fingers with water supply.<br>Also,recent news stated that S'pore's Port is also being affected badly by msia's competition.will spore be able to sustain its growth? this will depends on diplomatic ties.....all the best!<br><br>PS:even though i find war a really exciting idea,it's very cruel.so dun complain abt having to enlist for NS for 3 years liao.</div>
