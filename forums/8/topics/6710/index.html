            <div class='col-md body'>Well, like the word suggests, accident. Accident is defined as something that happened not by will. Like we all say, accidents do happen...and when it happens we can only try our best to save the situation. In this case, the doctors have already tried their best but to no avail. God bless her and her mourning family.<br><br>------------------<br>The Prince Of Death...<br>______________<br>| |Ã” NiVleK Ã” | |</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fantasy Island is much safer now than when it first started. They had even closed down some slides due to the high injury rate. I got injured b4 also but guess it is just a matter of unluckiness. Anyway all things fun tend to have a higher risk factor involved. (Think bungee jumping)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Did anyone read about the little girl who got killed in New Delhi (I think) airport in the escalator? This happened a couple on months back I think. Some guy's bag strap got caught in the gap between the escalator steps and when he pulled, one whole step came off. In the ensuing panic, a young girl fell headfirst into the hole left by the missing step. She was gradually crushed and cut to pieces by the still moving escalator as her relative tried desperately to get her out. It supposedly took quite a while before she stopped thrashing and screaming - poor girl. This was a real sad tragedy.<br><br>The Sentosa incident is no less tragic. It's especially sad when young children are the victims.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, but I think some accident can still be prevented, if cautions are taken seriously. Well, what can I say, the girl is just at the wrong place at the wrong time.<br>Feel sorry for her family, having to lose her when she's still so young.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i think we have to evaluate the problem before concluding whether this accident is preventable or plain luck.<br><br>Actually I dun really know wat happened, the explanation on ST was so vague. (I read ST online hence no pictures)<br><br>Hope the authorities is looking into the design of the Double Trouble again. It was reported that the water pressure was too great to be overcome by the little ger. In terms of engineering, such fluid pressure can be reduced by many methods.<br><br></div>
