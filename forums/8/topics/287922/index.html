Alot of Asians there, sometimes maybe you'll think that theres too many.<br><br>Uni Campus is ok one lah. I neva been to the one in UNSW but generally its about a few rooms in 1 village apartment then you'll get a room and toilet. Everything else share lor. Very easy to make friends one.

(1) College (aka hostels) which does cleaning of your room and offer meals, but they are really expensive (2) self-catered apartments. These are apartments that the uni manages. They come in 3 to 5 rm per apartment depending which one u choose baker or mulwarre apartments. Check the accommodation website for more details www.housing.unsw.edu.au.<br><br>I agree that sydney is very cosmo. If you go down to the city, there are so many asians. In UNSW, it is super populated with asians...</div>

Basically, they are of a minority. If push really comes to shove, so to say, just grab hold of the mother-fcuker and let him taste some asian knuckles. These fcukers are basically cowards. They always have a warped idea of all asians, especially Chinese. They think we know some kungfu and just show them some faked kungfu stance in such situations and they'll run off.<br><br>Just remember, be confident and enjoy your stay in Oz.</div>

Except last line.<br><br>Does going through OCS make ppl invincible? Fake kungfu stance? Bruudder switch off the TV pls.<br><br>Advice to TS is to use common sense and judgment if you encounter racist situations. It does happen, rare in Sydney but it does.<br><br>Other than that, enjoy the UNSW campus ... fantastic uni,  suburbs surrounding the campus Kensington, Randwick, and Kingsford have amazing makan places.<br><br></div>
