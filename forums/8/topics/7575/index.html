            <div class='col-md body'>i used to have an upstairs neighbour who is a weekend carpenter, they used to drill holes on walls or hammer on cupboards only on weekends, er, for the past 20 over years i have been staying here and when i say weekends, i meant every weekend for the past 20 plus years  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">. we have never complained to them directly but only among our own family members as the owner is a kampong friend of my parents, after so many years, we even learnt to joke about it. finally they moved out a couple of months ago and we thought we would have peace, but alas, a terror more horrifying than them came along. not only did we have to put up with six weeks of renovation which saw damages done to our sewage and drainage pipes which their contractor rectified (er, how would you like shit landing all over your soap, shampoo, conditioner, somehow, that brings new meaning eh? luckily for me, my parents got rid of the mess before i came home), now we have to put up with knocking, scratching noises daily and nightly.<br><br>and whoever lives directly above my room is a blooming monster, he/she does not walk, it stomps! it was 11.00 pm now and they were playing their radio at full blast that i can hear the song of Diamond Dust in my air-con room, can you imagine how loud that is now? i went upstairs to take a look but they are having a housewarming, so i just went home again. and 2 nights ago at 3 am in the morning, it threw something onto the ground with such might that it created a loud thud that i was shocked out of my sleep, you can imagine my fright and anger. the problem is how do i handle it, any advice?<br><br>iÂ’ve been thinking, iÂ’m a night bird as i sleep really late and sometimes when a good song comes on the radio, i do turn up the radio a little but not too loud, i do not think that they can hear it but i could be wrong, could it be that i annoyed them first? i was thinking of going up tomorrow and apologize to the owners that if i offended them with the volume of my radio (i usually set it around 15 and up it to 20 if i like the song, my volume dial can go up to 50), i would keep it down in future but request at the same time that whoever has been stomping around stop doing so because if he/she doesnÂ’t, the only way for me to drown out the irritation is to turn up the volume loudly but that would be inconsiderate to my neighbours on the same floor as me. my dad is selectively deaf, my mom and brother can sleep through anything.<br><br>would really appreciate any constructive advice from anyone out there. thank you.<br><br>the monster has been stomping around since 11 pm, man, it looks like a long night and year for me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

If they don't quieten down today, you think they will quieten down a week later? You will have to perform no.2 very soon. Either you go up now, ding-a-dong and request for their volumes to be down a little, or if u r nice, go get some pastries or fruits, go pay them a housevisit tommorrow in the capacity of a neighbour, then mention to them nicely that their volumes are a tat bit too high and since the walls are thin, neighbours might complain...... hmm...things like that, hehehe...... if it doesn't work, I think of something else.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

Pity your doors, if I were you I would go upstairs and slam their doors. Anyway, this is not about being nice or not, as a neighbour, you have some moral obligations to fulfil, and I believe under the law, u shouldn't be making too much noise after 10, I think......correct me if I'm wrong, so it is definitely alright for u to go and say something to them.....<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Colette:<br><br>My deepest condolences...oops....*laffs* Well, I have my fair share of bad neighbours, trust me, really bad neighbours. My neighbour upstairs, is a madhouse, and I meant literally, The four elders as my family call them endearingly has been in and out of woodbridge since as long as I can remember. And when the whole family is back home, I get no peace, yes peace is such a bliss then,imagine people, pounding their heads on the floor and wailing out loud in the middle of the serene night. It is errie. Even people who lives opposite my block can hear them clearly....I think they have this need for fresh air when they wail, thus the need to wail just at the windows, thus can you imagine the truma of living past it for the past 20 years? Can the things they wail about, is so sickeningly funny, 4 old people, 1 man and 3 woman arguing about who should wear whose underwear, and I ain't kidding, and sometimes about who should have the right to the TV, and there are even sometimes quarrels about one of the woman in the house having an affair with some married man, and the frequency they do this is something like every 2-3 days. And my, they go on and on and on like the energiser bunny, they dun sleep, they just need to quarrel. And you think they are alright in the morning, I do the laundry sometimes, and every this sometimes, I will see all sorts of interesting catch in the laundry I hang out to dry, I can find soil, paper, cigerette butts, curry, milk, and sometimes a chicken wing or 2. And I did say I do it sometimes. And these homely people, like to cook their own chilli and stuff, well I have no qualms about that, for I do such every now and then too, but they always so very enthusiaitic about it, that they have to get up at 6 a.m. to pound chilli. Of course they also have a peculiar habit of collecting cat and dog droppings for fertilizer for their plants outside their house, again I dun mind for I dun live on the same floor, and dun have to endure the smell, but they dun like to keep the excess, so they will leave it where it is convinient, at the staircase landing outside my house, imagine the privileage of having the aroma of a bag of shit when you step out of your house, such a wake up call in the morning.<br><br>Well, I told myself I have enough of this shit and all, so I came up with the perfect solution, I dun have to talk reason with mad people, I dun have to endure such nonesense, all I need to do is to move. Yes, and moving I am, to a new place, hopefully more sane, hopefully less aromatic. Wish me luck, I will be moving by mid July, and I am seeing light in my passage finally after 20 years of darkness, I hope you find yours soon...Why not we get married? Then you can move in with me, and leave all that chaos behind. This is what I call, "Take my hand and I shall lead you to heaven." *laffs* So dearie...will you marry me?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
