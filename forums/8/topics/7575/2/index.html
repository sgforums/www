I have these answers for you.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">1. the wife is always right, especially during PMS</span><br><br>I have check up with those 'q'ing at the Registry of Marriages, and yes, all there agree that their personal experiences acertain that to be a fact. So there is no reason for me not to disagree with a fact, and yes, strawberry cake, regradless of anything you will always be right, PMS or no PMS.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">2. you must know how to cook as i cannot cook, and when i learn to cook, not nice also must eat okay, no need to lie and say nice but just eat.</span><br><br>Cooking? You are talking to a first class home chef here, I have just added a few specialities to my list and I am reserving them for our first breakfast in bed, our first lunch in our new house, and of course our first romantic candlelight dinner on the Balcony. And even though you dun have to cook, I would gladly teach you if you let me, and I would eat anything from your wok and saucepan, I have always found it a heavenly bliss to eat what my beloved serve me. Be it gourmet buffet or poison, I iwll take it all. No comments but only compliments for all that I will be tasting would be love, and love from you is always sweet and nice.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">3. i may flirt but you must change your buaya ways</span><br><br>Did I tell you that I take pleasure in watching my partner flirt with other man? It is always good to knowthat my wife would still have what it takes to attract man, and with me first in line on her list, I dun think I have any qualms about that. As for me buayaing, you can rest assure that I would either be too busy cooking and washing while I romance you, to buaya anyone else but you. This I promise.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">4. housework - to be shared equally. hmm, could we split this in direct proportion to height, weight and size? iÂ’m only 1.52 m and currently weighs only 45 kg</span><br><br>I find this arrangement only fair, for I would most probably be the one who eats more, who takes up more space and thus gather more dust. And I would prefer it that you save your silky creamy hands just for my holding alone, dun touch that soap, or detergent, such things are for the man to handle! So I propose that you just use those hands of yours for my holding and to give me the occasional massage as a reward for me when I display exceptional obedience and affection. I hope you agree with this arrangement.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">5. my money (&amp; debts) are mine;  your money is also mine but your debts remain yours</span><br><br>Hmmm...I dun really agree with this clause though.....your debts should also be mine if you cannot handle them, can we change it to this? I am fine with the rest of the arrangment in this clause. But you only mention about money.....what about my shares, stocks, porperties and insurance benificiaries? They should go to you, your parents and your neighbours too, since i figured that our union  would not be possible if your neighbours did not create such a senario, and of course I would love to give your parents a house too, so that they will benefit from the peace and quiet they have.....and I dun know about them living with us, I meant I intend to get a private resort house on a Island, for we might be so ranchy as a couple that our neighbours will not be able to take our behaviour, much less your parents.<br><br>As for age difference, I have always love woman who are mature, and it has never occur to me that you are old, just that you the charms of a mature woman oozes from your every cell...dun waste them and let them drip to the ground, let them flow in me, and may I be revitalised by such energy.<br><br>What do you think my Peppermint Icing? Would you let me lick your icing off you every morning when we wake?</div>
