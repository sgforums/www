              <p>I'm 16, and i have a maid who is rude, and brainless. Though some maids are good and have their bad points, this maid of mine really gets on my nerves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, when my parents just talk about something unpleasent which regards her even if she did something wrong, she would give the " Cant be bothered " look and keep herself busy like doing chores while my parents talk to her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, She breaks a lot of stuff, est. about 20 items from the start of the year till now. Usually when maids break stuff, the employer would demand her to pay for it, but my parents didnt even ask her, and yet she gives that asshole attitude as if she did nothing wrong. The worst part is she did something wrong and push the blame to someoone else like my elderly grandma despite us knowing she was the culprit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thirdly, When she breaks stuff she would conceal it by hiding it and throwing it away quickly. And when people question her about it, she would say " I don't know, I never see ".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All that i can say is that she should be lucky to have an employer like my parents.</p>

              <p>I understand how you feel, cos I'm in the same situation as you. Mine understands the English language, yet when we speak to her, she pretends as though she couldn't understand a single shit. It just makes the whole situation so frustrating and job can't be done as instructions can't be conveyed out or rather, when she doesn't want to listen. Mine is someone with a degree fyi.</p>
              <p>And let's not talk about those employers who abuses their maid, leave that to another thread if you want to argue from that point. There are 2 sides to it, I believe if you employ a maid, treat them with respect, and they in turn, should also do their job properly. Right now, we are talking about us treating them properly but they, not doing their job! </p>

              <p>For those who complaint about their Maid.....this is what I have
              to recomend.....</p>
              <p><strong>How about U being the Maid for 1 day....and the Maid
              order you around and after 1 day you can tell us why your Maid is
              Rude and brainless.</strong></p>
              <p>For those who stayed in apartment/Flat U don't need a Maid. do
              your own housework don't be lazy. Save that money.</p>

              <p>I wonder would you still say the same should this situation be in a business organisation. The CEO takes over as an office boy and see if he is still as brainless or not. </p>
              <p>There are the good maids and those black sheep too, what we are pin pointing out here are some of the traits that certain maids display when they are not up to their mark when doing a job.</p>
              <p>A job is afterall a job, if they had chosen to apply for it whether in forced circumstances or not, they ought to carry out their role and responsibilites. </p>
