(i.e. I'm damn fuzzy, very critical, have all the necessary equipment, language power and TIME to deal with them).. heheh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>My last episode with my sis' furniture transport overcharging, I complain so much (all the way to the CEO) the senior manager had to call me up and settle the matter according to my terms.<br><br>I bought air tixs and they said they would send to me viz courier the next day. When that didn't happen and I couldn't get to the sales person through their phones (even tho I left msg early with their other colleague for her to return my call), I wrote 'da zi pao' and spam them via fax multiple times. (I fax to different fax machines all over in the office.)  It took them less than 5 min after I spam to return my phone call and I got my tixs very fast.<br><br>I would advice to get a fax machine to replace your phone set. It makes you a formidable fuzzy customer when you have another equipment to do spamming when you get poor customer service and can also auto speed dial and comes with speaker phone. hehe... Anyway, it's the company that waste paper, not you.<br><br>Other tactics.. e-mail spams and phone call spams... interrupt their time with all these and they have to settle your case swiftly so as not to slow down productivity.<br></div></blockquote>email spams is not advisable.... there is a case in sg back in 2000 where a man kanna fined 17.4k for spamming HDB server just to get their attention on his application to buy a flat.<br></div>
