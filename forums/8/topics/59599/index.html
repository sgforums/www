Recently i wanted to pay my bills thru the SAM machine but i forgot my a/c no. so i called the customer service operator and i asked for my a/c no. Guess wat, they gave me a WRONG a/c no. and i ended up paying for someone else's a/c. When i went home and checked i realised the mistake and asked starhub to help rectufy the mistake and transfer the funds back to my a/c instead. They told me they wouls take a few days to process. After about a week, i called them and they said they still processing it and they told me that i need to fill up a form and fax it over to them. I did just that and i waited for their response. 2 weeks later i called again asking if they had already transferred the money back to me and they said its still in the process and they added that i have not paid them for the month of september and i told them this thing happened because of yr mistake and u said u needed only 3 days now its been a month and its still not rectified, what are u ppl doing? Then they asked me to fax over my i/c no. and i form again. I told them i already did the last time so dun expect me to waste my time doing it again. Its been 2 months already and i have not received noticfication of the transfer of funds. Ever since that incident i have a very bad impression of Starhub. Their customer services suck to the core and i think their officers need proper training in language and communication skills. Never have i came by such rude, irresponsible and inefficient people. I am so appalled by their customer service officers. Disgusting.</span></div>

Recently i wanted to pay my bills thru the SAM machine but i forgot my a/c no. so i called the customer service operator and i asked for my a/c no. Guess wat, they gave me a WRONG a/c no. and i ended up paying for someone else's a/c. When i went home and checked i realised the mistake and asked starhub to help rectufy the mistake and transfer the funds back to my a/c instead. They told me they wouls take a few days to process. After about a week, i called them and they said they still processing it and they told me that i need to fill up a form and fax it over to them. I did just that and i waited for their response. 2 weeks later i called again asking if they had already transferred the money back to me and they said its still in the process and they added that i have not paid them for the month of september and i told them this thing happened because of yr mistake and u said u needed only 3 days now its been a month and its still not rectified, what are u ppl doing? Then they asked me to fax over my i/c no. and i form again. I told them i already did the last time so dun expect me to waste my time doing it again. Its been 2 months already and i have not received noticfication of the transfer of funds. Ever since that incident i have a very bad impression of Starhub. Their customer services suck to the core and i think their officers need proper training in language and communication skills. Never have i came by such rude, irresponsible and inefficient people. I am so appalled by their customer service officers. Disgusting.</span></div></blockquote>Yeah i agree with u.. Starhub service sux.. I suspect thay did not have proper training b4 hand as customer service officers.. They can't handle customer's difficult situation..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm one of those customers that any shop or store or company would be very scared of. (i.e. I'm damn fuzzy, very critical, have all the necessary equipment, language power and TIME to deal with them).. heheh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>My last episode with my sis' furniture transport overcharging, I complain so much (all the way to the CEO) the senior manager had to call me up and settle the matter according to my terms.<br><br>I bought air tixs and they said they would send to me viz courier the next day. When that didn't happen and I couldn't get to the sales person through their phones (even tho I left msg early with their other colleague for her to return my call), I wrote 'da zi pao' and spam them via fax multiple times. (I fax to different fax machines all over in the office.)  It took them less than 5 min after I spam to return my phone call and I got my tixs very fast.<br><br>I would advice to get a fax machine to replace your phone set. It makes you a formidable fuzzy customer when you have another equipment to do spamming when you get poor customer service and can also auto speed dial and comes with speaker phone. hehe... Anyway, it's the company that waste paper, not you.<br><br>Other tactics.. e-mail spams and phone call spams... interrupt their time with all these and they have to settle your case swiftly so as not to slow down productivity.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from a customer point of view... i think this is the "right way" of doing it la... but maybe sometime have to put into their shoes, these ppl, esp the phone operators, is what the company hired with just a low salary.. and they wan them to do wonders...<br><br>still, some telephone operator very impolite, and this is very disappointing, esp those big company and u are paying big money for their products... of cos their CS must be up to standard...<br>maybe u try to be nice to them first lor (cos i might be one of them working parttime as a telephone op.. lol), if they still like ying ying ching ching, whack them with your Hua-Shan-"Fax"-Fa...<br>lol</div>
