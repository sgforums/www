            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all! Woohoo...looks like this gonna be tha 3000th topic liao. Good.<br>Haizz...the good and bad of internet...the bad of irc, the good of irc...tangles up my heart so much so that i cannot even think of what to do, how to carry on, what may become tommorrow, the day after....<br><br>To all the guys and gals having some kind of irc romance...dun take things too seriously. Like for me...i had taken things too seriously..had thought things would work out find, had thought of beautiful imageries when i touched down in singapore 4 days ago, had wanted so badly to relish being with her, the girl whom i had spend so much time with whilst in london and chatting online, chatting on the phone...<br>What happened? I realised i was too selfish. none of this would haf worked out at all... none of this would ever will, just for the simple fact that we are not what we are online. and the feelings we have might not be the feelings that will be, tommorrow , the day after. And also, for me, the simple fact that i cannot be with her every day of the year, just because i haf to go bach to london to pursue my education. Just because i do not want to hurt her. Just because, it'll be better to just stay off and pretend that those sweet memories in the past...those memories, those everlasting memories....is all unfounded. All but gone and nothing but the last thin wisp of air signaling nothingness.<br>Had been so stupid to be so involved in this. My heart is waging a battle with my mind and heart. the mind of logic, the heart of love....but both not wanting to hurt her...what shall i do? how shalt i regret? I dunno...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Understand how you feel. Personally, I would never try to go into an internet relationship, for one, I don't believe that such things exist. For the simple matter, I don't believe that a romance would be able to blossom just by chit chatting and exchanging of pictures and talking over the phone. I might be very old fashioned, but I believe that there should be some form of interaction and everything for that relationship to build before it ends up as something concrete. That is my point of view.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also don't believe in long distance relationship, mainly because one failed for me, and I will definitely not attempt one yet again. I am not discounting the fact that long distance relationships might work. Some long distance relationships do work, and it is usually very beautiful if it does, for such relationships will only work through lots of effort of the part of both parties. That is why when some ask why I am not attached, that would be the main consideration. Half the time I am here, half the time I am there. Simply impossible for me.  But don't take my example for reference, remember, with hard work and undying enthusiasm, the long distance relationship might still work.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regards to the first post I posted, it is just my personal opinion, don't take my word for it. Some of my friends do have relationships from the net, and they are quite successful, at least til now.
