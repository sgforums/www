            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by denimfanatic:<br><strong>There were alot of great movies in the the 1990's. Its not that easy to make a great movie anyway, but there are a couple since 2000, [b]LOTR</strong>,<strong>Pianist</strong>, <strong>eternal sunshine</strong>,<strong>Amelie</strong>, <strong>requiem for a dream</strong> is fantastic. <strong>Donnie darko</strong>, <strong>Crash</strong> from last year,<strong>big fish</strong>, <strong>City of god</strong>, I dont really think its been declining, you just gotta know what to watch. But yeah theres alot more crap nowadays.[/b]</blockquote>The 90s shows were generally more violent, more stunts and explosion and interesting characters.More beautiful women. The best part is the violence and stunts were really done using real-scale props, more down to earth methods with actors diving or hanging on cliffs keeping the audience on the edge of their seats . They do this by showing progressive shots of the scenes..one moment the actor solves an obstacle only to be outdone by another bigger problem accompanied by dramatic music and the appropriate cinematography<br><br>The Island , a 2000s show had stunts using CG ..leaves a bad taste because they dont even look real like before , most of the time 2 couples running from baddie or some micro robots looking for them does not have any scope for stunts creativity..The CG part in movies nowadays are seem to get worse .. no creativity at all ..A select few directors like Spielberg had done new things wif the holographic effects in Minority Report deserves special mention..Again only some can do new things.<br><br>I particularly do not like the colour and lighting schemes in the movies nowadays, they are not using "natural light" like before. They are artificially enhanced using methods like silver grading , Colour blur and a variety of new enhancing techniques in post production. Called digital cinematography  , it gives the look of the Sky captain and the world of tommorrow.Although these techniques should be reserved for  old movies being remastered , it is fine Natural lighting takes much planning and effort to get it right whereas digital cinematograpahy is a lazy filmaker's paradise. Their excessive use damages the look of the film itself. the lighting in dfferent parts of the scene will not overlap to create  a natural look but will rather be more location specific<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes Marco Simone, it is a great movie. By the way, you are quite an appreciator.<br><br>What exactly was the 1994 movie, the 'other one' that you were talking about?<br><br>For me, Tom Hanks played even better in Cast Away, where he became so skinny and slowly changed into another person mentally also. It takes a lot of effort.<br><br>Similar with Adrien Brody, in The Pianist, where he also became very skinny and delusional.<br><br>Another one is Al Pacino, in Scent of A Woman, where he played a blind man.<br><br>These are all movies where they focused on character very strongly. These actors are really great.<br><br>For great cinematography, I'd like to recommend this movie called 'Tears of A Black Tiger'. It's a year 2000 Thai movie with excellent colours, oldie style shots, oldie hairdo, and oldie scenario/ storytelling. It's made in 2000 but they purposely put an artsy movie. Great movie.<br><br>For meaningful movies, there is one I like called.....Chinese Oddyssey, which is full of philosophy.<br><br>Also, there is also another particular series of Monkey King (Sun Wu Kung), where in the ending final episode, the Monkey King love interest sacrificed herself and as a result morph into a flower. Her original form hundreds of years ago. Seeing this, the Monkey King turned himself into a stone also. They were stone and flower, hundreds of years ago, where the flower was near the stone.<br><br>It was very poetic and meaningful.<br><br>This might be abit off topic.</div>
