            <div class='col-md body'>Just watched it again after 12 years.Awesome.<br><br>As in the words of Forest Gumps all-knowing mother, "Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get". How true. Life is unpredictable. You never know what's coming, what will happen tomorrow, who you'll meet and what kind of influence that person will have on your life.<br><br>Forrest Gump is about a very simple, simple man. An by being as honest as one can be, and being nice to all, and just purely innocent, this man does extraordinary things. Life hands him all kinds of strange opportunities, some even HUGE events of the twenty first century. Some people say this is about an idiot becoming a rich man? No, it's about a GOOD man, a truly honest, hard-working, man-of-his-word guy, who becomes successful through the goodness and innocence of his ways. He cheats for nothing, and so life rewards him in great ways.<br><br>We first meet Forrest sitting on a bench, where he then begins to tell his story to the many who come to sit next to him. What a story it is. Forrest has been a football star, an army war hero of the Vietnam, a half-owner of a billion dollar fishing company, a ping-pong world champion, and a superstar celebrity runner. And he's managed two visits to the white house, and he once met Elvis Presley. He also influenced the creation of famous bumper stickers and t-shirts. Whew. It shows what can come to those who just live life truthfully. And all this while, Forrest pines for his one true love; his first ever friend: Jenny.<br><br>Forrest Gump is full of great things. The screenplay tells an extraordinary tale, and is full of memorable lines, simplistic enough to be understood, and subtle enough to be considered more.<br><br>As Forrest journeys to Vietnam's jungles, and runs across the U.S's many and varied landscapes, we see absolutely beautiful cinematography. All the backdrops are wonderful, especially the ones of Forest's long run.<br><br>The hilarious visual effects put Forrest into old video clips, and never for a second do they look like a hoax. Truly great job.<br><br>The acting couldn't be better. Gary Sinise is cynically perfect as LT. Dan, Forrest's commander from the Vietnam, who becomes one of Forrest's best friends. He's the second best of the show, really capturing the man's sardonic humor and anger. Sally Field's is great as Forrest's wise mother. She teaches him everything he needs to know, and plays the part excellently. Robin Wright Penn plays Jenny, the girl Forrest is obsessively in love with. She plays the role well, having good chemistry with Tom Hanks. She never yells at him, but doesn't exactly treat him right, she almost talks stupid to him, for most of the film (until the end...). And Tom Hanks truly IS Forrest Gump, in his greatest role, and one of the best performances I've ever seen. Every line is delivered with perfect simplicity. His accent: flawless. His tone, and attitude never waver. In some actor's hands, the role easily could have become stupid. But not in Tom Hank's. He plays Forrest real, not overly stupid-sounding or slow talking. Rather...he talks a lot.<br><br>Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future I,II,III) directs the timeless classic of how great life can be. His direction ranges from war, to sporting events, to quiet scenes, to running scenes, to scenes with thousands crowded around, to scenes of old videos, and then sea-faring scenes. Only a very well-rounded director could pull all this off with the smooth transitioning Robert does. Even with all these different elements in the film, Zemeckis goes from one to the other, with no problem, and no break in the flow. It's edited smoothly. He makes all the elements of a drama, comedy, love story, and a war story come together smoothly. He tells the story of one man's extraordinary life brilliantly.<br><br>Forrest Gump is the tale of one man's triumph by being honest. Maybe we should all try it sometime. 10/10<br><br>"Stupid is as stupid does"-Forrest Gump</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The shows being produced in the 2000s are just plain utter nonsense ;-<br>Bad comic book spinoffs, vampires, remakes of 80s horrors, laughable creatures ... hate the storytelling, bad special effects, shoddy camerawork, actors with no screen presence and rushed scenes .. the acting is even worse needless to say .. give me  a  2000s show which made it to the all time box ofice list - NONE ..the all time box office list  are all shows from the 90s<br><br>90s was good time for movies .. i do miss the high budgeted Jerry Bruckheimer shows, scary creature flicks and slow horror suspense.. some of the comic book spinoffs like Xmen and Batman were also better back then having big talented stars like Val Kilmer and even so Arnold as baddie</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There were alot of great movies in the the 1990's. Its not that easy to make a great movie anyway, but there are a couple since 2000, <strong>LOTR</strong>,<strong>Pianist</strong>, <strong>eternal sunshine</strong>,<strong>Amelie</strong>, <strong>requiem for a dream</strong> is fantastic. <strong>Donnie darko</strong>, <strong>Crash</strong> from last year,<strong>big fish</strong>, <strong>City of god</strong>, I dont really think its been declining, you just gotta know what to watch. But yeah theres alot more crap nowadays.</div>
