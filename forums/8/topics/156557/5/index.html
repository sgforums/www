            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I find the topic rather interesting. Thus, would like to comment on this. (plus, my gammer is not that good, may provoke some) ORD, almost 10 years from the Army.  Now I have completed my reservists. (8 years cycle - Cdo)<br><br>During my time, we have not choice, if you're selected you are.  You may count yourself lucky or rather unlucky.<br><br>During my first day reporting to the camp from CMPB, after collecting our basic 'barang barang' from GSMB.  While alighting from the 3 tonner still with civilian and neat hair cut.  One trainer told us something that 'I' will never forget in my whole life.  "You guys are here today.  From now onwards, you're no longer human, you are all dogs!" "understand, ALL DOGS!!!".  We thought this is a hell place man......Have not cut hair already call us DOGS liao.<br><br>BMT was rather tough as compared to SBMT. Physical and mental strenght was always pushed to the limit. Some guys cannot even do 1 chin up, they will have to carry their backpack with everything inside for the whole day, during eating, lessons, PT, punishment, run everything, everywhere. Unless sleeping.  Chin -up was counducted least 3 time if not 5 for whole day / meal. Push up was like between (last time loh) 100 lucky day - unlucky days 250-300.  Every one time is either 30 to 50. (Now times are different liao)<br><br>During NAFA test, while letting off their backpack, you will be surpised that this guys can acutally do up to 15-17 chin up!!!<br><br>Life being to change after you POP for BMT.  Next phase is BCT.  Your mindset will be very different as everyone objective is on the red-beret. BCT, endign with Vocation training (VT/CTW) and company march and para-PTW. all in all 11 months you get your beret with a wings on the chest. Dun forget your body changes at the same time. (nice body line and chest-set)<br><br>During that time, you are the best of the cream.  Every places you go like attending external talks or courses.  People look at you very different as you have a red-beret and wings.  Especially during your No 1 in NDP parades.<br><br>That is why Cdo is very proud of themselve. "For Honor and Glory".  We are hated by all infantry units simply because Cdo is self-equipped (except air support).  We took limlights in SAFSA Boxing, dragon boat and in sports..Not to mentioned Best Combat Unit.<br><br>When you start work, your staff and superiors look at you differently, as leadership and management skill, command and control is systematically build into you during your NSF days.<br><br>May suggest you to accept with an open mind, change your preception, you will learning to adapt....Where ever you're.<br><br>Ex-Cdo 2nd Coy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's put thaings into proper perspective.<br><br>In the Army, any vocation can kill you.<br><br>Drivers gets killed with truck overturn during overseas training or every on the road.<br><br>Guards can get killed while live descent during Heli-repa.<br><br>Cooks get burns. Worst can burning down teh cockhouse or someone get food poison problem, DB liao.<br><br>Clerks get easy detention.<br><br>Armour troopers crush to death or tank over turned. If you're tankee.<br><br>Arti - More dangerous during live firing.<br><br>Engineer - more injury during live exercise as some work is still by hands and feets.<br><br>Nothing is the best if you're not mentally ready.  SAF have taken all necessary precautionary actions to avoid accidents, but nevertheless, some do happened. Why, is either of careless of someone or oneself.</div>
