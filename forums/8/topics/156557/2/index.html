If u say 'yes i am very interested', then he will refer u as highly suitable for cdos... After the medical review the commando officers will bring u for physical evaluation where u are required to do pull ups, push ups,sit ups and standing broad jump with yr best effort...if u can perform mush better than everyone else u will be recognised one...like me! hehe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> They will also test yr physco motor skills( balancing yrself while eyes closed and with yr both feet tiptoe) flexibility,agility and endurance... Last but not least there will be a mini interview conducted, the interviewer will ask u about yr CCA records...yr level of maturity,possibility of signing on and lastly he will ask u if u are interested to join commandos(if u have indicated u are very interested to join cdos in the survey earlier , he might not ask u this question,in stead he will ask what kind of specialities of commandos u are interested in. ) Thats all bro...good luck for yr VA anyway do have breakfast man or else yr stomach will be rumbling...</div>

If u say 'yes i am very interested', then he will refer u as highly suitable for cdos... After the medical review the commando officers will bring u for physical evaluation where u are required to do pull ups, push ups,sit ups and standing broad jump with yr best effort...if u can perform mush better than everyone else u will be recognised one...like me! hehe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> They will also test yr physco motor skills( balancing yrself while eyes closed and with yr both feet tiptoe) flexibility,agility and endurance... Last but not least there will be a mini interview conducted, the interviewer will ask u about yr CCA records...yr level of maturity,possibility of signing on and lastly he will ask u if u are interested to join commandos(if u have indicated u are very interested to join cdos in the survey earlier , he might not ask u this question,in stead he will ask what kind of specialities of commandos u are interested in. ) Thats all bro...good luck for yr VA anyway do have breakfast man or else yr stomach will be rumbling...</div></blockquote>Any1 think i should join commando?Serious.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the commando officer told me that napfa is not a good way to judge yr physical ability because it might have dropped by the time u went for the VA...he also told me that the physical evaluation and physco motor test are important in deciding whether u r suitable for cdos because they dun want any commando trainees to suffer any injuries in the case where they can't take the trainings....anyway bro during the VA the officer told me my physical performance was among those best records...do u think i can get in?</div>
