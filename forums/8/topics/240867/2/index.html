My friend didn't tell me much and I saw that he's so troubled and I just wanna stay out of this, so I tried not to ask too much, even though I offered to do the explanation (to whatever she might ask me when confronting).<br><br>I only know that the wife who 90% of the time based overseas suddenly called back &amp; accused him (of what exactly I also dunno).  I think this happened end of last week bah?  I have been on leave, so I didn't get to see this friend &amp; wasn't aware of this.  But yesterday I went back to office so he told me.<br><br>I asked him exactly what the wife's msg.  He mumbled something, like dun wan to talk further about it.  So I didn't bother to ask him what his response to her.</div>
