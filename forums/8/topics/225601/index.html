The question is, what do you mean by fair?<br><br>Maybe let me give a few example. Like: The government is not fair when they increase GST by 2%, the government is not fair when utility bills are increasing, the government is not fair when the PAP is dominating etc.<br><br>I truly wonder if that is someone who would say something like: Is there someone who says that its unfair that the government give grants to startups, give you a good transport system, give you food and a roof, give you lower income tax and such.<br><br>What I want to prove here is not what the government is giving or taking but what do you mean by fair.<br><br>From what I've been noticing, we meant fair by "so long I get what I wants means fair and I don't care where you took it from" and "so long you take things away from me means unfair and I don't care where you give it to" concept.

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, I get a fair number of different opinions for different point of view. Especially with views from january and Nelstar.<br><br>I have a kind of thinking that I wonder what you guys think. If I were to say, everything in this world is fair and everything is made in balance. The thing that gives birth to the word fair and unfair is due to humans' greed.<br><br>Let me give some example to support my statement.<br><br>All energy is not created from no where and it doesn't disappear. It merely changes from potential energy into kinetic energy and things like this.<br><br>All births leads to deaths. Power leads to greed and Famous leads to jealousy.<br><br>Now these might prove that everything is made equal and balance. because all events leads to some changes be it in the form of though or physical.<br><br>The only thing is when human feel unfair is caused by their peronsal greed.<br><br>As they don't get what they want and they want to fight for what they want, they start to think of "fair" &amp; "unfair".<br><br>I think I'm thinking too much but initially I thought the word "fair" is such a "good" word but if think deeper, it actually derives from something "politically bad".<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
