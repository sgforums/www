            <div class='col-md body'><strong>What Is Fairness?</strong> - Cardinal<br>Let's suppose that person A and person B are sitting together in a room when an angel appears in a burst of light and says "Be not afraid! Here are 100 grapes for your enjoyment - divide them fairly between the two of you, and then consume them." Then the angel vanishes.<br><br>How should A and B divide the grapes? As it happens, person A likes grapes twice as much as person B does. (For the purists, assume that each of them has constant marginal utility and that these facts are commonly known.) The following dialogue ensues:<br><br>A: In order to divide them fairly, we should split the grapes evenly - 50 to you, 50 to me.<br><br>B: That's not a fair division: I like grapes half as much as you, so if we split 50-50, I only end up half as happy as you are. A truly fair division would make us equally happy. Therefore, I should get 66 grapes, and you should get 34.<br><br>A: That's ridiculous! It can't be fair to give fewer grapes to the person who likes them more. <span style="font-style: italic;">Our individual happiness is irrelevant - fairness means splitting the grapes evenly, nothing more.</span><br><br>B: How can our individual happiness be irrelevant? <span style="font-style: italic;"> The whole point of having the grapes is to makes ourselves happier. </span>It's the quantity of grapes that is irrelevant here - neither of us cares about how many grapes we get except through how much utility we will gain from eating them. Our happiness is the relevant concept to equalize here.<br><br>My take: B is right in that happiness is the relevant quantity, but this notion of fairness verges upon the absurd when one person has much lower utility for an item than the other. A is confused to think that fairness is in any way connected with efficiency. I think that fairness is a concept that is often devoid of a coherent meaning, even though people often feel very strongly about it. I'd advise avoiding the question "What is fair?" and instead considering practical questions like "What has been agreed?" and "What is practically achievable?"<br><br>Conclusion: The two fight for hours over the fair way to divide the grapes, finally deciding that the only allocation that was fair under both their definitions was for each of them to have no grapes. Or A divides, B chooses. That's fair.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br></div>
