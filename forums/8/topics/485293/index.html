              <p>Hi everyone, so I'm stuck in a pretty deep rut, I have a phone contract with Singtel, but a few months back I lost the phone in Indonesia and someone else used it and racked the bills up, when I came back I blocked the phone and I thought that was that, among things I also moved apartments and I completely forgot about bills, now they sent a letter that says I have to pay 2000 SGD in A WEEK if not they'll bring a lawsuit, can anyone advise me what to do??</p>
              <p>Of course I'm going to be responsible and pay back what I owe, but I am a student here and I cannot work parttime because Im an international student, so I can only rely on my monthly allowance which is not much to live on by itself. The due date is next Monday, I'm really in a huge mess right now, I don't have friends that can lend me that amount of money, and my parents won't stand for it either (they're having problems on their own).</p>
              <p>Can someone tell me if I can maybe negotiate with the collectors for the due date and if I can pay in installments, and what I should say when I call them tomorrow (I'm afraid if I put it off anymore they'll think I'm defaulting)? will they really come forward with the lawsuit? Have anyone experienced this kind of thing before? I'm really afraid that they'll intimidate me and I'll panic. I can only offer to pay in monthly installments, and not much at that. I heard Singapore don't have a Fair Debt Collection Act, so is it common for collectors to come roughing people up?</p>

              Hi there,
              
              Don't worry. You won't get charged in court for defaulting mobile phone bills. At least I haven't heard of that before. Everyday, there ARE MANY PEOPLE chalking up unpaid telco bills and receving lawyer letters. 
              
              In your case, what they will do:
              
              1) Keep calling your land line and mobile to chase for payment
              2) Suspend your service and if payment still not received after a certain period, terminate your service and add in "early termination fees" to your existing default payment. Everytime they send lawyer letter to you, it also adds into your existing default payment.
              
              What you can do:
              
              1) Try to call them and ask for monthly instalment (They will not agree most probably!)
              2) Just pay an amount of money every month, let's say $100.00 a month, until you clear the debts (provided line is already terminated or service suspended, which I believe should be the case).
              
              As long as they see some money coming in every month at a certain time, they will not send lawyer or reminder letters. If you decide to fight with them till the end without payment, they WILL CLOSE your case, and put on record. This affects your credit bureau record (ie. ability to take loans, signing up new mobile line with other telcos).
              
              Hope that helps. How I know? I am past that stage. LOL

              You can don't pay if you are already an old hag, and waiting to die in the coming years.
              If you are still young, THIS WILL AFFECT YOUR CREDIT REPORT. Simple things like signing new mobile phone line will become a chore. If serious, you might not even be able to secure your HDB loan, credit card, study loans. THIS IS NO JOKE.
