            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks guys for all the comments. Can I twist this topic a little? If your friend has cheated on his gf, would you keep his secret or would you tell the girl?<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 03-12-1999).]</div>

But, depending on how badly he/she feels about it, I probably won't say anything yet. I WILL give him/her shit for doing the dirty, but at this stage it won't be up to me to divulge anything. Whatever happend later, I'll decide when I come to it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry for not explaining the situation properly, heh heh...<br><br>Actually, I have 2 separate sets of problems. Problem #1 is my friend who is feeling insecure after her bf told her everything, including the three one-night stands he's had before. He's very devoted to her now; he doesn't even look when a chiobu walks past. But she's scared of history repeating itself.<br><br>Problem #2: I saw a friend holding hands with another girl, not his gf. Confronted him alredi but he denied that there's anything between them. Yeah right. I know the gf. She's a classmate. Should I tell her? Would she believe me?<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>This is what I think. Feel free to disagree.<br><br>#1 The fact the the bf told her everything suggests that he is quite serious with her. I don't think he's trying to test waters or anything. I would probably encourage her to give him a bit of credit and let things pass, otherwise its hard to carry on. It would probably be difficult to ignore the insecurities, but I suppose thats life.<br><br>#2 If you believe that friend i.e. he does not lie to you often, or if you are unsure, then say nothing. Like many people have said, its not your place to make trouble for the original couple. Otherwise, you might bring it up some time later and see if his story is still the same. Talk also to his gf (you friend right?) and if there are indications of anything wrong, you must decide whether to say something. Lets say something is going on. Your friend (that gf) is going to get hurt no matter what. I'm honestly not sure that if you being the one with the news will actually lessen the pain.<br><br>Yes, I know, what I said is quite confusing, but there is just so many angles to look at it from, and I'm more concerned about their relationship than my own comfort.<br><br>Repeat: just my opinion.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks Pacman. Serioulsy, if the guy is seen holding hands with another girl (definitely not his sis!), is it accurate to think that he's guilty?! I don't mean he was supporting her because she's not limping or anything. They were walking around chatting happily.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>purr,<br>I know of a good friend, a girl, who is currently attached. However when she goes out with other guys, if the guy attempts to hold her hand, she does not object cos she does not think it is anything wrong if the guy is a good friend. I don't agree with her but that is her own decision. Not sure if the b/f knows but my guess is probably not.</div>
