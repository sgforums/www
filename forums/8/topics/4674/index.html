(e.g. past girlfriends, sexual history) A friend couldn't accept it when her bf told her about the one night stands he's had before.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi purr...I think it would depend very much on the people involved...some people are very open and can accept things a lot more easily than others...Ultimately the person in the relationship will know the character of his/her partner well enough to be able to make that decision whether they should tell or not...<br><br>Some couples find humor and some excitement in learning about past experiences of their partners...some just get jealous and insecure like hell...:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't tell everything unless you are REALLY sure your partner is open-minded. Even then, there might be some lingering doubt once something is revealed.<br><br>Personal experience : My ex wanted to move on to the 'next level' (not sexually!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">)  and I told her about my past relationships (one of them being with a classmate) and she couldn't get it out of her head that if I had never ended with that classmate, I might never have been with her. She doubted me from then and 8 mths later, everything crumbled cause of her jealousy for that classmate, and our relationship was over. If I had never told her, things might be different, but then again, I wouldn't have met this other girl who was more ideal for me.<br><br>In my opinion, some degree of secrecy and mystery keeps the relationship exciting, and knowing everything will eventually lead to boredom. (Like it or not) TRUE love is hard to find.. passion, romance, excitement, mystery etc.. are all important parts of today's relationships.<br><br>Cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>Is it cold in here, or is it just me?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guess there has to be some secrets somewhere along the way.<br>Like Rinoa said, some guys and girls just cannot take it.<br>I had a very open relationship with my ex as in we tell each other our past and all. However depite knowing that the past is past and the present and future should be more important, there are times when one side will wonder: "If xxx is still with yyy, will yyy make xxx happier when they do the same activity?" etc....<br>However for those who wish to keep some deep secrets, do take care NEVER EVER to let the cat out of the bag, otherwise it could jolly well be worse than an extinct volcano erupting.<br>So what I'll do is try to be open to the limit I think my g/f can accept. Maybe a match will be some guideline. Eg, If he/she has lots of close friends of the other sex, think he/she will be able to accept you as that too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have come to the conclusion not long ago that honesty is the best policy for whoever is being honest, not for anyone else. Often, people tell someone else a secret not because of honesty, but because of guilt or they want that confidante to make decisions for them.<br><br>So, like many people have said before, don't say anything till you are sure how people can take it. My view, say nothing. Because I can't judge characters well, so I might as well not take the risk. Don't lie, just say nothing.<br><br>For myself, I would rather know everything, because I would rather find out now than later. I'm more comfortable with that. Chances are, if I don't take the news well here, it will take a very long time for me to get to the stage where I won't mind.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, didn't expect so many replies to my question. How about sexual history? Should you tell? Is this relevant in the age of Aids? If you do, how much would you tell?<br><br>How do I make my friend feel better? Does it mean that if you've had one night stands before, you're likely to do it again? How do you know that someone has changed? Or should I just stay out of this?

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks guys for all the comments. Can I twist this topic a little? If your friend has cheated on his gf, would you keep his secret or would you tell the girl?<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 03-12-1999).]</div>
