              <p>Yeah this true. If no further complications, the H1N1 virus will only be a virus that is residing in your body. Yes, you can use drugs to get rid of it, this way it would be out of your body much quicker. However, if no complication arises, it is best for the virus to be removed by your body immune system. This way, it primes your body immune system, and you will have the immune response to this particular type of H1N1 strains.</p>
              <p>In the future, if a more dangerous or more virulent strain of H1N1 is to come around, your body immune system against the present H1N1 virus maybe work as well against the new virulent strain. However, this is provided that this new virulent strain of H1N1 virus is quite similar to the present one if not your body immune response may not work too.</p>
              <p>According to epidemiological studies, if during this period whereby the weak strain is infecting the population, it is better for us to get infected. Because a weak strain is weak and cannot harm us much. Therefore by getting infected, our body immune system is prime against it. In the future if a more dangerous form of the virus comes along, our immune system against the weaker strain may actually play a role in defense against this more dangerous form of the virus. This is only true, provided the more dangerous form of the flu virus is still H1N1 and the major antigens/epitopes which our immune system recognises is unchanged.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, if more of the population gets infected by this present low disease causing strain, and given that our primed immune system works against the new more dangerous form of the virus, therefore it would also bring down the transmission rate when the new dangerous virus kicks in.</p>
              <p>Imagine, with 70% of the population getting infected now, and having the immune system that is capable of handling the new more dangerous form of the virus, this means in every 10 people expose to the virus, only 3 will get it. This will thus bring down the transmission rate. If everyone now is afraid of the H1N1 and wanna take precaution, then imagine if only 10% of our population kanna the virus now, then in the future when the stronger one comes along, then 9 out of every 10 person will get the virus and be damn sick.</p>
              <p>Anyway, this is just some discussion about the H1N1 virus from an epidemiological point of view. Those who understand epidemiological and immunology will understand what I am saying. Those who dont know can go read up more if ya are interested.</p>

              <p>If it is a normal flu with no complication, one will recover within 7 days.</p>
              <p>Please google the normal cycle of a normal flu. No treatment is needed.</p>
              <p>If a normal flu that leads to pneumonia, this is a complication and medical treatment is needed.</p>
              <p>Please google it how a normal flu can lead to complications eg pneumonia.</p>
              <p>When the doctors talked about the complications arising out of H1N1 virus, they are referring to people who have existing chronic illnesses eg heart, kidney diabetes, cancer patients and patients with low immunity system, young children below age of 5, pregnant ladies and elderly who are above 65.</p>
              <p>People who are healthy and infected with H1N1 virus will recover with no treatment needed unless complications arises. When complications arise, one will need medical treatment.</p>
