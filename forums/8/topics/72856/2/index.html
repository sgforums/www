Even though a taxi driver has a car, he still has to drive hours each day just to earn a living. The car itself won't bring him income on its own. (Of course, unless he rents it out, but the amount will most likely be inadequate to cover his daily needs).</div>

But the idea of generating income from taxi driving isnt dying out in forseeable future, so it wont be really abandoned.<br><br>If you are talking about auto income generating vehicles, such as investments, that is good, and really good for everyone, but not only one have to change the mindset of people, having significant number of people relying on investments for eg, isnt healthy either.</div>
