The whole gang started to strip my char upside down and left me near naked. This one guy char forcefully took off my last clothing and by this time, I was getting real mad.<br><br>The gang dispersed and he ran off to hide in some subway. I followed him and he was standing inside on another char. I recognized him straight away and decided to invite him to the chatroom. But I change me mind after I typed half way and decided to defame him anyways.<br><br>But by that time, he already ran off so fast that I couldn't click on him. I ran after him too and he was finaly trapped in one corner. The fellow yelled at me to meet him in real life to settle and I agreed because I was boiling mad inside.<br><br>The scenario quickly changes to real life and in front of me stood a very chubby guy. We had a yelling match and the next thing I knew, he transformed into a big wolf, howling and started running off to one corner.<br><br>My hands magically appears a long bamboo stick ( the one which u hang ur clothes) and I started to hit him. My head was bursting with anger and I couldn't stop hitting him.<br><br>Finaaly, he couldn't take it and transformed back to his human form. He was yelling at me hysterically and I called him a pile of sh!t. He was obviously offended and he took off his pants and pointed his butt at me and started to lao sai right in front of my face! Some of it spilt onto my shirt!<br><br>I went crazy and I screamed at him with all my might. I was feeling shock and tired and all of sudden, the chubby guy threaten me to commit suicide if I force him to one corner again. He then flung open my house door and sat on a ledge. He yelled to the open air, trying to announce to the world that I forced him to commit suicide. I was shell shocked and I did the same thing as him yelling that I was innocent and he was just trying to be emo!<br><br>A few seconds after I yelled, the chubby guy leaped off and he was in mid-air before landing right into a grassy spot. I saw him struggling but in my heart, I wish he was dead. He didn't. He crawled to a line of bushes and hid there.<br><br>Then, I saw a lady and one kid standing beside a taxi. I yelled from the top to ask her favour of calling the police. She was one of the witnesses of this incident but the funny thing is..she was adamant about the whole thing and even smiled back at me to do it myself and she and her kid hoped into the taxi and they just drove off like that! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I had no choice. I went back to my house and ask my grandpa to hand me the phone as he was also using it. He gladly hands it to me. (in real life he would just chat non stop so the gesture was surprising) I dialed 999 and reached to a guy answering politely with a 'this is tampines police station, may I assist you?'<br><br>I told him that I am in Bedok and could he kindly transfer my call there. He says wait a min he wants to check up something and I said ok.<br><br>A few mins later, his voice changes to a dull and impolite tone and he told me he can't. I was like..huh? He then told me that I took some maths exams twice and I failed both times and one of the requirements to call for help from the police was to pass the maths exam o.O<br><br>I couldn't believed what I've heard and he was sounding really rude and told me that I don't deserve the help at all. I became panic and begged him sorrowfully, telling him that someone has been threatening me and how that someone committed suicide on his own will but is pushing the blame to me!<br><br>He gave in and finally agreed to transfer me. But to my disappointment, I was transferred to a phone advertisement &gt;.&lt;<br><br>I put down the phone and decided to try my luck again, hoping I won't get to that guy. It was a major relief when I got a kind sounding lady at the receiving end of the phone line. I hurriedly told her my situation but she cut me off politely and told me to wait a moment while she check something. I agreed and the same thing happen but this time...she was real polite about it.<br><br>She told me that I took two maths exams and I didn't passed them. She told me that the government has since change the rules on calling for help. After she finished explaining, I couldn't take it anymore..my eyes stung and tears start flowing. I was devastated. I cried and told her how unfair it was and how my situation was hell.<br><br>The lady sympathised but she said she had no choice too. After that, my father walked in and told me he would help me to complain.
