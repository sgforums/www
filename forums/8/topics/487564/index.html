                                      SAF</span></span></strong><br> <br> 1. Overview<br> The military justice system in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is
                                      expected to treat every service personnel fairly and equally,
                                      regardless of race, rank or vocation.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> <br> 2. Multi-levelled Approach</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The military justice system is based on the SAF Act, which was
                                      implemented in 1972. All servicemen are subjected to the SAF Act,
                                      SAF Regulations, and orders of whatever form issued pursuant to
                                      them.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">While discipline is paramount in the military, not all offences
                                      committed by SAF servicemen are dealt with by formal investigations
                                      and charges. Essentially, offenders can be dealt with either by way
                                      of informal or formal punishment systems.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> <br> 3. Informal Punishment System<br> Commanders are empowered to mete out informal punishments like
                                      push-ups and weekend confinement to servicemen who have committed
                                      disciplinary breaches, like being late, sluggish, or improperly
                                      dressed.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">4. Formal Punishment System<br> If the offence that a serviceman committed is of a more serious
                                      nature, he may be formally dealt with by his disciplinary officer
                                      by way of a summary trial, or brought before a subordinate military
                                      court (more commonly known as the General Court Martial or
                                      GCM).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">(a) Summary Trial</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The offences that can be dealt with by summary trial are
                                      essentially military offences, such as absence without leave
                                      (AWOL), non-compliance with lawful orders or insubordination.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Depending on the rank of the serviceman in question, and the type
                                      of the disciplinary body hearing the case, the possible sentences
                                      that may be imposed can vary, and these can include fines or
                                      detention.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The summary trial is carried out in accordance with relevant SAF
                                      regulations, and the records of the summary trial are sent to the
                                      office of the Director, Legal Services of the SAF.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">(b) General Court Martial</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The General Court Martial exists as a separate forum from that of
                                      the summary trial. Unlike the summary trial, the GCM can deal with
                                      a wider range of offences, and can impose a wider range of
                                      punishments including imprisonment and discharge, on top of
                                      sentences like detention and fines. The GCM is also a more public
                                      and open forum, and its proceedings are conducted using similar
                                      legal rules and procedures as those used in a civil criminal
                                      court.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Generally, only serious offences investigated by the Military
                                      Police Command, and which are referred to the office of the
                                      Director of Legal Services, will result in the accused serviceman
                                      being charged in a GCM. In such a case, a military prosecutor will
                                      draw up a formal charge sheet and present it before the GCM.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">General Courts Martial can be further sub-divided into two
                                      categories, namely the Panel Courts Martial - consisting of a
                                      President and usually two other members, and Judge Courts Martial -
                                      consisting of a single President only.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Currently, the practice is for military offences to be heard by
                                      Panel Courts Martial, while civil offences like misuse of drugs and
                                      penal code offences may be dealt with by a Judge Court Martial.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"><br> The current policy is also for an NSman, who is or was a District
                                      Judge in the Subordinate Courts, to preside in a GCM. There are
                                      currently 10 NSmen who have been appointed by the Armed Forces
                                      Council to perform duty as President of a court martial. They are
                                      rostered by the Registrar of the Subordinate Military Court to hear
                                      cases during their in-camp training. In the case of a Panel Court
                                      Martial, the other two members are rostered from among some 155

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">There are numerous safeguards and avenues set out in the military
                                      justice system for an SAF serviceman to seek redress if he is
                                      unhappy about the punishment imposed on him.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Generally, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with an informal
                                      punishment meted out to him may request a higher level commander to
                                      review the punishment, or request for formal disciplinary
                                      dealing.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">In the case of a summary trial, a serviceman brought before the
                                      disciplinary officer may elect instead to be tried by a court
                                      martial. Alternatively, an aggrieved serviceman may request that
                                      his conviction or punishment imposed at the summary trial be
                                      reviewed by MINDEF's Director Manpower (a delegated authority of
                                      the Armed Forces Council).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">In the case of a GCM, a serviceman may choose to be represented by
                                      a lawyer or an SAF defending officer if his case will be heard by a
                                      court martial. The SAF has about 200 trained defending officers.
                                      While an SAF defending officer comes free to the serviceman, he has
                                      to bear the cost of engaging a lawyer. At the end of the trial, a
                                      serviceman who is dissatisfied with the decision of the court
                                      martial may petition the Reviewing Authority (the AFC or a
                                      committee of its members) for a review of his case. The serviceman
                                      can also appeal to the Military Court of Appeal (MCA) for a
                                      reconsideration of his conviction, or his sentence, or both.</p>

                                      members. Heading the MCA is a President, who is appointed by the
                                      Chief Justice. By law, he must be a person qualified to be a Judge
                                      of the Supreme Court. The current President of the MCA is Justice
                                      Choo Han Teck. Four other members - two civilian members who are
                                      qualified legal practitioners with at least five years experience
                                      each, and two senior military officers - make up the rest of the
                                      MCA. The MCA is the highest court in the military justice
                                      system.</p>

                                      case impartially like any other civil criminal case. The
                                      proceedings in the GCM and the MCA are also heard in a public
                                      forum, and these military courts adopt many of the same legal
                                      procedures and safeguards as that used in the civil criminal
                                      courts. All servicemen formally charged with an offence can bring
                                      their case to these forums.</p>

              <p><em><strong>Being psychologically prepared is all about knowing
                                      what to expect and being prepared for it.</strong></em></p>
              <p>To be better prepared, you can participate in Total Defence
                                      activities and Open Houses organised by the SAF/SPF/SCDF.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should also talk to your family members and friends
                                      who have lived the NS experience. The more you discuss with others,
                                      the more comfortable and mentally prepared you’ll become.</p>
              <p><strong>Because NS life is different from civilian life before
                                      enlistment, there are many adjustments you need to
                                      make.</strong></p>
              <p>A good way to cope is to get support from your buddy and fellow
                                      recruits. They are going through the same tough training as you, so
                                      talking to one another will help relieve some tension.</p>
              <p>In most evenings during your leisure time, you’ll also have some
                                      time to call your family or loved ones to talk. They can give you
                                      emotional support during NS.</p>
              <p>You can have a one-on-one interview sessions with your officer
                                      to highlight any problems you may have. If you have a personal or
                                      family problem that need to be addressed, do let the officer
                                      know—he may be able to give you some advice or time off to settle
                                      your problems.</p>
              <p>Life in NS revolves around structure, routine and discipline.
                                      This helps us stay united as a uniformed organisation as well as
                                      imparts the rigours necessary to protect our nation and
                                      citizens.</p>
              <p>This does not mean there is just work and no play. In fact,
                                      after a few weeks in NS and you’ll find new friends and new reasons
                                      to smile!</p>
              <p><strong>As a soldier, one of the biggest adjustments you’ll have
                                      to make quickly is in regimentation and discipline.</strong></p>
              <p>Being in a uniformed organisation, you’ll have to obey orders
                                      from your superiors. Thus some of you may feel a sudden lack of
                                      freedom to do what you want and you may find yourself having
                                      difficulties accepting authority initially.</p>
              <p>Regimentation and discipline build strong character and
                                      toughness, so that you’ll be tough enough to handle difficult
                                      combat, crime-fighting or rescue situations without giving up or
                                      breaking down.</p>
              <p>When you first enlist into NS, you may have concerns of being in
                                      a new territory, with new faces and new things to do. But don’t let
                                      this get to you. Just remember the saying that “when the going gets
                                      tough, the tough gets going”.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Following are some
                                      tips on what you can do to prepare yourself
                                      psychologically:</em></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Adopt a positive perception</li>

              <li>Set realistic expectations</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can also speak to your friends or family members who have
                                      been through NS. Ask them to share their stories. The sharing will
                                      help you reduce some of your fears, uncertainties and doubts.</p>
              <p><strong>During NS you’ll be living with different
                                      people.</strong></p>
              <p>Because these people come from different backgrounds, they may
                                      not think like you do or react to situations like you would.
                                      Instead of trying to select your type of people, you should cherish
                                      the diversity. This is a chance for you to learn more about your
                                      fellow mates and their cultures.</p>
              <p>You’ll find that you have many opportunities to absorb the
                                      different cultures—during training, eating, chatting or just seeing
                                      and listening. Take these opportunities and learn from people
                                      around you, you’ll have a much better appreciation of Singapore’s
                                      cultural diversity.</p>

              <h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enhancements to NS
              IPPT Management &amp; Training </span></h1>
              <div>
              <p><em><strong>July 2014</strong></em></p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>The new NS IPPT Management system will be in effect from
              1 Sep 2014.</strong></p>
              <p>Enhancements to the NS IPPT policies seek to ease administrative
              constraints to better support NSmen in managing their fitness and
              other commitments. The key changes are as follows:</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.   Extension of
              IPPT/IPT/RT windows to 12 months.<br> b.   Increase in monetary incentives for good IPPT
              performance.</p>
              <p>Concurrently, the SAF will improve IPT and RT fitness training
              in the Fitness Conditioning Centres (FCCs). From <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1 Sep 14</span>, all Fitness
              Conditioning Centres (FCCs) will be providing a greater variety of
              training and specialised fitness classes.<br> <br> As part of SAF's continuous efforts to review the fitness training
              system, a new IPPT format that is simpler to administer and simpler
              for servicemen to train for will be introduced. A pilot
              implementation involving selected Army NS and Active units (i.e. at
              least 3,000 active and NS participants from various age groups,
              vocations and gender) will be conducted from Sep to Nov 2014.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THE ENHANCED NS
              IPPT SYSTEM</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(With Effect From
              1 September 2014)</strong></span><br> <br> <strong>Enhancements with effect from 1 September
              2014:</strong><br> <br> 1.    Pictorial diagrams of the current and new NS
              IPPT management system are as follows:</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=17d97be3-67a9-4935-b8a7-0357c5816f6e&amp;amp;groupId=10401&amp;amp;t=1406197426269"><img src="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=17d97be3-67a9-4935-b8a7-0357c5816f6e&amp;amp;groupId=10401&amp;amp;t=1406197426269" alt="" width="288" height="185"></a></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.    The IPPT window
              has been extended from 9 months to <strong>12</strong> months. In
              this window, NSmen must attempt and pass their IPPT test.
              Alternatively, they can volunteer for a 10-session IPT programme.
              They will exit the IPT programme if they (1) complete 10 sessions
              of IPT; or (2) meet their Personal Performance Targets.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 1</span>:<br> <br> My birthday is on 1 January.<br>  <br> Old system: my IPPT window is 9-months long: 1 January 2015 to 30
              September 2015.<br>  <br> New IPPT system: my IPPT window is 12-months long: 1 January 2015
              to 31 December 2015.<br>  <br> b.    The RT window has been extended from 3 months
              to <strong>12</strong> months. In this window, NSmen must complete
              their 20-session RT programme. They will exit the RT programme if
              they (1) complete 20 sessions of RT; or (2) pass IPPT during the
              stipulated RT-IPPT sessions.<br>  <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 2</span>:<br>  <br> My birthday is on 1 January.<br>  <br> Old system: my RT window is 3-months long: 1 October 2015 to 31
              December 2015.<br>  <br> New IPPT system: my new RT window is 12-months long : 1 January
              2016 to 31 December 2016.</p>
              <p>2.    The quantum for the IPPT monetary
              incentives has been enhanced. The revised quantum is applicable to
              NSmen with birthday windows starting from 1 Sep 2014. For example,
              if your birthday window starts on 1 Sep 2014, you will be eligible
              for $500 if you attain Gold award. However, if your birthday window
              starts on 31 Aug, you will still be subjected to the old system,
              and you will receive $400 if you attain Gold, even if you take the
              IPPT after 1 Sep.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=4ce11a50-c74c-4c92-b5a1-fafac271c38f&amp;amp;groupId=10401&amp;amp;t=1406197775143"><img src="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=4ce11a50-c74c-4c92-b5a1-fafac271c38f&amp;amp;groupId=10401&amp;amp;t=1406197775143" alt="" width="288" height="111"></a></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">3.    NSmen who do not
              perform IPPT and/or RT will continue to be disciplinarily dealt
              with.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Transition to new
              IPPT system</strong></span><br> <br> 4.    As at 1 September 2014, NSmen who are still in
              their IPPT window will enjoy an automatic extension of their IPPT
              window by 3 months. Those within their 3-month RT window will have
              an extended RT window (i.e. remaining RT window + next 12-month
              window).</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=297129e0-21eb-4d10-9007-bdb25a00cbd5&amp;amp;groupId=10401&amp;amp;t=1406249720590"><img src="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=297129e0-21eb-4d10-9007-bdb25a00cbd5&amp;amp;groupId=10401&amp;amp;t=1406249720590" alt="" width="288" height="88"></a></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;"> a.  
               <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example
              3</span>:<br> My birthday is on 1 August. On 1 September 2014, I am 1 month into
              my IPPT window.<br> <br> After extension, my new IPPT window will be 12-months long. It will
              be until 30 Jul 2015 instead of 30 April 2015. I will need to
              complete either my 10-session IPT program or perform at least 1
              IPPT test.<br> <br> b.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 4</span>:<br> My birthday is on 1 January and I failed my IPPT. On 1 September
              2014, I am in my RT window.<br> <br> After extension, my new RT window will be from 1 September 2014 to
              31 December 2015 (i.e. remaining RT window + 12-months) instead of
              31 December 2014. I will need to complete 20 sessions of RT in this
              new window or pass an IPPT during a stipulated RT-IPPT session.</p>
              <p>5.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">One-time Reset of Default
              Offences</span>.  NSmen with existing offences and charges are
              allowed a one-time opportunity to reset all offences by completing
              their IPPT requirements during this transition.</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 5</span>:<br> My birthday is on 1 January and I failed my IPPT. I have defaulted
              my RT for my past 2 windows and have been charged. After extension,
              my new RT window will be from 1 Sep 2014 to 31 Dec 2015. If I
              complete my 20 sessions of RT in this RT window, my 2 existing
              default counts in the system will be reset to zero. If I default my
              RT again, I will be disciplinarily dealt with.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">6.    Please refer to
              the advisory via the IPPT Booking System at NS Portal from 1 Sep
              2014 onwards for your IPPT status.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NEW IPPT FORMAT
              AND SCORING SYSTEM</strong></span><br> <br> <strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br> <br> 1.    Fitness is an important element of soldiering.
              The SAF constantly reviews our training system, including physical
              training regimes and physical fitness tests, to ensure that they
              are relevant and effective. Starting from 1 Sep 2014, the SAF will
              launch a pilot implementation of a new and simpler Individual
              Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) format, which will be accompanied
              by a new scoring system. The new IPPT format is expected to be
              fully implemented across the SAF in 2015.<br> <br> <strong>KEY FEATURES OF THE NEW IPPT FORMAT AND SCORING
              SYSTEM</strong><br> <br> 2.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A
              simpler three-station IPPT format to encourage personal ownership
              of fitness</span>.  The new three-station test format will
              comprise a push-up test, a sit-up test, and a 2.4km run. These
              stations will measure the strength and cardiovascular fitness of
              our servicemen. This new and simpler format was designed to allow
              servicemen to train and maintain their fitness, without the need
              for specialised technique or equipment. Fitness is a personal
              responsibility. This simpler test format will further motivate our
              servicemen to take greater ownership of their fitness, and
              incorporate these exercises into their daily routine to maintain
              their fitness.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=a497af9a-5830-4fa8-b146-3606a64e36c0&amp;amp;groupId=10401&amp;amp;t=1406250852346"><img src="http://lifestyle.www.ns.sg/image/image_gallery?uuid=a497af9a-5830-4fa8-b146-3606a64e36c0&amp;amp;groupId=10401&amp;amp;t=1406250852346" alt="" width="288" height="90"></a></span><br> <span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Table 1.  New
              IPPT Format.</span></span></p>
              <p>3.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">New scoring system to motivate
              personal excellence</span>. The SAF will also introduce a new
              scoring system to accompany the new IPPT format. Servicemen will be
              allocated points for their performance in each of the three
              stations. The maximum number of points servicemen may earn for each
              station are 50 points for the 2.4km run station, and 25 points each
              for the Push Up and Sit Up stations. The maximum number of points a
              serviceman can achieve in the IPPT is 100. The points will be added
              together to form a final score, which will determine the
              serviceman's individual fitness standard. Similar to the current
              IPPT, servicemen will need to score the requisite number of points
              to Pass, Pass with monetary incentive, and to achieve the Silver
              and Gold IPPT awards. Active servicemen will continue to be held to
              a higher passing standard because fitness training is incorporated
              into their work and training routine. To ensure the high standards
              of our elite combat troops - Commando, Diver, and Guards will be
              held to a higher Gold IPPT standard.<br> <br> 4.    This new scoring system will encourage
              servicemen to do their best for each of the stations. The better
              they perform in the stations, the more points they will be awarded.
              The flexibility of the new scoring system will motivate servicemen
              to exercise greater ownership on how they will train for their
              IPPT, allowing them to tap on their individual strengths to do
              well.</p>

              <p>5.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shorter age categories for a better
              performance-to-age match</span>.  As part of this physical
              fitness review, we will also shorten our age categories, from
              5-year bands to 3-year bands. This shorter age categories allow us
              to better differentiate the different age groups of our servicemen,
              and is a better performance-to-age match. Instead of having to
              perform to the same standards in a five year age block, servicemen
              will perform to a new standard every three years. This shorter age
              category will be more sensitive to the effects of age on the
              physical fitness of our servicemen.<br> <br> <strong>EXAMPLE</strong><br> <br> 6.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Age
              Group 3 Pass example</span>.  For a 25 to 27 year old NSmen to
              achieve Pass he would be required to perform 16 Push Ups in 1 min
              (6 pts), 30 Sit Ups in 1 min (14 pts) and complete his 2.4km run in
              12min 40s (31 pts). With this performance, he would accumulate a
              total score of 51 points, which would make him eligible for the
              Pass Award.<br> <br> 7.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Age
              Group 6 Gold Award example</span>. For a 34 to 36 year old
              serviceman aiming to achieve Gold award, he would be required to
              perform 35 Push Ups in 1 min (20 pts), 35 Sit Ups in 1 min (20 pts)
              and complete his 2.4km run in 10min 40s (41 pts). With this
              performance, he would accumulate a total score of 81 points, which
              would make him eligible for the Gold Award.<br> <br> <strong>IMPLEMENTATION</strong><br> <br> 8.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pilot implementation</span>. Army
              will conduct a pilot implementation from Sep to Nov 14 to fine-tune
              the administration of the new IPPT. Selected Active and NS units
              will participate in this phase. At least 3,000 servicemen and
              servicewomen of different vocations and age groups will be
              represented in the pilot implementation.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Frequently Answered
              Questions</span><br> <br> <strong>What is the current NS IPPT Management
              System?</strong><br> <br> The current NS IPPT management system was implemented on 1 April
              2011. Under this system, NSmen are required to pass their IPPT
              within the first 9 months of their birthday window. Those who fail
              or default on their IPPT have to attend 20 sessions of Remedial
              Training (RT) in the last 3 months of their birthday window. NSmen
              can also volunteer for IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT) in the first
              9 months of their birthday window, and will fulfil their IPPT
              requirement for the year if they meet their Personal Performance
              Targets (PPTs)<sup>1</sup>. Those who fail to meet their PPTs have
              to attend 8 sessions of RT in the last 3 months of their birthday
              window.<br> <br> <sup>1</sup><span style="font-size: 10px;">PPTs are intermediate
              standards raised progressively at an annual rate towards an IPPT
              Pass. The PPT standard is derived from the results of the IPPT
              conducted during the first session of IPT.</span><br> <br> <strong>What are the key changes under the enhanced NS IPPT
              Management System?</strong><br> <br> With effect from 1 Sep 2014, NSmen will be given 12 months to
              attempt and pass their IPPT. Alternatively, NSmen that require help
              can volunteer for a 10-session IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT).
              NSmen who pass their IPPT or complete IPT will proceed to either
              IPPT or IPT in their next 12-month birthday window. NSmen who fail
              or default IPPT or IPT will be subject to Remedial Training (RT).
              They will be required to complete their RT programme within their
              subsequent 12-month birthday windows. NSmen who volunteer for IPT
              will be considered to have met their IPPT requirement for the year
              if they (1) meet their Personal Performance Targets (PPT) at any
              point in the programme; or (2) complete 10 sessions of IPT within
              their birthday window. NSmen on IPT are advised to attend training
              at least once a week continuously for 10 sessions to obtain the
              benefits of the training regime.<br> <br> <strong>What are the specific changes to the IPPT Management
              System?</strong></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extension of IPPT/IPT to 12
              months</span>.   The IPPT/IPT window will be extended
              from the current 9 months to 12 months, to give NSmen more time to
              attempt and pass IPPT or complete IPT.<br> <br> b.    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extension of RT window to 12
              months</span>.   Instead of the last 3 months in their
              present window, NSmen who default or fail the IPPT will be given 12
              months in their next birthday window to complete 20 sessions of RT.
              This extension is to enable NSmen to better manage their other
              commitments so that they can meet the RT requirements. NSmen are
              advised to attend RT at least once a week continuously for the
              duration of his RT in order to obtain the benefits of the training
              regime.</p>
              <p><strong>What are the changes to IPPT Preparatory
              Training?</strong><br> <br> The IPT programme will continue to be available to NSmen who need
              help with IPPT training. Participants will be able to exit the
              programme upon meeting their PPTs. To better recognise the efforts
              put in by NSmen to train for IPPT, with effect from 1 Sep 14,
              service pay for IPT programme will be accorded to NSmen whose
              birthday windows start from 1 Sep 14. NSmen who complete the
              requisite 10 sessions of IPT within the IPPT window but fail to
              meet PPTs will no longer be subject to 8 sessions of RT. To
              motivate NSmen to participate in as many IPT sessions as they can,
              NSmen who default on IPT will be subjected to 20 – D sessions of RT
              in the next window, where D is equal to the number of IPT sessions
              that the NSman participated in, in the preceding 12-month birthday
              window.<br> <br> <strong>Is there a change in determining whether NSmen have met
              their IPT/RT requirement?</strong><br> <br> NSmen who have failed or defaulted IPPT are liable for RT. NSmen
              who have defaulted IPPT will be liable for 20 sessions of RT during
              their 12-month RT window (new system with effect from 1 Sep 14). To
              differentiate between IPPT failures and defaulters, under the new
              system, failures will be liable to 20-D sessions (as opposed to 20
              sessions), where D is equivalent to the number of IPPT/IPT attempts
              made in the preceding window.<br> <br> NSmen who volunteer for IPT will be considered to have met their
              annual IPT requirements if they (1) pass IPPT; (2) meet their
              Personal Performance Targets anytime during their IPT programme; or
              (3) complete 10 sessions of IPT during their 12-month IPPT/IPT
              window (with effect from 1 Sep). They will no longer be liable for
              8-sessions of RT if they do not meet their Personal Performance
              Targets by the 10th session. This is to recognise that servicemen
              have put in their best efforts to train and meet their fitness
              targets in volunteering for and completing the 10-session
              programme.<br> <br> <strong>Under the enhanced NS IPPT management system are NSmen in
              RT allowed to participate in non-ICT IPPT that are not the
              stipulated RT-IPPT tests?</strong><br> <br> In the new system, NSmen in the RT programme will only be allowed
              to participate in ICT-IPPT or RT-IPPT on the stipulated 8th, 14th
              and 20th RT sessions. NSmen are given sufficient time to attempt
              and pass their IPPT during the 12-month IPPT window. NSmen that are
              in the RT programme are deemed to be servicemen that require help
              to train for and pass IPPT. As such, it is mandatory for NSmen in
              the RT programme to participate in at least 7 training sessions
              before they are allowed to attempt the IPPT.<br> <em><br> Monetary Incentive</em><br> <br> <strong>What are the changes in monetary incentive for IPPT
              performance?</strong><br> <br> To motivate personnel to do their best and maintain a high level of
              physical fitness, the quantum of the awards will be increased by
              $100. The new quantum will apply to NSmen with birthday windows
              starting from 1 Sep 2014; NSFs whose IPPT windows start from 1 Sep
              2014; and Regulars for tests taken from 1 Apr 2015.</p>

              <p><em>Disciplinary Framework</em><br> <br> <strong>Under the enhanced NS IPPT management system, what happens
              when NSmen fail or default their IPPT?</strong><br> <br> Currently, both IPPT defaulters and failures are subject to 20
              sessions of RT within the 3-month RT window. In the enhanced
              system, there will be greater differentiation between IPPT Failures
              and Defaulters. IPPT failures will be subjected to fewer sessions
              of RT in the 12-month RT window. NSmen who fail will be subjected
              to 20 – D sessions of RT, where D is equal to the number of IPPT
              attempted in the previous 12-month birthday window. For defaulters,
              they will have to complete 20 sessions. Within the RT window,
              servicemen will only be allowed to exit RT if they attain the Pass
              standard at the stipulated test sessions (i.e. 8th, 14th and 20th
              sessions).<br> <br> <strong>What is SAF doing to deter recalcitrant
              defaulters?</strong><br> <br> IPPT is an annual requirement for all IPPT-eligible NSmen. NSmen
              who default their IPPT will be subjected to disciplinary action. A
              new disciplinary framework will be implemented from 1 Jan 15.
              Currently, NSmen with three such offences or more will be subject
              to either a Fine or be sent to Detention Barracks. Under the new
              framework, NSmen with three such offences will be subjected to Fine
              and a five-day residential In-Camp-Training (Physical Training)
              [ICT(PT)]. The ICT(PT) is a more constructive way to help NSmen to
              train for their fitness. The ICT(PT) focuses on teaching servicemen
              on the different types of fitness modalities and fitness
              habits.</p>
              <p><em>New IPPT format</em><br> <strong><br> What is the impetus for the new IPPT format?</strong><br> <br> Physical fitness of our servicemen is tested using the IPPT
              protocol. Prior to 2009, combat fitness was assessed using our
              Standard Obstacle Course and route marches. Since then, the Army
              has strengthened combat fitness training with the introduction of
              Vocation-Related Exercises and Vocation Obstacle Courses to meet
              our new operational demands. With this in place, it is now timely
              to review our physical fitness test protocol and standards.<br> <br> <strong>Will the Home Team be implementing the new IPPT
              format?</strong><br> <br> Yes, the Home Team will be adopting the same IPPT format as the
              SAF. The Home Team has assessed that the new IPPT format would meet
              their needs for assessing the physical fitness of Home Team
              NSmen/NSFs.<br> <br> <strong>When will the trial for the new IPPT format be
              held?</strong><br> <br> The trial will be conducted by the Army Fitness Centre from Sep -
              Nov 2014. It will involve at least 3,000 Active and NS personnel
              across different gender, age groups and vocations. NSmen from
              selected units will participate in the trial during their
              ICT.<br> <br> <strong>Will SAF make any more changes to the new IPPT format and
              scoring system?</strong><br> <br> SAF does not plan to make any more changes to the new IPPT format
              and scoring system. SAF continuously reviews our fitness training
              system to ensure that we maintain our high standards.<br> <br> <strong>Is it easier to pass the IPPT now?</strong><br> <br> Passing and excelling in IPPT will still require dedicated training
              and effort by servicemen. However with the simpler and more
              motivating format and scoring system, servicemen will be more
              motivated to train.<br> <br> <strong>Why is there a need for a new scoring
              system?</strong><br> <br> The intention of the new scoring system is to motivate our
              servicemen to excel in all the test stations. We want to encourage
              everyone to train to their maximum potential.<br> <br> <strong>Why did SAF/HT move towards a 3-year age
              band?</strong><br> <br> We recognise that a 3-year age band will provide a better
              performance-to-age match compared to the current 5-year age
              band.<br> <br> <strong>How well will this new IPPT structure reflect fitness
              levels of our soldiers/HT NSmen/NSFs?</strong><br> <br> The 3 stations provide a good measurement of basic physical fitness
              as it focuses on the three main body parts. When viewed in totality
              with SAF's other combat fitness regimes such as loaded route
              marches, VRE and SOC/VOC, it is reflective of the fitness levels of
              our soldiers.<br> <br> For the Home Team, the new IPPT structure is a good assessment of
              the basic physical fitness of Home Team NSmen/NSFs. In addition,
              Home Team NSmen/NSFs have to undergo certification and proficiency
              tests such as the Police Defence Tactics and Hazmat Rescue
              Certification Test to ensure that they meet the physical demands of
              frontline operations.</p>
