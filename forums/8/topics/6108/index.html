            <div class='col-md body'>Yes rape sux<br>The thing about rape and sexual abuse it that it is a viscious cycle . It usually starts with the child or person being abused following by the abused person growning up and becomming a abusive person.( Although only a small percentage of abused ppl become abusers themselves).<br>I believe the cause of rape and sexual abuse is due to the fact that first impressions last. eg imagine u are a 7 year old girl and ur male older cousin craetes a situation whereby ur are manupliated into to trying something sexual, at this age u wouldnt know better because children are young and impressionable and have learnt to trust and obey adults. So the bad stuff happens and u hate urself for it BUT no matter how bad it was there was definately some sexual sensations that were nice and since 1st impressions last u will somehow subconsciously have some attraction to older men similar to that of ur abuser, no matter how much u really will hate that person u WILL have some attraction purely because 1st attractions last.<br>I think ppl who become rapist and sexual abusers have little self control especially over their sexual side cos they were never taught how to control their sexual emotions and channel them in a proper way. Thus in their minds they think what they are doing is ok , imagine if the rapist was raped him/herself at a young age by a older person, if the child then never learnt from this huge mistake which was bestoed on him/her the will grow up with teh impression that it is ok to rape and manupliate another human being when teh FACT is it is not ok to treat another human as jsut an object.<br>This is also coupled with the abusers need for control, most abuser are possesive control freiks who live their life in extream tight routine, they MUST be in control of every situation because in their traumatic world if they are not in control of other ppl and situations then other other ppl and situations are in control of them, and when they are not in control bad stuff happens HORRIBLE shattering stuff happens.<br>I myself being an abused child have learnt to deal with these issues through the help of a qualified councilor and with a good network of supportive friends and family, and eventually i am working towards my goal of being a person consciously in control of my life ( notice conscious ).<br>I personally realise on of the main Problems with being abused is that socitey doesnt accept that and sterotypes of physchotic killers and skizo ppl always come up , Honnestly i think this is really unfair and it WOULD REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF ppl would accept ppl who have beem made victims and not ostrisise then.</div>

ARrgghhh...<br><br>I personally feel that it's not that easy to rape a woman... If u were the rapist, you gotta take her clothes off, hold down her hands, pin her legs, take of your own clothes etc... heck, taking of the jeans or underwear is gonna be a problem.<br><br>I guess women just freeze in fright or are afraid of getting hurt? We need them to be more aware that this can be avoided (to a certain extent)... Scream, claw, shout, kick, bite... lure him into a lulled state and *CHOMP*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>We gotta stop this from happening. Rape really takes away a person's innocence. The trauma of the bestial act haunts the victim and his/her family longer than a snatch theft or robbery would, and leaves much deeper scars then a knife could inflict.<br><br>------------------<br>Is it cold in here, or is it just me?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah, but when you think about it, castration is just a minor punishment.....<br><br>What they should do, is send these bastards to those jails where they keep all those really hardcore criminals.

            <div class='col-md body'>NO, rape does not carry a life sentence... i think is maximum 24yrs jail and 24 srokes of cane.<br>of course, if this lead to the death of the victim, the prosecuter may change the case from rape to murder and this will carry a death penalty, like this case for instance..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's so sad...I really don't know what to say or think. Personally, I feel that punishment can never be a way to solve the problem. Maybe education is? Right now, I would rather pray that God can heal the girl and take away her pain, than to think of harsh punishments for the rapist(s). True that they must be punished, but that's not the most important thing now. The girl's recovery is.</div>
