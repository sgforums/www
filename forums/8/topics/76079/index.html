            <div class='col-md body'>What is the law on underage smoking? It seems to me they're non-existance. What I know is, kids under age of 18 are banned from smoking. But kids in school uniform are puffing away happily in public eyes. These underage kids are blowing smoke into my face acting like they're king and the sight and smell of it seriously irks me.<br><br>Why raise the price of cigarettes? It doesn't bother the kids. They don't earn the money, so they won't understand the hardship in earning it. If you raise the price, they'll just need to ask for more money from their parents.<br><br>So we have to do it the draconian way, impose heavy penalties on the kids if they're caught smoking. 1st time offender will have to attend "Why smoking harms you" lessons every sat and sun for one month. 2nd offense mean they have to serve community service every sat and sun for one month. 3rd offense? 2 months. And so on.<br><br>We have to strike where they will feel the pain. Fines and price raise won't help, since its their parents money, it doesn't hurt them. Burn their precious freetime, their weekend, and they'll feel the pinch.<br><br>What's your opinion? If it's good I'll submit to Straits Times Forum.</div>
