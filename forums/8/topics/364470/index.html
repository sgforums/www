              <p>Hi all! Just here to gather some feedbacks and contributions from fellow forumers. :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recently, i just finished my Uni studies and having studied a bit about business and strategy, just wanna know if it's feasible to start up a F &amp; B business now? I have heard that there's no good and bad time for starting a business, in fact anytime is a good time, based on what my lecturers and speakers said last time, but still need some ideas and comments for more info.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My mum is making her own ice cream and having tried her flavours for a few months now, i feel her products are okay to sell. Not say fantastic but some flavours are hard to tell as compared to Walls or Magnolia. I know its highly competitive in the ice cream industry with players like Haagen Daas, B &amp; J, Gelare, Swensens, and so many others in the retail industry as well. Recently, I saw some Gelare outlets closed down and having seen that they have a reasonable crowd everytime i went, its a bit surprising that the outlet is gone...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There's also a brand called Ice Cream Chefs at Siglap/kembangan there, and the young crowd they attract alomost everyday amazes me. This makes me feel that it can be done, provided the correct marketing and branding strategy is used..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok cut my crap short. So basically, in order to start a new brand, what do you guys think is of utmost importance in order to start competitively and also not to lose too much $ in the beginning so one can sustain it while the brand grows??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eg: Great product? Great marketing strategy? Brand awareness?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any contribution welcome. Cheers</p>

              <p>Hanor hanor, I don't eat ice cream in singapore, unless its durian flavour.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>If that snow ice thing came in durian flavour, I'll eat it too.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I like durian flavour only, coz all the other flavours, I can taste it even before it reaches my damn mouth.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Those common flavours out there like chocolate, vanilla, durian, hazelnut, rum and raisin, and some yogurt flavours bah...Some ok, some still experimenting..haha..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you all guys prefer any flavours can also state down lor..than i c if my mum can do anot..haha..Problem is ice cream cannot be easily transportable, so till now, only my close friends who come over my house have tasted it before..feedback is not negative..haha..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If can afford we will get a container to put these ice cream into and bring to let more people try and comment..before finalising the recipes...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i guess there r many factors need to take into consideration, like pricing, direction of business (retail or supplier), brand vision and mission..ahaha</p>

              <p>Icecream are being sold too expensive(to me), so i dont really eat them</p>
              <p>I wonder if it is possible to get the 'healthier choice' logo for icecream or not<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">, maybe add some fruits in it and says it contains the vitamin a,d,e,k, then wad b3,bsth...those water soluble and fat soluble thing</p>
              <p>flavours that are currently on the market will be chocolate, strawberries etc. If your icecream comes in this flavour, people will jsut compare</p>
              <p>so i think it is better to come out with not so common flavour:</p>
              <p>i will try will be durian, passionfruit, angmoh liulian(soursop if i am not wrong), something more asian</p>
              <p>I remember the potong icecream did came up with asian dessert dishes in icecream flavour as well.</p>

              <p>Yoz..thanks all for the feedback...yup those common flavours like chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, durian i think is a must, as most people have associate themselves with such flavours. Almost all ice cream brands have those flavours, so if they exist till today, i guess the demand is still there of course..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm thinking of some original flavours as well, so as to provide a differentiation feature. In that way, we can differentiate ourselves from other brands in the market.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i'm suggesting a feature that allows customers to make their own ice cream, by adding their own toppings and mixing flavours. It is something like ice cream chef's strategy, where customers can choose their toppings and the staff just mix the toppings into the ice cream for them. (<a href="http://www.coldrock.com">www.coldrock.com</a>)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Setting up a stall is our preferred starting point. My theme is something like coffee bean, where people can chill and eat and drink there. Preferably hiring eye candy as staff as it can definitely draw in more crowd, from the young especially..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What you all guys think? Any more ideas?? Ha</p>
