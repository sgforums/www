              <p>I think the axis power made 3 major mistakes during the war which cause them to lose the war.</p>
              <p>1. Japan made a mistake to attack China. China at that time was having internal wars between Jiang and Mao Zedong. When Japan attacked them, they put aside their differences and than unite to fight against Japan.</p>
              <p>China was also a very big country which made Japan lost alot of resources in the war.</p>
              <p>2. Germany made a mistake to attack Russia when they still have not conquer Britain. Thus they were made to fight 2 countries together and Russia was a very strong country.</p>
              <p>Moreover, Germany and Russia had already sign a treaty at that time not to attack each other</p>
              <p>3. Japan attacked America at a very wrong time.</p>
              <p>I think if the axis fought world war 2 in this way they may win the war.</p>
              <p>1. Japan, Germany and Italy to attack Britain and France. That will be 3 countries against 2 countries.</p>
              <p>As we can see from world war 2 that France was conquered by Germany, it shows that France was actually a weak country.</p>
              <p>If the 3 countries have join force to attack Britain and France, there is a high chance that they will be able to conquer the allied powers.</p>
              <p>2. Once Britain and France have been conquered, all the colonies such as Singapore, Malaysia etc will automatically surrender to the axis power.</p>
              <p>3. Once Britain and France have been conquered, the axis can than proceed to attack America using the reason that America was selling weapons to the allied forces as a reason to attack them.</p>
              <p>4. As it is 3 countries attacking America, most likely they will be able to conquer America. After that they can than proceed to attack and conquer Russia.</p>
              <p>5. Even if at this point of time, America is to join forces with Russia to fight the axis, there is still a high chances that Axis will win the war as its 3 countries fighting against 2 countries.</p>
              <p>6. Once russia and america have been conquered, the axis can than proceed to attack China.</p>
              <p>China by than will have been greatly weakened by the internal wars between Mao and Jiang.</p>
              <p>Once china knows that the whole world have been conquered by the axis, I think China will surrender without fighting at all.</p>
              <p>Than the axis will have conquered the whole world.</p>
              <p>What do you all think?</p>

              <p>the axis wouldn't have won. you are daydreaming too much...</p>
              <p>1) Hitler believed in superiority of Nazi race, the Japanese were merely his pawns in the South Asia side and he was prepared to do away with them.</p>
              <p>2) Your assumptions are weak, Britian and France are USA's strongest allies at that point of time esp Britian, USA will not let Britian fall without a fight.</p>
              <p>3) USSR was already on its guard against Germany even after they signed the treaty. The treaty was meant to give them time to fortify themselves against the Germans and intruders. If the Germans appear to be so aggressive and given the nature of the leader's paranoia, they would have moved to side with the Allies to stop the expansion of the Axis powers.</p>
              <p>4) You shld probably also check out Mussolini as Italy's dictator, he was actually quite a weak leader and Italy was more of a baggage to Germany than of help.</p>
              <p>5) The strategic location of Japan means that it's hard to render support to the 2 powers.</p>
              <p>6) Internal fractiousness was still persistent in China even during the World War 2, do not assume that the internal conflict will stop due to the war. The tussle for power was still going on even during Japanese Occupation and that was how they lost so many provinces.</p>
              <p>7) More weak assumptions from you that forces stop fighting after colonial powers fall and that China will surrender after the world is conquered. (another weak assumption that the world will be conquered by Axis) Look at Force 136, most people were local natives who rose up as gurilleas.</p>

              <p>1) Hilter will never do away with Japan. He could not even even conquer russia and britain much less conquer Japan too.</p>
              <p>2) It was a fact that USA did not participate in the war until Japan attck them. If Japan did not attack them, USA will not have join in the war even if Britain got conquer by them.</p>
              <p>As a fact, the majority of americians did not want to join the war and supported the allied forces only by selling weapons to them.</p>
              <p>3) It was also a fact that russia did not join the war despite seeing France being conquered by Germany and Britain left alone to deal with the axis.</p>
              <p>If germany did not attck russia, they will hold the same don't care attitute like the americians and not participate in the war until they get attacked.</p>
              <p>7) With their master, Britain, France and America being conqered, even if the colonies wanted to put on a fight they will be pretty much powerless to do so.</p>
              <p>Just look at Singapore, Malaysia etc. Their master Britain did not get conquered and yet they were easily conquered by Japan.</p>
              <p>Imagine if their masters got conquered, the soliders guarding these colonies who come from their Master Countries will probably forsake these colonies and all rush back to their defend their homeland and master.</p>
              <p>With the world conquered by the axis, yes china can fight if they want to.</p>
              <p>But it will be 1 weak country verus 2 superpower countries(excluding Italy if you want to claim that its a weak country)</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Edgar Snow (July 19, 1905-February 15, 1972) was an American journalist and writer. He was the first Western journalist to visit Yan'an, then the "red capital" of China.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">During his visit in 1936, he interviewed leaders of the Communist Party of China, including Chairman Mao Zedong. Snow's interviews resulted in the book Red Star over China, the first Western book to give a first-hand account of how the CPC, the Red Army and the people under the CPC's rule were struggling to defend their country against the Japanese invasion and improve their welfare.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">His reports helped the CPC win international sympathy and support during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1937-45).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">During the 1960s and 1970s, Snow visited China several times to report on its progress during a time of antagonism with and isolation from Western powers.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">His work contributed not only to the revolution and construction of the new China, but also to US people's understanding of China.</p>

              <p> Germany and Italy can also attack Britain and France while Japan focus its army to attack america so that america could not sell weapons to the allied forces.</p>
              <p>Once Germany and Italy have conquered Britain and France, they can than join forces with Japan which will be 3 countries to fight and conquer america.</p>
              <p>Once america have been conquered, the axis can than proceed on to conquer russia before finally conquering china</p>
              <p>____________________________________________</p>
              <p>Another alternative is for the axis to rope in russia to be their ally and promise russia that they will spilt the conquered countries with her.</p>
              <p>Germany, Italy and Japan will than attack and conquer Britain and France, while russia attack america.</p>
              <p>Once Germany, Italy and Japan have conquered europe, they will than join forces with russia to conquer america</p>
              <p>Once america is conquered, the 4 countries can than attack and conquer china.</p>
              <p>Once china has been conquered, than the axis can consider attacking and conquering russia and spilting russia up equally among themselves</p>

              <p>best way from my opinion is</p>
              <p>japan let the commies and KMT fight among themselves erodding their military strength will japan shall join the operation barbarossa, pincer attack with germany against russia.</p>
              <p>US will be more than happy to get rid of commies without doing anything themselves.</p>

              <p>The Axis powers did not have Gundams to help them, that's why they lost the war</p>
              <p>the allies had the Zakus to help them though</p>

              <p>read the man in the high castle by phillip k dick.</p>
              <p>anyway, all germany and japan had to do was put off attacking hawaii and the USA until they had done away with Britain and Russia.</p>
              <p>If Japan had attack East Russia along with germany simultaneously in op barbarossa they would have succeeded since most of the Russian industrial might was shifted eastwards as the germans advanced</p>
              <p>once russia is out of the way, the luftwaffe can focus on taking out the British RAF.</p>
              <p>once germany has domination of british airspace, they can start op sealion and take down britain.</p>
              <p>then they consolidate, build up their forces, and hit oz and USA</p>

              <p>If Germany,japan and italy got nuclear weapons first. They can win.</p>
              <p>If japanese 731 unit experiments suceed, they can make a super weapon of mass destruction to kill their enemies. Super biological and chemical weapon.</p>
              <p>If Germany sucessfully deploy many V2 and rocket weapons, they could have won.</p>

              <p>the axis wouldn't have won. you are daydreaming too much...</p>
              <p>1) Hitler believed in superiority of Nazi race, the Japanese were merely his pawns in the South Asia side and he was prepared to do away with them.</p>
              <p>2) Your assumptions are weak, Britian and France are USA's strongest allies at that point of time esp Britian, USA will not let Britian fall without a fight.</p>
              <p>3) USSR was already on its guard against Germany even after they signed the treaty. The treaty was meant to give them time to fortify themselves against the Germans and intruders. If the Germans appear to be so aggressive and given the nature of the leader's paranoia, they would have moved to side with the Allies to stop the expansion of the Axis powers.</p>
              <p>4) You shld probably also check out Mussolini as Italy's dictator, he was actually quite a weak leader and Italy was more of a baggage to Germany than of help.</p>
              <p>5) The strategic location of Japan means that it's hard to render support to the 2 powers.</p>
              <p>6) Internal fractiousness was still persistent in China even during the World War 2, do not assume that the internal conflict will stop due to the war. The tussle for power was still going on even during Japanese Occupation and that was how they lost so many provinces.</p>
              <p>7) More weak assumptions from you that forces stop fighting after colonial powers fall and that China will surrender after the world is conquered. (another weak assumption that the world will be conquered by Axis) Look at Force 136, most people were local natives who rose up as gurilleas.</p>

              <p><br>I favourite bit is how he thinks the only two superpowers our modern world has ever seen would somehow lose to a duo or trio of countries that couldn't even conquer an entire continent properly on their own. </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Allies</span></strong></p>
              <p>Russia spans eleven timezones, and is the single largest country on our planet.<br><br>USA had the atomic bomb.<br><br>Britain had a very united and supportive common populace who were ready to stand beside their government against the Axis powers (and horrible Blitz bombings) throughout it all.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Axis</span></strong></p>
              <p>Japan alone couldn't even put a dent in China, and conquering southwards instead to Southeast Asia simply overstretched them. <br><br>Italy barely did anything compared to Hitler's army. Notice how easily Italy surrendered when the Allies' made their counterattack ala D-day?</p>
              <p>Germany was utterly defeated before even reaching Moscow (which isn't even covering a quarter of the USSR's total landmass) thanks to the harsh weather conditions.</p>

              <p>Your all missed an very important point which lead to the defeat of Japan and end of war but I will began with this :</p>
              <p>1) United Kingdom would never lose the war even if Germany, Italy and Japan attack together because Canada was under Britain control at that time and is the second largest country after US. All the British has to do is to get resources and reinforcement from Canada and even without US help they might still win the war.</p>
              <p>2) Speaking of atomic bomb, it is important to note that because all the top scientist and brains are supporting the allies because they suffered under the axis rule especially the Germany and important people like Einstein were in US and if was his letter that led to Manhattan Project.If the Germany did not try to do silly thing to drive these talent away(most german scientist are Jew), they might still win the war.</p>
              <p>3) And speaking of brains, US has an very excellent generals like George Patton who are responsible for turning the tide against the Germany while the Germany after 1943 onwards relied on boy soldiers who brain and age are like Naruto and not surprised, they all let George Patton signed their "death certificate" , Moral of the story : Knucklehead = Dead only !</p>
