No worries.<br><br>Actually, they reason they are in the Champions League for the 02/03 season is of course due to last season's result. Ya lor, this season is really pek chek. Like u said, every big team, should do their best to perform consistently and score enuff goals to be touted as derserving Champions. No doubt abt that. Look at Man Yoo, really kudos to the players who responded wif steel determination to rally a late charge at the championship.<br><br>Arsenal are a big-time team but their backline has been inconsistent and that may just cost them the League. I do share the same sentments abt Owen and Nistelrooy... cos dun forget Owen do not have much support from his midfield to create opening for him. Most of the time, his on his own. Whereas, Nistelrooy has the services of welsh wizard Giggs, England's captain &amp; his accurate right crosses of Beckham, vision from scholes... sure can count on them for assists.<br><br>Both Cheyrou and Diouf and his compariot Diop is overated is likely due to the media's fault really. They probably need i season to get used to the frantic pace of EPL. I think Cheyrou can be a excellent asset to come. Can c he has abit touch of Zidane but he knows he need to release the ball quicker than he tght.<br><br>Nice comments from u really.

Yes, no doubt he has improved alot in his technique and freekicks but somehow I dun really fancy him. He's the sorta of player who do alot of hard running and yes, the occasionally curvy shots on the run, but ultimately he lacked flair and excellent creativity. U know, the one-twos between players, the grace and delivery wif the ball. The defence splitting pass to ur strikers. Liverpool need that kinda player... badly. Liverpool used to play alot of one-two, off the ball runs into postion... now, more hard running kinda tactics.<br><br>As fans, we still have to support the team tru thick and thin.

            <div class='col-md body'>after reading thru the forum, all i can say is that let the team do the talking on the pitch comes this wkend. Any predictions at all r jus pure speculations.<br><br>As 4 the trouble plaguing LIverpool, all i can said is u got 2 look 2 the boss n that's Gerrad Houllier. He 's the 1 who came up with the system, the tactics n the players. True it brings him wat... 5 trophies in the past seasons, but that's based on a solid defence and his side scoring at least 1 or perhaps 2 goals. But more often than not Liverpool this season has trouble scoring 1 or even another 1 after the opposition has equalize or taken a lead. Jus taken the game vs Sunderland... pure ridiculous.<br><br>For such a big club with such rich tradition of exciting, flowing football, it 's indeed a shame that they decided 2 go continental italian, but they can't defend as well as the italians nor attack with flair like the spaniards. They will do well in Europe, but given their limited options in attack. I have 2 say the quarterfinal is all they can aspired with the current mentality in the Champs League.<br><br>Lack of wingers, i beg 2 differ, isn't snicer 1 n wat abt the long 4gotten man, Berger? Of cos the ppl Houllier brings in also matter this summer. But with the current tactics in place, the quest 4 the EPL crown will jus  b a dream as Arsenal has proven that with their fluid attack, Newcastle with we -score-more-than-ya philosophy that over a long n hard season, attack is impt but not enuff, wat more can a defensive minded, relying on counter attack or more likely Owen Liverpool hope 4?</div>
