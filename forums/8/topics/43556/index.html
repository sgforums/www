            <div class='col-md body'>Henry relying on Rooney for title<br>LONDON (Reuters) - Arsenal's French striker Thierry Henry is hoping that Everton's 17-year-old Wayne Rooney can help the London club retain their premier league title.<br>The newly-crowned PFA player of the year believes the gifted England forward can help Everton beat Manchester United at Goodison Park on the final day of the season to give the Gunners a chance of overhauling the league leaders.<br><br>Arsenal trail Manchester United by five points and even if they win all three of their remaining fixtures, there is nothing they can do if Alex Ferguson's side beat Charlton at home on Saturday and Everton on May 11.<br><br>However, Henry believes that Rooney can play his part in Arsenal's championship bid.<br><br>"He has a wonderful arrogance about him and the situation or the opposition doesn't appear to worry him," Henry was quoted as saying in the media on Tuesday.<br><br>"When he plays against great defenders like Marcel Desailly, it's like he is playing in the street. It's not a lack of respect, he just wants to go out and play.<br><br>"I like that in a player and hope that the premier league race is not over yet."<br><br>Henry also admitted that although Arsenal are now second favourites for the title the club was not ready to concede defeat.<br><br>"We still have games and I'm not a guy who likes to give up. I'm also at a club that doesn't give up," he said.<br><br>"But we have put ourselves in a position where we have to look at other results to help us."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal relying on Rooney? That's pretty hilarious... they have got themselves to blame don't they. No doubt Arsenal had some great talent out there in their first eleven, they don't really have a solid reserves. If u are a big club aiming for success any where, be it it's own league or Champions League, u gotta have a solid reserves as well. Just look at Man U(I 'm a Liverpool fan btw), they have reserves who can come on and make/create chances and put em in. That's wat the game counts isn't it at the end? The 3 points. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>This season have been great foe epl fans as usual...esp the championship is down to the wire. Definitely Man yoo deserves the credit for their relentless determination to win. i admit as a pools fan, i'm impressed wif that. heck... i still hope Arsenal would clinch this one for the second time in da row. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Right noe the back four has the most fragility. Leeds is no easy meat as always and their recent resurgence is looking gd. Viduka+Kewell paring is gonna give hell to the Arsenal back 4. This match is gonna be tight. There shld be a couple of goals but Henry and co will finish them off. I agreed wif u bout the importance of Everton matchup.</div>

Has been quite pek chek too. First half of the season really looked good n fark we were the league leaders as well for some time. Then piles of bad results start coming. One surprising thing to note is that Owen still manage to score this season's tally of 28 goals despite he had a long spell w/o a sniff at goal.<br><br>No doubt the midfield area are a hardworking lot, they r still not quite creative enuff. Hope to c some real good wingers coming in the next season.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

A close to 30 goal season is pretty fruitful for a premier league striker. It seems England strikers like to get criticise becuz they can't get England to perform (like Alan Shearer)---&gt; kao he voted premiership player of the decade and people was criticizing him like he can't play footie 4 nuts! And if u compare owen with van nistroy ... his output missed out on the amount of penalties which Mr Van.N takes ! So wat's the biggie deal of van Nistroy ?<br><br>And yes ... mabbe its juz Gerard Houllier ... there's pple like Patrick Berger ( I remember his devastating long shots) not utilized at all in this campaign ...<br>And and sorrie to criticize ur team again, i think the Bruno Cheyrou and wat's his name El Hajli Diouf reallie not worth the cost at which they are brought at ... a bit overrated .. .both !<br></div>

Not at all. No worries.<br><br>Actually, they reason they are in the Champions League for the 02/03 season is of course due to last season's result. Ya lor, this season is really pek chek. Like u said, every big team, should do their best to perform consistently and score enuff goals to be touted as derserving Champions. No doubt abt that. Look at Man Yoo, really kudos to the players who responded wif steel determination to rally a late charge at the championship.<br><br>Arsenal are a big-time team but their backline has been inconsistent and that may just cost them the League. I do share the same sentments abt Owen and Nistelrooy... cos dun forget Owen do not have much support from his midfield to create opening for him. Most of the time, his on his own. Whereas, Nistelrooy has the services of welsh wizard Giggs, England's captain &amp; his accurate right crosses of Beckham, vision from scholes... sure can count on them for assists.<br><br>Both Cheyrou and Diouf and his compariot Diop is overated is likely due to the media's fault really. They probably need i season to get used to the frantic pace of EPL. I think Cheyrou can be a excellent asset to come. Can c he has abit touch of Zidane but he knows he need to release the ball quicker than he tght.<br><br>Nice comments from u really. It's frank.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
