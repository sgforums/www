If the tooth is real, that confirms his own findings as to what the creature is.<br><br>"The discovery of the deer remains comes as no surprise to me," he said. "When I traveled to Loch Ness last December, I discovered a slide trail (tracks) that were entirely consistent with my theories on the identity of the monster. The bite pattern on the deer carcass reflects that of a particular species documented in both fresh and salt water systems around the globe.<br><br>"The discovery of the shed relic (tooth) however is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and it is extremely important that we recover it as quickly as possible as the DNA would prove my theory. We could be on the cusp of a great discovery and the fact that local authorities in the Scottish Highlands are refusing to cooperate with this investigation is reprehensible," he added.<br><br>According to accounts from the two students and the Scottish local who took them on a boat tour, the tooth, along with a video tape and two rolls of film were confiscated by a water bailiff shortly after the students pried the tooth loose from the half eaten deer carcass. Because of a contractual agreement with author Steve Alten, who included his hypothesis in a book (“The Loch)” on the subject, McDonald could not elaborate on the monster's identity until after July 15th.<br><br>However he did want to comment on recent speculation that the tooth could simply be the broken tip of an antler. "I can categorically eliminate the notion that the purported tooth is a Cervid/Capreoline deer antler or any animal's claw," he said. "It is neither a young spike nor a bony deciduous antler and in no way resembles the texture of broken, cast, or otherwise shed antler tissue. I've hunted deer with my father throughout my childhood. I know them well. While I can’t verify anything until I examine the tooth, I can say with assurance that we are not looking at a claw or antler.”<br><br>McDonald and the two students have offered a $5,000 reward for any information leading to the recover of the tooth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Loch Ness plesiosaur<br><br>A series of plesiosaur vertebrae have been found on the shore of Loch Ness. This hss been hailed by some monster hunters as 'proof' of the existence of a living plesiosaur in the Loch.<br>So what do we know about this find?<br><br>Firstly, although it has been confirmed as plesiosaurian by staff of the National Museums of Scotland (NMS), it contributes nothing to the debate over the existence of a monster in Loch Ness. The bones are millions of years old, and Loch Ness is (in geological terms at least) very recent - only 12,000 years old or so, being a glacially excavated trough.<br><br>Secondly, it didn't originate in the loch. As the NMS staff, and also Matt Dale of 'Mr Wood's Fossils' in Edinburgh, spotted, its general appearance, and the presence of holes made by burrowing sponges, show that it has spent some time in the sea, probably as a beach pebble on a coastal outcrop such as the Jurassic of the Moray Firth coast, or somewhere further afield. Yet Loch Ness is fresh water.<br><br>I have not had the chance to examine the specimen myself, and have to rely on the photographs published in the popular press (all of which show the specimen upside-down, by the way). It is an articulated series of what look like dorsal or very worn cervical vertebrae. The zygapophyses seem rather low and flat, and the rims of the articular faces rather rounded. The specimen is heavily water-worn, and a lot of surface detail appears to have been lost.<br><br>If there is any mystery about the specimen, it is how it ended up in Loch Ness. Natural transport as a glacial erratic is unlikely given the distribution of the nearest Jurassic strata, say the NMS staff, who have been diplomatically noncommittal about how it got there.<br><br>A deliberate hoax has been suggested by several people in the media. There is indeed a long history of hoaxes associated with the Loch Ness 'monster' phenomenon, and some perpetrator may well have been willing to waste money possibly to no effect. Finds of plesiosaur bones are not very common, and it would need someone who knew something about vertebrate palaeontology to recognise them as such at the first finding and, after the specimen was put in Loch Ness, to take the risk that nobody would find it. There is no suggestion at all that Mr McSorley was knowingly involved in any such deception. Indeed, the newspaper reports quote him as cleaning off 'about an inch of green algae' which suggests that it had been lying in the water of the loch for some time. It was, moreover, sheer luck that Mr McSorley happened to find it when a Dutch tourist, who knew his fossils, was standing by. It would be possible to buy such fossils - I'd guess a specimen of this kind could sell for a couple of hundred pounds. This would make it a rather expensive, and very shallow, deception.<br><br>However, a credible alternative is that the fossil was used as a demo piece for tour groups to show what real plesiosaur bones look like, and was left behind by accident one day. This has actually happened before, in the case of a plesiosaurian limb bone in the 1980s.<br><br>It will be interesting to watch the story develop.</div>
