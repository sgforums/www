              Hi, I would like to seek some valuable advice in a coin which I was thinking of purchasing. It's the Edward VII Year 1903 ONE-DOLLAR coin from the Strait Settlement period.
              
              The dealer has quoted me a 3-digit price (which I think is very overpriced) for the coin for the following reasons he highlighted:
              
              1) 1903 is the very first dollar coin of Singapore. It's even earlier than the Lion dollar coin in from the 60s to 80s.
              
              2) It is also the very first coin of its own dollar series. There're other years like 1904, 1907, 1908...etc. but their silver content is only 50%. He told me the 1903 is 90% silver.
              
              I looked around the glass table display. True enough. The coins from 1904 onwards is all in the $40 - $80 range. But all the coins (including 1903 the face is still the same).
              
              Don't wish to pay more money just for the numbers, so I want to verify if what he said is true.
              
              Thanks in advance!!

              haha, you think there's certificate of authenticity for everything? :lol:
              
              in numismatics, there's PCGS or NCS gradings.... that would meant more money. 
              
              I've never seen gradings for Straits Settlement coins, which is like making a nice &amp; expensive maple woodcase for a cheap egg.
              
              If it's a Saint Gaudens coin (those pre-1933 US gold coins), I will definitely ask for PCGS!

              <p>Hey cyberr1981, nice to meet another gold bug in Singapore. I guess few people understand the fundamentals behind the accumulation of gold and silver, and it is quickly becoming apparent that these two are the only way out given the massive debasement of currency that is going on as well as the unwinding of the trade and debt in America. Sadly, most Americans do not understand the difference between money and gold, and fear holding gold because they are afraid that the government would confiscate the gold in the worst case scenario anyway. One really needs to visit Zimbabwe to understand the meaning of a 100 trillion dollar note that buys u nothing.</p>
              <p>The American Golden Eagle is already scarce, whats the point of having a gold spot price of USD900 when the actual status of bullion is more like SOLD OUT. As well as all those commodity speculators suppressing the price of gold and unable to fulfil physical delivery. Once there is a shortage, and when I say shortage, I mean delay in physical delivery, all those people holding paper gold will suffer. And the second wave, the larger wave, escaping the debased US dollar would push up prices even higher. I believe in a true spot price of USD5000 at the end of the day. Care to guide me around the gold scene in Singapore?</p>
