              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dear Sir/Mdm,</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I visited M1 Shop Causeway Point last Friday, 14th of November, around lunch time and was attended by Mr Kenny Foo. I would like to compliment on his service attitude, not only towards me but also towards the old Indian lady that he was attending before me.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Although she was not going to be a customer at the shop and was trying to sell her phone, he exercised patience while attending to her although I was waiting to be served. I find this service attitude admirable and should be commented.  Although it is his responsibility in attending to every patrons in the shop but it is rather rare to see good service in this industry. I hope to see this type of service attitude during my next visit although I had bad experiences at M1 before.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I appreciate your time in reading this email and I hope that your company would express my appreciation for his service attitude while I was in the shop on my behalf.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Regards,<br>Caleb</span></p>

              <p>i actually feel that way, i'm in retail myself and unless the customer is rude i do feel good service is ç�†æ‰€å½“ç„¶, after all i am getting paid for it.</p>
              <p>as for bad service i don't go back again, not much point complaining since most companies only pay lip service to what they reply.</p>
