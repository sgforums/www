            <div class='col-md body'>i read somewhere that you can actually tell from your dreams if your mind is healthy or not. when you have nightmares, do you often get beaten up by monsters? if u do then it means you have a weak mind because your mind isn't strong enough to fight back. but, when you attack the monsters in your nightmares it shows that you have a strong mind and that your fear hasn't defeated you yet. when one day you realize that you keep dying or getting killed in your dreams, then you know that you have either low self-esteem, depression, or are extremely stressed until your mind cannot find the strength to fight back the monsters in ur nightmares...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>was your hand numb because the way u sleep ur body press on it and block the blood flow?<br>sometimes my hand goes numb, cant move at all when i was sleeping(but not dreaming), i just woke up and found my hand cannot move at all. bcos i sleep side way and someone press one of my hand until blood cannot flow, so it goes numb. If ur hand is numb and u are dreaming, in your dream, your hand may not be able to move too.<br><br>i have often have similar dreams, in fact all my dreams have something in common. In my dream there is not day or night, the sky is always grey, i cant tell it was day or night in my dream. And i often dream myself running, i cant remember i was running away from something or i and rushing to reach some place that i have to go. The way i run is very weird, it's like the gravity is very low. I can leap forward very far, land on the ground and lead another step, but the speed wasnt fast, it's like everytime i leap forward, i "float" forward slowly.</div>
