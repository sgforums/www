Perhaps a contraption that hooks on two poles and with two wires hooked up to a circuit. When water drips onto a little compartment containing the two wires, electricity current flows through the water and thus a closed circuit is made, this activates the beeper. So I have said too much and this idea is now copyrighted to me neh ni neh ni boo boo.<br><br>------------------<br>Honesty is the Worst policy when taking an exam in CME</div>
