            <div class='col-md body'>Sadly i must say this is a result of living in Singapore.<br>Do something good and they reward you. Do something bad and they punish you. Children of singapore grow up with the mentality of doing something for something.<br><br>There isn't anything much people would do selflessly for others anymore. One of the factors here.<br><br>Secondly is ranking. Heard of the term BEST FRIEND?<br>In my opinion, nobody have best friends. No seriously. Nobody have best friends and this shouldn't be only my own opinion. It has to be taught to everyone. I do my best to preach.<br><br>You see a person can have many friends. By defining someone your best friends you are putting pressure on that friend(his best friend is someone else). Or you might be hurting someone whom you deem as a best friend. You see if a person isn't an enemy, he is only a neighbour/colleague/classmate. Most people classify these people as friends. Which is wrong.<br><br>If you had a friend under which should belong to that category instead, you would soon realise that a babe/dood will be the key to souring your friendships, supposingly the two of you fell for her/him. In essence, it is no longer a healthy competition. Inside your heart you are secretly rooting out for yourself and cursing your 'friend' to be doomed to failure. The essence here isn't friendship but more like a war.<br><br>Another example is if your friend keeps bringing up something to smear your reputation/make you really really angry but is always friendly to you. That friend is probably jealous of something you did or have that he didn't and can never posess. While he/she is friendly to you, he/she is secretly hoping to bring you down to his/her level so you two can be truly equal to be friends. The essence here is jealousy, not friendship.<br><br>Finally one last example(Real life example happened to me<strong>names and timeline are changed to protect the identity of the guy who left me to die</strong>). 2 friends who go back a long way. Around 30 years of friendship. One day FriendA likes this girl who happened to be FriendB's ex. FriendA have been doing silly things to get his ex back with him but to no avail. One day they were at the beach with a group of friends. FriendA had both legs cramped badly from the waist down and shouted for help. FriendB was quick to tell everyone that A is acting hoping to attract his ex's attention. Making sure he is loud enough to let everyone hear this, including A's ex. A's ex was so disgusted she walked off. Other friends were convinced and didn't help.<br><br>FriendA only made it back alive by transfering every ounce of hate and anger he had into survival instincts. Thus my signature in this forum. After that everyone that is a friend to me i regard as friends. Others i am quick to end my friendship with. People tell me i am harsh to end a long friendship just like that. I think i have become wise and do not want to waste time with enemies by my side.<br><br>It doesn't matter how far back the friendship ran. It is the essence of the friendships that matters. If the essence of friendship is no longer there, even if we ran 10000 years back, i can end it right there and then.<br><br>It isn't fragile. It isn't being harsh or mean. I am always true to those whom i treat as my friends. I go out of my way to help them with what i can. There are something which you can forgive but sometimes alot of things are not meant to be forgotten and forgiven. If a friend watch you die without offering help he can do everything in the world to ask your forgiveness but from that moment on he can never be your friend again ever. Friendships should be made after a long time of getting to know the person. When it turns sour, you have to judge the situation and decide if you want to salvage the situation.<br><br>This isn't about forgiveness. I can only say if your friend leave you to die and you forgive him just because you two go far back you are an idiot. It isn't about how long the friendship runs back. It's about if there is any essence of friendship in there. I can NOT know anything of a dood i met just 1 week ago but i can trust him. That is friendship. If a friend is jealous of me and upgrade himself to compete against me instead of tearing me down by making rumours or hurting my self esteem that is friendship(takes alot of experiences to know the wisdom in this). If a friend scolds and insults me to fire up my anger in the hope that anger is better then despair, instead of saying oh poor you, let me know if you need help in anyway when they know they can never help you in any way. That is friendship.<br><br>Wisdom is gained through experiences in life, my dear.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That day i had a argument with my best frn. She made me so pissed off because although she could no longer argue her way through she continued ranting on. It amused me to see the way she insisted she was right even though the whole world knew she was wrong. Stubborn ox. I had given in to her many times but this time i thought over and decided to stop contacting her. To my surprise, this best friend who was the most most most stubborn person in the world actually sort of called and asked me for a movie with another friend. This was her way of giving in. I was touched becos i thought this friendship was gone case as i did not expect she give in and i knew this time i would not.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

So they treasure the chance of first meeting. For us who living in the mordern age. It's very easy to contact everyone. You lose a fren, you find a new one easily. You break with your bf/gf, just call her and try to patch back if you want. Or you just go out and find someone else. In the ancient time, the chance the you meet new ppl are more slim than the in mordern time, so they treasure relationship with the ppl they already know.<br></div></blockquote>That's an interesting insight.

Well I think friends that give you good times in your life are as impt as those who help you to get by the bad times.<br><br>Not everyone is brave or understanding or generous or considerate. All of us want our friends to be perfect this way, and get bitterly upset when they fail to be as generous or as understanding as we expect. Who doesn't want heroes for friends? Someone who would stand by you despite fear, who would fight for you despite lack of aptitude?? But we don't live in a Hollywood world - looking at our own imperfections, who are we to demand a friendship like this? Are you able to give a friendship this way?
