            <div class='col-md body'>I know this is pretty old 'news'... but its pretty cute<br><br>by SheikCockman<br><br>In the upcoming Roy Keane autobiography, the former Irish captain has forgotten to mince his words, and instead, has sunk his teeth into everyone. More surprisingly, he has even chosen to spit his vitriol at one of our local stars, Indra Shadan Mahmud.<br><br>Talkingcock.com is privileged to announce an exclusive excerpt from his upcoming autobiography, in which he has nothing complimentary to say about our local footballing hero.<br><br>For the uninitiated, Roy Keane was in Singapore recently for Manchester United's Far Eastern Tour. Actually we at Talkingcock.com are not too sure about this fact, but we hope our readers are stupid enough to ignore this and carry on.<br><br>"I saw that w**ker staring at me from the start.", Roy Keane bleats in his book. "So I says to myself, I'm gonna beat the s**t out of that f**king w**ker. I'm Roy Keane u know. I am the best footballer in the world. I won the European Cup, what the hell has he won? The f**king Tiger Cup???"<br><br>"We were playing at their National Stadium. What a f**king disgrace. No whiskey in the toilets at all! How do they expect me to perform in these appalling conditions? F**king Singaporeans. And then when we went out to meet the players, that f**k face said, Hi I'm Indra Shadick, some f**king thing like that."<br><br>"That was it; I had never been so insulted in my life. I swore that I would kick that b**tard in the bollocks the first chance I got. But Fergie told me to give f**kers like Phil Neville a chance to play for once, and I joined him in the bar. Next time however, I will give than Indra b**tard something to remember."<br><br>When Talkingcock.com pressed Roy Keane about these latest comments, 'Keano' as he is more commonly known, punched our reporter in the face. Sir Alex Ferguson has claimed that 'Keano' was just being himself.<br><br>Watch this space.</div>
