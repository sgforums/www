He was best known as The Crocodile Hunter, which was the name of the unconventional nature documentary series on television he hosted, assisted by his American-born wife, Terri Irwin. His larger-than-life persona and seemingly outrageous antics (including the close handling of both common and rare species of wildlife and, perhaps most famously, the capture of live crocodiles and other reptiles on-screen) were key features in the presentation, which provided a forum for educational information about wildlife conservation and conflicts with humans in various parts of the world. The program made the Irwins into television personalities on several continents.</span><br>______________________________________________________________<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: blue;">D</span>eath <span style="color: blue;">O</span>f <span style="color: blue;">S</span>teve <span style="color: blue;">I</span>rwin</strong></span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">On September 4, 2006, shortly after 11:00 a.m. local time, Irwin was killed in a marine accident while filming an underwater documentary in the Batt Reef off the Low Isles near Port Douglas, north of Cairns, Queensland, Australia. It is believed that a stingray barb penetrated his heart, causing a fatal wound, though this has yet to be confirmed by Australian officials. Ironically, it has been reported that his new documentary was aimed at demystifying the stingray.</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">The Queensland Police Service issued a statement saying Mr. Irwin collapsed after being stung at Batt Reef, Low Isles off Port Douglas about 11am. He had been filming a documentary. Source AAP and SMH.com.au Sydney Morning Herald &amp; AAP. Steve Irwin killed by stingray. Sydney Morning Herald, AAP.
