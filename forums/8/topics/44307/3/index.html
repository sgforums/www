            <div class='col-md body'>Uuh...  The joss stick does signify several things pending on the type of religion you follow, and how much you intend to know about it.<br><br>In Buddhism, the joss stick is to signify fragrance and the awakening of the mind.  Now, several sects of Buddhism will have slightly different interpretations of the joss stick.  But the trend has been to make the air fragrant.<br><br>If I'm not wrong, there are religions (stop me if I'm wrong, but I think it's Taoism) that believe that the spirit lives on joss sticks.  A joss stick is an offering to sustain the separted spirit.  Logically speaking, if the departed knew more people, the more joss stick would be burnet and offered.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

Buddhists have waged war in Japan and China with their warrior monks.  And so has Taosim in their own ways.  But I think they've bene more internal unlike Christians (and Muslims) in their crusades.<br><br>About Chritians being more hardcore, you'll like to know that all religions have their hardcore fans.  It's just the way you handle them that matters.  You just have to stick to your beliefs and principles, and you won't be influenced no matter how hard they try.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

There are hardcore or extreme so called christians who resort to violence like in Ireland. But the bible teaches christians to be  meek, to be like the Lamb Of God, Jesus, silent even when brought to slaughter. We are also taught not to take revenge becos vengeance belongs to the Lord. We  are also taught to submit to authority so thats why I done my NS, obey the law and would fight for the country if needed. We  are not taught to be like terrorists where they proclaimed their acts are bringing glory to God because my GOd is far too powerful and loving to need to do such things for His own purpose.<br><br>I dun think christianity is hardcore but instead we have found someone worthy of our belief, someone real in our lives not someone we imagine to. The fact is that every major religion in this world has its extremists (christians, muslims, buddhists etc) We are faithful to Him and since in the bible, He said I came to seek and to save the lost because He love us, why should you think christians, His followers, would do otherwise. Afterall the bible is recognized worldwide as a book of love isnt it.<br><br>God bless.</div>

Wun buddhists or muslims posibly do the same? Just because we are more faithful to God, we get targetted?<br><br>Thirdly, God exhort us to be wise like a serpent and meek like a dove. We have to discern. If today the situation comes to a point where big countries like USA, France or whatever rally to destroy ISLAM or BUDDHISM forever, which is unfair to human rights, would that then be right for a person to fight for his religion then?</div>

I'm a Buddhist, but I follow an ol' Israeli saying...<br><br>"It's good to die for your country, but it's better to have a country to die for."<br><br>That's subjective of course depending on how big or which part of a picture you'd like to view this situation.<br><br>But do realise that, firstly, religions are more appealing because you tend to be exposed to them first and more significantly than things like National Education.  Secondly, religions trancends borders.  You may be an South African and I a Singaporean but we're brothers 'cause we both follow the way of the Cross.

            <div class='col-md body'>for the sake of discussion... suppose your family is christian and someone passed away... and for some reasons one of them is not a christian... in a normal christian funeral, we'll pray, we'll sing and we'll have eulogy in remembrance... a non-christian will usually sit through and not make any fuss about it... similiar situation?<br><br>i think maybe the cousin was just not being tactful about it..<br><br>i am a christian.. when my dad and my grandma passed away.. i was present at the funeral... i held joss sticks, i walked through the prayers.. but that doesn't mean i believed in the rituals that we were going thru.. i did it out of responsibility and respect.. but my mum and relatives knew that i am a christian.. and she respected me for not doing certain things.. it's all a matter of being understanding and practising tolerance...<br><br>like certain points that were brought.. if you do for the sake of doing, then where lies the meaning? and if there is no meaning in your action, then what harm is there to your beliefs? after all that is done, you must know who you put your spiritual dependance on and what you think is worth doing in life..<br><br>yet another point was that, do no wait till it's too late to show love to your loved ones.. cherish and appreciate when they are still around.. a moment of ritual cannot replace what u are able to do for them in their lifetime...</div>

That's what joss sticks are for in Buddhism especially the making the air smell sweet bit.  The fragrance of joss sticks complemented flowers (which also produe fragrance in te air) at the altar table.  Flowers, however, signified the impermanence of life.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>
