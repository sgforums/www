            <div class='col-md body'>Just wan to know the reason behind it. My grandpa passed away last week and at his wake, 2 of my cousins say they are Christians n cannot take joss sticks. I must say I'm pretty pissed about it. What is so wrong in just taking the joss stick n paying your last respect to your own grandfather whom without him, u wouldn't even be here today! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> Didn't make a scene confronting them at the funeral but it really irks me the kind of disrespect that they are showing. A fren of mine(muslim) who came to the funeral had no second thoughts offering joss stick and my grandpa's own grand-daughters refuse! what kind of teachings are these christians preaching?! I'm really pissed off!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I understand your frustrations about this matter because I was chased out of the house 10 years ago precisely of this matter. Now i am back in my house with my parents and relatives understanding of why I did not offer joss sticks to my grandma.<br><br>I was my grandma favorite grandson (makes me a greater sinner, you must think.). 10 years ago on Ching Ming, my mother wanted me to offer joss  sticks to my grandma whom passed away when I was 10 years old. I refused to stating that while I love my grandma, i dun believe that offering joss sticks is needed to show my love and that i believe its not right to just blindly follow tradtion.<br><br>That was the final straw for my parents. I was a 6 month old christian then. They called up all my relatives and they came to my house scolding me and finally it resulted in my mum taking my bibles out and burnt them away in front of me and labelling me a black sheep.  I felt very hurt because do they think they love my grandma more than I do? I love my grandma more than I loved anyone else. I told them right in front, I said exactly the same things in Mandarin "If 2nd aunt (she was very unfillial to my grandparents while grandma is alive) and me were to stand before ah ma's altar. I do not carry joss-sticks and 2nd aunt carried. ANd if ah ma was to appear, you all can ask her, who love her more, me without the joss-sticks or her with the joss-sticks."<br><br>My relatives were dumbstruck cos they knew I do love my grandma alot but I wanted to tell them that my love and respect  for her cant be expressed thru 3 joss sticks. To say that I  am unfillial because of 3 joss-sticks is a total insult to my grandma and my love for her. I think they understood me, because my grandpa stood out  and say that I am right and my parents should not pursue the matter any more.<br><br>I am still the only christian in my whole family, but I am glad I put across a point to them that I do not believe in doing things for people to see after they die, I rather do things for them while they are still alive.<br><br>Hope you understand but I am cool if you do not.<br><br>God bless.</div>

However, when u say that u "believe its not right to just blindly follow tradtion." My thought is that "it is not right to just blindly follow religion". This is wat cases Jihad nonsense.<br><br>Forgive me if I sound nasty. I would like  to find out WHY this religion enforces such a rule. Is it to show that they are the "supreme" religion n they show no respect to the other religions? Is it that they dun "believe" in the other religions other than themselves? Are they afraid of being burned by fire or choked by the smoke?<br><br>I mean I can understand things like "thou shall not steal/kill" or watsoever cos it make sense to me. But not to touch other religion things? Whats the logic behind it? In my personal opinion, its jus project to me an image that I'm stuck-up, I'm always rite, I'm the only one that matters. Forgive me if any Christians are offended, but prove me otherwise.</div>

However, when u say that u "believe its not right to just blindly follow tradtion." My thought is that "it is not right to just blindly follow religion". This is wat cases Jihad nonsense.<br><br>Forgive me if I sound nasty. I would like  to find out WHY this religion enforces such a rule. Is it to show that they are the "supreme" religion n they show no respect to the other religions? Is it that they dun "believe" in the other religions other than themselves? Are they afraid of being burned by fire or choked by the smoke?<br><br>I mean I can understand things like "thou shall not steal/kill" or watsoever cos it make sense to me. But not to touch other religion things? Whats the logic behind it? In my personal opinion, its jus project to me an image that I'm stuck-up, I'm always rite, I'm the only one that matters. Forgive me if any Christians are offended, but prove me otherwise.</div></blockquote>ok, lets clear some things up.<br>firstly, the 10 commandments states that<br>'thou shall have no other God's before me'<br>'thou shall no bow down before any other God'<br><br>so obviously, when you pay your respects, in this case burning joss sticks and bowing down before the alter, you are bowing down before someone and this is not right, as you cannot pray/worship/etc anyone else. (bowing down to a teacher is different, before you retort. why because you do not worship not treat your teacher as a higher power but someone who is older and more knowledgable than you)<br><br>a christian can certainly pay their last respects, going to the funeral ? or even walking past the coffin?<br><br>i hope that this answers your questions about christians not touching other peoples religion.</div>
