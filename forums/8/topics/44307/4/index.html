Is that against there beliefs?</div></blockquote>In Christianity, there isn't a teaching or rule that christians are not allowed to hold joss sticks whatsoever. In your case I don't feel that your cousins are showing disrespect. Yes, it is the chinese tradition that one pay respect to his past family members but you need to realise that your cousins have a belief of their own. The reason they chose not to hold a joss stick is of one-self belief and practice. I think you should respect them on your part. Showing respect does not consistutes to holding and praying to the dead. True respect is in the heart of pure reverence.<br>I remember the time when I went to visit my relative's grave with my family. My dad was understanding and told me that I can pay my respect without holding joss sticks if I wanted to. I'm glad that he was understanding and sensitive towards me.<br>Imagine this : you're a vegetarian and your grandparents invite you to their birthday feast which meat and vegetables are served. Being a vegetarian and a good grandson, you attended the feast with a cheerful heart. However, I'm very certain that you will appreciate if they can respect your belief and not force a piece of meat down your throat. This same principle applies to the former situation.</div>

God has gave us freedom to choose, 'Let those who have ears, listen." He came to give love and life, but He knows there are people whose hearts are hardened. Maybe you are confused by hardcore and faithful. But thats fine with me.<br><br>God will bring you back someday cos He loves you and will let you know He is beyond religion, He is beyond our understanding and He is beyond our human logic, He just wans to have a relationship with you.<br><br>God bless.</div>

Holding a joss tick or not is superficial and not important, in this case it is the right intentions that matter. i hope you get what I am trying to drive at. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
