Dun think its so troublesome lah.<br>After all whenever anyone has to alight he has to open the door for them.Maybe if they could link the mechanism for opening doors with switching modes....maybe....</div>

It's said in the papers.<br>So much is said about the good things about the technology, but it will only be certified when it come to actual implementation.<br>just to mention about an example, the TV Mobile thingy, they actualli conducted trials on a few buses plying through Orchard Road as early as 1999 (I saw them at that time so I knew). Thought they should have cleared the problems but see what happened? screechy sounds ans disturbing squeks. Worse still, some are not loud enough, macam like for ants to listen, even more irritating than if it was of the right volume.<br>Their explaination? "teething problems are bound to happen in new technology" --somebody in SBS. What this? if you are thinking this way, obviously problems will occur, and it did occurred. Trust them to have boasted so much about the thing that time... phui!<br><br>------------------<br>Better be sure what you want to do, and do your best once you know what you want to do... ...</div>
