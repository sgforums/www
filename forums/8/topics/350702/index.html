              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SAF doc dead in Melbourne<br>Body under s bridge; he was absent without leave from SAF from Oct</span></strong></p>
              <p>A 27-YEAR-OLD Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) doctor, absent without official leave since last October, has been found dead in Melbourne.</p>
              <p>The body of Captain (Dr) Allan Ooi was found under the Westgate Bridge in the south Australian city on Tuesday, police from the state of Victoria told The Straits Times.</p>
              <p>The 2,600m long bridge across the Yarra River is a vital link between the city centre and Melbourne's western suburbs.</p>
              <p>A police spokesman there said the young man was seen getting out of his car on the bridge before 4am that day, and that the police did not believe anyone else was involved in the incident.</p>
              <p>She added that witnesses were still being interviewed and that a report was being prepared for the Coroner's Court.</p>
              <p>Capt (Dr) Ooi had not been to work since last October and the SAF had been trying - unsuccessfully - to get in touch with him, said Mindef spokesman Colonel Darius Lim.</p>
              <p>Capt (Dr) Ooi was believed to have been in Melbourne all this while, though it is not known where in the city he was, nor with whom he was staying.</p>
              <p>In a statement issued to The Straits Times from Melbourne, his brother Adrian said: 'He was a gifted doctor and a kind and respected friend. But to us, he was and always will be our beloved son and brother.'</p>
              <p>It is unclear when the family will be returning home with the body, but Adrian said the family hoped to 'celebrate Allan's 27 years of achievements and life with us with very fond memories of a remarkable person'.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">An all-rounder, go-getter</span></strong></p>
              <p>AN ALL-ROUNDER who excelled at everything, the death of Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) doctor Allan Ooi shocked all who knew him.</p>
              <p>The 28-year-old was found dead below a busy bridge in Melbourne on Tuesday. He had disappeared for months, including having gone AWOL (absent without official leave) from the army since October last year. The SAF had tried unsuccessfully to contact him, according to a spokesman.</p>
              <p>A friend who went to medical school with Capt Ooi, speaking to The New Paper on condition of anonymity, said that Capt Ooi was the 'most brilliant' person he knew and 'excelled at everything he put his mind to'.</p>
              <p>He recalled that Capt Ooi picked up the popular game 'Warcraft' really quickly, and in a short time, became one of the top 10 Warcraft players in Singapore and was among the top 100 in the world. The friend added that, unlike most medical school students he knew, Capt Ooi had a 'rich life' outside of school. 'He was a sportsman - he swam competitively, and was an excellent pool player. He was also really funny, with a great sense of humour,' the friend added.</p>
              <p>An alumnus of Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) and Anglo-Chinese Junior College, Capt Ooi was a school water polo player and swimmer. TNP reported that he was a go-getter who also took part in pageants such as the International Man Singapore pageant where he was crowned Mr Continents in 2001, and the Mr Singapore pageant, which he won the same year.</p>
              <p>Capt Ooi also emerged near the top of his cohort in Officer Cadet School and then Medical Officers Cadet Corps.</p>
              <p>It is believed that Capt Ooi had suddenly left home and flown to Melbourne, but it is not known who he had been living with there.</p>
              <p>A family friend, who declined to be named, said it was known that Capt Ooi had been unhappy at work 'for a long time'. He had been serving his bond with the SAF and left friends and family bewildered when he left without a word. It is not known how many years of his bond he had served.</p>
              <p>Melbourne police are still speaking to witnesses and are preparing a report that will be sent to the Melbourne Coroner's Court, TNP reported. A spokesman for the Melbourne police said Capt Ooi was seen getting out of his car on the bridge before 4am on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>'Allan had a magnetic personality and loved his family deeply,' said a friend. A poignant statement, as his family is in Melbourne, making arrangements for his body to be flown back to Singapore.</p>
