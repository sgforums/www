              <p>idiotic girl. Do u know how much work, planning and foresight we need to have to be as officers? while recruits are resting in their bunks, we have to work for planning of the next day.</p>
              <p>i was only 19 when i was an officer. And i let u know i dont need to DIY or Go geylang or stopped from booking out.  I had a steady gf and we had great sex. Ok?</p>
              <p>We Lts dont have to stay in . Only recruits, corporals, sergeants need to.</p>
              <p>and for the last time, paste some frigging tape over your mouth or if its itchy go and blow some guy.</p>

              <p>To get full LT, u need to attend courses and it also depends on yr unit if its a high profile one like Armour, guards and Infantry, u will get promoted to LT if u had done things like ATEC or exercises.</p>
              <p>I was stuck at 2LT cos i was in BMTC Tekong taking care of recruits and later on i had an injury which prevented me from going to those courses.</p>

              <p>To get full LT, u need to attend courses and it also depends on
              yr unit if its a high profile one like Armour, guards and Infantry,
              u will get promoted to LT if u had done things like ATEC or
              exercises.</p>
              <p>I was stuck at 2LT cos i was in BMTC Tekong taking care of

              <p>Wasted his life... tsk tsk .. such good potential only to allow himself to be trapped in that captivity of negativity that he couldve strived to bring about change and be the pioneers to a greater revolution not just for himself but those around and the very system that he claims is preventing him from doing so.</p>
              <p>Maybe to him , suicide will bring about the change or problems to light. But dying a martyrs death as opposed to taking ur own life without actually trying to bring about the change, is just a bit stupid i must say.</p>
              <p>Maybe its true, how nowadays they say we just cant handle the stress n all that stuff due to the good life. We all want that freedom. That life.</p>

              <p>No one with half an ounce of brain would ever kill himself just because he was unhappy at work. It just proves the level of his intelligence and mental strength.

              <p>Dont make flawed viewpoints. he got into the service because in this country, there is a narrow minded meritocratic perception that r highly educated people are perfect. Most highly educated people i  know do not have a high level of emotional intelligence as compared to the ordinary joe on the street who went through hardships. If u put a scholar and a tribesman in arainforest, and teach them both survival skills. Scholar will use IQ but will lose out due to a mental breakdown. The tribesman will use emotional intelligence to get out of the mess. EQ is what keeps people going. EQ is either in born or is learnt through experiences. IQ is a inborn trait.</p>
              <p>I can remember reading a story in these forum years ago about a scholar and an uneducated man trapped in a maze.</p>
