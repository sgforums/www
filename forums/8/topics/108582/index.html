            <div class='col-md body'>The scene: a club in London's West End used to welcoming showbusiness types and footballers. The cast: marketing experts, shareholders out to make a quick buck, plus a smattering of Russian hostesses known as the "Nikita" girls.<br><br>Oh, and one rather diminutive general, a hero of the Soviet military, dressed in full military regalia, sipping vodka and fascinating all and sundry with the story of how he invented the most famous rifle of all time.<br><br>But General Mikhail Kalashnikov, 83, was not in town last night to discuss the AK-47, weapon of choice for terrorists, gangsters and revolutionaries across the globe.<br><br>In one of the most bizarre, and some might suggest tasteless, of marketing exercises, Gen Kalashnikov is lending his famous name to a brand of vodka, which is officially launched today.<br><br>The general claims he wants his name to be linked to something not connected with violence.<br><br>Kalashnikov Vodka is the brainchild of British entrepreneur John Florey, who got the idea of approaching the general while representing the Russian chess grandmaster Gary Kasparov.<br><br>It took Mr Florey two years to track down the general and persuade him to lend his name to the vodka, made at a distillery in St Petersburg. The general, however, is not just a figurehead. He has had points to make about every aspect of the product, from the design of the bottle to the spirit inside.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, he did not make a fortune from the rifle: the Soviet way was not to encourage its troops to patent their designs.<br><br>He was, anyway, not rich enough to pass up the chance of becoming the chairman and face of the grandly named Kalashnikov Joint Stock Vodka Company plc.<br><br>What's in a name?<br><br>Swiss army penknife<br><br>Carl Elsener, a Swiss cutlery maker, delivered the first batch of his penknives to the Swiss army in 1891<br><br>Army and Navy stores<br><br>Began as Army and Navy Co-Operative, set up to cater for grocery and drapery needs of officers and their families<br><br>Saab<br><br>another version is:<br><br>London, Sept 22 (ANI): General Kalashnikov, whose Kalashnikov range of rifles went on to become the most used rifles in the world after he introduced them in the late 1940's, has now launched his own vodka, in order to carry on the 'good name' of his gun.<br><br>He said that he hopes that his vodka will also become as huge a hit as his guns and that he will try to make it the best vodka in the world by making it from special Russian grain and water taken from Lake Ladoga north of St Petersburg.<br><br>"I've always wanted to improve and expand on the good name of my weapon by doing good things. We wanted that vodka to be better than anything made, up until now, in both Russia and England," Ananova quoted him as saying.<br><br>He also hopes that his vodka will prove to be a potent mix for people, as the alcohol concentration will be as high as 82 percent.
