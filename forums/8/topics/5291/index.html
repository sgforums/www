            <div class='col-md body'>Im just wondering about the SNAGs' nowdays, cos there seems to be more and more of them, but is it their natural self and character ? or are there just more guys who pretend to be SNAGs ? cos i personally know somebody who behaves like a SNAG in front of his gf, but is of a totally different character and behaviour when his gf isnt around ? is that wrong or should it be the way ?<br>Like to hear views from all round  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i don't know who "all round" is. but i'll give it a try. i think maybe that fren of yours may be showing his true self to his gf and a macho facade to other ppl. that's just a maybe. there's a topic somewhere around here on snags i think. don't quite know what a snag is tho. maybe you can enlighten me? i mean everyone can be kinda nice and sensitive right? are there really more of snags around? i dunno. have to hear from the others.<br><br>oh....and i hope "all round" turns up soon. it's getting late!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'll have to say SNAGs are natural. I know some people whose personalities are exactly like a SNAG, and they are consistent.<br><br>I also think some people do try to be SNAGs. I don't think they are pretending, but because it is so (or rather was) fashionable, the behaviours of true SNAGs are mimicked under certain situations i.e. in front of girls. Personally, I just see the friend of yours as basically normal, because many people treat different people in different ways in different situations. I'm sure you don't talk to your parents like you talk to your friends, but your underlying personality is generally fixed. Also, guys tend to behave in certain ways in front of guys because we don't want to appear un-guyly. Peer pressure.<br><br>I have to add here that SNAGs seem to be passe. Which means problems for natural SNAGs as well as people who have learnt the behaviour of a SNAG through pressure of the opposite sex. But thats a topic for someone else to post.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't agree that SNAGs are wimps, and to a certain extent most of us have SNAG characteristics in us... we love, care, protect, feel sad etc... Sure beats the " Stare what stare? Want to fight izzit?" kinda guys (and gals).<br><br>It's wrong to judge a multi-faceted person to be a 'two-headed snake' cause everyone portrays different characteristics to different people under differing situations/environments, no? But there are always the POSERs, who seem to be on the bandwagon of anything remotely fashionable.

            <div class='col-md body'>Its real easy to know if someone is a real SNAG or not. Those with girlfriends mostly are not. And apparently those without are usually the real McCoy. The reason is that SNAGs are quite treated as sissies.<br><br>Fortunately, the 'posers' out there actually mean no harm. Trying to be a SNAG is actually an improvement. The modern women hate the MCP(male chauvinist pig). And apparently the SNAG is the best option. So guys....if you aren't a SNAG don't worry. Let the girls guide you.</div>
