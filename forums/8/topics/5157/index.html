            <div class='col-md body'>i am very interested in this gal i met up with sometime ago. she knows that i have feelings for her already and have rejected my approach. we are still chatting over the phone. however, she bugs me with things like "i like this guy very much and i think he likes me too." i even met this prospective BF of hers once and still am fuming over it until this day. i feel that i cannot care for her as a friend anymore, and i can't put on the brave face and pretend nothing is happening from my view. What should i do? i so very want to curse and swear at this guy in front of her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry man!  Can't help you out here!<br><br>If she told you that she likes another person, then either she is telling you the truth or she trying to you to forget about her.  Bad sign if it is either one!.<br><br>Are you sure that her prospective bf that is tagging along her that day?  Or is it just that she asking a guy friend to help her out by pretending to be her prospective bf just to put you off.  Bad sign!<br><br>The only suggestion I can give is to go hunt and put her out of the picture and see what happen in the next few months.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree. The 3 possible outcomes are:<br><br>1) She is trying to get you to forget her<br>2) She is really interested in the other guy<br>3) She is trying to get you to make another move on her because she changed her mind.<br><br>I think the 3rd one is not very probable. I'll have to say that since you are only torturing yourself about her and you can't face the cruel reality, the best ( but not the easiest) thing to do is to disappear for some time. Don't neglect the other people around you, both your other close friends and potential partners.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 16-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think u're going to lose out. if u want to test out if u still have a little chance, try this: disappear into think air without even telling her, if she's angry with u, probably and hopefully there's still a chance, if she bochup u, it's time to change a target</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Uh...even if she's angry when u dissappear, it doesn't really mean she likes you.  As with any close friend, if u dissappear they will take it personally and get angry u don't want to contact them....<br><br>My suggestion is to tell her that you need some time to be away from her because of your feelings for her.  Tell her that you can't tahun to be around whne she's tokking about so many guys and that you need this time away to sort out your feelings for her because you know that it won't be reciprocated.<br><br>It's the best way out....ask her to have some understanding for the position that you are in and although she might be sad, mad, relieved?, she will ultimately know that it's best...unless she's really those types that don't care one.<br><br>This tactic is if you are friends and don't want to lose her as a friend...Who knows, maybe during that time away she might miss you like hell and realise something...but don't count on it bub....:-)<br><br>happy decision making...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The only few scenerios that I can think of is:<br>#1. She might be interested in u but juz giving herself more time.<br>#2. She values your opinion.<br>#3. She juz wants to make sure that u're there at the sidelines, as an alternative (to put it bluntly)<br>#4. She really juz wants to be friends with u.<br><br>Somehow i think that all these above scenerios are those that are already clear to u.. so a bit redundant.. hehe..<br><br>If she really means something to u, then probably u might want to take the chance and ask her again.. though it might not be the best option available.. the possibilities of it backfiring are much more than its rate of success..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from a girl's POV, you can't do anything. SHE ISN'T INTERESTED IN YOU! she's probably just telling you about the guy, like she's doing to everyone else. or else, she knows you still like her and wants to tell you that she ISNT INTERESTED AT ALL and she wants you to give up totally. you seriously cannot do anything; if you really can't deal with it then keep away.</div>
