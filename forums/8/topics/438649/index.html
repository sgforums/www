            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I could remember him and his face as if the day we first met was just yesterday. He was a such a fun boy. He was the closest friend I ever had then, and I, him. We were such pals! I remember how he usually dressed. We were primary school friends so he wore a dirty yellow version of our Canberra Primary School's usual white uniform. Many people did not accept him as he was bound by this insanity and craziness. By that, he was labeled a naughty child. But I was the only one who believed in him, and that I trust him with my all. I accepted him into my World.</p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>It was not until the end of our year in the school, that our relationship drifted apart. It wasn't in a bad way, like as if that we hated each other. But communication and networking drifted us apart. He went into different secondary school as I am. Good thing we traded phone numbers didn't we? Except that I forgot where I left that math text book which I had his phone number written down. And that the note I gave him... well went missing I guess. We never contacted each other at all.</p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>His name was Carlos. He lived in Yishun Sapphire. I had visited his home once and vice versa. He is of a hispanic and chinese decend. His father was hispanic and his mother was chinese. They would ocassionally talk in spanish whenever they needed to only talk to themselves... without Carlos and his sister's knowledge.Â </p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Today, I talked to an old secondary school friend of mine and asked if she knew Carlos. Since she lives in the same residence. I was baffled when she said she knew him. She explained in minor detail about what she knew about Carlos and his family. Then, I knew for a fact that we were talking about the same person. A spark of hope lit inside me. I was one step closer to finiding my long lost best friend. Unfortunately, she mentioned that Carlos and his lovely family had moved. Still though with her information, I might just get up a step higher.</p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>So here's the deal of what I know about Carlos, including what my friend added: His full name is Carlos Oli-- something. Well she couldn't remember the last part. He wore a brown coloured uniform (Secondary School) I do not know which school he belonged to then. He has only one other sibling, a little sister back then... who used to call me peanut because my name sounded like it and she had no idea how to pronounce my name well. He also lived in Yishun Sapphire.</p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Now, I have left secondary school and just freshly begun my year in College. It would be nice to see him again.</p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I would LOVE to have anyone provide information, any information at all about Carlos. Or even about that brown uniform. Thank you :)</p>
