It makes them particularly vulnerable to exploitation, however.<br><br>I don't know if your girlfriend belongs to such a group. Anyway, while it may be easy to see things clearly and place judgments as a spectator, we wouldn't know how deep your friend's feelings go for her jerk of a boyfriend. Or there could some other unknown reasons as well that she is not willing to share. Sometimes, the more unreasonable things may appear to be, the darker the reasons that may be hidden from the view of the spectators.</div>
