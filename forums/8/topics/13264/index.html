            <div class='col-md body'>January 22, 2002 Posted: 1:05 AM HKT (1705 GMT)<br><br>SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singaporean officials on Saturday blasted local Internet sites that call Osama bin Laden a "good Muslim" and criticize the Singapore government for arresting suspected al Qaeda militants in the city-state.<br><br>A Web site in Singapore and one based in neighboring Malaysia have condemned the Singapore government for its close links with the U.S. military and for being insensitive to the concerns of Muslims.<br><br>"If the Singapore government is truly concerned about religious harmony in Singapore, it should take appropriate actions to remove itself from the <strong>American and Israeli attacks on Muslims</strong>," Zulfikar Mohamad Shariff said Saturday in a news release on his Web site Fatheha.com.<br><br>Government officials have said Shariff has a right to publish his Web site as long as he does not incite violence. But several officials on Saturday said Fateha, which calls itself "the voice of the Singapore Muslim community" and claims to have 360 members, only represents the fringe of society.<br><br>"I think he has to think very carefully about the impact these kinds of statements have on Singaporeans," Education Minister Rear Adm. Teo Chee Hean said on NewsRadio 93.8. Teo is also the second minister for defense.<br><br>Singapore arrested 13 people in December for allegedly plotting to blow up numerous targets in the Southeast Asian city-state, including the U.S. and Israeli embassies and U.S. military personnel. Eight of the 13 have trained at al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, the government has said.<br><br>Shariff, 30, told The Associated Press Saturday that the suspects were probably motivated by the U.S. military presence in Singapore and Singapore's foreign policy.<br><br>"The Singapore government's position in aligning with the United States in its attack of Afghanistan, its support of Israel, even with the daily murder of Palestinians, strikes a negative reaction from the Muslim community," he said in the news release.<br><br></div>

THIS, IF happens is inevitably their OWN MISTAKES....<br><br>IF they wanna RISE VOICE, rise voice... By attacking the INNOCENCE make them NO LESS a murderer like their enemy as they had claimed....

            <div class='col-md body'>To BEGIN... Your BACKGROUND is BLURRISH and your OBJECTIVE UNCLEAR.. Nonetheless, let's talk on a NEUTRAL stand....<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Swampfox:<br><strong>Religion has NOTHING to do with it. Religion is a easy word to use, instead of POLITICS.<br>When one group can NOT get thier way, they revert to "terrorism". Look it up in HISTORY books.</strong><br>Nobody BOTHER to bring up 'religion' as the topic. The TERRORIST started it. Though one have to admit that it is a SEPARATE ISSUE altogether, but it has been inevitably linked to many's heart... You cannot really blame them for doing that because it's a 'co-reaction' thing.... Someone bring up 'religion' as an EXTRA, people know it's NOT connected. But if PRESSURE and FURTHER PROBLEMS start to arise from SOME's recognition of that, it IS a problem to be DEAL with.<br>Agree with 2nd point. But TERRORISM should NOT be practised UNLESS a sort of EXTINCTION problem or 'EXTREME' problem is there. And like mentioned, it is USUALLY an INSULT to HUMANITY. TARGETTED TERRORISM is used to bring across MESSAGE(s). NOT random demonstrations of TERRORISM. That is just IGNORANT DESTRUCTION and TEAR DOWN of GLOBAL HUMANITY.<br><br><strong><br>Color of the Skin has nothing to do with it. It's the color of the heart.</strong><br>You cannot TOTALLY deny their correlation. To MANY RATIONAL enough, your saying is TRUE. To the ones at LOSS, SUFFERING and with IDEAS DEEPLY ROOTED, the GENERAL IDEA is DIFFERENT. You CAN INSIST on your point, but you CAN'T easily change theirs. We got your point, but theirs are the CRUCIAL one?<br><br><strong><br>The world says American hate Muslims, WE do not. There are MANY different religions here.<br></strong><br>Maybe not before the TERRORIST strike? Then again, such stirs of hearts is a sense is inevitable for some?<br><br><strong><br>I lived in Singapore. I've learn the culture &amp; I like it.</strong><br>Thanks... Not to bury the effort, our government very much DESERVES the credit...<br><br><strong><br>USA gets a bum rap, everybody needs our help &amp; then says go away your a problem.. BUT that is another large discussion....</strong><br>AGREE. It's another LARGE discussion. It's about humanity. I'm sure America is NOT the only one facing that sort of problem?<br><br><strong><br>The society in the Middle East has low standards. In Singapore your Poly Tec is good school, this teaches U to think for yourself. Do U believe that a Afghani is as smart as U.. or even an average 12 year old.. I Do Not think so..</strong><br>I AGREE. That's why I said it's VERY DEEP down in its ROOTS. And with SIMPLE SPOON-FEEDING around. FED-FACTs can be EASILY MIXED up with REALISTIC FACTs. Can't TOTALLY blame them. But with TERRORISM at work, time is RUNNING OUT. EDUCATION is IMPORTANT. IF we SURVIVE to that point.<br>I must admit SG Government have GREAT INSIGHTS. But when it comes to HUMANITY and FREEDOM of SPEECH, it might be a different issue altogether.<br><br></blockquote>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT.
