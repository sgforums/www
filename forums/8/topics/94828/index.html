            <div class='col-md body'>Sats cuts 108 jobs, outsources 1,064<br>By Karamjit Kaur<br><br>SINGAPORE Airport Terminal Services (Sats) has shed 108 workers and will ask another 1,064 others to join companies that will be taking on more of its work.<br><br>Related links<br>Watch Channel i news clip<br><br>Sats, 85 per cent owned by Singapore Airlines (SIA), is trimming its operations to deal with soon-to-come competition which will be vying for the catering, baggage handling and other ground services at Changi Airport.<br><br>The exercise will cost Sats about $28 million in retrenchment benefits and expenses this financial year, but will yield annual savings of about $20 million after that.<br><br>When the dust settles, the company - which controls 80 per cent of the ground-handling pie at Changi - will be down to 7,692 staff, compared to 9,200 before the Sars virus hit last year.<br><br>At a news conference yesterday, Sats president and chief executive officer Ng Chin Hwee, flanked by chief operating officer Karmjit Singh and chief financial officer Lim Kei Hin, described retrenchment as 'an option of last resort'.<br><br>Mr Ng said: 'We are sorry to have to make these changes, but they are necessary to ensure that we are positioned for the new competitive landscape.'<br><br>By the end of next year, Sats will have to compete with two foreign companies - Dubai-based Dnata which is part of the Emirates Group and Switzerland-based Swissport - for Changi's ground-handling business worth $1.2 billion a year.<br><br>The sector is being opened up as part of moves to position Changi as a 'must' stop for airlines, especially in an era of budget airlines and stiff competition from nearby countries.<br><br>Sats, which started outsourcing its functions 30 years ago, will now move to contracting out about 30 per cent - up from 19 per cent - of its work to companies such as Chye Thiam Maintenance and aeRo 2000.<br><br>In June last year, the Sars outbreak and its impact on air travel led to 196 workers losing their jobs.<br><br>Mr Ng disclosed that Sats management had not been spared either. Following a restructuring exercise earlier this year, there are now close to 200 positions, down from about 240 as managers either opted for early retirement or were simply not replaced when they left the company.<br><br>This time round, those affected are mainly lower-level workers including aircraft cleaners, food packers and baggage handlers.<br><br>As part of their exit package, the 108 workers will each pocket a month's salary for every year of service, capped at 25 years.<br><br>They will retain their medical benefits for another full year and travel benefits until the end of this year.<br><br>Said Mr Victor Pang, general secretary of the Singapore Airport Terminal Services Workers' Union: 'At least now they can rest assured that their medical bills will be taken care of, although their jobs are gone.'<br><br>The 1,064 workers, whose jobs have been outsourced to contract labour providers, have up to five days to decide if they want to move to the new companies or take the retrenchment package.<br><br>Those who cross over will get a lump-sum payment of 0.8 month's pay for every year of service, capped at 25 years, and a $4,000 cash bonus to be paid over three months. For them, the medical benefits will remain for another 18 months.<br><br>The sticking point for most workers, however, is the lower salary they will earn on the other side, said a cleaner who did not want to be named. She will take home less than $1,000 a month at the new company, compared to $1,400 now.<br><br>She said: 'It is quite a big cut especially if you have bills to pay and children to feed. But I need the job, so I will probably sign up anyway.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SIA may retrench up to 70 workers<br>Airline plans to outsource accounting and data entry work to cut costs; one in three of these employees affected<br><br>By Karamjit Kaur<br><br>IN WHAT is likely to be the first of several rounds of retrenchment at Singapore Airlines, the national carrier said yesterday it may axe up to 70 workers by the end of the year.<br><br>They are all doing accounting and data entry work - such as handling flight coupons and inter-airline billings - tasks which the company is outsourcing.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>The carrier said in a statement that one in three of these workers will be affected.<br><br>Yesterday's news comes about a week after SIA said it was studying ways to outsource the work now done by its information technology infrastructure department - a move sources said was likely to result in lost jobs.<br><br>The airline's spokesman told The Straits Times it was exploring various possibilities within the company for the 70 affected staff in the finance department with its unions, but 'retrenchments will be likely'.<br><br>He said that more outsourcing could not be ruled out in future if it meant work could be done more efficiently and effectively.<br><br>Technology would also mean fewer people being required to do the same tasks, he added, but he stressed that SIA would 'always explore the options of reducing its cost base with the minimum impact on its staff'.<br><br>He said: 'We won't move to reduce staff lightly.'<br><br>In yesterday's statement, SIA's senior vice-president for finance, Mr Goh Choon Phong, stressed: 'This is a difficult decision and management is sensitive to the human considerations.<br><br>'We're working with union representatives and staff to provide the necessary support in this adjustment.'<br><br>After laying off about 600 people in June and July last year, in the wake of Sars and the Iraq war, the airline had said it would review operations in a bid to cut costs and boost efficiency.<br><br>At the time, chief executive officer Chew Choon Seng said: 'It's timely for us to re-examine what we do, how we organise ourselves to perform business functions and how we go about doing our jobs.'<br><br>The spokesman said yesterday that being efficient was something the airline addressed all the time and that this had become particularly important with the emergence of low-cost carriers in the region.<br><br>'It's incumbent on SIA to manage itself well so that it continues to deliver the highest quality services to customers, while keeping its cost base in check.'<br><br></div>
