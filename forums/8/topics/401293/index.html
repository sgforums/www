              <h5>TAMARA THIESSEN</h5>
              <cite>May 31, 2010<br><br>
              <p>At the Tanah Merah MRT rail station in Singapore, hundreds of iPhone-infatuated commuters appear to be as oblivious to fellow commuters as they do to the sign strung before them: ''Value Life Act Responsibly''.</p>
              <p>It is the kind of behaviour-regulating message that is thrust down their throats daily, though some observers are cynical about their effectiveness. "This is campaign city," a marketing specialist says. "There's a 'Smile' campaign, 'Be on time to weddings' campaign, a 'Courtesy' campaign … there are just too many campaigns."</p>
              <p>In a country where people are regimentally law-abiding and clean, happiness and civility are also deemed to be in need of outside enforcement. Visitors to Singapore know they will be greeted by spick-and-span public spaces, hoovered grounds and streets free of chewing gum and spit; yet many say there is no such assurance of finding good manners and a caring society.</p>
              <p>In a letter to <em>The Straits Times</em> Sabrina Chen said that ''achieving true kindness boils down to having one characteristic which is missing among us: initiative. Singaporeans lack the initiative to care".</p>
              <p>Under slogans such as ''Kindness rocks'' and ''Be a smile champion'', the Singapore Kindness Movement has been campaigning relentlessly for a more benevolent society. The movement's second State of Graciousness in Singapore Survey, found ''S'poreans'' had conducted themselves better on public transport over the past year, amid hefty state-waged campaigns to improve consideration among commuters.</p>
              <p>But half the respondents were negative about behaviour in public, on the roads, at work and at home, said the movement's general manager, Teh Thien Yew. "Levels of indifference and unhappiness are still high … we are all concerned about graciousness in our country."</p>
              <p>Some foreign workers in the city have few kind words about Singaporeans' manners. "They are the rudest f---ing people I have ever seen; they need some basic training in civic awareness," said Paul Stapleton, an IT manager from Sydney. "They don't feel that anyone else exists outside this tiny island."</p>
              <p>The resounding verdict points to a Singapore rigorously controlled at the expense of humanitarian values. So will more state initiatives such as the Singapore Kindness Movement, whose patron is the Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, reap change?</p>
              <p>"The problem is the sole concern of most Singaporeans is money and economic wellbeing," a long-time British resident says. "The only reason the churches here are packed to the rafters is because people attend in order to network."</p>

              <div class="top-meta">
              <div class="tm-l align-left">By Angela Lim – June 2nd, 2010<br><br>
              <div class="snap_preview">
              <p>It’s no secret that Singapore is a “campaign city”.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">The National Courtesy Campaign, Speak Good English Movement, the Singapore Kindness Movement and even toilet campaigns like “Aim Right”, “Wash Your Hands Right”, “Don’t Wet The Floor” are clear testaments to this.</p>
              <p>But <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Sydney+Morning+Herald&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Sydney Morning Herald </span></a>writer Tamara Thiessen takes this a step further in a provocative piece entitled “<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/singaporeans-asked-to-chew-on-their-manners-20100530-wnjm.html"><span style="color: #334499;">Singaporeans asked to chew on their manners</span></a>” that was published on the newspaper’s website on May 31.</p>
              <p>In it, she questions the level of courtesy and graciousness in Singaporeans as well as how constant reminders to be courteous have to be “thrust down their thoats daily”.  The article further goes to portray Singapore as a regimentally law-abiding and clean country, where “happiness and civility need…outside enforcement”.</p>
              <p>But despite the city-state’s spick-and-span spaces free of chewing gum and spit, “there is no assurance of finding good manners and a caring society”, she writes.</p>
              <p>An IT manager from Sydney who is based in Singapore, Paul Stapleton, is quoted in the article saying, “They (Singaporeans) are the rudest f***ing people I have ever seen; they need some basic training in civic awareness. They don’t feel that anyone else exists outside this tiny island.”</p>
              <p>Another long-time British resident staying here added, “The problem is the sole concern of most Singaporeans is money and economic well-being. The only reason the churches here are packed to the rafters is because people attend in order to network.”</p>
              <p>General manager of the Singapore Kindness Movement, Teh Thien Yew, is also quoted in the paper as saying, ”Levels of indifference and unhappiness are still high … we are all concerned about graciousness in our country.”</p>
              <p>Invariably, every society has its fair share of bad social graces.  But is it fair for an Australian or Briton to pass judgement on Singaporeans as a whole based on personal experience and a few opinions?</p>
              <p>A 24-year-old Singaporean student, who wanted to be known as Jen, told Yahoo! Singapore that Thiessen’s article is a case of the pot calling the kettle black.</p>
              <p>“Who is the writer to say that Singaporeans make up an ungracious society? Yes, there may be some rude people in Singapore. But there are always bad eggs in every society. Personally, I’ve met my fair share of rude Australians while studying there, but I don’t dismiss Australia as a country of ungracious people.”</p>
              <p>To Singaporeans’ credit, according to the <em>State of Graciousness in Singapore</em> <em>Survey</em>, people here conducted themselves better on public transport over the past year. Also, the country’s “Graciousness Index” — an indication of how citizens rate the level of graciousness within society — climbed 3 points from 58 to 61 in the same time.</p>
              <p>Having said that, while Thiessen’s article borders on being one-sided and slightly extreme, could the ugly truth be that she’s actually right? </p>
              <p>After all, in the same survey, only 37% out of 1,000 Singaporeans interviewed were happy with the level of graciousness in the city-state.</p>
              <p>In light of such harsh criticism, do you agree that the level of courtesy and graciousness in Singapore society leaves much to be desired? Are state campaigns effective in inculcating kindness and consideration in local citizens?<br><br><a href="http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2010/06/02/singaporeans-slammed-for-being-rude-in-australian-newspaper/">http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2010/06/02/singaporeans-slammed-for-being-rude-in-australian-newspaper/</a></p>

              <p>-I DON'T HOLD DOORS OPEN FOR ANG MO.  RATHER I SLAM IT SHUT IN THEIR FACE.</p>
              <p>-WHEN ANG MO LINE UP IN FRONT OF ME AT MIX RICE STALL, I WILL BARK OUT MY ORDER 1ST BEFORE HE HAS CHANCE TO ORDER.</p>
              <p>-IF ANG MO SCOLDS ME, I WILL SAY "GET LOST".</p>
              <p>-AT THE BUS, I WILL PUSH ANG MO TO ONE SIDE WHEN ENTERING. But if I see a malay or indian, I patiently let them go up first.</p>
