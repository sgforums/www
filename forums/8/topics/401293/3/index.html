              <p>I think most Singaporeans are not rude on purpose, but are mainly just unaware of their habits.</p>
              <p>For example, if your'e driving and put on your signal to change lanes, usually the driver in the other lane behind you will subconsciously accelerate so that you don't have space to fit  in. It's not that they're rude, it's just that we're bred to not "lose out", so even letting another car in front of you is perceived as such.</p>
              <p>Another example is cutting in front of queues. Most of the time the person is unaware that there are other ppl in line, but instead of taking the initative to ask, they just cut in. This happened to me 3 TIMES when I was in line to receive communion in church!</p>
              <p>This type of behaviour can be corrected, but there must be a drive for people to start behaving more gracious before the behaviour becomes the norm.</p>
              <p>I find Singaporeans are friendly if given the chance, such as initiating a conversation in a lift or something. However, our competitive environment just makes it difficult to be naturally gracious.</p>

I, myself, had my fair share of racist treatment from those aussies. So  really. the writer should examine her own before commenting on others.

              <p>Yes. Singaporeans are rude. I am a Singaporean and am ashamed to admit that. But I believe it's because our society is like this because of the need to protect ourselves.</p>
              <p>With so many people crowding around each of us, we need to stand up to 'fight' for our own right as no one will 'fight' for you. This is what we have been brought up to believe.</p>
              <p>Moreover, with the population now rapidly increasing (tru unnatural means of flooding of FTs), we are more pressurized to protect our own rights for everything. Now, even space in the MRT, malls, foodcourts, hawker centers, parks, pools etc, we have to fight for our own space and right to be in a place.</p>

              <p>The reason is because Singapore lacks a rural hinterland.</p>
              <p>Usually, people from rural areas and small towns would be better in graciousness and friendliness, because, in those situations, they are still able to forge relatively close social relationships.</p>
              <p>Since Singapore is 99% urban area (with the exception of small outlaying islands) , this means that the average person spends most of his / her time in a super dense, super cramped, environments, and in highly transactional relationships, and there is no strong social bond or glue.</p>
              <p>Other countries such as Australia, I agree can have more friendliness and graciousness among its people. This is because they still have lots of small towns and rural areas.</p>

              <p>Some foreign workers in the city have few kind words about
              Singaporeans' manners. "They are the rudest f---ing people I have
              ever seen; they need some basic training in civic awareness," said
              Paul Stapleton, an IT manager from Sydney. "They don't feel that
              anyone else exists outside this tiny island."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The problem is the sole concern of most Singaporeans is money
              and economic wellbeing," a long-time British resident says. "The
              only reason the churches here are packed to the rafters is because
              people attend in order to network."</p>

              <p>Thats like a duh..Ofcourse most Chinese here came from China. Where else would they come from? India? LOL</p>
              <p>Its true that prejudice is a bitch. How some Singaporeans says Chinese people speak loudly, they same people fails to see that they're doing the same. But generally speaking most China FTs i encounter are quite rude really. Its like their culture or something. This is not to say that I've never met any polite Chinese people. Like I said, prejudice is a bitch.</p>

              <p>What is the big difference between the terms China ppl and Chinese ppl?  I thought your NRIC says you are "Chinese".  Doesnt it mean China origin? PRC national means nationals of PRC irrespective of race.  You dont become Ang Mo by being born in Singapore and speaking Chinglish. For generations to come, the NRIC will say race = Chinese.  And stop criticising PRC nationals.  There are some Singapore nationals behaving worse than them.</p>
