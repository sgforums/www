            <div class='col-md body'>AAG was delighted to find an email in our inbox from Kim, the current owner of the now infamous haunted painting from Ebay, "The Hands Resist Him". Urban legend or something more? That's up for you to decide! Many thanks to Kim for taking the time to chat with us!<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>AAG: What prompted you to buy the painting, other then it's obvious noteriety as a haunted painting?<br><br>Kim: On examination of the detail photographs provided in the ebay listing, I thought the painting might date from the 1930's or 1940's, which would make it a fairly early example of American surrealism. Which could make it more valuable in market. I also collect surreal works of art, so either way I was interested. The " haunted painting " aspect caught my attention, but didn't affect my interest, one way or the other.<br><br>AAG: Have you spoken with the actual painter that produced the art? If so, what did he have to say about the painting?<br><br>Kim: I discovered the painter, William Stoneham, last September, via a chance search on google. You can go to his website, www.stonehamstudios.com, for other work. The painting was based on a poem by his then wife, "The Hands Resist Him" and a photograph of Bill when he was a child. Interestingly enough, this isn't the first time others have been affected by his works, or thought them haunted or possessed.<br><br>AAG: Do you intend to display the painting to the public, attempt to resell it on the market for profit, or keep it for personal viewing?<br><br>Kim: All of the above. I bring it out in the my gallery on special occasions, New Year's Eve, etc. I have already been offered a fair amount to sell it, but not what I think it's real value may be.<br><br>AAG: Would you ever consider having a Paranormal Research Group come over and see if they get any EMF Readings, temperature differences, or anything else from the painting. The art itself of course would be untouched, and could remain hanging.<br><br>Kim: Depends on the group.<br><br>AAG: Have you had any strange or unexplained happenings to yourself or in the building that the painting now resides in?<br><br>Kim: Unfortunately, nothing to report here, although a strange carrot did appear on the floor on New Year's Eve, but my guest thought it had more to do with the adult beverages being consumed, than the painting.<br><br>AAG: We've heard on one site the painting was a of the painter, himself, and his little sister at a young age. Do you have any ideas why ge made his sister look almost "doll" like?<br><br>Kim: The doll was just part of his interpretation of the poem, not based on a sibling.<br><br>AAG: It the painting as spooky in person as it is as displayed on the internet, or are the colors more vibrant, giving it a less ominous feel?<br><br>Kim: For the most part, everyone who has viewed it in person can fully appreciate why it was deemed haunted. It is very spooky in person, and even more at night, under a single light source. Also, everyone who has purchased a print so far has reported the same affects. Not for the tame at heart.<br><br>AAG: Do you as the owner get any weird, ominous, or otherwise anxious feelings around the painting, especially if you are in the room alone with it?<br><br>Kim: I happened to enjoy looking at it, but if you could see the paintings that are hanging on the walls around me as I type my responses, you could see why I say that. To my left is a 6 ft x 4 ft surreal oil from 1947, comparing the birth of the atomic age, ( dropping of the atom bomb) with the crucifixtion of Christ. Behind me is another painting of similar size from 1963, portraying a Jewish concentration camp survivor testifying at the trail of Adolf Eichman. Perhaps the most haunting work I own. I gravitate to works that visually, intellectually and emotionally are challenging. Of course, not with every work in the house, but many.<br><br>AAG: Do you have anything special planned for Halloween featuring the painting, such as a feature on Discovery's Haunted Places/Things, etc?<br><br>Kim: I truly believe that Bill Stoneham is a very talented and serious painter and would never do anything to cheapen his work. Which, might be a good time to tell you about the prints I did have made. I was not going to make cheap posters or t-shirts. I choose to have giclees on canvas made in the exact size of the original, 36" x 24" image. The giclee is fairly costly to have made, but the color and detail is so amazing that every tiny crack in the surface of the original is visible in the giclee. People interested can contact me at this address or at hauntedpainting@aol.com. The prints are $450. each, which includes packing &amp; shipping, and no one has been anything short of amazed at the image.<br><br>AAG: And, of course, do you personally feel that the painting is haunted?<br><br>Kim: I have never experienced anything paranormal in my life and with the painting nothing has changed. However, I have come to believe that others can and do have different reactions, and given the amount who became physically ill, I cannot rule out the possibility that others see and feel what I can not. Thanks for taking the time to ask the questions. Stay in touch. I've made a few web friends from this experience, most notably the artist. He is back painting again and we are planning an exhibition for a few years in the future.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Many, many thanks to Kim for donating her time and answering our questions!<br></div>
