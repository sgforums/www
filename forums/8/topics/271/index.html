            <div class='col-md body'>(taken from CNA website)<br><br><strong>Bus and train fares to go up on July 1</strong><br><br>Bus and train fares are going up by between 3 and 10 cents from July 1 (soooo efficient worrrrrrrrr), depending on whether you pay by cash or card.<br><br>But that's not all bad news, as <strong>there are likely to be bus and train fare revisions every year from now.</strong> (ahahahhahahaahah! bruff who....raise again rite?)<br><br><strong>If you haven't already, it's time to go and get an ez-link card, especially if you want to minimise the impact of these fare hikes.</strong> (so tt it makes sure we pay the CORRECT FARE...no more cheating guys!)<br><br>This was the message from the Public Transport Council (PTC), which has raised fares depending on the means of payment.<br><br><strong>On buses, fares will go up by 3 cents for ez-link payments, 5 cents for those using farecards, and 10 cents for cash payments.<br><br>On MRT and LRT trains, fares will go up by 4 cents for ez-link payments, and 5 cents for commuters using magnetic farecards.</strong><br><br><strong>Concession fares for children and students don't change but concession stamps will cost between 50 cents and $3 more.</strong><br><br>The fare increases, which will hit nine in 10 commuters, has proven very unpopular but the PTC stoutly defended its decision.<br><br>The PTC said it was satisfied public transport operators had tried to contain costs and improve productivity, and <strong>they have not been profiteering at the expense of commuters.</strong> (zhun bo.......)<br><br>The PTC also said it had <strong>tried its best to stall past increases.</strong> (obviously not trying hard enuff)<br><br>Mr Eric Gwee, Chairman of Public Transport Council, said: "Looking back, we should have done something last year. So now, we have to bite the bullet. But if we wait till next year, we'll see a big increase."<br><br><strong>The increase will generate extra fare revenue of between 2.2 and 2.5 percent for the bus and train operators.</strong><br><br>But the PTC said this is still lower than the average 5.8 percent annual increase in operating cost over the last two years.<br><br>Mr Gwee said: "Do we wait till they go into the red before we make those adjustments, or do we try to attenuate with time?<br><br>"If they're not financially viable, why would they put in investments or be driven to improve their services or their efficiency if there's no incentive for them to do so?"<br><br>Still, the Consumers Association said it was disappointed with the ill-timed increases - a sentiment echoed by many irate commuters.<br><br>"You can't increase the price at this recession time! Everyone is looking for jobs and you are making extra margins, you're not losing money."<br><br>"It should not be increased for the time being because the economy is still so bad, at least differ for a longer period of time."<br><br>"It's quite significant for people who communite frequently, it's adding up to quite a lot per day."<br><br>But the PTC has warned that small but regular fare revisions each July are the way to go. And <strong>the public needs to get used to this.</strong> (so it becomes out fault now.....)<br><br>Mr Gwee said: "So don't be surprised next year or the following year or the following year. It's whether how much it'll be, that's all. So don't be surprised that there'll be fare revisions every year."<br><br>With ez-link in place, the PTC's working with the Land Transport Authority to finetune the fare system before next year's revision.<br><br><strong>It's considering either a pay as you use system where fares are computed according to distance travelled or a zonal system where you pay according to your destination - clearly something to look forward to next year.</strong> (yeah...next year say mus raise again)<br><br>------------------<br>~~<strong>Evi|Ger</strong>~~<br>more affectionately known as...<br><strong>tHe eXtrA-oRdiNaRy eCCenTriC PaRanOid BiTch wiF thE PaiZaBor aTTiTudE</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(who is a Prata-natic...and a loyal supporter of Quickly and Qoo~)</span><br><br>A <span style="font-style: italic;">hiaK~</span> is <span style="font-style: italic;">a sarcastic laugh</span><br><br>[This message has been edited by FireIce (edited 11 June 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SBS introduces fare cap on transfers, SMRT says increases not enough</strong><br><br>Shortly after the announcement of fare hikes in Singapore's public transport, SBS and SMRT had their say and essentially it was that costs have exceeded fare hikes.<br><br>But SBS Transit admitted it was not a good time to raise fares, and so it has introduced a cap on fares with at least one transfer.<br><br>In contrast, <strong>SMRT, which operates the trains and Tibs buses called the increases modest and said they were not enough.</strong><br><br>In its defence, SBS Transit said it has been trying to reduce labour costs, by controlling hiring and cutting increments and bonuses.<br><br>But these savings were largely eroded by the restoration of the 4 percent employer's CPF contribution in January last year.<br><br>The Electronic Road Pricing was another extra cost, and the projected increase for this year is about S$700,000.<br><br>And because of the uncertain economic outlook, ridership has also been falling by 2.8 percent in the first four months.<br><br>But SBS Transit knows that no one likes fares to go up, so it has come up with a scheme to help soften the impact this time.<br><br><strong>It is introducing a fare cap of S$1.90 on journeys with at least one transfer. This is for commuters using the ez-link card.</strong> (oni for those long-distance travellers....)<br><br>It applies only to SBS Transit services, which will include the North-East MRT, and Sengkang and Punggol LRT lines.<br><br>For example, the journey from Bedok Ave 2 to Jalan Buroh actually costs S$2.39. But the commuter pays only S$1.90.<br><br><strong>The fare cap will only be implemented from October because it will take time to modify the ez-link system's software.</strong> (raise can be in july...this type of thing mus wait till october.....hiaK~)<br><br><strong>As for the MRT, fares were last raised two years ago. Since then, it says operating costs have risen faster than revenue.</strong><br><br>This was also despite moves to improve productivity and contain costs.<br><br>For example, when SMRT upgraded the stations' airconditioners and lighting systems, it led to energy savings of more than S$1.6 million a year.<br><br>But these savings were more than wiped out by two increases in the electricity tariffs, the decision to lower the air-con temperature in both stations and trains, as well as the increase in the number of services to improve frequency.<br><br>SMRT says manpower costs also went up as more staff were needed with the new Changi Airport extension and Dover Station. (the 2 most useless stations.......)<br><br>------------------<br>~~<strong>Evi|Ger</strong>~~<br>more affectionately known as...<br><strong>tHe eXtrA-oRdiNaRy eCCenTriC PaRanOid BiTch wiF thE PaiZaBor aTTiTudE</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(who is a Prata-natic...and a loyal supporter of Quickly and Qoo~)</span><br><br>A <span style="font-style: italic;">hiaK~</span> is <span style="font-style: italic;">a sarcastic laugh</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i fully agree with price hike man. look at this, public transport is so cheap in singapore. if you go other developed places and compare you'll know what i mean. and moreover, its a reasonable hike of a few cents. for aircon service, better bus interchange at toa payoh, more mrt stops to more places, its completely fair! especially when cars cost so much. car drivers need to pay so much erp everywhere, parking coupon and parking fine some more, and pay tax! the public transport system come from public funds some more, and it is only fair that those who use it pay for it more, just like erp! mrt and bus takers have been subsidised for so many years by the rest of the taxpayers who drive cars, its time they pay more for their own usage man. people should be happy you even have public transport. my place, the closest bus stop is over 1 km away, and none of the 3 closest bus stops take me to the closest mrt station. and i don't complain. when i take bus, i just walk in. those who have it good, stop whining!</div>

Regardless of recession or not, we would have frowned on any planned fee hike anyway (knowing us). Hence in a way its understandable if they neglected to poll the public prior to their proposal.<br><br>However there is something i fail to understand. They cited operating costs and improvements as their main reasons for the fee hike. I can accept rising costs as a legitimate excuse but WHAT IMPROVEMENTS have they accomplished over the last few years? All i see is a completely unnecessary air-con interchange and a buggy ez-link card!<br><br>TIBS at least have overhauled their aging buses and launched a newer generation of comfy seaters and bendy buses; but the SBS superbus has been ard for..........well a long time and there have been no significant upgrades on their side...and what abt SMRT?<br><br>Their hopeless LRT (choke-full of mechanical and computer faults) should be privatised instead of being a stat board. And for all their claims of adding the new kawasaki trains, i seem to recall a significant mechanical problem that forced SMRT to withdraw their entire fleet of the new trains for re-evaluation. What did that cost us then?<br><br>Train frequencies dropped, commuters had problems squeezing into the shortfall of trains left to accomodate them etc etc all in all it stank of unprofessionalism.<br><br>If anything, apart from their operating costs, their continued bungling has done nothing but diminished the credibility of their proposal for fee hikes. I can only wonder why PTC approved it in the first place.<br></div>
