            <div class='col-md body'>Following my father in business, i only hold a degree to be the deputy boss, my father only have an O level qualification. Nevertheless, when we interview a potential executive, we need to look for qualification, particularly we look for some kind of specialities or specialist certificate such as CPA or Qualify Chemist or specialist in SNS rather than general education. It is does important that after your degree, take up a specialist course to enhance your own value. Dun waste time on master. They are good for teacher and govt sector, in private sector, master is not much different and worst, if you cannot perform, you might be critised and laughed.<br><br>Like it or not, you are like a commodity in the market, the value you have, determind your price.  If you do not upgrade, your value drop and you find yourself backdated and devalued. Last year in Singapore, about 30% of GP doctors were order to be send back to medical school to relearn /learn old and new medical practice.<br></div>

In some companies (especially in the public sector) there is what you people are talking about, a paper war going around.
