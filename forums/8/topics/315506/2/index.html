              <p>My point was that malays are decendents of cowards. Not that malays are cowards. But by your vulgar and senseless post it only pin points to what kind of person of your race you are...</p>

              <p>That is ONE theory that you have put forth. What I have put forth is ANOTHER theory.</p>
              <p>What that really disturbs me is that you take one theory and use it as a thinly-veiled attack on the ancestors of Malays. As maskedangel has put it.... What the hell is your point, then? You're happy that the ancestors of Malays were runaways? And you take that fact and label them all as cowards?!?!</p>
              <p>As this website says: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sabrizain.demon.co.uk/malaya/malays4.htm">Origins of the word 'Melayu':</a></p>

              <p>So.... they run away from pestilence, strife and war, and that makes them cowards, huh?</p>

              <p>yes that does proves them as cowards... the story that i have put forward did say that the javanese and siam was going for war... How about the javanese ppl of their tribe who needed them. The malays ABANDONED them. Thus having less manpower=more bloodshed.</p>
              <p>the javanese WERE their tribes ppl, one of their ppl... But the malays RAN AWAY leaving the ones that stayed to fight...</p>

              <p>From Wiki:</p>

              <p><strong>History</strong></p>
              <p>The Malay people are believed to have originated in Borneo and then expanded outwards into Sumatra and later into the Malay Peninsula.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span style="white-space: nowrap;" title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since January 2008">[<em><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><span style="color: #0000ff;">citation needed</span></a></em>]</span></sup> These people were descendants of Austronesian-speakers who migrated from the <a title="Philippines" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Philippines"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Philippines</span></a> and originally from <a title="Taiwan" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Taiwan"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Taiwan</span></a>. The main foundation of this school of thought lies in the fact that the oldest Malay settlements have been discovered in Sumatra and not in the Malay Peninsula. This suggests an upward - south to north - migratory route. Malay culture reached its golden age during <a class="mw-redirect" title="Srivijayan" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Srivijayan"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Srivijayan</span></a> times. Malays practiced <a title="Buddhism" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Buddhism"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Buddhism</span></a>, <a title="Hinduism" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Hinduism"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hinduism</span></a>, and their native <a title="Animism" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Animism"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Animism</span></a> before converting to Islam in the 15th century.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Etymology</strong></p>
              <p>According to the History of Jambi, the word Melayu originated from a river with name <a class="new" title="Melayu River (page does not exist)" href="http://www.sgforums.com/w/index.php?title=Melayu_River&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Melayu River</span></a> near to <a title="Batang Hari River" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Batang_Hari_River"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Batang Hari River</span></a> of today's Muara Jambi, <a title="Jambi" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Jambi"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Jambi</span></a> province of <a title="Sumatra" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Sumatra"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sumatra</span></a>, Indonesia. The founder of <a title="Malacca" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Malacca"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Malacca</span></a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Parameswara" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Parameswara"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Parameswara</span></a> was a prince of <a title="Palembang" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Palembang"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Palembang</span></a> which was once owned by a nation called "Malayu" back in the seventh century. <a title="Yi Jing" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Yi_Jing"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yi Jing</span></a> (635-713) clearly recorded in his journal book a nation of name 'Ma-La-Yu' existed. According to archaeological research of Jambi, large numbers of ancient artifacts and ancient architectures of Melayu have been found with photo evidence.</p>
              <p>The word "Malay" was adopted into <a title="English language" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/English_language"><span style="color: #0000ff;">English</span></a> via the Dutch word "Malayo", itself from <a title="Portuguese language" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Portuguese_language"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Portuguese</span></a> "Malaio", which originates from the Malay word "Melayu". According to one popular theory, the word Melayu means "migrating" or "fleeing", which might refer to the high mobility of these people across the region (cf. <a title="Javanese" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Javanese"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Javanese</span></a> verb 'mlayu' means "to run", cognate with Malay verb 'melaju', means "to accelerate") or perhaps the original meaning is "distant, far away" (cf. Tagalog 'malayo')</p>
              <p><br>Another theory holds that the name refers to the Tamil word <em>Malai Yur</em> which means "Land of Mountains" (<em>malai</em> means mountain and <em>yur</em> means land), a reference to the hilly nature of the <a title="Malay Archipelago" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Malay_Archipelago"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Malay Archipelago</span></a>.</p>

              <p>I have read before on the theory of human migration and where the malays come from... But how did they get there....</p>
              <p>From my knowledge, not all malays decended from the fleeing javanese. After the fleeing javanese(most malays), ppl from java, orang minang(padang), boyan, bugis etc came to malaysia and singapore but joined in the malay society and their true heritage have long dissapeared...</p>
              <p>Did I say all of the malays in s'pore and m'sia decended from the fleeing javanese? What I am sure about is MOST malays decended from that group... Thus having the name Melayu which is from the javanese language fleeing.</p>
              <p>Of they are moving from one place to another to find a better fishing ground why not call it another name? if someone where said that I am melayu with the javanese language, I surely will be offended...</p>
              <p>I doubt the melayu is from the tamil.</p>

              <p><br>If you read the post I posted earlier, Melayu can mean 'migrating' too, though another meaning is 'fleeing'</p>
              <p>So if they are migrating, Melayu is applicable too.</p>
              <p>You doubt 'Melayu' comes from Tamil language</p>
              <p>But that is also a theory like your Javanese theory</p>
              <p>And according to your theory, if you flee a war, you are a coward</p>
              <p>This is applicable to any race that fled from a war in their country. This can be applicable to the whole damn world man</p>
