              <p>Guess what, wise guy:</p>
              <p>You angered a LOT of non-Malays in here who actually value racial harmony. If you didn't anger the non-Malays, then you certainly at least offended them.</p>
              <p>You see their ancestors being refugees seeking a better life as something to be ashamed of.... well, my paternal grandfather migrated here from South India in search of a better life, and I'm proud of the way he raised my dad and his siblings. And far from forgetting his roots, he kept sending money back to his family.... my family still keeps touch with our relatives who live in Kerala.</p>
              <p>You want to look down on your mother's ancestry, then that's your problem. I just feel sorry for your mum for having a son like you, and I feel sorry for you for having such a stunted way of thinking.</p>
              <p>But no, since you want to do that online in a public forum..... don't say nobody warned you of the consequences.</p>
              <p>What laurence said in the previous page.... that really did happen. No joke.</p>

              <p>I dont see the fleeing javanese as refugees...I find them cowardly and thats my perspective... Women, children, disabled are fine as refugees...</p>
              <p>Your paternal grandfather migrated to here for a better life and not the same can be compared to people who fled the war. Good for your family that he raised you and your family well...</p>
              <p>and yes, me looking down on my mothers ancenstry is my problem... Its really none of anyone's concern actually...</p>
              <p>And yes, I have heard of cases as such... It is not my intend to mock the modern society... Its my opinion of fleeing javanese as cowards and where melayu derieved from, i have no intention of mocking the malays and the non malays...</p>
              <p><strong>You may have a different perspective on this... So I have my perspective, so why so many ppl is flaming me of my opinion of the fleeing javanese? If they have their opinion speak it out, why bother flaming me? It wont really change my opinion by ppl flaming me...</strong></p>

              <p>what you have effectively said in this thread is:<br>You can flame others or make sentences that do not seem offensive to you but seem offensive to others (their own problem). No one should say anything about your perspective.</p>

              <p>I see that you're a little lacking in empathy and a willingness to listen; all that matters to you is what you feel about your own perspective and not about how others feel about it.</p>
              <p>Sure, you see no problem in labelling the ancient Javanese as cowards. The problem is, lots of people have problems with that perspective of yours. But I guess to you, the perspective of White_SoulReaper is divine, and the perspective of everyone else isn't.</p>
              <p>Well, good luck to you. All it takes is for one pissed-off fella to file a police report. That has happened before; you were warned several times in this thread.</p>
