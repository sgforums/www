              <p><br>It seems that we have another gundu here.... Read back the whole thread if you have to... I did not say that the now malays are cowards... I said that the fleeing javanese were being cowards! And from my sources, that is where the name melayu stands for(fleeing)! I did not say that malays now are cowards... The(malays now) are the decendents of those fleeing javanese... If they and you have a problem w/ ppl who flee when there is a war be condemn as cowards by me, then that's theirs and your problem... Dont put words into mu mouth...</p>
              <p>Of course about the time machine is unrealistic. I was being sarcastic... I thought you would have the brains to know so....</p>
              <p>Did I break any law? I dont think so. Did I say that malays now are cowards? Did I mock their culture in any ways? No... It's you ppl who is putting words in my mouth when you feel offended by the way i write....</p>

              <p>Guess what, wise guy:</p>
              <p>You angered a LOT of non-Malays in here who actually value racial harmony. If you didn't anger the non-Malays, then you certainly at least offended them.</p>
              <p>You see their ancestors being refugees seeking a better life as something to be
              ashamed of.... well, my paternal grandfather migrated here from South
              India in search of a better life, and I'm proud of the way he raised my
              dad and his siblings. And far from forgetting his roots, he kept sending money back to his family.... my family still keeps touch with our relatives who live in Kerala.</p>
              <p>You want to look down on your mother's ancestry, then that's your problem. I just feel sorry for your mum for having a son like you, and I feel sorry for you for having such a stunted way of thinking.</p>
              <p>But no, since you want to do that online in a public forum..... don't say nobody warned you of the consequences.</p>
              <p>What laurence said in the previous page.... that really did happen. No joke.</p>

              <p>1) I think <a rel="nofollow" href="/users/238803">White_SoulReaper</a> is someone who will definitely fail A level history and cannot even survive in society in the future.</p>
              <p>The above sentence is not mockery to me you know? If condemning you is regarded as mockery to YOU... Then its your own problem... I dont find any offense in this, it's my own perspective...</p>
              <p>==&gt; understand the point now?</p>
              <p>2) "You very well know that the last quote is from another thread that is its about youth below 21 voting."</p>
              <p>Do you admit that you said youths below 21 (eg you) are easily influenced by any source?</p>
              <p>If you admit so, how do we know you have not been influenced by any source in this thread?</p>

              <p>1) what makes you think that I am sitting for my a levels? If you have read all the post, one "stalker" actually posted up a lot of my info... I could be above 21 and passed my a levels for all you know... Dont assume too much</p>
              <p>If you want to mock me its your problem... call me a stray breed whatever... Your perspective of me is none of my concern....</p>
              <p>You understand?</p>
              <p>2) I shall explain for the other thread instead since you are sooo wanting to link this up...</p>
              <p>There are 3 types of youths.</p>
              <p>one the one who cares about politics and looks at sources.</p>
              <p>two the ones who easily influenced by others, such as friends, parents etc...</p>
              <p>three the ones that doesnt care about politics at all...</p>
              <p>Democracy does have negative points too... It all depends on the majority.... What if the percentage is split 51-49? does it really say, singapore chooses? In terms of most votes yes, but opinion wise, its almost 50-50... If add in 18 to 20 yr olds, the country would be at stake... These are quite simple, you should know how to do the math.</p>
              <p>I surely one of the ppl of the 1st point.</p>
