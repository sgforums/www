              <p><br>If you read the post I posted earlier, Melayu can mean 'migrating' too, though another meaning is 'fleeing'</p>

              <p>You doubt 'Melayu' comes from Tamil language</p>
              <p>But that is also a theory like your Javanese theory</p>

              <p>Ask any javanese ppl what melayu means and they will say its fleeing... I asked my maid, my maids friend... Melayu means fleeing.... Who is the one who placed migrating in the meaning... Are they javanese or some researcher etc?</p>
              <p>This topic is like fixing a puzzle... look at our history and how do you think the word tamil comes in? The malay archipelago is not that mountainous... India also mountainous, why dont they call themselves melayu too...</p>
              <p>There are many small theories, piece it all together... then history makes sense...</p>
              <p>and one post said that there is a place in sumatra and there's melayu river or something... Is that before the malays have established their civilisation or after since they have photos at that time too...</p>
              <p>and cowardice part is not part of my theory... It's my perspective... Ppl who ran away from their obligations are cowards.</p>
              <p>yes, a group of ppl from all races in the world fled their ppl during a war. The thing is are you the decendent of all the ppl who fled?</p>

              <p>At this conjecture, what is the purpose of this thread actually? Ur mum's a Malay..ur dad's a Chinese... Ur mum is from Malaysia..Ur dad's a local..Ur a student in RP.. Ur a Muslim..and here you go, posting fallacies about Melayu being cowards in the first place and such..And when people confront you where you get your sources from, u just STFU and ignored them...So, again i ask u, where u get the sources from? Its not that difficult tracking ur identity and filing a court order for you to produce your sources, at my expense..it really not difficult especially since you rent your laptop from RP...</p>
