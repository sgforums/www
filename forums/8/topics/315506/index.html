              <p>Melayu is malay in the malay language.</p>
              <p>I don't get it why some malay ppl like to call themselves "anak melayu" which stands for "the children of the malays".</p>
              <p>Melayu actually means "those who fled" in javanese language.</p>
              <p>In history, malays were javanese who fled when siam attacked java. They abandoned their land and refused to protect her from Siam(now thailand).</p>
              <p>Thus, being cowards. I find it funny when people like to say they are "anak melayu" and actually be PROUD of it.</p>
              <p>Don't they know that they are the decendents of cowards who fled their javanese land?</p>

              <h3><img src="http://library.thinkquest.org/10414/media/chiman.gif" alt="" width="70" height="110" align="bottom">The Chinese</h3>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the 19th century, the Chinese in China also faced
                      many difficulties. There was a shortage of good farmland. This
                      situation was made worse as the population increased very rapidly.
                      With the shortage of fertile land, especially in South China, not
                      enough food could be produced for the growing population.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">Droughts and floods made life even harder. In China
                      itself, there was also disorder and unrest as the people were trying
                      to overthrow the corrupt Qing government. <span style="color: #ff0000;">To make things worse, China
                      was at war with countries like Britain, France and Japan during the
                      19th century.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">Many Chinese had heard of opportunities in Southeast
                      Asia (known as Nanyang to them), so they decided to go there to look
                      for work and a better life. Singapore was one such place in Nanyang
                      that could offer the Chinese migrants an opportunity to make a better
                      life for themselves.</span></p>

              <p>Melayu is malay in the malay language.</p>
              <p>I don't get it why some malay ppl like to call themselves "anak
              melayu" which stands for "the children of the malays".</p>
              <p>Melayu actually means "those who fled" in javanese
              language.</p>
              <p>In history, malays were javanese who fled when siam attacked
              java. They abandoned their land and refused to protect her from
              Siam(now thailand).</p>
              <p>Thus, being cowards. I find it funny when people like to say
              they are "anak melayu" and actually be PROUD of it.</p>
              <p>Don't they know that they are the decendents of cowards who fled
              their javanese land?</p>

              <p>That is ONE theory that you have put forth. What I have put forth is ANOTHER theory.</p>
              <p>What that really disturbs me is that you take one theory and use it as a thinly-veiled attack on the ancestors of Malays. As maskedangel has put it.... What the hell is your point, then? You're happy that the ancestors of Malays were runaways? And you take that fact and label them all as cowards?!?!</p>
              <p>As this website says: <a href="http://www.sabrizain.demon.co.uk/malaya/malays4.htm">Origins of the word 'Melayu':</a></p>
              <p><em>'..... If one were to be a poor padi farmer constantly robbed and looted by the marauding armies of Srivijaya, Majapahit, Jambi, Chola and countless others, it would probably be quite sensible to pack up and move to somewhere relatively safer and quieter.....'</em></p>
              <p>So.... they run away from pestilence, strife and war, and that makes them cowards, huh?</p>
              <p>Pfft. You're a troll. Get outta my sight. Stop befouling my eyes with your senseless posts.</p>
