            <div class='col-md body'>i don't understand everybody is saying that 15 is too young to start a relationship and whatsoever. i feel that its perfectly fine for him to at least experience how does a relationship feels like. so at least when he's older he will roughly know what to do so on and so forth.<br><br>judging that both of you are friends, i guess that physical contact won't be able to really prove anything because it would be kinda awkward if she starts shouting molest when u touch her don't you think so?<br><br>IMO i will say that i encourage you to just go out with her a few more times before you ask her if she would get into a relationship with you. during this few outtings treat it as though you are together with her. but of course you don't go all out with the hugs and all. try to get comfortable with her around you and of course make her feel comfortable as well. if you feel that all goes fine and she doesn't show any signs of rejection, go for it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> normally if the girl gives the "rejection aura" you should be able to sense it. trust me.</div>

Really.... And i agree with <strong>Chris1988</strong> words. Starting a r/s at 15 is not too young a start. We are now living in a new world, not like last time whereby you will only go steady at 30+ or so. I've been into a relationship, and trust me, its fun and exciting for both parties. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  And regarding the "rejection aura" i believe you can sense it. You will feel that she doesn't want/need your attention, she doesn't feel like talking to you often, she gives you a negative remark, you can feel it. So...<br><br>GOOD LUCK! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TS you should ask her out on single dates... casual ones (not asking you to present her with 999 roses yet)... going on dates does not mean you are a pervert, it's a chance for you to see her in a different environment and to get to know her better... it's a chance for you to get closer to her (not asking you to hug her or kiss her yet)...<br><br>For a start, if you are shy... ask her out with a friend first... say common friends... so she won't be uncomfortable... or shy... "everyone else also going mah..."<br><br>Going to the movies is a little passe... but it's still a good starting point... at least after the movie, you can talk to her about the movie mah...<br><br>Then gradually after a few group outing, you can try to ask her out privately... cos she's more comfortable with you already, you'd probably have higher chances...<br><br>Drop her a couple of small little gifts to speed up the process... girls LOVE surprises (by that I don't mean you have to spend a BOMB, please try to avoid flowers... cliche... and i think it's kinda embarrassing to lug the flowers around)...<br><br>Most importantly, keep the conversations going... ask her to share more about herself with you... such as funny incidents... her childhood... her likes and dislikes...<br><br>All da best... and make sure you juggle your school work ah!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I got into my 1st relationship when I was 13, so I think for 15, its quite ok lah. But then again, its not WHEN you get into a relationship, its WHAT you do during the relationship that matters. Be it 15 or 30, as long as you know how to treat the other person right, that's all that matters. Some people 20+ liao still look for ONS, or just flings, so there's never really a actual age when people should or shouldn't get into a relationship.<br><br>Going back to the TS, I know it is easier said than done, but asking her about what she thinks of u is the best thing to do. Because quite simply, we are not her. We can give u all the advice in the world, but we cannot answer her feelings for you, can we? Rather than letting us get your hopes raised to the sky, only to have the possibility of it being crushed later, getting an answer straight from her would be the ideal thing to do.<br><br>Good luck to you. I myself is also involved with a gal that is giving mixed signals. Ultra-friendly to me on MSN/SMS, but when we are in a group at class, she and I kinda don't really talk to each other, except when we are one-to-one. Would sms me to ask me why never go school, or ask about my father(recently kenna hospitalized). But whenever I reply or send her sms, she would take a long time to reply, especially in the morning and afternoon. Only when I sms her in the evening would the response time be faster. She is the ultra-friendly kind of gal, who can talk to everyone and anyone, and so I think that she treats me as just another friend. My friends encourage me to go for it, but I am afraid of reading the wrong signals. So I don't know what to do.</div>

For me, it happened since last week. I guess I am to blame too lah. For some reason, I clamp up whenever we are in a group, because I don't know what to say. And also, i feel that she will talk to everyone and anyone in the group, except me. She approaches me or talk to me ONLY when I am just alone with another friend, or when I am alone.</div>
