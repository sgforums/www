            <div class='col-md body'>There is no doubt that we will be heavily influenced by China. I am proud as a Chinese that China is becoming stronger, but the feeling ends there. I am glad that I am a Singaporean, even though the chinese economy is booming, many graduates are out of job and even greater hordes of jobless people are deprived of education opportunities for their next generation, suffering from countless injustice from the corrupt officials etc. At the end of the day, people go China today to make $. No one would want to migrate to China and get a chinese passports. If the TS belongs to those who have already made it, why would he leave China and come to SG ?<br><br>It would be meaningless to compare Singaporean Chinese with PRC. After all, our background differs. We have to serve NS to protect our country and all the foreigners. The government should place an embargo of say 5 yrs for new immigrants who plan to make use of the Singapore passport to gain entry to the next host country. This would help to sieve out those who apply for citizenship with ulterior motives.<br><br>Singapore is a free country. The TS is welcome to relocate himself to another place if he don't like it here.</div>

The professor mentioned that there are no pure breed Han people around due to the various outer race invasion. The only possiblity of pure breed Han people are the Hakkas. Sadly, most of the Hakkas are scattered in the South.<br><br>TS reminds me of Ah Q who are trying to hurt others to gain pride and face.

            <div class='col-md body'>i onli read the first post in this thread and all i have to say is that my opinion of PRC people was neutral up to about this month.<br><br>just came back from a hongkong &amp; shenzhen trip. hk was fine. shenzhen was not. PRC pple smoke everywhere, spit everywhere, and the modern subway in shenzhen (similar to our MRT with the fare gates and ez link tokens) seems to be terrorized by monkeys everyday.<br><br>my experience: the PRC people disregard all rules and signages.<br><br>1) buying the single trip token - queue in the queue line? rubbish. whoever pushes their way to the machine first gets to buy first. i got people sneaking to stand in front of me in the queue at least 6 times when there are only 4 people in front of me. when i'm already at the machine, a guy just pushes me aside and presses the buttons for his own ticket.<br><br>2) boarding the train - a civilised matter? no. more like american football. 3, 2, 1, doors open! fight! people entering and leaving the train push each other. they don't push u aside. they push u BACK. when guy A is trying to leave the train, guy B would be shoving him BACK into the train. a bit like sumo wrestling. survival of the fittest.<br><br>3) leaving the station - before every stop, a reminder is announced in the train in chinese, dialect, and english for single trip passengers to drop their ez link tokens in to the slot at the fare gate. when i got to the fare gate at my stop - i arrived at the shen zhen homo sapien zoo.<br><br>every PRC person was pushing and shoving and hurling vulgarities at each other to get out of the station. oh and those extremely fed up and climbed over the gate.<br><br>scenario:<br><br>legend:<br>x = PRC people<br>| = gate/glass<br>---- = side of fare gate<br><br>x xxx|   outside<br>xx xx|<br>x x----------------<br>xxxxx|     &lt;xx----------------<br>xx xx|<br>xxxx|<br><br>as you can see, X represents them. they were everywhere and everyone of them refused to queue. furthermore, those who climb over the gate stood at the other side within the faregate lane (in between the two ------ ) which kept triggering the sensors and every single lane kept BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP with the error red light flashing<br><br>they didn't even bother to tap the token or drop it in or figure out how to work the machine or something. they just kicked at the gate, spit at it, whack it, and cursed etc.<br><br>the officer on duty took a half hour to clear about 50 people through the gates.<br><br>In short, i have to agree that PRC people need to improve. that's a long story.</div>
