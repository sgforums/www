              <p>it seems that you have completely no understanding of economics at all. When I come to Singapore and work, I create a certain value for the company which I work for every month, and the company pays me a certain cut of that value I have generated (that's how they make money), and the company in turn has to pay tax, do projects in Sg which all benefits Spore. Besides, money that I spend in sg contributes to more $$ for the economy which would provide more jobs for everybody. It's a win-win situation, not a win-lose situation as u implied.</p>
              <p>It's not called "stealing jobs" but rather "filling a need" and creating value for everyone.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Besides, if there was a local who could do my job better, don't mind the dirty work under the sun, or better qualified than I am, or willing to accept a lower pay, I'm quite sure that I wouldn't have got the job in the first place. So I'm filling a need, rather than displacing local workers. This can also be shown thru the exceedingly low unemployment rate in Sg (1.8%). I don't understand how anyone can complain about a lack of jobs with such a low unemployment rate, maybe you should move to Greece or the US and see how's the employment conditions there? </span></p>
              <p>Sg is a democracy, so you can vote for those who believe in your concept of a closed door Sg, you can voice your opinions and you can translate that into reality. It's really quite easy, just tax any company who hires a foreigner by maybe 20% of their salary. If your vision really comes true, I'll be more than happy to leave and contribute my skills and expertise in other countries (benefting them instead).  Unfortunately, I don't think enough people believes in what you believe for that to become a reality (and I think it's best for Sg that it remains the way it is now) </p>

              <p>Last time I checked, Sg enshrines a concept called "freedom of speech". Well if you seriously dislike foreigners that much, just ask the moderators to ban every single foreigner posting here, easy right? Or like what I said earlier, just form a campaign/party to "halau all foreigners away", and win the election, then you'll be able to do what you want most. Anyway it'll be my last post here too, since apparently a foreigner cannot post in this forum without being personally insulted. </p>
              <p>This is ironic too, as Sg is a melting pot, with most of its citizens having migrated here (could be a few years back, could be few decades back), with such low tolerance for foreigners. </p>
