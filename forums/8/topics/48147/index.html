            <div class='col-md body'>A contest was organized by "New Woman Magazine" on "Most<br>Embarrassing Moments" as the topic.The following are some of the few good<br>embarrassing moments that magazine received from several women.<br><br>------- Curl Up and Die --------<br>I walked into a hair salon with my husband and three kids in tow and<br>asked loudly, "How much do you charge for a shampoo<br>and a blow job?"<br><br>------- Pad, please! -----------<br>An insurance man visited me at home to talk about our mortgage insurance.<br>He was throwing a lot of facts and figures at me, and I wanted to<br>follow as best I could, so I told my 6 yr-old son to run<br>and get me a pad.He came back and handed me a Kotex right in front of our guest.<br><br>------- Ho, Ho, Ho -------------<br>I was taking a shower when my 2 year-old son came into the bathroom and<br>wrapped himself in toilet paper. Although he made a mess, he looked<br>adorable, so I ran for my camera and took a few shots. They came out<br>sowell that I had copies made and included one<br>with each of our X'mas cards.Days later, a relative called about the<br>picture, laughing hysterically,and suggested that I take a closer look.<br>Puzzled, I stared at the photo and was shocked to discover that in<br>addition to my son, I had captured my reflection in the mirror wearing<br>nothing but a camera!<br><br>------ Lady Golfer --------------<br>I was at the golf store comparing different kinds of golf balls. I was<br>unhappy with the women's type I had been using. After browsing for several<br>mins, I was approached by one of the good-looking gentlemen who works at<br>the store. He asked if he could help me.Without thinking, I looked at him and said, "I<br>think I like playing with men's balls."<br><br>------ Nuts about You ----------<br>My sister and I were at the mall and passed by a store that sold a<br>variety of nuts. As we were looking at the display case, the boy behind the<br>counter asked if we needed any help. I replied, "No, I'm just looking at your nuts."<br>My sister started to laugh hysterically, the boy grinned, and I turned beet-red and walked<br>away.<br><br>----- Na-na-na-na-nah! -------<br>While in line at the bank one afternoon, my toddler decided to release some<br>pent-up energy and ran amok. I was finally able to grab hold of her after<br>receiving looks of disgust and annoyance from other patrons. I told her<br>that if she did not start behaving right now she would be punished.<br>To my horror, she looked me in the eye and said in a voice just as<br>threatening, "If you don't let me go right now, I will tell Grandma<br>that I saw you kissing Daddy's pee-pee last night!" The silence was deafening after this<br>enlightening exchange. Even the tellers stopped what they were doing. I<br>mustered up the last of my dignity and walked out of the bank with my daughter in<br>tow. The last thing I heard when the door closed behind me were screams of<br>laughter.<br><br>------- Surprise! ---------------<br>It was the day b4 my 18 birthday. I was staying<br>at home, but my parents had gone out for the evening so I invited my<br>girlfriend over for a romantic night alone. As we lay in bed after making<br>love, we heard the telephone ring downstairs. I suggested to my girlfriend<br>that I will give her a nude piggyback ride to answer the phone.<br>When we got to the bottom of the stairs, the lights suddenly came on<br>and a whole crowd of people yelled, "SURPRISE!!!" My<br>entire family: aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins and all my<br>friends were standing there. My girlfriend and I were frozen in a state of<br>shock and embarrassment for what seemed like an eternity. Since then, no<br>one in my family has planned a surprise party again.<br><br>------ Priceless ----------------<br>One of the funniest "most-embarrassing-moments<br>stories I've come upon in a long time was about a lady who picked up<br>several items at a discount store.When she finally got up to the checker, she<br>learned that one of her items had no price tag.Imagine her embarrassment when the checker got<br>on the intercom and boomed out for all the store to hear, "PRICE CHECK ON LANE THIRTEEN,<br>TAMPAX, SUPER-SIZE."That was bad enough, but somebody at the rear of the store<br>apparently misunderstood the word "Tampax" for "THUMBTACKS." In a business-like tone,<br>a voice boomed back over the intercom. "DO YOU WANT THE KIND YOU PUSH IN<br>WITH YOUR THUMB OR THE KIND YOU POUND IN WITH A HAMMER?"<br><br>-------- Mom's Advice -----------<br>A teacher noticed that a little boy at the back of the class was squirming<br>around, scratching his crotch and not paying attention. She went back<br>to find out what was going on. He was quite embarrassed and whispered<br>that he had just recently been circumcised and he was quite itchy.<br>The teacher told him to go down to the principal's office. He was to<br>phone his mother and ask her what he should do about it. He did it and<br>returned to his class.Suddenly, there was a commotion at the back of<br>the room. She went back to investigate only to find him sitting at his<br>desk with his penis hanging out.<br>"I thought I told you to call your mom!" she<br>screamed.<br>"I did," he said, "And she told me that if I<br>could stick it out till noon, she'd come and pick me up from school."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
