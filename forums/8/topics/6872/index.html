            <div class='col-md body'>I used to want to become a singer. I simply love singing. But sadly I know that will never occur. Even though I can sing quite well (a lot of my frens seem to think so), I am smart enuff to know that I am not sufficiently endowed in the looks department to challenge those idols. So I have since given up on that...hahah<br>Right now, my dream is to settle down with my ger fren and have a family of my own. This is because I was never close to my family. I see my parents not more than 2 times every day, sometimes none at all. We seldom talk to one another and we only have a meal together once every year (dinner during the Chinese New Year Eve). That is why I have always longed for a family of my own, one that I can be close to. I am happy to say that this dream is very close to materialising. Our flat will come in around 2-3 years time.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>
