                          VOICE IN THE HEAD</strong></span></p>
              <p><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/308657">(A New Earth, Eckhart Tolle)</a><br> <br> That first glimpse of awareness came to me when I was a first-year student at
                          the University of London. I would take the tube (subway) twice a week to go to
                          the university library, usually around nine o'clock in the morning, toward the
                          end of the rush hour. One time a woman in her early thirties sat opposite me. I
                          had seen her before a few times on that train. One could not help but notice
                          her. Although the train was full, the seats on either side of her were
                          unoccupied, the reason being, no doubt, that she appeared to be quite insane.
                          She looked extremely tense and talked to herself incessantly in a loud and
                          angry voice. She was so absorbed in her thoughts that she was totally unaware,
                          it seemed, of other people or her surroundings. Her head was facing downward
                          and slightly to the left, as if she were addressing someone sitting in the
                          empty seat next to her. Although I don't remember the precise content, her
                          monologue went something like this: "And then she said to me... so I said
                          to her you are a liar how dare you accuse me of... when you are the one who has
                          always taken advantage of me I trusted you.... you betrayed my trust..."
                          There was the angry tone in her voice of someone who has been wronged, who needs
                          to defend her position lest she become annihilated.<br> <br> As the train approached Tottenham Court Road Station, she stood up and walked
                          toward the door with still no break in the stream of words coming out of her
                          mouth. That was my stop too, so I got off behind her. At street level, she
                          began to walk toward Bedford Square, still engaged in her imaginary dialogue,
                          she still angrily accusing and asserting her position. My curiosity aroused, I
                          decided to follow her as long as she was walking in the same general direction
                          I had to go in. Although engrossed in her imaginary dialogue, she seemed to
                          know where she was going. Soon we were within sight of the imposing structure
                          of Senate House, a 1930s high-rise, the university's central administrative
                          building and library. I was shocked. Was it possible that we were going to the
                          same place? Yes, that's where she was heading. Was she a teacher, a student, an
                          office worker, a librarian? Maybe she was some psychologist's research project.
                          I never knew the answer. I walked twenty steps behind her, and by the time I
                          entered the building (which ironically was the location of the headquarters of
                          the "Mind Police" in the film version of George Orwell's novel,
                          1984), she had already been swallowed up by one of the elevators.<br> <br> I was somewhat taken aback by what I had just witnessed. A mature first-year
                          student at twenty-five, I saw myself as an intellectual in the making, and I
                          was convinced that all the answers to the dilemmas of human existence could be
                          found through the intellect, that is to say, by thinking. I didn't realize yet
                          that thinking without awareness is the main dilemma of human existence. I
                          looked upon the professors as sages who had all the answers and upon the
                          university as the temple of knowledge. How could an insane person like her be
                          part of this?<br> <br> I was still thinking about her when I was in the men's room prior to entering
                          the library. As I was washing my, I thought: I hope I don’t end up like her.
                          The man next to me looked briefly in my direction, and I suddenly was shocked
                          when I realized that I hadn't just thought those words, but mumbled them aloud.
                          "Oh my God, I'm already like her," I thought. Wasn't my mind as
                          incessantly active as hers? There were only minor differences between us. The
                          predominant underlying emotion behind her thinking seemed to be anger. In my
                          case, it was mostly anxiety. She thought out loud, I thought-mostly-in my head.
                          If she was mad, then everyone was mad, including myself. There were differences
                          in degree only.<br> <br> For a moment, I was able to stand back from my own mind and see it from a
                          deeper perspective, as it were. There was a brief shift from thinking to
                          awareness. I was still in the men's room, but alone now, looking at my face in
                          the mirror. At that moment of detachment from my mind. I laughed out loud. It
                          may have sounded insane, but it was the laughter of sanity, the laughter of the
                          big-bellied Buddha. "Life isn't as serious as my mind makes it out to
                          be." That's what the laughter seemed to be saying. But it was only a
                          glimpse, very quickly to be forgotten. I would spend the next three years in
                          anxiety and depression, completely identified with my mind. I had to get close
                          to suicide before awareness returned, and then it was much more than a glimpse.
                          I became free of compulsive thinking and of the false, mind-made I.<br> <br> The above incident not only gave me a first glimpse of awareness, it also
                          planted the first doubt as to the absolute validity of the human intellect. A
                          few months later, something tragic happened that made my doubt grow. On a
                          Monday morning, we arrived for a lecture to be given by a professor whose mind
                          I admired greatly, only to be told that sadly he had committed suicide sometime
                          during the weekend by shooting himself. I was stunned. He was a highly
                          respected teacher and seemed to have all the answers. However, I could as yet
                          see no alternative to the cultivation of thought. I didn't realize yet that
                          thinking is only a tiny aspect of the consciousness that we are, nor did I know
                          anything about the ego, let alone being able to detect within myself.</p>

              her monologue went something like this: "And then she said to me...
              so I said to her you are a liar how dare you accuse me of... when
              you are the one who has always taken advantage of me I trusted
              you.... you betrayed my trust..." There was the angry tone in her
              voice of someone who has been wronged, who needs to defend her
              position lest she become annihilated.<br> <br> As the train approached Tottenham Court Road Station, she stood up
              and walked toward the door with still no break in the stream of
              words coming out of her mouth. That was my stop too, so I got off
              behind her. At street level, she began to walk toward Bedford
              Square, still engaged in her imaginary dialogue, she still angrily
              accusing and asserting her position. My curiosity aroused, I
              decided to follow her as long as she was walking in the same
              general direction I had to go in. Although engrossed in her
              imaginary dialogue, she seemed to know where she was going. Soon we
              were within sight of the imposing structure of Senate House, a
              1930s high-rise, the university's central administrative building
              and library. I was shocked. Was it possible that we were going to
              the same place? Yes, that's where she was heading. Was she a
              teacher, a student, an office worker, a librarian? Maybe she was
              some psychologist's research project. I never knew the answer. I
              walked twenty steps behind her, and by the time I entered the
              building (which ironically was the location of the headquarters of
              the "Mind Police" in the film version of George Orwell's novel,
              1984), she had already been swallowed up by one of the
              elevators.<br> <br> I was somewhat taken aback by what I had just witnessed. A mature
              first-year student at twenty-five, I saw myself as an intellectual
              in the making, and I was convinced that all the answers to the
              dilemmas of human existence could be found through the intellect,
              that is to say, by thinking. I didn't realize yet that thinking
              without awareness is the main dilemma of human existence. I looked
              upon the professors as sages who had all the answers and upon the
              university as the temple of knowledge. How could an insane person
              like her be part of this?<br> <br> I was still thinking about her when I was in the men's room prior
              to entering the library. As I was washing my, I thought: I hope I
              don’t end up like her. The man next to me looked briefly in my
              direction, and I suddenly was shocked when I realized that I hadn't
              just thought those words, but mumbled them aloud. "Oh my God, I'm
              already like her," I thought. Wasn't my mind as incessantly active
              as hers? There were only minor differences between us. The
              predominant underlying emotion behind her thinking seemed to be
              anger. In my case, it was mostly anxiety. She thought out loud, I
              thought-mostly-in my head. If she was mad, then everyone was mad,
              including myself. There were differences in degree only.<br> <br> For a moment, I was able to stand back from my own mind and see it
              from a deeper perspective, as it were. There was a brief shift from
              thinking to awareness. I was still in the men's room, but alone
              now, looking at my face in the mirror. At that moment of detachment
              from my mind. I laughed out loud. It may have sounded insane, but
              it was the laughter of sanity, the laughter of the big-bellied
              Buddha. "Life isn't as serious as my mind makes it out to be."
              That's what the laughter seemed to be saying. But it was only a
              glimpse, very quickly to be forgotten. I would spend the next three
              years in anxiety and depression, completely identified with my
              mind. I had to get close to suicide before awareness returned, and
              then it was much more than a glimpse. I became free of compulsive
              thinking and of the false, mind-made I.<br> <br> The above incident not only gave me a first glimpse of awareness,
              it also planted the first doubt as to the absolute validity of the
              human intellect. A few months later, something tragic happened that
              made my doubt grow. On a Monday morning, we arrived for a lecture
              to be given by a professor whose mind I admired greatly, only to be
              told that sadly he had committed suicide sometime during the
              weekend by shooting himself. I was stunned. He was a highly
              respected teacher and seemed to have all the answers. However, I
              could as yet see no alternative to the cultivation of thought. I
              didn't realize yet that thinking is only a tiny aspect of the
              consciousness that we are, nor did I know anything about the ego,
              let alone being able to detect within myself.</p>

              <p>Thinking is actually internal dialogue. There is a block, so that the dialogue is silent.</p>
              <p>Sometimes the block fails, momentarily, and we voice out our thoughts. This is normally when we are excited, surprised or deeply in thought or we make an exclaimation. There is nothing wrong with this.</p>
              <p>However when the block is totally non existing, you will talk to youself. This could be a psychological or biological problem. You need to see a doctor for this.</p>
