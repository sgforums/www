              <p>wat kind of cock question is this?!</p>
              <p>if girls don't get educated, then do wat? work as wat?</p>
              <p>everyone has the right to education!</p>
              <p>if you are gender bias, then effectively you are wasting half of your human resource. Just look at some countries in middle east which is gender bias in terms of economic opportunities against their women. Assuming your population is about half-half in terms of men and women... how effective can you be if you are only using half your brain?  if not for their oil resource, the countries there will still be struggling! and even today, they have to depend on a large % of foreign talent and expats becos they are only using half their brain.</p>
              <p>if not enough of your girls are educated, then wat jobs can they hold? do you want your girl frens, sisters, mothers to dance topless like in patpong in bangkok because they are lowly educated, or do you hope they have better jobs and opportunities?</p>

              <p>that is really sad.</p>
              <p><em>As I leave Uganda, there's a detail of a story that I can't forget. 
              Before receiving help from the RLP, one man went to see his local 
              doctor. He told him he had been raped four times, that he was injured 
              and depressed and his wife had threatened to leave him. The doctor gave 
              him a Panadol.</em></p>

              <p><br>Low birth rate is true because:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Career women got less time for marriage n even if they r married got less time to bring up children</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) More and more career women postpone marriage to 30s, making harder for childbirth (You never hear career women marry at 22: ripe age for giving birth). That is why the Malays and Arabs birth rates are very high because they marry early.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Educated girls sure want men who are more educated and smarter than them. So harder to find a matching.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) You also hear a lot of sg men complaining that they cannot marry women who earn more than them (dunno why so, I dun have a problem wif tat).</p>

              <p>its male ego , if she earn a bit more than the guy still ok, but if its a lot I doubt any guys would be comfortable with that unless the guy status higher than her but she makes more.
