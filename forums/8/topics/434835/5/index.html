              <p>Ever since humans formed a society, the men of this society have always -- and in all cultures -- forced males of all ages to treat girls "better" than boys [without forcing females to do the same]. This 'pro-girl sexism' is [and always was] *far* more intense in non-western cultures -- including that of Singapore -- than in western cultures.</p>
              <p>Here is my list of examples of non-western cultures:</p>
              <p>1. Natives American "Indian" cultures<br>2. Latino cultures<br>3. Russia<br>4. All of Asia<br>5. Turkey<br>6. Kazakstan<br>7. Nations run by Islamic fundamentalists<br>8. All of Africa<br>9. Eastern Europe<br>10. All of what used to be in the Soviet Union location<br>11. Romania<br>12. South and Central Americas</p>
              <p>Please note: I'm not racist, after all, my ancestors are from Singapore. I'm of Tamilian descent but I was born and raised in USA. I can understand Tamil but I can't speak or write it.</p>
              <p>'Pro-girl sexism' = society forces males of all ages to treat a
                                          girl-child "better" than boy-child of the same age and provide this
                                          treatment solely on the basis on gender.</p>
              <p>"Better" = the following:</p>
              <p>1. More compassion<br> 2. More sympathy<br> 3. More respect<br> 4. More gentleness<br> 5. More easiness<br> 6. More empathy<br> 7. More cleanliness<br> 8. More protection<br> 9. More luxury<br> 10. More personal space<br> 11. More privacy<br> 12. More security<br> 13. More freedom<br> 14. More modesty<br> 15. More decency</p>
              <p>... along with *less* physical contact.</p>
              <p>On average, the adult woman:<br> <br> 1. Is physically weaker than the adult man<br> 2. Is more emotional than the adult man<br> 3. Is better behaved than the adult man<br> 4. Is far more likely to be a victim of opposite-gender violence
                                          [e.g. violence may be sexual, domestic, or spousal abuse] than the
                                          adult man<br> 5. Can get or be pregnant whereas the adult man can't<br> 6. Is physically more delicate than the adult man</p>
              <p>Also, it is likely natural for a man to want to treat an adult
                                          woman partially over an adult man -- this is seen in many mammalian
                                          species. For example in many species of large mammals -- such as
                                          bison --, the adult males are rough with each other but tender with
                                          the adult females.</p>
              <p>Due to this, I believe males of all ages should treat adult
                                          women "better" than adult men. However, NO male -- of any age --
                                          should *ever* be socially-mandated to treat girl-children better
                                          than boy-children because this will cause boys to develop an
                                          intense and life-long hatred for young girls and a hatred for the
                                          macho men who teach these boys to defer to girls. This sexism
                                          against boy children will likely cause boys to also despise society
                                          and it's irrational norms.</p>
              <p>In addition, science has already proven that average girl-child
                                          is NOT *innately*:</p>
              <p>1. Weaker<br> 2. More sensitive<br> 3. More delicate<br> 4. Lower-IQed<br> 5. Slower<br> 6. Less energetic<br> 7. Less aggresive<br> 8. Less violent<br> 9. Less cold-hearted [or more hot-hearted]<br> 10. Less openly abusive to members of the opposite gender<br> 11. Less openly sexist against members of the opposite gender<br> 12. More tense<br> 13. More emotional<br> 14. Less emotionally-stable<br> 15. More compassionate<br> 16. More mature in personality</p>
              <p>... than the average boy-child of the same age.</p>
              <p>Boy = male under 18 years of age = child</p>
              <p>Girl = female under 18 years of age = child</p>
              <p>Woman = female who is 18 years of age or older = adult</p>
              <p>Man = male who is 18 years of age or older = adult</p>

              <p>All you have to do is read about basic human history, culture, and anthropology.</p>
              <p>Here is how 'pro-girl sexism' started:<br> <br> It most likely started more than thousands of years ago with a
                                      small gang of strong macho men [the only male homo-sapien humans existing
                                      at the time] who decided that they would treat girls "better" than
                                      boys. The gang singled out male individuals and forced them to
                                      follow and enforce this rule -- they left the females alone. These
                                      male individuals joined the gang and -- out of extreme fear --
                                      began following and enforcing the gang's pro-girl, anti-boy rules.
                                      More and more male individuals began joining this gang -- out of fear
                                      for their own safety -- and submitting to their oppressive anti-boy
                                      regime. This is how the anti-boy, pro-girl gang got bigger. Members
                                      of this gang began teaching their boy-children -- likely through
                                      extreme corporal punishments -- to follow these sexist rules and
                                      pass these rules onto the next generation of children. Fathers who
                                      didn't teach their boy-children to follow this sexism were singled
                                      out by the gang [which was now big enough to be considered a
                                      society] and horrifyingly mistreated along with their helpless
                                      sons.<br> <br> This is my theory as to why 'pro-girl sexism' exists. It exists for
                                      the same reason many other irrational, un-natural societal norms
                                      exists -- they are followed and enforced out of fear of facing
                                      social condemnation.<br> <br> This historical gang of humans I describe pretty much had similar
                                      rules of most of today's street gangs. If they want you, they force
                                      you to join, and if you try to leave, they torture and kill you. If
                                      they see you and don't want you, they torture and kill you
                                      regardless of your actions.</p>
              <p>'Pro-girl sexism' is not at all innate or instinctive. It is an
                                      example of learned behavior that is practiced out of fear and
                                      shame.</p>
