              <p>How so? Different between races? So now it is a race issue?</p>
              <p>it is not race. you can be happy if you live within your

              <p>So, you want polygamy? Did you see the term biological
                                      fertility? Do you understand its meaning? What you suggest doesn't
                                      solve fertility problems.</p>
              <p>it solves the problems on the female side</p>
              <p>Tell me if this isn't about <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>you</strong></span> having

              <p>You are saying that educating women leads to
               their change in attitude towards parenthood, which in turn causes a 
              decline in the birth rate. How do you draw a link between educating 
              women (cause) and change in attitude towards parenthood (effect)? My 
              take is that change in attitude towards parenthood is more possibly due 
              to greater western influence through the media, or even <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>males'</strong></span> preference for smaller families. For example, as a male, I want no more
               than 2 children after marriage. Why are you specifically targetting 
              women as the cause of low birth rate?</p>
              <p>To answer your question on why there are fewer births, I already 
              gave you a list in a post prior to this one... What's more, it is 
              non-exhaustive. I can add the encouragement of birth control by the 
              Singapore Government. In less developed countries, knowledge of birth 
              control is poor, so there are more unplanned-for births.</p>
              <p>So if it is not race related, and is instead about being happy 
              living within your means, then have you considered that the Muslim 
              community is getting the same education for their women as others? By 
              using the Muslim community in your argument, apparently you have some 
              presumptions about their education level and financial standing. (For 
              convenience's sake, Muslims and Malays are used interchangeably)</p>
              <p>Of
               course it doesn't solve the problem of low birth rate due to 
              infertility. In fact, encouraging polygamy will worsen the problem. 
              Simple maths or logic will tell you this. Comparing 2 exactly similar 
              communities, one with monogamy and the other polygamy, both will have the same number of married women.
               However, there will be lesser married men in a polygamous society. 
              Since the birth rate is controlled by the number of women getting 
              pregnant, there will be lesser instances of conception with a smaller 
              pool of men copulating with the same number of women, which means the 
              polygamous society will have a lower birth rate.</p>

              <p>So are you saying muslims are lesser educated than the rest thus higher birth rate ?</p>
              <p>Pls lah, life is about sacrifices. You want something, you sacrifice something. You want money, you work two jobs. You want a baby, you risk earning less money. And now in singapore's enviroment, is it suitable to have babies ?</p>
              <p>Please lah your solution is so childish. As stupid as the government wanting more FT. The babies dont feed on air, even if your concubine has a baby, do you have the money to raise it ?</p>

              <p>You are saying that educating women leads to their change in
              attitude towards parenthood, which in turn causes a decline in the
              birth rate. How do you draw a link between educating women (cause)
              and change in attitude towards parenthood (effect)? My take is that
              change in attitude towards parenthood is more possibly due to
              greater western influence through the media, or even <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>males'</strong></span> preference for smaller families. For example, as a male, I want no
              more than 2 children after marriage. Why are you specifically
              targetting women as the cause of low birth rate?</p>
              <p>To answer your question on why there are fewer births, I already
              gave you a list in a post prior to this one... What's more, it is
              non-exhaustive. I can add the encouragement of birth control by the
              Singapore Government. In less developed countries, knowledge of
              birth control is poor, so there are more unplanned-for births.</p>
              <p>So if it is not race related, and is instead about being happy
              living within your means, then have you considered that the Muslim
              community is getting the same education for their women as others?
              By using the Muslim community in your argument, apparently you have
              some presumptions about their education level and financial
              standing. (For convenience's sake, Muslims and Malays are used
              interchangeably)</p>
              <p>Of course it doesn't solve the problem of low birth rate due to
              infertility. In fact, encouraging polygamy will worsen the problem.
              Simple maths or logic will tell you this. Comparing 2 exactly
              similar communities, one with monogamy and the other polygamy, both
              will have the same number of married women. However, there will be
              lesser married men in a polygamous society. Since the birth rate is
              controlled by the number of women getting pregnant, there will be
              lesser instances of conception with a smaller pool of men
              copulating with the same number of women, which means the
              polygamous society will have a lower birth rate.</p>

              <p>Gender Equality. Let's start by performing National Service.</p>

              <p>AWARE urges more gov’t commitment to gender equality<br>By Liyana Low</p>
              <p>The Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware) is concerned about the Singapore government's level of commitment to gender equality.</p>
              <p>This comes after a United Nations (UN) committee on women's rights highlighted areas of improvement in a report -- dated 27 July -- about gender equality in Singapore.</p>
              <p>In a statement to the press on Thursday, AWARE said it hopes the government can do its best to meet its obligations on some of the key areas mentioned in the report.</p>
              <p>One area highlighted in the report by the UN Convention On the Elimination Of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women(CEDAW) committee was the persistence of domestic and sexual violence against women here -- which it says remains under-reported.</p>
              <p>Other aspects that needed improvement are the implementation of national mechanisms such as a Human Rights institution or anti-discrimination law; and incorporating a definition of discrimination into the legislation.</p>
              <p>The committee also wanted paid maternity leave here to apply to all women employees regardless of nationality and marital status.</p>
              <p>AWARE also expressed concerned with the discrimination of marginalised women in Singapore -- namely the sexual minority, the "foreign wife" and "foreign domestic workers" and women with disabilities in the absence of a clear anti-discrimination mechanism.</p>
              <p>The report from the UN CEDAW committee was in response to Minister of State for Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) Halimah Yacob's presentation on the state of gender equality in Singapore at the UN headquarters in New York two weeks ago.</p>
              <p>AWARE had also made its own recommendations that were presented to the UN to improve women's rights in Singapore. This was its third time submitting such a report.</p>
              <p>Madam Halimah had told the committee that gender equality was important to Singapore's economic growth.</p>
              <p>She said that Singapore had risen to 10th out of 138 countries on the UN Gender Inequality Index, with women's literacy rising to 93.8 per cent and women's participation in the workforce increasing to 56.5 per cent last year, from below 30 per cent in the 1970s.</p>
              <p>In her presentation, she also mentioned that gender stereotypes were disappearing -- though that was "a work in progress."</p>
              <p>Noting that the Singapore government appeared to be more receptive and open to the CeEDAW committee, AWARE still felt that it was being non-committal, especially in areas that were highlighted in CEDAW's report.</p>
              <p>A spokesperson from AWARE said: "We remain concerned about the State's reticence on its obligations to institutionalise CEDAW across the board including in Parliament, the judiciary and law enforcement agencies, schools and the media."</p>
              <p>Requesting the relevant Ministries, especially MCYS, to include civil society actors in public policy consultation, AWARE added, "We also urge the government to set aside a dedicated budget for mainstreaming CEDAW through committed public education, improved data collection and temporary special measures."</p>
