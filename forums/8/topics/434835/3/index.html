              <p>well, why the hell not? </p>
              <p>everyone deserves an education, it should not be an exclusive right to the male. men and women are equal in that sense, although sometimes we find ourselves fulfilling different roles. </p>
              <p>so, why are we not having enough babies? I think there is many possible answer to this question, but education is definitely not one of them. education is not just about going to school and learning how to earn a livelihood - it gives us knowledge of the world around us and cultivate values; it wipes out all the wrong beliefs in our mind. Women have in the past contributed to the development of our society jsut as much as men, who are you to deny them of their education?</p>
              <p>The real problem, in my opinion, is because we're all growing increasingly material. Money and career has become important to us, so much so that some among us are willing to sacrifice having a family for their jobs (although there are personal reasons as well).. which is kinda sad.</p>

              <p>Would you rather return to the Stone Age and become like China?</p>
              <p>There will always be low-achievers in society, and they will always complain. What you are enforcing is similar to that in Malaysia, where Malays are the privileged race, while others have less 'rights'. Look where that got them. Depriving one gender of their rights to education just so that the other have a 'higher' chance of employment is just gonna degrade Singapore's human rights reputation and attractiveness to foreign investors. Essentially, our workforce competitiveness on the global scale will be destroyed.</p>
              <p>But your interest in this is not about the birth rate, is it? It is probably about inability to find a mate, poor job prospects... it is all about your failure as a man. Go take a good look in the mirror before pointing fingers tyvm.</p>

              <p>It could be true. And so are many other factors. You are blaming low birth rate on what is possibly the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>least</strong></span> significant contributing factor.</p>
              <p>It can be the increasing cost of living, of raising a child. It can also be the changing attitudes of couples towards parenthood i.e. preferring lesser children and thus smaller families. It can even be the greater biological fertility problems both men and women are facing today.</p>
              <p>You compare the factors I just listed out with yours, which is more likely to be the critical one?</p>

              <p>2) More and more career women postpone marriage to 30s, making
              harder for childbirth (You never hear career women marry at 22:
              ripe age for giving birth). That is why the Malays and Arabs birth
              rates are very high because they marry early.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Educated girls sure want men who are more educated and

              <p> </p>
              <p>4) You also hear a lot of sg men complaining that they cannot
              marry women who earn more than them (dunno why so, I dun have a

              <p>1) Same thing applies for carrer man</p>
              <p>2) True. But take a while and ponder. Thats not the fault of education. Its more expensive to settle down and have a family nowadays.</p>
              <p>3) And men want to look for angle face and devil figure. So which is more worse ?</p>
              <p>4) Thats because they feel insecure. Because of that we have to ban girls from education ?</p>
