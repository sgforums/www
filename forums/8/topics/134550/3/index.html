            <div class='col-md body'>Tis is one of my favourite chinese movie of all time  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>However I got to recommend NOT to watch part 2 &amp; 3. They r too commercialised and actually spoil the initial beauty of the first show. I mean, it has a good beginning, middle and ending isn't it ? WHy add in parts tat make the story worse ? Furthermore part 2 &amp; 3 make the 2 (andy and tony) incredibly stupid and always make mistakes, unlike the first installment where their intelligence is an attraction.<br><br>My interpretation of the show BEFORE watching 2 and 3 is andy is forced to become a mole for zhen zhi wei. (no money or something) He actually wanna be the good guy, tat is why he prefer to be a good guy being a mole for police than vice versa... tat is why he felt sad tat tony died... Anyway, in real life, the bad guys r not necessary punished and the good guy never really always have a good ending. It is one of the best ending for the show  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>BTW, if andy got caught like the chinese version, the story will be very normal and lousy. A lot of my chinese friends feel nothing after the show because it is just a typical police show liao...<br><br>Talk too much liao... sorry huh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've got all 3 Parts but like Part 1 and 3.  Maybe because Part 2 reflect the younger version of Andy Lau and Tony Leung played by Edison Chen and Shaun Yew.  I have nothing against them but just prefer the older actors.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>In Part 3, the other ying di are Leon Lai and Chen Dao Min.<br><br>There will be a Hollywood version played by Brat Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio but I forgot the title-to-be.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I have a few questions in this part I movie, think that they don't make much sense: (please help to explain)<br><br>1) while police had gun fight with shorty (zhi wei) &amp; his gangsters, how come shorty can easily ciao... and went to a place where Andy Lau only was the only one around. No other police was around except Zhi Wei and Andy Lau.<br>this doesn't make sense.<br><br>2) how come Tony Leung can go out of car before the gun fight? nobody suspected why he got out of the car? Zhiwei didn't suspect as well?<br><br>3) Once Tony Leung knows Andy Lau is the bad guy by sending his handwriting on the envelop, how come he ciao?  he should put the envelope to original placel and pretend nothing happens. he can then get his own identify back and will not die.<br><br>I always thought that this movie (part I) is the best in plot according to Hong Kong movie review. But this movie plot is not good....it doesn't make logical sense.</div>
