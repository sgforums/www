No other police was around except Zhi Wei and Andy Lau.<br>this doesn't make sense.<br><br>2) how come Tony Leung can go out of car before the gun fight? nobody suspected why he got out of the car? Zhiwei didn't suspect as well?<br><br>3) Once Tony Leung knows Andy Lau is the bad guy by sending his handwriting on the envelop, how come he ciao?  he should put the envelope to original placel and pretend nothing happens. he can then get his own identify back and will not die.<br><br>I always thought that this movie (part I) is the best in plot according to Hong Kong movie review. But this movie plot is not good....it doesn't make logical sense.</div></blockquote>1) Because it's a show la, whether or not the shorty ciao, he, still must die because he got surrounded... So better than let the normal policeman kill and got promoted, must let ANDY LAU TO BE A HERO!  *Piang!* he became a hero and got promoted, thus was never suspected he was a mole.<br><br>2)Again, because this is a show, the bad guy must die. There's a lot of flaws in EVERY movie, because due the duration of the film, they have to cut short A LOT of unnesessary things. Such circumstances, the shorty or others might have suspected and he could have explained but all these take so MUCH of a time,  so might as well quickly let the shorty die lah... anyway just a show what...<br><br>3)He ciao because he was shocked! If im not wrong, most people who have reacted this way. If you just made a friend, and suddenly you know this friend is your enemy, given that he is such a high authority, PLUS nobody knows you are a good guy, he can easily arrest you. That's why he run lah! If Andy come back seeing him trying to coverup something, then that's the end for the good guy. So, he ciao?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, gotta say i was baffled by the apparent "flaw" in the part where Tony left abruptly after seeing the envelop...<br><br>Andy was already on his way to returning his identity, anyone with common sense wld have waited to re-establish his identity before trying to expose Andy.<br>Why must Tony run away as a fugutive, then sent a tape to threaten Andy &amp; goes to meet him all alone at the rooftop? The last quarter rely lacks logic, if u think thru carefully.<br><br>But nevertheless, it's a damm cool movie with good plot &amp; actors... long time HK movie was this good since <strong><span style="color: blue;">A better Tomorrow </span></strong><span style="color: #444444;"></span><br><br></div>
