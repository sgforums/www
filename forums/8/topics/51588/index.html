            <div class='col-md body'>No. The fact is by Owen's natural, he should be better than that. Somemore he disappointed the supporters when he should had scored some important goals. Maybe his peak has gone.<br><br>I thought the top scorer is van nisterestroy of Man U?

I do like to see more of Jenas and Viana in action for Newcastle this coming Season cos they add alot of flair in the attacking option. They are still young and have alot of potential to be a good midfield pairing in the years to come.<br><br>Oh yeeeh...IF Sir Bobby Robson pulled off a stunning transfer of Lucio to Newcastle... it would be one of his best buy in his time there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's been some days since the transfer of Kewell from Leeds to Liverpool for 5million pounds. And yet, I still can't believe Houllier managed to get his signature... Incredible stuff for Liverpool.</div>
