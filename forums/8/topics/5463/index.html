            <div class='col-md body'>i had read the posts in this forum and i am really wondering if love really is blind. People can fall in love with chatters or cyber friends in the net; Person can talk about inner beauties and not pyshical appearance; Long known friends can end up be lovers; Enemies of such could be couple, but why?<br>I admit that i am not that handsome and rich compare to hunks along Muhd Sultan but is love that blind that i have to be alone for such a long time and is love that blind that i could not find my true love yet? True enough, fate counts, opportunity slips but why? I got no attitude problems nor i have a foul mouth like a rubbish chute. So can anyone tell me what to do and what am i lacking of...guts maybe? Not sure myself.<br><br>Anyway you guys going out tonight? Where?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep it really is blind....Blind to people like us...ha ha ha:-)<br><br>Sorry, don't feel much like joking, but It came out anyway...just thinking of my X  (long time ago-4yrs ago-...Still miss her a lot).:-(<br><br>As for love being blind and why u aren't hooked yet...let me just say that it's the looks that ur missing buddy(taking that u are average and not handsome...).  Very few people read a book without a cover to attract them.<br><br>If ur face can't get attention, then no way in hell are u gonna get anyone...<br><br>What needs to be done is get attention to urself in a positive way...but then again, when u get that attention, u need the looks to keep that attention long enough to show ur personality...<br><br>so it just boils down to loooks again...<br><br>Sorry, but it really does boil down to that...Altho there are a few that don't go for looks.  U could try tho, but be prepared for total devastation before u get anywhere...good luck man...:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lust can see.. and so can attraction; but love, is definitely blind. true, looks feature a great deal when you first see someone, and if you're considering whether to even talk to him. afterall, do you really want to go out with a fat, short, ugly, sweaty, pimply, hairy lil twerp? i thk not.<br><br>however, is tt considered love? i thk not. love, IMHO, is blind. after you've gotten to know someone, and you've truly love tt person, it doesnt matter anymore, whether he/she's tall/short, fat/thin, rich/poor... you can "forgive" and accept all their shortcomings, because you love tt person. unlike infatuation, you are aware of the person's flaws, and you dont put him up a pedestal thking he's the epitome of perfection. that's when you're in love.<br><br>however, even couples in love break up sometimes due to stuff like difference in financial/family backgrd, status, educational level, etc. IMHO, this doesnt prove tt love isnt blind but rather tt sometimes, even if love is blind, one cannot afford to do the same in life. so you have to be practical and realistic..........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks for replying and i think its true then...love is so unforgiving to be blind. Still, in some opinion from others, it might be a blessing. An average guy having a girl who look like a fairy from heaven but what about the others, drooling for the dreamgirl in every night. After waking up, face the reality man!! Damn! Why the alarm sound at this moment?!?!<br>So, i guess we have to face it, Firewire. Nevertheless, i still believe in one stupid but useful sentence, one can change its fate.<br>Hope to hear more opinions from you all, my friends<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Love is blind to those who only use their eyes to see. The gift of sight is not presented to the eyes alone. It lies in our hearts and our very soul.<br><br>Often we may see beautiful things, and yet we dun feel happy. This is coz our hearts do not acknowledge the beauty. The image of beauty does not extend beyond the eyes.<br><br>And yet, the so-called ugly things may touch our hearts and evoke tears of joy.<br><br>May love blind yur eyes but not yur heart.</div>
