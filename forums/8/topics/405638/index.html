              <p>The CPF board provides education loan to help young people from low income family to finance they're university education. These loans however only provide for students who are studying in government university like NUS and NTU. Their reason is that because government subsidized university course fee are more affordable - an education loan would not hinder their parent's old age savings that way. From what I've found that, the courses offered by SIM usually cost the same if not cheaper. I can not think of  a reason why they only provide for people who are already enjoying government subsidy. The government speak of providing education opportunity for the needy, shouldn't they do the same for people who study at SIM? in my opinion SIM is quite recognized in Singapore in the sense that a considerable number of local student are studying in that university. It makes me wonder what the real intention of the government really is. do they fear the competition may arise if they ease the access to private university? I actually wrote to the CPF on many occasions and all they could say was 'because the regulations are written that way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am a 21 year old who completed national service about half a year ago. I scored 2A's for my preliminary exams and 2 B's for my A level but i got rejected by NUS and NTU science fac after going through their interview because they found out i do not have any CCA achievements. The fact is i was working by the age of 14 to support myself and i don't have time for any CCA commitments. I am now enrolled to SIM and i'm facing a lot of difficulty because I am due to pay for the course fee at the end of this month. I have got some savings from national service and my part time job but they're not enough ( stupid me i did'nt try to save more) Now i'm about $1,500 short. I've consulted my MPs but they only make matter worse. I wrote to CPF board to appeal for a loan but to no avail. I tried to obtain a bank loan but was rejected by all the banks because of my low household income. I have 2 siblings who are still studying and they're doing too badly in school to start working part time like i did. I am working on a project now that will earn me about 1.5k, but the thing is i will only get the money by the end of next month and there's just no way i can ask for advance pay. Many of my friends advised me to start working first and save enough to begin school next year. But they're not me, they do not know how much i wish to ease the financial burden of my family and receive a proper education at the same time. I have no worries about repaying for any loan because I've secured a job that will earn me $1200 for 2 hours a day.</p>
              <p>Does anybody know how else i can seek help from the government? hopefully obtaining a loan.</p>

              <p>Well, since you have "<span style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 15px; color: #333333;">secured a job that will earn me $1200 for 2 hours a day.", work for one month, 2 hours a day, 5 days a week, and you will have 24k. The max you need to pay for one semester is less than 5k, so problem solved!</span></p>

              age savings that way. From what I've found that, the courses
              offered by SIM usually cost the same if not cheaper. I can not
              think of  a reason why they only provide for people who are
              already enjoying government subsidy. The government speak of
              providing education opportunity for the needy, shouldn't they do
              the same for people who study at SIM? in my opinion SIM is quite
              recognized in Singapore in the sense that a considerable number of
              local student are studying in that university. It makes me wonder
              what the real intention of the government really is. do they fear
              the competition may arise if they ease the access to private
              university? I actually wrote to the CPF on many occasions and all
              they could say was 'because the regulations are written that
              way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am a 21 year old who completed national service about half a
              year ago. I scored 2A's for my preliminary exams and 2 B's for my A
              level but i got rejected by NUS and NTU science fac after going
              through their interview because they found out i do not have any
              CCA achievements. The fact is i was working by the age of 14 to
              support myself and i don't have time for any CCA commitments. I am
              now enrolled to SIM and i'm facing a lot of difficulty because I am
              due to pay for the course fee at the end of this month. I have got
              some savings from national service and my part time job but they're
              not enough ( stupid me i did'nt try to save more) Now i'm about
              $1,500 short. I've consulted my MPs but they only make matter
              worse. I wrote to CPF board to appeal for a loan but to no avail. I
              tried to obtain a bank loan but was rejected by all the banks
              because of my low household income. I have 2 siblings who are still
              studying and they're doing too badly in school to start working
              part time like i did. I am working on a project now that will earn
              me about 1.5k, but the thing is i will only get the money by the
              end of next month and there's just no way i can ask for advance
              pay. Many of my friends advised me to start working first and save
              enough to begin school next year. But they're not me, they do not
              know how much i wish to ease the financial burden of my family and
              receive a proper education at the same time. I have no worries
              about repaying for any loan because I've secured a job that will
              earn me $1200 for 2 hours a day.</p>
              <p>Does anybody know how else i can seek help from the government?
              hopefully obtaining a loan.</p>

              <p>Yea I think so too. Is that the only job you have that gives you this money? If so, NDP and YOG don't last the whole year.</p>
              <p>Probably signing on is one of the good choices.</p>

              <p>U can try talking to SIM about the issue...but SIM must be willing to help...as in arranging for U to talk to their decision makers(maybe head of Finance and most likely higher)...and U spending the effort to convince them that U can make up the difference by exam time...</p>
