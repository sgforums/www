            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I really thought those time sharing or dunno what thingy has died long time ago.  But I was wrong...hehe<br><br>A few months ago, a guy called me.  He didn't even know my name.  He said he called to do survey and my number was computer generated to him.  I asked him for his name, company name etc but he quickly brushed me off by saying that he was just doing survey, not selling things to me.  He said his company is just an advertising firm engaged by some resort company to do findings on consumers and their holiday plans.<br><br>He went ahead and asked me a few (really very few) quick questions and then said bye bye.<br><br>A couple of weeks later, a lady called to "verified" that I went through the so-called survey.  I can't quite remember what the 2nd call was about, but it was really a short conversation.<br><br>This evening, a lady called.  The caller id shows 62352967.  It was obviously a tel nbr from town area and I thought I should answer cuz it might be something related to my work.<br><br>Then this lady said I did the survey and have been selected to get the door gifts.  She named all the door gifts like 3 days 2 night to Yun Nan in China, then dunno what dunno what.... Altogether, there were at least 3 door gifts that she mentioned.  I can't quite recall whether she said I was entitled to all of them, or I could choose 1.<br><br>She just went on and on and on, without full stops, commas.  Oh boy... she really has good stamina, cuz she spent 4 mins talking non stop, without pausing to take a breath.<br><br>She said that I didn't have to pay anything, no cash involved, dun have to buy anything.  I knew I should have interrupted her so that she did not have to carry on her pitch.  But I was lazy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   I was relaxing, waiting for the foot masseur to do my reflexology.  So I just let her yada yada yada yada for 4 MINUTES.<br><br>Just like any time sharing company, they die die must make you come down to their place.  This one, she said was at Aldephi.  She was very persistent in getting me there to collect my doorgift.  I tried telling her no.  Well, I did try and if she let me, she wouldn't have wasted so much time on me.  But she chose to go on and on and on, talking about how good the door gift is and I dun need to buy anything.<br><br>So finally, she decided to breathe, then I but in and said "I don't collect free gift one.  If I need the thing, I will buy".  Guess what?  She quickly said "Ok BYE!" and hang up within 1/4 sec.  She sounded angry.  What, I dun like free gift one... cannot meh?</div>

Then if that can't convince you they will show you a video abt how good their companies and resort is at i think is australia watiki resort . Sorry can't remember actual name cos been many years liao . Is abt they ask you ti invest iun a resort room where you can book the room to enjoy the stay for abt 3 days , but if you were to spoil or break anything in the room or resort , you will have to pay for it . The total cost for the investment is ard $20k . And they will make you sign alot of legal papers if you were to fall for their trick.</div>
