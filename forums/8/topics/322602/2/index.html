              <p><br> but what has this man done that you expect him to be locked

              deal.   It is so common to see naked bodies in the
              beaches overseas, so does that mean all these people overseas must
              be locked?  </p>

              <p>You are so silly, why do you think I MUST do what you have suggested?</p>
              <p>Especially when you are confused and agitated about your own sexuality and yourself?</p>
              <p>Why don't you flip the page back to page1 and see the gay idiot who replied to my post?</p>
              <p>And when you realised who is the idiot who first started calling names, then you can do yourself a favor and flip yourself inside out.</p>
              <p>I strongly agree with you that all our accusations MUST be based on FACTS.</p>
              <p>Do you not agree?</p>
