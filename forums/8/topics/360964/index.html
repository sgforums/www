              <p>Gazelle = Buyer ????  ha ha ha ha  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p><em>Thu, May 21, 2009  AsiaOne </em></p>
              <p>The online ad's subject line is simple, but straightforward enough for most people to take a second look.</p>
              <p>It reads, "Wanted: Used women's Lingerie (singapore)".</p>
              <p>According to a report by local Chinese evening daily Lianhe Wanbao, behind the ad is a 25-year-old university student who is looking to purchase women's used lingerie, because he has a fetish for them.</p>
              <p>The advert, posted on the online classified ads and notices site Craigslist, contained a one-line description.</p>
              <p>"Looking for Malay women's used lingerie... don't worry... just find it sexy when it's from a Malay woman... willing to pay well for it... do contact me if any malay women are interested."</p>
              <p>When a Wanbao reporter contacted the seller about the ad, the other party said that he is a 25-year-old university student who enjoys collecting used women's lingerie and has a fetish for them.</p>
              <p>He explains that he is not a cross-dresser and does not use the lingerie for that purpose, and ensures the reporter that he just adds them to his collection.</p>
              <p>However, the buyer insists that the women whom he purchases his "goods" from must be young. When the reporter assumed the identity of a 20-year-old female student, the buyer became very interested.</p>
              <p>He said that he might even be a regular, customer if the deal is a success. He might even purchase the used lingerie as often as one or twice a month.</p>
              <p>The Wanbao reporter also learned from conversations with the buyer that this is not the first time he has purchased used underwear online. However, the transactions were all conducted through the mail, with the money deposited into the seller's bank accounts. The buyer also declined to meet the reporter.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Might need to seek medical help</strong></span></p>
              <p>According to an expert Lianhe Wanbao spoke to, the man who posted this online ad might have a sexual fetish.</p>
              <p>People with sexual fetishes will find themselves being sexually excited by certain items, and will increasingly find themselves dependent on these objects.</p>
              <p>Lianhe Wanbao also reported that research data has shown men with a sexual fetish for women's lingerie are usually loners and are not socially adapt.</p>
              <p>These men are likely to lead a normal life, but should their fetishes become stronger, they would need to seek medical help for their condition.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Conversation between reporter and lingerie buyer</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Buyer:</strong> First things first - how old are you?</p>
              <p><strong>Reporter:</strong> I'm a 20-year-old female student.</p>
              <p><strong>Buyer:</strong> I'm a university student, 25. Are you really interested in selling your lingerie?</p>
              <p><strong>Reporter:</strong> That depends on what you want to use it for.</p>
              <p><strong>Buyer:</strong> What am I going to do with it? It's quite obvious isn't it?</p>
              <p><strong>Reporter:</strong> Are you a cross-dresser?</p>
              <p><strong>Buyer:</strong> Haha... No I'm not a cross dresser and I don't have a fetish for it. I am only interested in buying women's used underwear, that means the underwear that you have worn previously. Don't worry, I just have a fetish for the items, and I don't have any other ill intentions.</p>
              <p><strong>Reporter:</strong> I understand. How many pieces do you want? Do you want bras or panties, or both? Bras go for $100, panties cost $40.</p>
              <p><strong>Buyer:</strong> That's too expensive. I'm willing to buy your used lingerie at $40 for bras and $25 for panties. This is the market price. I'll buy one first, and if you think that there is no problem, I am willing to buy them from you regularly, like once or twice a month.</p>

              <p><br>Personally, I think such fetishes aren't morally correct and that the buyer really might need help, but on the otherhand, I guess it is okay, considering that he doesn't meet up with the seller or goes about stealing lingeries and harrasing others.</p>

              for it... do contact me if any malay women are interested."</p>
              <p>When a Wanbao reporter contacted the seller about the ad, the
              other party said that he is a 25-year-old university student who
              enjoys collecting used women's lingerie and has a fetish for
              them.</p>
              <p>He explains that he is not a cross-dresser and does not use the
              lingerie for that purpose, and ensures the reporter that he just
              adds them to his collection.</p>
              <p>However, the buyer insists that the women whom he purchases his
              "goods" from must be young. When the reporter assumed the identity
              of a 20-year-old female student, the buyer became very
              interested.</p>
              <p>He said that he might even be a regular, customer if the deal is
              a success. He might even purchase the used lingerie as often as one
              or twice a month.</p>
              <p>The Wanbao reporter also learned from conversations with the
              buyer that this is not the first time he has purchased used
              underwear online. However, the transactions were all conducted
              through the mail, with the money deposited into the seller's bank
              accounts. The buyer also declined to meet the reporter.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Might need to seek medical
              help</strong></span></p>
              <p>According to an expert Lianhe Wanbao spoke to, the man who
              posted this online ad might have a sexual fetish.</p>
              <p>People with sexual fetishes will find themselves being sexually
              excited by certain items, and will increasingly find themselves
              dependent on these objects.</p>
              <p>Lianhe Wanbao also reported that research data has shown men
              with a sexual fetish for women's lingerie are usually loners and
              are not socially adapt.</p>
              <p>These men are likely to lead a normal life, but should their
              fetishes become stronger, they would need to seek medical help for
              their condition.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Conversation between
              reporter and lingerie buyer</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>Buyer:</strong> First things first - how old are
              you?</p>
              <p><strong>Reporter:</strong> I'm a 20-year-old female student.</p>
              <p><strong>Buyer:</strong> I'm a university student, 25. Are you
              really interested in selling your lingerie?</p>
              <p><strong>Reporter:</strong> That depends on what you want to use
              it for.</p>
              <p><strong>Buyer:</strong> What am I going to do with it? It's
              quite obvious isn't it?</p>
              <p><strong>Reporter:</strong> Are you a cross-dresser?</p>
              <p><strong>Buyer:</strong> Haha... No I'm not a cross dresser and I
              don't have a fetish for it. I am only interested in buying women's
              used underwear, that means the underwear that you have worn
              previously. Don't worry, I just have a fetish for the items, and I
              don't have any other ill intentions.</p>
              <p><strong>Reporter:</strong> I understand. How many pieces do you
              want? Do you want bras or panties, or both? Bras go for $100,
              panties cost $40.</p>
              <p><strong>Buyer:</strong> That's too expensive. I'm willing to buy
              your used lingerie at $40 for bras and $25 for panties. This is the
              market price. I'll buy one first, and if you think that there is no
              problem, I am willing to buy them from you regularly, like once or
              twice a month.</p>

              <p><br>He probably wanks off to it. It would have much more meaning and thrill if it was your woman's and you're both overseas.</p>
