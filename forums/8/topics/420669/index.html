              vulgarities espoused in the Twitter war will be published as they are 
              here]<br> .<br> <br> After the article ‘YPAP leader paid $10,000 for MM Lee’s book‘ was 
              published, netizens have brought to the attention of The Temasek Review 
              about a Twitter war going on between the said YPAP leader, Mr Cheo Ming 
              Shen and a netizen.<br> <br> Looking at the Twitter records of Bossming (aka Cheo Ming Shen) and netizen Rocksontan in <a href="http://twitter.com/bossming">http://twitter.com/bossming</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/rocksontan">http://twitter.com/rocksontan</a>, apparently, the Twitter war started when a netizen, Rocksontan tweeted the following in the morning on Monday, 17 Jan:<br> .<br> <br> rocksontan: Cheo Ming Shen say LKY is equivalent of Nelson Mandela to Singaporeans?!! Who is this *******kia? <a href="http://twitpic.com/3qr7mm">http://twitpic.com/3qr7mm</a><br> <br> It hit a raw nerve on Mr Cheo and understandably, Mr Cheo replied angrily:<br> <br> bossming: @<a href="http://www.singaporebikes.com/forums/member.php?u=4128">Rock</a>sontan I figure who the **** are u is a bigger question? Oh wait nobody gives a ****. So don’t bother answering.<br> <br> Rocksontan continued at around noon time again:<br> <br> rocksontan: Lawrence just told me the *******kia who say LKY is like 
              Mandela is from a company call Muffnang. Sell ******* one ah? Monday, 
              January 17, 2011 12:22:01 PM via web<br> .<br> Mr Cheo then went on slamming Rocksontan at full throttle:<br> <br> bossming: @<a href="http://www.singaporebikes.com/forums/member.php?u=4128">Rock</a>sontan
               it seems there is only one person selling ******* here. and we know 
              thats you. time to upgrade and sell lampa, naenae, etc. Monday, January

               like perhaps why hiding behind a moniker and your hokkien vulgarities 
              actually make you feel better. Monday, January 17, 2011 12:40:45 PM via

              January 17, 2011 12:41:52 PM via TweetDeck in reply to rocksontan<br> .<br> Rocksontan then dedicated a channel to Mr Cheo which further infuriated him:<br> <br> rocksontan: #WaysLKYislikeMandela They both have white hair #cheomingshen Monday, January 17, 2011 12:55:32 PM via web<br> <br> bossming: @<a href="http://www.singaporebikes.com/forums/member.php?u=4128">Rock</a>sontan

              dedicate “songs” to Rocksontan for the next hour or so. All this while, 
              Rocksontan did not reply to Mr Cheo:<br> <br> bossming: playing with anonymous freaks is quite invigorating. i really 
              understand now why xiaxue enjoys doing it so much. Monday, January 17,

              has to be careful to use their fake moniker account, and not their real 
              one. Monday, January 17, 2011 1:30:13 PM via TweetDeck<br> <br> bossming: 1 little 2 little 3 little rocksons. 3 little 4 little 5

              in reply to rocksontan<br> .<br> In the article ‘YPAP leader paid $10,000 for MM Lee’s book‘, Mr Cheo has
               made a few comments on the discussion thread, confirming the above 
              twitter exchange with netizen Rocksontan. He said, “For the record, 
              rocksontan went personal on me and called me a ‘*******kia’, now I dunno
               about you guys, but if somebody gets personal with me, I get personal 
              back with them.”<br> <br> Mr Cheo is a highly educated person, a graduate from the prestigeous 
              London School of Economics and Political Science and the YPAP Chairman 
              of Toa Payoh East branch. Even though netizen Rocksontan shouldn’t have 
              thrown vulgarities at Mr Cheo in the first place, but is this the way 
              our future leader is supposed to behave – retaliating with more 
              vulgarities and vindictiveness?<br> <br> Singapore will be finished if we are to be led by this sort of revengeful PAP leaders in future.<br> .<br> <br> Benny</p>
