              <p>Hear alot of people complaining that singapore service staffs got very poor attitute and customer service.</p>
              <p>So how exactly do you define good customer service?</p>
              <p>Recently I went to a vcd shop call "Blue Max" at Suntec City.</p>
              <p>The moment I step in only the staff come and ask me what am I looking for. I politely tell her that its ok I will look myself. Because actually I don't want to buy anything. It is lunch time and I am just shopping to pass time than go back to office.</p>
              <p>Throughout my short 5 to 10 minutes in the shop, the same staff at least ask me 3 times the same question again on what am I looking for and I give her the same answer again that its ok I will look myself.</p>
              <p>So is this considered as good customer service?</p>
              <p>I find it very irrating and I think most shoppers in sg are like me we like to see ourself than when we ahve anything we want than we approach the staff to ask for help. This will be the last time I go into that shop again</p>

              <p>Good customer service = able to meet customer's demands efficiently while giving them a pleasant experience IMO</p>
              <p>Your's an example of irritating customer service. The salesgirl might have got the wrong idea that good customer service = making sure customers find what they want. I really dislike it too when I have a salesperson tagging along even though I said I'll look around myself. It can feel like they suspect you to be a thief when they are this watchful sometimes. =/.</p>

              <p>people not suited to be in the customer service line shouldnt be recruited into this line.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ah lians and ah bengs, both young and old, obviously shouldnt be recruited just because of shortage of staff. if you want to attract good customer service staff to join your company, you need to pay them well. some company want to recruit good staff but dun want to pay well. if you pay peanuts, you attract monkeys is the saying. you do not want monkeys to serve your customers isnt it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if your company finds it hard to attract good staff, then you need to continually recruit people throughout the year. if you can find people from other service industry doing their job well, maybe can poach them and pay them well to join your company.</p>

              <p>Thats generalizing. Being part of the sales industry myself, I have to say that not all of the front line staff have bad attitude or do not know how to do their job properly. It really depends on what type of store you are in, when and who is serving you at the time.</p>
              <p>We are all human beings, and if you want every salesperson to greet you and have a set guideline to follow, robots may just take over the job in the near future, no?</p>
              <p>To me, as long as the salesperson isn't rude and speaks politely, that is enough.</p>
