My SUMMARY<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br><br>Usually, words or actions can be misinterpretated among strangers. 'shuo zhe wu xin, ting zhe you yi'...tt's when misunderstandings occur.

Precisely, the PRESENT is wat we r discussing abt! the motion shldnt be an answer since it's supposed to be discussed) although i admit tt i cld have seen &amp; experienced lesser than devil &amp; the rest. I got his pt....tt's why i can empathize. However, if we look at it another way.....I TAKE A NEUTRAL STAND. Guess all along, tt was my msg i wanna get across but keep 'jamming'.....in emotions? I find tt Emotions is the culprit. Emotions can blind one fr u/standing the BIGGER picture, tt's my  STRESSING pt. <span style="font-style: italic;">For example, a couple who loves each other deeply will say nasty things/hurting words during quarrels. They may not mean it but yet cant help it.</span> One can only see clearly when taking away the emotions. Thus, back to my wat i've been trying to EMPHASIZE again. My opinions dun have to be agreed with but maybe some r not able to see wat i mean since....A Bigger View(actual issue) is BLINDED by Emotions. Anyway, Time will tell. Why assume tt it's only U, may be ME...or US? Juz do our part &amp; make this world a better place to live in <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
