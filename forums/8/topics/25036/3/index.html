Since you put it this way, let's write in 'plain English' then...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Singapore is SUPPOSE to be ONE UNITED NATION. The way I see it, it's slowly separating into AT LEAST 2 classes.... The RICH and POWERFUL... The POOR and HELPLESS.... NO OFFENCE, just look at Indonesia and you'll know where that's gonna lead us... To add, Singapore is verymuch UNLIKE Indonesia... No resources no land.... How well have we been treated by our government for the past few years... To be FAIR, I would say the policies they applied have it's PROs and CONs... It's LAYERS.... Of course I won't be able to read what's really behind their mind....<br><br>The general disappointments that's dangling in the air.... It's a matter of TRUST and adherence between this '2 layers'.... A CRUCIAL POINT to the future of ALL OUR EXISTENCE.... (No offence, but unless there's an alternate plan to replace part of the population with foreigners...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  Don't panic please..? This is just a PRESUMPTION...?) TRUST between the government and the citizen of a nation is not only a problem in Singapore, but also a problem in MANY other countries... Just that you can say it's MORE SIGNIFICANT in this country...? Why? Because this place's small... It's SECURED and it's WELL-CONTROLLED... It's like having your daddy dragging you by your shirt collars telling you where he wants you to head for..... TRUST in this case makes a VERY BIG DIFFERENCE... The guy pulling you by your collars... Is he your TRUSTED DAD, a STRANGER? Or YOUR ENEMY...? As simple as that... TRUST.... The CRISIS and IRONY of all this if you've not realised by now.... Our government has not developed much of that YET.... At least not in a 'complete sphere'.. Because this man has got STRONG ARMS.... He thought he don't need you to trust him..? Never thought he would fall sick one day...?<br><br>Now he tells you tales and stories.... Like a grandpa talking to his grandchildrens... But all those 'folktales' just sound SO SIMILAR...? HOW do we DIFFERENTIATE...? I believe Singaporeans don't really want stories..? They want ACTION in a POSITIVE SENSE.... REAL ONES... Not just 'wayang shows'....?<br><br>If only this guy could loosen his hands a little and not just a 'fake move' just prelude to a 2nd grabbing.... Something SOLID.... We can pull through this together.... And the METHODOLOGY? Haven't the government been ENCOURAGING OPEN MARKET and GLOBOLISATION? Split POWER into RESPONSIBLE hands... Not just SHOW(s)... See the effects of 'MONOPOLYSING'...? Now even the major companies in Singapore are following the foot steps of this GIANT MAN....<br><br>I say EITHER we pull it through TOGETHER as ONE UNITED PEOPLE, or we DIE in MANY PIECES.... But of course, nobody would be interested if it's gonna end in such a way that they're still gonna die as PART of a UNITED PEOPLE anyway...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

However, though i may be 21 yrs old, i wished as much to be thinking like a young kid. A kid can be simple n less complex in thinking. We have been trained to survive in this world not to be exploited by others, therefore to explain why we tend to guess or suggest the motives others may have when they have any requests. Kids only know tt as long as he has gotten wat he wants, tt's enuff. It's sounds NAIVE but dun u think tt the naivety reveals less complexity, highly-contained EQ &amp; FOCUSED?<br><br>Not tt i do not agree tt a TRUST is an essential element. So, let me pose this qn: "When will u trust the govt? Wat kind of steps shld they take bfe they can gain ur full trust in them?" In fact, i've said tt i dun feel the attachment to Sg but i hope to. I'm AWARE of the need to do so. My trust for Sg's govt is the confidence i wanna give to the leaders of Sg who represent us, who want to flourish the name of Singapore n make me feel proud as a Singaporean. Again, i agree tt the easiest way to label as "Good Govt" is to please us all...do wat we want them to but is tt the rite way? How many comments n opinions r there? who r the ones to express them? r they suggesting a solution to benefit the country or on a personal basis? Reveals less complexity, highly-contained EQ &amp; FOCUSED at problems or Enlarged Problem? All these need to be taken into considerations.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> If u r the newly-appointed manager in a big co, in this bad economy times, u r lucky to escape the retrenchment. However, u have an even tougher task ahead than to keep the job. U may need to list 5 names in ur dept to be asked to leave(retrench) due to cutting cost n eliminating under-performing staffs. What wld u do? Maybe quitting is the best solution? u dun have to suffer wrong accusations by then. Or better, please everyone! Let everyone stays! Well, i cant agree much.
