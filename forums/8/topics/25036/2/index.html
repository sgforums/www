            <div class='col-md body'>Minister: NEWater wonÂ’t affect our stand<br><br>KOTA TINGGI: NEWater, SingaporeÂ’s newly-discovered water source, is not expected to have a significant effect on MalaysiaÂ’s stand on the water pricing issue.<br><br>The two countries are expected to start their second round of negotiations on the water supply issue and several other outstanding matters on Sept 2.<br><br>Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar said Malaysia did not see how the republicÂ’s new water source could be used as a Â“bargaining toolÂ” by Singapore.<br><br>He said Malaysia was not perturbed by SingaporeÂ’s announcement that it had succeeded in recycling waste water into drinking water and that this would reduce their dependence on water supplied from Johor.<br><br>Â“We donÂ’t feel we are going to lose a lot if Singapore thinks it can live on recycled water.<br><br>Â“If they donÂ’t need our water, why should we be worried when we can use it for ourselves.<br><br>Â“We should not be angry if they want to drink NEWater. It is up to them and it will not have any significant impact on our stand on the water issue,Â” he told newsmen after officiating at a Kemas kindergarten day here yesterday.<br><br>Apart from water, the other issues that form a package for discussions are the redevelopment of KTM land in Singapore, use of Malaysian air space by the Singapore Air Force, release of West Malaysian workersÂ’ Central Provident Fund money and Customs, Immigration and Quarantine facilities in Singapore.<br><br>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong told Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin recently that his government would allow one of the two water agreements with Malaysia to lapse as the republic could rely on the recycled water.<br><br>Syed Hamid said Malaysia was Â“openÂ” to the issue and would present a new price formula in the next round of negotiations which he described as Â“competitive and should suit SingaporeÂ’s demandÂ”.<br><br>Â“At the last meeting, they wanted a more competitive price, so we will submit our formula based on the level of competitiveness they want.<br><br>Â“If they refuse to accept the offer, we may have to get the courts to decide on the price.<br><br>Â“I must stress that we are not renewing the agreements that expire in 2011 and 2061. Instead, we are willing to sign a new agreement for Singapore to obtain supply from a new source, Sungai Sedili,Â’Â’ he said.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lawyers dispute Singapore opposition chief's claim<br>By John O'Callaghan<br><br>SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Lawyers for Singapore's two most senior leaders have contested claims by an opposition politician being sued for defamation that he issued a public apology under duress.<br><br>A letter sent to Reuters on Wednesday by Drew &amp; Napier, the law firm representing Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, said Chee Soon Juan "fabricated his evidence to avoid judgment" at a closed-door hearing on Tuesday.<br><br>Goh and Lee are suing Chee over his suggestions in the run-up to last November's general election that the government lent S$17 billion ($9.7 billion) to former Indonesian president Suharto.<br><br>Chee, the head of the Singapore Democratic Party, may face financial and political ruin next week when a High Court registrar decides whether to send the case to trial or find him liable for damages.<br><br>Lawyers for Goh and Lee argued at Tuesday's hearing that Chee had gone back on an agreement to pay damages and costs after apologising publicly, the letter said.<br><br>Chee told the court he had apologised on October 31, the letter said, because he was under pressure from colleagues in his party who feared similar legal action.<br><br>But Goh and Lee's lawyers argued that a statement by the senior minister about potential action against other candidates in Chee's party was published in a newspaper only on November 1.<br><br>"When this lie was pointed out, Dr Chee changed his position and said that the threat was made by PM Goh before 31 October 2001," the letter said.<br><br>"But lawyers for PM Goh and SM Lee pointed out that Dr Chee was unable to point to any evidence of a threat by PM Goh and that Dr Chee was making up his case as he went along."<br><br>"WHERE'S THE MONEY?"<br><br>Chee, who represented himself after his requests for foreign lawyers were turned down, told reporters outside the court his apology "was made under duress and intimidation".<br><br>Goh and Lee deny a loan was ever made to Suharto and say Chee's comments were understood to mean they were "dishonest and unfit for office" because they had misled the public.<br><br>Chee followed Goh on the campaign trail shouting "Where's the money?" through a loudhailer.<br><br>The two leaders' civil suits put Chee in the company of several opposition politicians sued by members of the long-ruling People's Action Party, often for hefty damages.<br><br>Critics have slammed the various lawsuits as a tactic to curb political activity and free speech. Ruling party officials say they resort to the courts only to defend their reputations.<br><br>Chee said damages and costs could hit S$1 million ($568,200).<br><br>"I'll be bankrupted and as a bankrupt then I am not able to stand for elections," he said on Tuesday. "I will continue on the struggle and I will not be silenced."<br><br>The free-speech proponent and former university lecturer has already lost his right to contest the next general election after being fined for speaking in public without a permit.<br><br>Veteran opposition politician J.B. Jeyaretnam was bankrupted last year after defaulting on an instalment from a defamation judgment involving some ruling party members.<br><br>The People's Action Party, first under Lee and now under Goh, has kept a lock on parliament since independence in 1965. It won 82 of 84 seats last November and has never lost more than four seats in any election.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A look in the mirror reveals some hard truths<br>By Chua Lee Hoong<br><br>THE Prime Minister launched a challenge to Singaporeans on Sunday, and it careened into a wall of raw nerves. 'Look yourself in the mirror and ask, 'Am I a stayer or a quitter? Am I a fair-weather Singaporean or an all-weather Singaporean?' ' Mr Goh Chok Tong asked during his annual National Day Rally speech, and since then, the bandwidths have been flooded with howls of protest:<br><br>It's not fair to label all who migrate as 'quitters'! The Government should examine how its own policies have contributed to people wanting to leave! It's double standards to be placing foreign talent - 'quitters' of another country - on a pedestal while denigrating local citizens who uproot as fair-weather Singaporeans! And so on and so forth.<br><br>Was that fair criticism? To my mind, half and half. A reading of the full text of the speech shows that Mr Goh was at pains not to tar all who have emigrated or who have ever thought of doing so as quitters:<br><br>'Fair-weather Singaporeans will run away whenever the country runs into stormy weather. I call them 'quitters'. Fortunately, 'quitters' are in the minority. The majority of Singaporeans are 'stayers'. 'Stayers' are committed to Singapore. Rain or shine, they will be with Singapore. As we say in Hokkien, pah see buay zao(refusing to run despite being beaten to death).<br><br>' 'Stayers' include Singaporeans who are overseas, but feel for Singapore. They will come back when needed, because their hearts are here. The Singapore nation is not just those of us living here, but also the thousands of loyal Singaporeans who live around the world.<br><br>'Let me stress that I am not criticising all Singaporeans who have emigrated. But I take issue with those fair-weather Singaporeans who, having benefited from Singapore, will pack their bags and take flight when our country runs into a little storm.'<br><br>Infer from those words that being in Singapore does not mean being with Singapore. Living here does not make one a 'stayer'.<br><br>By emphasising that the Singapore nation also covers the thousands of loyal Singaporeans living around the world, Mr Goh effectively widened the notion of the Singapore nation beyond these 24 km by 36 km shores.<br><br>Not that this is the first time he is doing so. Remember the Singapore 21 notion of the Singapore Heartbeat? That 1999 vision sees the ideal Singaporean as one who, wherever he is in the world, remains rooted emotionally to the country, because this is where his family, friends and memories are. This is his best home, which he will return to whenever necessary to defend it.<br><br>The dichotomy between 'quitters' and 'stayers' is very much a variation on the same theme, except that the words this time are more loaded, more emotive - thus attracting more attention. And even then, the dichotomy is not new. Way back in 1969, the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had thrown up the issue for public discussion.<br><br>His question addressed the educated young of that time. It created a ruckus.<br><br>Mr Goh's Sunday question addresses the educated young of today. It should be no surprise that it has aroused a similar reaction.<br><br>The people whom the question most targets also count among the most vocal in Singapore. Well-educated and proficient in English, when they howl, they make their howls heard.<br><br>This time round, however, the question comes at a time when it might be seen as adding insult to injury.<br><br>When you've had your nerves gnawed raw by months of economic hardship, it's easy to ignore the big picture that the PM wants you to see even if, deep down, you understand how important that is.<br><br>Many of these English-speaking Singaporeans, whether lawyer, stockbroker or stockbroker-turned-taxi-driver, are still feeling the pinch of massive pay cuts and job uncertainties.<br><br>So even if they do understand the bigger picture - the need for Singaporeans to root themselves to the country; the need to be more self-reliant, and so on - they won't take kindly to being accused of being potential 'quitters'.<br><br>A second reason for the reaction: Oversimplification. The young person fresh out of university stays abroad for reasons very different from someone in his 30s or 40s who uproots and leaves. Few depart just because of 'some temporary storm'. Perceived government reluctance to take the reasons seriously add to their sense of grievance.<br><br>Then there is, I think, a third reason, not articulated much so far but which can be summarised as a feeling of helplessness. People want to belong, but don't know how - or even to what.<br><br>Undergraduate Crystal Tien, 20, told The Straits Times the other day: 'The PM should think about how he can get the quitters to be stayers. Personally, I'm a quitter because I do not feel much attachment to Singapore.'<br><br>I find the last statement indescribably sad because, quite palpably, this is one young person who would feel passionately for Singapore if she could - but is unable to because there has been little in her 20 years of life to ignite that feeling.<br><br>Is it because of her parents? Or the Government? Or society in general? No doubt, all three play a role; all three are interdependent after all.<br><br>But as the dominant force in Singapore, the Government really should do a stock-take of all its actions over the years and determine how these have contributed to sentiments of indifference towards the country. Have they come about in spite of, or because of, actions by the Government? Actions which need not even be policies, but little decisions by the by. It is so easy to mount massive campaigns to be more rooted to Singapore, but forget that little deeds and measures may be sending quite different signals instead.<br><br>Take for instance the discount booklets which seem to have become a routine part of the goodie bag dished out at the National Day Parades. What national pride, what attachment to the nation, do you foster when attending the parade - the one annual collective celebration of nationhood - is rewarded with rag merchant discounts and vouchers for cheaper facials? Thanks, but no thanks.<br><br>So, are Singaporeans 'stayers' or 'quitters'? Mr Goh's question was a necessary reminder to the population of the part they have to play.<br><br>But, equally, the anger and criticisms expressed since then are also necessary reminders to the Government that a successful nation cannot be forged by edict alone, but through a diligent and honest partnership with the people.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AngelDark little kiddo.<br><br>Take a number and stand in the queue if you want an arguement. Flaming, moi, not to that stage yet. Harsh words of discussion, yes. There is no denying that your FireIce is a sarcastic bitch. Look at the way she responds. What is so funny about our PM drinking Newater? This is not a one off incident, open your eyes and read most of her postings. I don't base my facts on a stand alone incident. I might be one of those few who are willing to stand out and point that out, but there are other people who felt the same, just that they did not voice out.<br><br>I picked on FireIce because of the same passionate reasons (you claimed you can't stand people flaming) that she only knows how to be sarcastic and I can't stand her sarcastic manners. Can I stop her? I don't think so. Why? This is because it is her freedom to free speech in this forum. So right now, I am exercising my right to do that as well.<br><br>Which is more important, being able to avoid a direct confrontation over water issue or living under their thumbs forever? Now that we are moving towards self reliant on water, why can't we do our best to achieve it? Why do you insist on offering our necks to the pigs up there?<br><br>Before I end, are you so desperate to have a sister? Dun you have your own siblings (That's a flame...intentional...yes)? But I would like to be gracious to apologise on that flame, after all you are a kiddo who needs lots of sisterly love. Wish your "brother and sister" love remains strong.<br><br>And when an arguement is about national survival, there is no preferrence towards any sex. PM Goh was a gentleman, but does your "Lady" fireice act like one gracious lady? I don't think so. Respect the lady, wait till she earns it.</div>
