He's saying that the ad attempts to equate 'contraceptive' to 'wedding ring'.<br><br>Such an association degrades marriage as an institution, and stable family ties as a building block of society. Since the govt recognises stable and strong families as a building block of society, some govt department needs to be responsible to vet advertisements to ensure that they are in line with the mainstream societal values and ethos.<br><br>The article's call for relevant govt depts to exercise more oversight is justifiable. But the govt dept concerned of course also reserves the right to respond or not respond.<br></div></blockquote>Pray, specifically how would contraceptives degrade marriage as an instituition? For some married couples, no contraception means bearing more kids than they can afford. And this lead to stable and strong families? This is the exact problems they have in developing countries - no contraception, too many kids in poor families.<br><br>Not forgetting, in Singapore, you are asking a government who dictate how many kids we must have to even dictate the use of condoms? Huh?<br><br>And what are Singapore's mainstream societal values and ethos? Are you sure these are universal values?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's quite strange that there is nothing on his blog that suggests he is an extremist, and knowing what he is in his daily life merely affirms what he is. do u actually thought that has been detrimental in this discussion? would it have the same effect if i had merely stated that he is xtian? at least giving him a friendster profile gives us an idea of how he is like.<br><br>do u know why i have set it in the first post? if not, we will merely be disgraded to a discussion dictated by a first few posts of innocent forummers who come in and say things like, "is he human?" or "is he a man?" and no one looking at the kind of background he is coming from.<br><br>if i simply put a note saying he is a xtian, or just a staunch one, would u not guarantee tat ppl will be misled and start stereotyping faster than they type here? their minds would have wondered elsewhere. it's better setting the record right. this is what he type, verbatim. i dun judge (other than giving my viewpoint and invoking a discussion) him based on wat he type and then cover it up completely saying "this guy is like this, this guy is like that" which is dangerous, i provide the resource for everyone to read it for himself and make his stand.<br><br>i put this here so that we can have a proper discussion about it, cos, indeed, the discussion has degraded to senseless one-liners at edmw and no one had posted it here. we had discussed such difficult topics like jc-poly (pls dun start again) and things like tat, why not this?<br><br>in any case, i have put my stand that he is not going to do any good to xtians in general. i've been in and out of the xtian circle, and i've been in discussions with a lot of outsiders who had misjudgements about xianity, and shun it at any meagre attempt to explain. evangelism will become harder. this will only make the task harder. this is my view. in any case, i'm standing on top of it, not saying he is right or wrong, but telling you this is the consequence.</div>

You brought up the word. Mainstream doesn't mean universal.

Anybody with business sense would know that Durex would probably prefer it to be categorized as the former case, so as to reach a wider market.

            <div class='col-md body'>Again, people still cannot specifically state how contraception can degrade marriage. Its not enough to say marriage is marriage, contraception is contraception and whats all this talk about giving partner IUD? I see contraception as a first an foremost guard against unwanted pregnancy in pre-marital sex, if and only if we cannot forestall such action. It plays a part in marriage, by inculcating the values of family planning, rather than bearing more kids than one could afford. Of course, religiously, i cannot prescribe such course of action for Catholics or the Muslims.<br><br>Will contraception then degrade the instituition of marriage? Rather, contraception plays a part in the instituition of marriage, and other things, including prevention of unwanted pregnancy, AIDS, STDs and other ills.<br><br>In an argument, its not enough to state your own values in the guise of a good analysis. Its not enough to state marriage is marriage, contraception is contraception, and then stating that anyone would doesnt know is confused. The validity of your argument is challenged when people starts to ask 'why would these two be mutually exclusive?'. I have already pointed out how these two things are linked.<br><br>Again, I found someone trying to apply the utilitarian-Jeremy Bentham-what not views in rather disturbing ways. Pray what is defined as the mainstream values and norms, I asked this before, before you blatantly state that the government has the duty to uphold the societal norms and values yada yada.<br><br>Because this sounds a lot like the PAP, when questioned about matters such as censorship, George Yeo, for example, was yakking away about Asian conservative values without defining what they are, and worse of all, to simply state that and turn that into a policy 'supported by the majority' of Singaporeans.<br><br>Its not universal as you admit, that has broken some freedom of  rights, you could not define and prove what they are, you have already exhorted a dictatorial-utilitarian view so commonly used by authoritarian government. I think, before the debate goes on, we have to stop this value-stating as if they are right and happened to be there, before anyone could could go in and analyse the issues deeper.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laurence82:</div><div class="quote_body">Again, people still cannot specifically state how contraception can degrade marriage. Its not enough to say marriage is marriage, contraception is contraception and whats all this talk about giving partner IUD? I see contraception as a first an foremost guard against unwanted pregnancy in pre-marital sex, if and only if we cannot forestall such action. It plays a part in marriage, by inculcating the values of family planning, rather than bearing more kids than one could afford. Of course, religiously, i cannot prescribe such course of action for Catholics or the Muslims.<br><br>Will contraception then degrade the instituition of marriage? Rather, contraception plays a part in the instituition of marriage, and other things, including prevention of unwanted pregnancy, AIDS, STDs and other ills.<br><br>In an argument, its not enough to state your own values in the guise of a good analysis. Its not enough to state marriage is marriage, contraception is contraception, and then stating that anyone would doesnt know is confused. The validity of your argument is challenged when people starts to ask 'why would these two be mutually exclusive?'. I have already pointed out how these two things are linked.<br><br>Again, I found someone trying to apply the utilitarian-Jeremy Bentham-what not views in rather disturbing ways. Pray what is defined as the mainstream values and norms, I asked this before, before you blatantly state that the government has the duty to uphold the societal norms and values yada yada.<br><br>Because this sounds a lot like the PAP, when questioned about matters such as censorship, George Yeo, for example, was yakking away about Asian conservative values without defining what they are, and worse of all, to simply state that and turn that into a policy 'supported by the majority' of Singaporeans.<br><br>Its not universal as you admit, that has broken some freedom of  rights, you could not define and prove what they are, you have already exhorted a dictatorial-utilitarian view so commonly used by authoritarian government. I think, before the debate goes on, we have to stop this value-stating as if they are right and happened to be there, before anyone could could go in and analyse the issues deeper.<br><br></div></blockquote>The idea is that even if contraception is sometimes beneficial within a marriage, but if contraception is equated to marriage, then the concept of marriage is degraded, because marriage should be much much more than just contraception alone.<br><br>Thus stated succinctly. I can't help it if you refuse to read it.<br><br>I didn't suggest they're 'mutually exclusive'. You're the one who suggested that. And then you went on to say why they're not mutually exclusive. Except no one else here said they're mutually exclusive to start with.<br><br>Certainly I agree 'contraceptives' would be helpful to poor developing countries. I'm not too sure though that 'sex toys' would be one of the high-priority things developing countries need. As for whether we should have sex toys and the ads widely available in S'pore, that is still an open question.<br><br>Values are hard to define, but they are something that can be felt. I'm not as well-versed in language as you, using arcane phrases such as 'utilitarian-Jeremy Bentham-what not', so I don't feel justified in pretending to be qualified to try to define values. A failure to define mainstream values does not mean they don't exist. A lot of societies have values, which are difficult to describe fully in words, partly because values are fuzzy, and definitions cannot cover all situations encountered in real-life.<br><br>Values also shift over time. They are not laws, or a constitution. If you have some urls how other countries have successfully defined their mainstream values, you might want to provide them here for our reference. If these are hard to find, perhaps there's a reason, that it's because most countries recognize the difficulty of trying to define and encode intangible things. I can't do any better.<br><br>Yet that has not deterred governments or watchdog bodies elsewhere from stepping in to reject ads, publications, radio shows, TV programs, movies which may cross over fuzzy lines of good taste or public morality, etc etc, in many countries. The lack of 'values' definitions satisfactory to you has not stopped many conservative countries' govts from doing what they need to do. The practice is not unique to Singapore. We may have to be content with a lack of a set of hard-and-fast definitions for now.<br><br>Seeing PAP's style in my post? That's a good one. Who's been attending many political rallies? Not me.<br><br>Your posts tend to put words into my mouth.<br><br>It's good to have an opinion, you're entitled to your own opinion and to argue it, but don't falsify my opinion. I never said any two particular things are 'mutually exclusive'.</div>
