Remove them.</span></strong><br>His blog......... <a href="http://unrehearsed.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://unrehearsed.blogspot.com/</a><br>His friendster...........<a href="http://www.friendster.com/user.php?uid=2654158" rel="nofollow">http://www.friendster.com/user.php?uid=2654158</a><br><br>The Straits Times<br>May 15, 2006<br><br>I was at the 7-Eleven store at Ginza Plaza when I noticed a poster on the sale of a 'vibrating sex ring' by Durex.<br><br>The poster was placed prominently on the store front and the product advertised was on offer. Despite the fine print stating that it was for sale only to those above 18 years, it depicted the sex toy as a wedding ring. It desecrates the sanctity of marriage with such an association.<br><br>Such morally questionable products should not be advertised so prominently in a family store.<br><br>I would like the management of Durex and 7-Eleven to explain the rationale for placing such advertisements in the stores as they could infect the minds of young students.<br><br>Does the relevant government department vet such advertisments? Are there no laws to govern the display and promotion of such products?<br><br>Despite the propagation of objectionable materials on the internet, the authorities and civil society should take steps as far as possible to stop such advertisements from polluting our young minds.<br><br>Lucas Ho Wei-Jie<br><br>lai lai lai, such a hot topic no one post in sgForums??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

The viewpoints expressed are his own, and are just traditional. Lucas could be Buddhist, or Muslim, or Hindu, for all we care. His article doesn't tarnish any image of any religious group.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ^tamago^:</div><div class="quote_body">judgement is exclusive to everyone.<br><br>if u have no qualms about the kind of damage he is causing to his religion, then it is not within my agenda to push. i'll only warn of its consequences, u make ur stand.<br><br>it's just like how ppl view islam during the aftermath of 911, and how ppl immediately associate it with terrorism, before the leaders, secular and religious, came out to clear the air.<br><br>the innocent and the fence-sitters will detest xtianity cos of the damaging behaviour of the few vocal ones.</div></blockquote>(Criticism of Durex ad) equals to (11/9/2001 Terrorist acts that killed thousands) ???<br><br>Don't be silly.<br><br>And if you really want to so-called 'warn' him, then email him directly, instead of publicizing his blog and friendster.<br><br>Shame on you.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laurence82:</div><div class="quote_body">But the thing took a twist when he question the promotion of kinky stuff such as a vibrating condom and the relation it had to marriage. Notwithstanding the fact we can no longer regulate how our youngs think and act by coercion or whatever, including having pre-marital sex, I dont see what is the problem of promoting something that could at the very least try to prevent unwanted pregnancy. I think he think too much.<br><br></div></blockquote>Read Lucas' article again. He's saying that the ad attempts to equate 'contraceptive' to 'wedding ring'.<br><br>Such an association degrades marriage as an institution, and stable family ties as a building block of society. Since the govt recognises stable and strong families as a building block of society, some govt department needs to be responsible to vet advertisements to ensure that they are in line with the mainstream societal values and ethos.<br><br>The article's call for relevant govt depts to exercise more oversight is justifiable. But the govt dept concerned of course also reserves the right to respond or not respond.<br></div>
