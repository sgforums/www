              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Hi,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I have failed to lodge the Annual Return and hold AGM since financial year 2001.

Its name was changed to its current name, 3P Access Pte Ltd, in 27 Jun’01 for the purpose of a Joint Venture. At that time, Johnson Ho introduced myself to Cai Mao(a director the company since 1998), and Derek Goh and the 3 parties decided to start a Joint Venture(JV) business together. </span></p>

I was in the 1<sup>st</sup> group and hold 78% of the shares in the Company with Winston Lau and myself as the appointed directors. Global Voice Pte Ltd (GV) was in the 2<sup>nd</sup> group and hold the remainder, 22% of the shares in the Company, with Cai Mao remained as a director. Derek Goh was a major shareholder of GV. GV had an internet telephony and international communication services in Singapore and the Company was to engage in the business of marketing and promoting GV’s services.</span></p>

The JV business was operated from GV’s premises and around 7 staff was recruited.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 27pt; text-indent: -27pt; text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

The debt included 7 staff salaries and more than 6 creditors. GV was one of the creditors.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 27pt; text-indent: -27pt; text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

The Company ceased operations on 15 Jan’02 and the staff were not paid their salaries for Dec’01 and Jan’02. The Company had unsettled debts and liabilities of around $35,000 when it ceased operations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 27pt; text-indent: -27pt; text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

For this purpose, I had engaged a liquidator with my own money to advise the Company. GV was not agreeable to the liquidation unless the debt of $17,397.91 owing to them was settled by the Company before other creditors. I did not agree to the amount claimed by GV, and in any event, I felt strongly that if any of the creditors were to be paid, the staff had to be paid first and not the shareholders. I, being the co-signatory of the cheques for the Company with GV, refused to sign the cheque to pay GV.</span></p>

However, I was barred from having access to the accounts of the Company unless I agreed to sign the cheque to pay GV. I refused to sign the said cheque.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 27pt; text-indent: -27pt; text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

I was not successful in my attempts. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 27pt; text-indent: -27pt; text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

Cai Mao and I got together for a discussion. Essentially, it was proposed that the monies left in the bank account was to be utilised towards paying the auditors to file the annual returns, that I will forego my claim for salary, and to convince the other creditors to accept a proportional payment of the debt. Thereafter, GV was to transfer its shares to me, and Cai Mao be allowed to resign as the Company director. The proposal was rejected by Ng Cher Yan, the company secretary for the Company. The alternative proposal made by me to liquidate the Company using the monies left in the bank account was met with silence. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 27pt; text-indent: -27pt; text-align: justify; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

The notice stated that Cai Mao had ceased to be a director of the Company since 25 Sep’02 and the Company had failed to file the Notice of Change of Directors with ACRA within the requisite time and was therefore liable to a fine. I was shocked with this new turn of events as both Winston and I did not know of Cai Mao’s resignation, and as late as Jan’03 to Mar’03, the company restructuring proposals had touched upon Cai Mao’s resignation as director only after the matters of the Company had been settled. Immediately, I took the issue up with ACRA and lodged my objections to the resignation of Cai Mao as a director of the Company.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0pt; text-align: justify; "><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>

On 24 Mar’04, Winston and I have since been summoned to Court to answer to ACRA summons for financial year 2001. Cai Mao was not issued with the summon although he was a director in the financial year 2001.</span></p>

In the write-up, I had included an email from Cai Mao dated 25 Jan’03 detailing about point (10) above. As this email was dated 25 Jan’03, Cai Mao could not have ceased to be a director on 25 Sep’02 as mentioned in point (11) above. <span style="color: red;"></span></span></p>

There was no response from GV.</span></p>
