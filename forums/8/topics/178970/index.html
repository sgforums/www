So it's a crime to carry something that looks like drugs in US? I think criminalizing drugs is wrong to begin with, but this... this is just unbelievable. I mean, what the hell are they thinking with a law like that? There are countless things that could be misconstrued as drugs. Guess they better ban sugar, salt, all sorts of leaves, talcum powder and everything else that is white, powdery or leafy.<br><br>The US has of the most bizzare and ridiculars laws I ever heard ... and I have read many in the past. I mean ... US constantly preach "Freedom and democracy" and that all crap.. but it doesn't apply to themselves at all.<br><br>Do you know you can be classifed as terrorist, when they find minute amt of bleach, soda and manure etc in your house and simply lock you up without trail. A 5 year old boy classifed as a terrorist and can't fly in a airplane ? To simply name afew.<br><br></div>
