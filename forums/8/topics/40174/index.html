            <div class='col-md body'>This is the exact opinion of a Japanese guy on the above. Singapore girls are the most aggressive and unreasonable he ever met. He has been in Singapore for a long time. He believe that local TV drama shows it all, the way Singapore women behaved. He claim that he never see this type of behaviour in drama of any other countries. When I said maybe Singaporean girls are highly Westernised, he counter that most Western women are much better behaved. He said that put a Japanese woman in Singapore environment, within a year or 2, the Japanese woman will become like his typical Singapore woman. He also commented that Singapore men are not assertive enough in relationship creating such an environment.

The Japanese man who comment is in his 50's living in Singapore for over 30 years. Married to a Singaporean women for more 30 years, got 3 (half Chinese, half Jap) daughters. All 3 are married.

            <div class='col-md body'>There are agressive women everywhere.. be it in Singapore or else where..

            <div class='col-md body'>actually i think is the culture between the countries. Japee gal are taught to be submissive...anything the guy wanted also yes yes.... but Sg girl are taught to stand and defence themselve...so that is the different. That why you see those Jap guy do crazy things to their girls</div>

NONE would be my best guess, followed by "very few".<br><br>some may rebutt me when i say singaporeans dunno about the world. yes we know about the world thru the media and meeting pple from that part of the world. but nothing beats the actual thing. u will NEVER know wat japanese are really like unless u live with, among and along them. don't be reading a magazine and watching jap tv and tell me u know them when u've never even stepped in that country.<br><br>so i hope u know why such a comparison cannot be made. it's not becos women here are indeed more agressive than women in japan (or anywhere else), it's that there would be very few pple that would be worthy to make such a judgement. i'm certainly one of them.<br><br>u want me to compare aussie women with sg women? i can try my best. but that's a different story.<br><br>so back to ur japanese friend. he MAY have a point, becos he spent a certain amount of time here? so in my view he can be qualified to compare jap women to sg women, but not "women from other countries" unless he spends much time in the "other countries".<br><br>after having said ALL this bulls[/i]hit, there is one bottom line. It's always pretty pointless to compare the masses. u know that typical "men and like this and women are like that", then u get "but not ALL men are like that and not ALL women are like that". same applies here. where's the point in all this?<br><br>to me, there's no point.</div></blockquote>bravo  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
