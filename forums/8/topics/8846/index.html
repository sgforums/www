            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, Why not try using Frontpage. Although its not a very good s/w, but seems like most beginners start with that and its really not hard to learn. Good luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I recommend Dreamweaver as Frontpage is more biased towards IE becos both are from Microsoft whereas Dreamweaver is more compatible to Netscape and IE.Geocities can be used for commercial uses also,not only private uses as evident by their Geoshop advert which offers a 1 stop place for a person to create a on-line shop,hehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Makan begins with a drool, grows with a chomp, ends with a burp.When you were born, you were hungry and everyone around you was full.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Array,<br><br>Perhaps you could try <a href="http://www.ewebcity.com" rel="nofollow">www.ewebcity.com</a>  to host your website. Its free and most of all, its good for small and simple website. :-)<br><br>And I agree with moose, do take the time to learn Dreamweaver. I'd pretty have to say that once you try it, you'll never look back to Frontpage, although FP has some features that DW doesnt have and DW has some features that FP doesnt have. I guess it pretty much boils down on preference. :-)</div>
