            <div class='col-md body'>In far corners of the world, tsunami takes fizz out of new year celebrations<br>JOHN LEICESTER<br><br>(AP) - For Sweden's prime minister, celebrating the new year after Asia's tsunami disaster felt "completely wrong." Paris, its gay heart heavy with the tragedy, draped black cloth along the Champs-Elysees. Elsewhere, prayers substituted for parties in the final minutes of 2004.<br><br>Even for those far from Asian and African shores where the giant waves killed almost 150,000, the disaster was too overwhelming for a carefree leap into 2005. In Europe, thousands were struggling with the loss of loved ones and friends. The confirmed death tolls for many European countries were in the double digits, but officials warned the final tallies would be in the hundreds or even thousands. For Sweden alone, 2,500 tourists were still missing, while Switzerland was waiting to hear from some 700 and the French reported at least 118 disappeared.<br><br>"Never has the step into a new year felt heavier," said Goeran Persson, Sweden's prime minister who urged Swedes to light candles in their windows as a vigil. "We should have celebrated with fireworks and festivities. Now that feels completely wrong."<br><br>Many of the estimated one million revellers around the glittering, firework-illuminated harbour in Sydney, Australia, marked a moment of silence for victims.<br><br>"You could tell people were a little more reverent tonight; it was kept in people's thoughts," British tourist Mark Stiles said.<br><br>Stores in major German cities said sales of fireworks were down, in some cases by a third. Some retailers attributed the restraint to appeals from Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and others for the money usually spent on pyrotechnics to be donated.<br><br>Germany's main party at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin went ahead, but the revellers were urged on big screens to donate to UNICEF (news - web sites). TV stations turned their New Year's Eve galas into charity events for tsunami victims.<br><br>Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel of Austria also urged people to forgo fireworks. The city of Innsbruck cancelled its display in a silent vigil for 40 residents of the western Austrian province of Tyrol who remain missing in Asia. Mayor Hilde Zach called the move "a sign of solidarity" to mark "the great loss of human life." The southern city of Graz was donating its fireworks fund to tsunami victims.<br><br>Crowds of thousands in London fell silent for two minutes in memory of the lives lost in Asia. Then as Big Ben struck midnight, a spectacular fireworks display burst in the sky above the River Thames, casting a brilliant glow over Westminster houses of Parliament.<br><br>An Olympic-themed light show, reflecting the city's bid for the 2012 games, lit up the London Eye ferris wheel.<br><br>In Russia, wearied by a year of economic scandals and terrorist attacks, caution prevailed. Revellers filed through metal detectors onto Moscow's Red Square to watch the fireworks display over St. Basil's Cathedral.<br><br>"This year . . . ended very badly," said Lena Suyedinya, 26. "I hope next year will be calmer - more peaceful."<br><br>In Paris, the 480 scarf-like strips of black cloth hung along the Champs-Elysees and on light posts at the nearby Place de la Concorde - a deliberately discreet but poignant gesture to victims.<br><br>"This night cannot be ordinary because of this mourning affecting the entire planet," Deputy Mayor Anne Hidalgo said.<br><br>Parisians still stocked up on champagne and foie gras for feasting but said the tragedy weighed on their minds.<br><br>"Our hearts will be in it a little less this year, when we think about all the victims," said Marie-Caroline Lagache, 34. "It's going to be a New Year's Eve that's a bit more lifeless."<br><br>Many Asians were too busy counting the dead, feeding survivors and combating disease to even think about partying.<br><br>Most government agencies in Indonesia, where the death toll was by far the largest, cancelled fireworks and urged people to pray.<br><br>"Let's welcome the new year without a party because now we are filled with concern and sadness," President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said. "We are still mourning. Let's pray together and hopefully God will not give us another disaster."<br><br>There were no official celebration in India, but hotels and clubs in some cities held low-key programs.<br><br>Thailand, with thousands dead, cancelled a countdown party in Bangkok and officials urged people to attend religious services instead.<br><br>Clutching white roses and candles, hundreds gathered Friday night on southern Thailand's tsunami-ravaged Phuket island for a vigil at a shopping mall that replaced planned New Year's Eve festivities.<br><br>Thais and foreigners raised lit candles as a band played Elton John's Candle in the Wind. The candles were then placed in rows of metal flower boxes full of sand and mourners paused for two minutes of silence.<br><br>China's state-run CCTV broadcaster announced the cancellation of its live New Year's Eve gala programming.<br><br>But celebrations went ahead unaffected in Taiwan. The Philippines, which escaped the tsunami, also was in celebratory mood, with cacophonous fireworks and gunfire before midnight.<br><br>Malaysians flocked to mosques, temples and churches for special prayers as firework displays in the mostly Muslim country were banned and celebrations were cancelled in mourning for victims of the tsunami.<br><br>The Islamic sultanate of Brunei also scrapped New Year's Eve festivities and held prayers at mosques.</div>
