            <div class='col-md body'>If God is one of us, He will never be a slob for He is sinless and perfect. Just like mateo replied, some 2000 plus yrs ago, He came as a human to take away our sins.<br><br>Believing in God doesn't mean you'll have a rosy life, most of the time, you'll find life tougher as you're more aware of your sins and as you strive to be more like Him. And yes, having faith in a God whom we have never seen is also very tough but if you truly believe and do read the Bible with understanding, you would and should find a peace that this world can never give you.</div>
