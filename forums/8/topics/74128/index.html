            <div class='col-md body'>Andy Rooney says.... "As I grow in age, I value women over 40 most of all.<br>Here are just a few reasons why:<br><br>An over 40 woman will never wake you in the middle of the night to ask,<br>"What are you thinking?" She doesn't care what you think.<br><br>If an over 40 woman doesn't want to watch the game, she doesn't sit around<br>whining about it. She does something she wants to do. And it's<br>usually something more interesting.<br><br>An over 40 woman knows herself well enough to be assured in who she is,<br>what<br>she is, what she wants, and from whom. Few women past the age of 40<br>give a darn what you might think about her or what she's doing.<br><br>An over 40 woman usually has had her fill of "meaningful relationships" and<br><br>commitment." The last thing she wants in her life is another dopey,<br>clingy, whiny, dependent lover.<br><br>Over 40 women are dignified. They seldom have a screaming match with you at<br><br>the opera or in the middle of an expensive restaurant. Of course, if<br>you deserve it, they won't hesitate to shoot you if they think they can get<br><br>away with it.<br><br>Over 40 women are generous with praise, often undeserved. They know what<br>it's like to be unappreciated.<br><br>An over 40 woman has the self-assurance to introduce you to her women<br>friends. A younger woman with a man will often ignore even her best<br>friend because she doesn't trust the guy with other women. An over 40 woman<br><br>couldn't care less if you're attracted to her friends because<br>she knows her friends won't betray her.<br><br>Women get psychic as they age. You never have to confess your sins to an<br>over 40 woman. They always know.<br><br>An over 40 woman looks good wearing bright red lipstick. This is not true<br>of<br>younger women.<br><br>Over 40 women are forthright and honest. They'll tell you right off you are<br><br>a jerk if you are acting like one. You don't ever have to wonder<br>where you stand with her.<br><br>Yes, we praise over 40 women for a multitude of reasons. Unfortunately,<br>it's not reciprocal. For every stunning, smart, well-coifed hot woman of<br>40+, there is a bald, paunchy relic in yellow pants making a fool of<br>himself<br>with some 22-year-old waitress.<br><br>Ladies, I apologize.<br><br>Andy Rooney<br><br><span style="color: red;">Eh... I dunno true or not regarding dis Andy char... but wat he saes is not 100% wrong...</span><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
