            <div class='col-md body'>A paradox is an apparently true statement or group of statements that seems to lead to a contradiction or to a situation that defies intuition. Typically, either the statements in question do not really imply the contradiction, the puzzling result is not really a contradiction, or the premises themselves are not all really true (or, cannot all be true together). The recognition of ambiguities, equivocations, and unstated assumptions underlying known paradoxes has led to significant advances in science, philosophy and mathematics.<br><br>The word paradox is often used interchangeably and wrongly with contradiction; but where a contradiction by definition cannot be true, many paradoxes do allow for resolution, though many remain unresolved or only contentiously resolved<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3b/Boyle'sSelfFlowingFlask.png/180px-Boyle'sSelfFlowingFlask.png"><br><br>self-flowing flask fills itself in this diagram, but perpetual motion machines cannot exist.</div>
