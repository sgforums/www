I wanted to give her a surprise on thurs, but the restuarant manager gave me a surprise instead with the bill. Thurs is our 3 month-versary. And it is her birthday so that is why it is a very important day. I even ordered some flowers and a necklace. The necklace caused me like $300++ and is so expensive, I bargained for like 3 hours but can only reduced like $30.<br><br>1 July Tues<br>Today I give Andrea a call, we chatted alittle and ask her out on friday. She told me she was unable to make it on friday as her new friend from her dance academy bought some tickets to a concert. ANd it is a very good one. I ask if I could come along. She said no as it is full house and they have no extra tickets, furthermore the last time we went for a musical she said I dooze off in the midst and it was so embaressing. I apologies for 3 days already and now she had brought it up!<br>The rest of the week she will be busy on her company's marketing campaign. I was so disappointed. Didn't she know that It was her birthday and our 3 month-versary? I really wanted to spend it with her.<br><br>2 Aug Wed<br>Today I called Andrea and I told Andrea I'll be sending her home tomorrow. I told Joe about this, he said I'm going to break up soon and Andrea realised her mistake!!! I was so angry. Later day I poured some of my overnight night water I left on my desk yesterday into his tea. Sadly I cancelled the reservation for tomorrow.<br><br>3 Aug Thurs<br>Dear Blog, today Joe didn't come to work today heard he has a diarrea!!! At last I have some peace at work. Later the night, I went to Esplanade like around 9.30 waited for Andrea until like 11pm then the show is over. She came out only with James her new friend. I send her home and asked her why only James and her? She said the rest of the people last min couldn't make it. I don't know what but I feel very awful. I gave her the necklace and thank me before she departed. She is tired. That goes with our 3 months-versary only got to see her for an hour.<br><br>To Be Continue<br><br>5 Aug Sunday<br>Dear Blog, today I went to church with Andrea, she said she got her new friend to join her for service. Little did I know it was James! Arrrgghh. We when to service together and he tease me saying I should go work out more on my muscle. He thought i'm a dancer like Andrea but I'm not. His name is James Kok. I called him James Co ck!!! When his not around of coz.<br>Later the day Andrea told me James is just her student she got to know in the Dance and tell me don't try any of my tricks on him. I agree, I'll try the real thing on him. Tricks are for kids. So there we are spend the day in church a movie and we departed. I wonder who exactly is this James, hehe we'll find out.<br><br>6 Aug Monday<br>Today I went to the dance academy to find out bout James. He is just a student therefore they couldn't reveal any information of him. I did and online search of him. Nothing! I saw him when I fetch Andrea home. He had a car and drove both of us back instead. I think I want to get a car too!!! I told Andrea, she sigh. Ask Andrea about james but she wouldn't say. What is wrong with woman I just don't get it sometime.<br><br>8 Aug Wednesday<br>Hmmm Blog I been thinking of two days.. Please tell me how can I found out about James... I ask Jesus He never reply. I can't let him have Andrea.<br><br>9 Aug Thurs<br>Today is national day, Andrea and I went to see the fireworks at esplanade. Surprisingly James was there with a big camera and a tripod like a photographer. Wah Kaoz his like everywhere we went. He say he likes to take photo and even took our photo with Andrea, me and HIM!!! I must do something. Bloggy, I must do something!!!<br><br>10 Aug Frid<br>Dear Blog, today as I came home I felt something strange. I felt someone is following me home. When I look around the stretch which I usually took to came home the person disappeared. I called and told Andrea about it, she thinks I am over reacting. I ask her to be careful of James as I found nothing of him yet. She flared and says I promised not to try any tricks on him. I have to apologies like an hour think she still haven slimmer down. Shouldn't have told her that. Its for her own good also.<br><br>To be Continue.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>11 Aug Saturday<br>Dear Blog, today I went to Gym with Johnny. We excerise as I like to look muscular alittle bit. That day Andrea say I'm alittle plump. But she used to say she like it. Think it must be James! The day was fine but a dirty old body builder keep looking at me doing bench press. I think he is gay.<br><br>Later the day I went to some shopping. A lady introduced me to some perfume. She say my girlfriend will love it as it could attracts woman. At least that's what the advertisement tries to portray.<br><br>12 Aug Sun<br>Dear Blog, today I woke up very early to dress nicely and put on the new perfume. I want to give Andrea a surprised. I went to church for service as usual and it seems true that all the girls seems to keep looking at me and smile. Even Elaine, a model also give me a couple of glimpse and smile. I think the perfume really works. But in my heart I only have Andrea and no one else. Andrea is still the most beautiful and I can't wait to meet her.<br>She came later and told me I didn't zipped.<br><br>14 Aug Tuesday<br>Dear Blog, Today Andrea and I went out for movies. I went to fetch her at her house at 7++ We left for the bus stop, Andrea and I don't smoke. But the guy on the bus stop keep smoking and stealing glance at me. Thank God the bus came and we left the man alone. I asked Andrea if he hates the smell she can stick her head to my bosom as I put on perfume today. She smile and pinched me. I still don't understand woman, it means she wants or don't want?<br><br>Later the night, I been wondering about what happened the day earlier. The bus stop only serve one bus. And the man were there since I came and we left. And after we came back late in the night. Another man was there at the bus stop. Something fishy must be happening.<br><br>To be Continue.<br><br>15 Aug Wednesday<br>Dear Blog, Today I called Johnny and discussed by the incident. We suspected someone is following Andrea and I wanted to find out. I devised a plan and ask him to help me. He say ok.  At the same time since Andrea doesn't have dance class tomorrow and Fri, I ask Andrea out on Friday. I planned a surprise for her.<br><br>16 Aug Thurs<br>To day I bought some little present for man. Wrapped into a package. I sneaked to Andrea house and found the man. I hid in one of the HDB nearby.<br><br>Johnny pretended to be surveyor and will give present to anyone willing to take part in the survey. I asked a couple of house before finally approach the man by the bus stop. He was taken in and completed the survey. Given a present and at the same time do alittle pretending and selling before asking him to take part in a final lucky draw which of course he needs to fill the details of his background.<br><br>He stayed in Ang Mo Kio, written a fake occupation, 38 year old and living in a HDB. This is Pasir ris and I wonder why is he here. Nevertheless I'm going to find out soon. I have a feeling it has something to do with James. This James doesn't seems to be a simple person. I couldn't find out anything about him and all these things is happening. We'll see.<br><br>17 Aug Thurs<br>Today I went out with Andrea and later the day we went to mount faber. We are there alone at the highest point looking at the city below us. The night was so beautiful. I hold her soft and tender hands with both of mine and look into here eyes. I wanted to give her a necklace which my mum said was for my wife. She brought it few years ago.<br><br>Suddenly out of no where James appeared!!! I was so furious but had to pretend to be smiling. He was there taking photos again. I wonder why so coincident!? Everytime also met him. Aarerrrggghhh! In the end the whole night Andrea and James were discussing about Photography and looking at beautiful pictures he had taken. I almost want to scold him, but Andrea was there. I didn't managed to give her the necklace.<br><br>To be continue.</div>
