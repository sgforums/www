In 2004, the price for this group almost doubled - from $8 to $15.<br><br>So sports fans will be the ones who pay most.<br><br>"It's outrageous! They've got enough money and they don't show enough international sports anyway. Why are they charging more money?" questioned Michael Reid, a StarHub pay-TV subscriber.<br><br>"I'm unhappy that the increase is so great. But it's a monopoly, there's nothing we can do about it," said another StarHub pay-TV subscriber.<br><br>Some are already thinking of alternatives.<br><br>"At the moment, Internet streaming of sports telecast is quite popular. So maybe some people will turn to that," said James Kuwe, also a StarHub pay-TV subscriber.<br><br>But not all seem to mind the higher costs.<br><br>"I feel that it's kind of okay because I'm into sports. It's my passion. So I don't mind paying a little bit more," said StarHub pay-TV subscriber Azmi Bin Affandi.<br><br>StarHub's Thomas Ee said the hike is only natural.<br><br>He added that it has not increased prices like other pay-TV operators around the world, despite a steady rise in costs.<br><br>He also said that it's impossible to continue absorbing the cost indefinitely so it's left with no choice.<br><br>The price hike will also affect commercial enterprises.<br><br>StarBub increases for such establishments will be rolled out around October.<br><br>"I think what we'll do is adopt a wait-and-see attitude and look at the level of price increase for what it is now. If it's not too high, we'll not pass on the increase in prices to consumers," said Mark Teo, marketing and sales director of Peranakan Place.<br><br>But not everything will cost more. StarHub will roll out two new channels at no extra charge. The History Channel and the Crime and Investigation Network Channel will be available to cable subscribers in mid June. - CNA /ls</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not a nice feeling. However the networks (especially the sports ones) keep securing exclusive broadcasting rights to this region for many events and programmes, and the deals keep getting more expensive. Inevitably the costs are passed on to Starhub and other providers elsewhere.<br><br>If one is able to look at Starhub's books and show that their margins aren't sustainable because of that, then we have to accept it grudgingly. And by that I do not mean SBST/SMRT levels of profit.</div>

It would be good of StarHub to provide this option," he said.<br><br>StarHub, however, is standing firm.<br><br>In response to queries yesterday, senior vice-president of cable, fixed and IP services, Mr Thomas Ee, said there "will be options" for subscribers who want to cancel their contracts, but "an amount of early termination charge will be imposed in return".<br><br>Asked if it was fair that consumers had to accept the price hike or be penalised, he said that as was industry practice, StarHub had stated its right to revise the terms and conditions Â— including pricing plans Â— "at its discretion without prior notice".<br><br>But Mr Ee was quick to assure subscribers that they could expect "more content without additional charges", even as he reiterated that the price revision was "inevitable" given the rising high costs of content.<br><br>This did little to mollify sports fans in particular, who have to swallow a double hike.<br><br>Mr Akhtar Mohd Said, who was considering signing up for StarHub's sports package this month, has now decided against it. "Maybe we should be allowed to sign up with a foreign pay-TV network and gain access to a wider selection of cable channels that are priced competitively," he said.<br><br>Case's Mr Seah Â— noting StarHub's "dominant position in the pay-TV industry" and the need for more competition Â— called on the Media Development Authority (MDA) to "explain its rationale" for allowing the increase.<br><br>Had StarHub consulted the MDA before going ahead? Mr Ee said it "did what is required by our licence".<br><br>Asked if the operator had any plans to alleviate the initial burden of the fee increases, Mr Ee said that this was why it had delayed the sports price hike until October Â— after the new English Premier League season kicks off Â— even though it meant "bearing the increased sports costs ourselves for a few more months".<br><br>He added that fans could look forward to more discounts for the sports package soon. As for those who have already signed up for its promotional sports package, StarHub will honour the promised discounts off the current $15 fee for now, and off the $25 revised fee from October.<br><br>But one subscriber, Mrs Kwan Â— who had signed a two-year contract for the sports group package last week as it entitled her to a 10-per-cent discount and a free digital video recorder Â— complained: "It's not fair, you sign up and then the price is hiked by more than 50 per cent within a week."<br><br>Sports fan Neville Chew suggested offering less content for a lower price. "What you're paying for is the frills Â— the pre-match show, the half-time talk, post-match highlights. I would prefer to just watch the match."<br><br>But Mr Mohd Din has other sources to turn to. He said: "ESPN offers free sports content via peer-to-peer television on its website. Rather than pay $25 a month, I'd rather get my adrenaline rush online."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by SMRT Buses:<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Wednesday June 13, 8:17 AM</span><br><br>[b]<span style="text-decoration: underline;">With higher charges, StarHub should let viewers opt out: Case</span></strong><br><br>It is not just the coming hike in fees that StarHub Cable Vision (SCV) subscribers are up in arms over, but also the penalties they will have to pay if they cancel their contracts Â— as a few are considering doing.<br><br>A day after the pay-TV operator said it would raise its basic subscription fees by $4 from next month, and its sports package price by $10 from October, the Consumers' Association of Singapore (Case) reacted to subscriber disquiet by joining the fray.<br><br>Executive director Seah Seng Choon told TODAY it was sending StarHub a letter today, asking the operator to waive the penalty charge for customers who wished to discontinue as a result of the price hike, but were still caught in the lock-in period.<br><br>"This is because they had signed the contract based on the old rate. It would be good of StarHub to provide this option," he said.<br><br>StarHub, however, is standing firm.<br><br>In response to queries yesterday, senior vice-president of cable, fixed and IP services, Mr Thomas Ee, said there "will be options" for subscribers who want to cancel their contracts, but "an amount of early termination charge will be imposed in return".<br><br>Asked if it was fair that consumers had to accept the price hike or be penalised, he said that as was industry practice, StarHub had stated its right to revise the terms and conditions Â— including pricing plans Â— "at its discretion without prior notice".<br><br>But Mr Ee was quick to assure subscribers that they could expect "more content without additional charges", even as he reiterated that the price revision was "inevitable" given the rising high costs of content.<br><br>This did little to mollify sports fans in particular, who have to swallow a double hike.<br><br>Mr Akhtar Mohd Said, who was considering signing up for StarHub's sports package this month, has now decided against it. "Maybe we should be allowed to sign up with a foreign pay-TV network and gain access to a wider selection of cable channels that are priced competitively," he said.<br><br>Case's Mr Seah Â— noting StarHub's "dominant position in the pay-TV industry" and the need for more competition Â— called on the Media Development Authority (MDA) to "explain its rationale" for allowing the increase.<br><br>Had StarHub consulted the MDA before going ahead? Mr Ee said it "did what is required by our licence".<br><br>Asked if the operator had any plans to alleviate the initial burden of the fee increases, Mr Ee said that this was why it had delayed the sports price hike until October Â— after the new English Premier League season kicks off Â— even though it meant "bearing the increased sports costs ourselves for a few more months".<br><br>He added that fans could look forward to more discounts for the sports package soon. As for those who have already signed up for its promotional sports package, StarHub will honour the promised discounts off the current $15 fee for now, and off the $25 revised fee from October.<br><br>But one subscriber, Mrs Kwan Â— who had signed a two-year contract for the sports group package last week as it entitled her to a 10-per-cent discount and a free digital video recorder Â— complained: "It's not fair, you sign up and then the price is hiked by more than 50 per cent within a week."<br><br>Sports fan Neville Chew suggested offering less content for a lower price. "What you're paying for is the frills Â— the pre-match show, the half-time talk, post-match highlights. I would prefer to just watch the match."<br><br>But Mr Mohd Din has other sources to turn to. He said: "ESPN offers free sports content via peer-to-peer television on its website. Rather than pay $25 a month, I'd rather get my adrenaline rush online."

Among other changes, it is considering price controls - a proposal that has met with strong resistance from incumbent media players. A second round of consultation would be held and the process completed by year's end.<br><br>Mr Seah Seng Choon, the executive director of the Consumers' Association of Singapore (Case), said it would support price regulation in markets "where there is a single dominant player". "At least then there would be somebody watching over the manner in which the price adjustments are made," he said.<br><br>Case felt "very strongly" about SCV's stance on not allowing recent subscribers to terminate their contracts without incurring penalties. It has written to SCV and plans to meet with its representatives.<br><br>SCV told Today it would reply to Case's letter "by providing more information about our rate adjustments". -</div>

This is something we are quite concerned about, because it is important for the service provider to come up with clear explanations.<br><br>"We are not against periodic adjustment per se. As businesses, we know and understand that when costs go up, businesses must make adjustments. The question is transparency, and how positive businesses are actually doing it in terms of giving consumers clear information.<br><br>"If the price adjustment is not in gradual terms or small percentages but in multiplying factor like two or three times, I think businesses should respect the choice of consumers."<br><br>He called for such businesses to give consumers a choice to opt out of contracts even if the businesses have done nothing illegal.<br><br>Mr Yeo said: "Although legally the companies and service providers have the right to do so, I hope they will consider the sentiments of consumers. They should give consumers the right to opt out." - CNA/de</div>
