            <div class='col-md body'>Actually in my opinion, kids are just kids, they wanted to be treated with respect, and though, some of them, are ignorant in their actions, so we as an adult should guide them, and maybe they are full of s h i t most of the time, but still, they also want their voice to be heard, not just be treated like any other kiddo,<br><br>and furthermore, we as an adult, should be more gracious and more forgiving, if they want respect, they should earn it, instead of thinking, it shall be bestow upon them, the more they whine about the unjust treatment, the more, they will treated as a kid, if they wanted to be treated as equal, first they must prove it, instead of just talk, after all, action speak louder than words<br><br>i wouldn't care much about what a kid has to say, after they are just flies flying around my ears, until they learn about etiquette, mannerism.Why should the government give priority to the kids, since they don't have the power to vote, and therefore, do they have any rights, i think most of them totally forgotten about this.<br><br>If we as an adult, fail to lead them in example, and squabble around with them, then truly, we are no different from them<br><br>Cheers, let them grumble, all they want, after all, this is their 'growing' up period while i drink my tea, and enjoy the little drama, they are creating</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kids don't give a heck these days.<br><br>Internet and friends is all they have. Most have no idea what they are scolding and signing. They only know it when somebody screams at them for using this particular word or showing this particular sign. Their parents know, their elders know, but they have no wish of passing this knowledge down or even teaching them from the right and wrongs. As a third generation kid, I've my own shares of asking and getting scolded, so nothing is new.<br><br>Adults only know how to say to ask when you don't know, but when asked, this is what we get. Since the reaction is so huge, it's no wonder that kids assume that these are bad and start using them.<br><br>Guidance is an easy word, but I don't see much of it being applied in today's society...</div>

I don't know what is the problem with kids nowadays, back then i am contented, with marble and if i am fortunate enough, with the little savings, i have, i could buy myself new toys!
