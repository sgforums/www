Knowing that if they did something, the cane would get to them. It acts as a deterrence. Compoundedly and unconsciously, this is how we grew up learning our basic rights and wrongs. The applications of it. It helps to restrict that freedom of wanting to do something real bad. Heck! If I know all I'm gonna get is some advice or "counselling" as they term it, it is probably worth the thrill to commit that wrong.<br>Kids who got into trouble in class are obviously ones who love attention. Putting them on "time-out" isn't that singling them out? Making them different from the others? And when you are different aren't you receiving attention from the others? You are feeding the troll in an attempt to wave him away. Do they even know that they are being punished?<br><br>Thank you. Views, comments?</div></blockquote>Sorry for the selective quotes here. But I assure you they will not misrepresent you.<br><br>Cane is effective. But just like you say, it acts only as much as a deterrence. If a child avoid doing something just because of the fear of pain, then he is like a trained animal. Why are there so many reports that Singaporeans behave wonderfully in our own soil, but once they are travelling, especially to Asian countries, they started littering? The strict fine is the cane here, and without it, the only glue to moral values, the deterrence factor, is gone.<br><br>Singling out students in class. The main purpose is not to punish them. Primary school gives only 1/2 hour per lesson, thus the teacher's effort is to prevent the bad student from disturbing the rest of the class from having lessons. The real punishment is often calling of parents.<br><br>Thus, I do think overall you have a very strong point, that is parents care too little. They send their children to school, expect them to be taken care of in all areas. When something went wrong, they either blame the teachers or the society, when often the fact is that they care far too little to make the whole system work.</div>

These people mostly spent their entire life in Spore. Well, there may be occasional travels, but never long stay in another country.<br><br>The world outside is a lot more complicated. Allowing a student to study overseas by himself lets him gain experience. He has to look for his own place to stay, maybe share an apartment with others, there will be many chances for him to encounter all sorts of people you don't get to see in Singapore.<br><br></div>

I agree with your points and I would not agree to extreme uses of the cane but it shouldn't be taken out of the school system completely. It's true about the students who tucks out and smoke.

The chances of this happening is becoming more and more likely if the schooling system starts to go easy on them. Counselling or the cane in the principal office?

And in this case, a proper disciplinary system in the school?<br><br>Taking myself as an example. I have thought about it before. Both my parents was still working when I was a kid. Most of the childhood was spent with my cousins. Elder cousin taught us how to shoplift. (Bubblegums at that time) I knew it was wrong but I was too young to understand the implications of such act. Until one day, my elder brother caught me shoplifting an eraser. I proudly showed him ( a rare country eraser at that time) and he was shocked and scolded me. I got scared and threw it away.<br>Yes he didn't use violence here but that's not my point. I don't emphasise on violence as a solution. I emphasise the point of instilling of fear so as to prevent wrongdoings.

Never denied that. But education is important too. Trained animals? If you think about it properly, all of us ARE trained animals. Not convince? Laws, regulations, guidelines, societal norms, ethical standards, cultural practices, moral standards kept us trained, my friend. I don't propose the extremes of caning or corporal punishments even for the slightest things.

Totally agreed. Like I had mentioned before, that's because of the increased ability in thinking maturely. As we grew older, we take more sense in what we are told, what we hear and what we read. We interpret more of them. Majority of those in primary schools? Doubt they are up to that maturity level.</div>

These people mostly spent their entire life in Spore. Well, there may be occasional travels, but never long stay in another country.<br><br>The world outside is a lot more complicated. Allowing a student to study overseas by himself lets him gain experience. He has to look for his own place to stay, maybe share an apartment with others, there will be many chances for him to encounter all sorts of people you don't get to see in Singapore.<br><br></div></blockquote>true true. i will never say that studying overseas is a bad thing. =)<br>but still some prefer to stay and study locally. so i was just wondering if these people have more opportunity to pursue their education here instead of abroad? and i wonder if the government attract students to stay..?</div>
