            <div class='col-md body'>Just a lil question here, from all the above mentioned posts, it seems like being 'cultured' is generally associated with pple with good social ettiqute(nice and polite). So would an uneducated 'uncle' with perhaps little social ettiqute who appreciates say, chinese or cantonese opera, chinese dance or mabbe a nice game of Chinese chess be considered an uncultured person?<br><br>He may spew Hokkien like nobody's business but at the end of the day, he would be able to sit down and appreciate a session of Canto opera just like Rinoa would a good poem.(sorry weak analogy here but my brain's pretty chow tar now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">)<br><br>So... does that make him cultured or uncultured? Or issit just that he APPEARS uncultured but is actually very cultured?<br><br>------------------<br>Why? Why me?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that when we say a person is cultured, we mean that not only do they have these other qualities such as appreciation and social etiquette, but also that the person has knowledge and understanding of his/her postion in relation to the world and the people around them.<br><br>It really leads back to social etiquette because if u are aware of ur surroundings , then most likely u will act accordingly to that surrounding and people or events there.  Just knowing that aa hundred people are standing next to u on the bus isn't the same as understanding that they are there...understanding that they also can think, that they also can blah blah blah...so shouting into ur handphone is most likely not going to happen if u understand that the people next to u won't like it.  Most likely it happens is because people fail to realise that others mind....Social consciousness...yeah...i think u can have every quality we mention and Star mentioned, and still not be culture until u can have some kind of social consciousness...Then again it leads back to self-reflection doesn't it...hmmm one big circle</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah....i agree....a cultured person is s'posed to be like an all-rounder i think. much like the greek (not geek) nobles or the confucian jun zi (or gentleman). i think when u say someone is cultured, u expect both good comportment and great learning. kinda like with both brains and the ability to carry it off. and to carry yourself well too. too often nowadays being cultured is associated only with the outward manifestation of it without the use of too much grey matter or the ends to which it is put. if u look back at the old days, only the elite received any education. and this was typically not just a training of the mind but also a kind of "social training" if u like, how to act and behave towards ur fellow man (and woman too of course!). so etiquette and self-reflection and learning went hand in hand.<br><br>nowadays, however, education is pretty different. it has become so focussed and specialised it has lost some of its original purpose and intent....to create a gentleman of sorts. we still fall into the trap of equating better educated ppl wif more refined and cultured ppl. but nothing could be further from the truth. many highly educated ppl are not only less than refined in social mannerisms, some have no sense of morals at all! so nowadays the family takes over the responsibility of bringing up the perfect lady or gentleman (which is not to say this wasn't also the case in days of old. just that nowadays formal education doesn't really cater to this kinda thing.)<br><br>still ppl expect that if ur more highly educated, it means it naturally follows ur more likely to be refined or cultured or whatever. so it's a whole package deal. and it just goes to show how the notion of education has changed so dramatically over the years. i think education is the capacity to learn. ur as educated as u are capable of learning. and from what i know, life itself is the greatest teacher. after that, it's all up to you. whether or not u pass ur finals, is up to you.<br><br></div>

Anywayz, the gals here r not that sophisticated anyway.<br><br>Knowing Monet, Puccini, Dali and co only mean that one is versed in western art and culture. Perhaps we should not be so preoccupied with those since we r definitely an Asian country. Art and culture arises from the way we perceive and do things. So perhaps, being cultured takes on a different composition in Singapore. But I guess u r right to the extent that Singaporeans r pragmatic people.<br><br>Personally, I think knowing the arts does little to impress most gals in Singapore. Having a flashy sports car, a fat wallet and drop-dead good looks are more effective.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>What would guys do to impress gals?
