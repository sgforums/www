            <div class='col-md body'>Prob if a girl smiled at me, I would think it was because I was wearing my short inside out ! Hahaha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>To get serious, if I was out with a date, I would try to keep my eyes on her. Easier said than done I know...because I am guilty of looking at girls even when I am out with a group of friends.<br><br>It's just that if the guys you hang out with don't comment much on girls, you will feel rather "repressed" and start looking even more. Don't know why...<br><br>Since I've come to the University, I've been more confident around girls and at least I don't think I am some egghead looking nerdy jerk ! So when I go out I dare to look at girls, and when a cute one comes along I may even smile at her (as long as no bf is tagging along !)<br><br>So if a cute girl were to smile at me, I would look and smile back. It's all embedded in the ancient art of flirting. No harm is done for both parties, and the girl will feel more feminine and the guy feel like a man !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheers !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sure you meant this to be a provocative question and the way you've phrased it certainly makes it antagonistic...<br><br>Anyway, I think all this labeling of people as "uncultured" is just another attempt by the high-brow to express their snobbishness/superiority.... there are definitely common standards on what constitutes 'culture'.... but not knowing about Monet or van Gogh does not an uncultured person make.<br><br>The average Singaporean (e.g. me) would not be well-versed in all this high-brow culture and may not be interested in it at all... odes that make them uncultured or boring? Definitely no.<br><br>And although it seems like a separate irrelevant question, if a girl smiles at me, I'll try to smile back (hopefully without my date seeing of course...haha... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">) but well, never have either experience, so just wishful thinking <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Oh, also noticed that in your other posts, you tend to go a little long... might help to break into paragraphs... otherwise can't expect people to plough thru willingly <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree on Eck and JCboy's postings. Just because someone doesn't appreciate works of art or music by past master does not mean that they are not cultured. Heck, I think cultured is not an accurate word to describe the quality that people are looking for anyway.<br><br>I suppose what is desirable is someone who is able to make decisions and form intelligent, individual views; the quality to be comfortable with your own existence, to be able to shut up or speak in the right circumstances. And be open minded.<br><br>I would also like to say that I'm still studying overseas, but I believe you don't have to travel overseas to have a personality or be cultured. You might be able to see different things and polish whatever skills you have, but if you are small minded you will stay where you are in terms of developement. Going overseas is no big deal.<br><br>As for surprising girls, depends on what type of girls they are. Even extremely novel and fun things can turn out to be try hard attempts to the wrong girls (and guys.) Needless to say, I'm clueless. Thats why I'm reading other people's postings.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fine arts are passÃ©. Seriously passÃ© if it hadn't been for government intervention and the prevelance of old-fashionedness among conservative authorities. Grunge, punk and glam-rock are subcultures that are IN. Nonetheless, just look at how taxpayers' money is blatantly wasted upon the mindless construction of some THEATRES ON THE BAY...  whatever *shit* project that is and whatever *shit* purpose it holds... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>We really need more pop stars, rock stars and alternative bands which are relevant and appealing to the masses. The taste for fine arts needs to be acquired, but why the torture? Besides, we have no time for that.<br><br>I look forward to the day when the government will drop its funding for modern-day (and should I say, characteristically boring) Mozarts, Picassos and Shakespeares, and instead channel more support for potential Madonnas, Mansons and Nirvanas.<br><br>I suppose I will get flamed for this, especially from the so-called "cultured" and "elitist" people who have nurtured their whole lives on ballerinas, classical music, cubist paintings, stage plays and other abstract forms of haute-couture. But likewise, I know there are people who think like me, who feels the need for local pop and alternative acts to really proliferate the local entertainment scene and assail the minds of our younger generation.<br><br>Now if only there were scholarships for potential rock bands...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Jasonnex<br>@ SGÂ·BOYS <a href="http://sgboys.cjb.net" rel="nofollow">http://sgboys.cjb.net</a>  <a href="http://www.sggirls.com/~sgboys" rel="nofollow">http://www.sggirls.com/~sgboys</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all the guys speaking up...I am gald that I have "evoked" your defence...but cos the thnd that I am into arts, musicals, paintings as well as international music. I just want to see why as an individual who has never got influenced by anyone in my life would seek for the alternatives in life which seemed so bewildered by others...<br><br>You might think that cultured ...in one sense<br>is being able to understand ur own identity, but tell me what kind of culture does Singapore really has? I have difficulty telling ppl cos Singapore does not have his OWN culture, and dun tell me by being multi-cultural means it is a culture it self..it is not a copyright thing here..Culture is something close to your heart and in your blood..I studied Anthropology too.( study of cultures all over the world)and it is quite depressing to know or trying to remeber what unique culture does SG..Foreigners only can vividly remember..that it is a "strict" country and a "fine" city, adding the attribution of being clean and green...but sad to say they say it is a country of no  character...Wah..I dunno what to say<br><br>But it is good to note the innermost feelings of how you all feel and what I personally feel, forum is not to criticise but to share individual one's thought.and not trying to offend anyone...<br><br>But dun think only geeks are cultured or artistic, well I may n ot be a wannababe but I did at least part-time modelling before, been to clubs too....so being cultured does not belong tot he geek realm..<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One last message before I go to sleep and dream about my x GF who I seem to miss very much right now for no reason whatsoever.<br><br>peopl e who know me know that I'm finishing my studys in the creative arts....Well...Cultured?  i have no idea what the hell beethoven does or whatever else there is that makes a person cultured...<br><br>I just know that i pass on knowledge to my peers that has some kind of contemporary signifigance...that looks beyond what we usually like to see....<br><br>Although I do know a few past painters and such, I am a contemporary man.  I only believe that the past is there to tell us where we were and where we should head to with knoledge of that fact.<br><br>Jason, i know what u r saying.  Many people don't consider the sub-cultures very important in Singapore while overseas, they are just booming in an undergorund kind of way.  Althoug, u must know that we need to furnish people here with knowledge of the past...As Rinoa has said already, Singapore is ver hard pressed to find an cultural identity that is their own...and Singlish is just the tip only...a very small part of it...<br><br>i don't know if u will agree Rinoa, but people who have taken Archi or Design, or History/Anthropology know that the problem with singapore is that we have no history here...There is history as a fact, then there is a history that exists in Singaporeans minds....<br><br>Most Singaporeans have a "collective amnesia" about it's own history...due to a large part to the governments plans of Tabula Rasa(Raze everything to the ground regardless of historical value) for the purpose of building newer and newer buildings for more and more commercial projects....With every razing, a part of Singapore dies and with it the memory that people have for that.<br><br>That is why we need to import so many different aspects of culture from so many different places...The fact that a country *has* to import culture is very sad and whoever is to blame should be blamed...in part to the government and in part to the people.  No one really cares how Singapore was developed or came about...only...where am i going to make money today....and how much today....<br><br>The government only now realises their mistake,(altho u will never hear them say it) and this is their attempt at attoning for their lack of cultural planning.<br><br>so in effect, Singaporeans do need to learn about history...not just locally, but world history...How many people here know who Ghengis Khan is?  From my own queries...almost noone...and the guy used to own half the damn world...geez....<br><br>Without history, u have no future...<br><br>That being said(sorry my post is long and is sure to bore even my stalwart fans), I am all for contemporary culture, but u see, it clashes with the gov. idea of what culture is, as these cultures are only youth cultures..What about everyone else.<br><br>Frankly speaking, i don't want a bunch of rowdy headbangers running around orchard getting into fights with me...and I know they will...I got that beat me up face.:-)<br><br>being a graphic artsit, designer, archi, painter,blah blah blah, I have this interest to stay current and ahead of trends and ideas...I am contemporary, but does that make one uncultured?<br><br>no, i don't think so.  Do u have anything to contribute to anyone that can change their lives?  Culture is just something that exists ...can't be imported...even importing rock/alternative culture here wouldn't work...u would only have a city full of poseurs.  believe me...Culture is something that u feel in ur heart for....It can set u apart of make u one with ur community, but either way, u make it happen, not the government and importation....<br><br>Long enough...i have more to say, but too long already...and too sad..bye.<br><br>________________________________<br><br>"I may be ugly, but I'm gentle..."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Spore guys not cultured? boring? i dunno about that... well, isn't it a stereotypical view that all asian parents force their kids to learn how to play an instrument when they are really young? at least it was in my case... frickin had to learn how to play piano and organ... if i dun practice my mum would beat the pulp out of my hands and butt with the "ROTAN"... I was only FIVE man... FIVE, dammit... anyways, got bored of it 8 yrs later and picked up violin and string bass... Now, i'm in college, and the only thing musical or cultural i do is go to clubs and party all nite long... not to mention those stupid general elective classes u have to take like Music Appreciation, Art appreciation...<br>yup, i agree with wat all the guys have to say... i dun exactly feel very cultured even though i know all sorts of composers and artist from the Middle Ages til now (thnx to my "required" classes), i just feel more confident in conversation with arty people, meaning at least i know who da heck they talking about... i know alot of spore guys who do not know the classics but are really NICE, refine, and really DEEP guys...<br>so Rinoa, there is 3 million people in spore, i think the chance of finding a nice, cultured, deep, interesting person is quite high  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>R. Heartilly: I thought the motivation to ask the original question was in part a declaration about your personal judgement that ---not knowing the classical arts= not cultured= bad. I stand corrected. Also, correct me if I'm wrong crude, but  then I got the impression that you have fallen into the trap of ---I haven't met anyone that has my same interests= there isn't anyone that have the same interests as me. Well, not true of course.<br><br>As well, I suggest that part of Singapore's culture is to do anything to survive, to fit in. Thats why we are so competitive. I'm not placing  value on that, so please, nobody don't ask me something like whats wrong with that. Culture does not have to be limited to the arts, although I don't know enough of the arts in Singapore to say anything about that. Thats why I'm still read all the postings here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Brave heart<br>Just to let you know I am great fan of the movie "Braveheart", simply love the soundtrack,cinematagraphy and of cos the scenic view of Ireland.Yes, James Horner is also the composer of the soundtrack of Braveheart...and I too realise that he uses the Japanese flute, which is why I am so attracted to his music. LSO(London Symphony of Orchestra) is cool as well.<br><br>And glad to know that you paid attention to the composers cos hardly ppl knows. Titanic, I still think Enya will be suitable to sing the theme song cos she is very special in her vocal and very mellow yet sensual..Do you think so?<br><br>As for those who have misunderstood,<br>I just want to say how all of you feel, and personally how I feel. Different individual have different ways of defining terms. I must admit SG guys are very nice and humourous bunch. As in a multi-cultural society, we know a bit of everything, but just want to let you know it is that there is no identity. What is your native language?<br>English, Malay, Mandarin??What are we?? We dun have a languageof our own, but i am not saying that i am disgusted that English is my first language cos it gained easier access to what i am now...<br><br>I just want to say, being cultured is not just knowing but also understand and appreciating which does not come easy to everyone...<br><br>Adios<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

Seems to enjoy quite a cult following! Yup, do agree with you on the OST, cinematagraphy and scenic view. In addition, I think the theme of the show too was very inspiring....especially the scene in which he gave the speech before the battle (dammit! forgot what that battle was called..), all the way to the final battle at Bannockburn...<br><br>Hmm...if u liked the OST from Braveheart, you may want to try out the Highlander's one. Its equally grand and memorable as B/H's. Oso, u might want to check out Horner's earlier work in "Willow". It has the Sakauhachi as the main instrument...I personally think that's his best work to date (then again I'm a biased person <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">)!<br><br>As for Enya's vocals, I'm afraid I'm unable to comment on that because I have only watched Titanic once (and on VCD only)...so I did not really take note of the soundtrack (unlike that ever irritating "my heart will go on"). Perhaps Celine Dion was selected in favour to Enya due to commercial marketing reasons *shrug*?<br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br></div>

Nevertheless, I will take a look at the OST u are talking about.Always felt that James Horner is a very talented composer, I think if he has not won the best composer award, his talents will not be so widely recognised.<br><br>Thanks for the recommendation, I sincerely hope that u will keep me informed with the latest good OST cos ever since I come here, I hardly watched and TV and needless to say any movies.
