            <div class='col-md body'>Ataraxia,<br>I do think it really depends on how enthusiastic the person in wanting ot know about arts. It is something to be natured.A lot of ppl does not know the talent in them sometimes...there has to be an external factor to evoked their hidden interests and talent. You can try to pick up a book and see if it interests u, if not no use trying to impress girls with the "limited" knowledge u have.One will see thru it very soon cos arts and literature is a very deep and abstract subject...<br><br>If you were to go to a play, it is so easy to see if u are really interested or if you understand it.(Most probably he will thin it is a good way to put him to sleep)...<br><br>Though I have not really tried to influence a guy with my artistic "abnormalities"..I do believe that uncultured a guy maybe..will not try to pretend cos it is never easy to be a great pretender....<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

Being cultured is actually how u really feel about culture and how immense u want to get involved in it.For eg, willing to spend $120 to watch a musical or some pop group concert. It is actually how much interests and emphasis u put on it.Going to France or Italy does not make one cultured but in fact just broaden one's horizon and knowledge.<br><br>One of my favourite country is Italy becos of its rich culture and of cos the plays and Italian opera, never fail to mesmerised me...It is more of the feel u have for it...rather than blindly following it...It is love and feeling love.<br><br>Not trying to be too literature-like or too romantic..but that is how I feel...<br><br>PS: My sis , I have asked my bodyguards to send her home when she is going home late...at least she has ppl to cheuffeur  her home...I feel better..thanks..<br><br>So far I have not "publicised myself with my ICQ number except for ppl who knows me here...but maybe next time.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">you want it..?hehhe<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Riona:<br><br>Yeah I suppose so. But it seems the layman's term of "culture" seems to have its roots deeply embedded with the West. Quite sad considering the richness of several oriental cultures like China and Japan.

            <div class='col-md body'>Riona:<br><br>Yeah I suppose so. But it seems the layman's term of "culture" seems to have its roots deeply embedded with the West.

            <div class='col-md body'>actually i haven't been thinking too much abt this topic, but i hope something comes along as i type....let's see now.....what exactly is culture and what does it mean to be cultured.....gee i think u could write an entire thesis on this.<br><br>from what i've read of the posts so far, there does seem to be an identification of culture with european culture specifically. european art, architecture, literature and philosophy have a rich and dynamic feel to it all. but it also has a long historical tradition. the problem with not being brought up in a european culture is that you wouldn't have a good idea of how to appreciate the culture. same way that a european may have some trouble adjusting to a distinctly s'porean culture (which i think does exist even if it is not well-defined) and actually appreciating it for what it is worth.<br><br>so culture to me would be somewhat equivalent to the traditions and ideas and values of a particular place and time.<br><br>what then does it mean to be "cultured"? if i am correct that a culture is defined according to the values, etc. of a specific place and time, then being cultured must be something over and above being just a passive participant in culture. being cultured cannot just be merely existing within a particular culture because then we would all, ipso facto, be considered "cultured" people, and this cannot be.<br><br>so what could it mean to be cultured? ppl who consider themselves cultured often see it either as a sign of breeding or learning. whatever the case, some amt of sustained effort has been put into it. these ppl would hence (rightly or wrongly) prob think that to deserve the right to be called "cultured", you have to be something more than just a nice and polite guy. all cultured ppl, on this view, are nice and polite. but not all nice and polite ppl are cultured. (of course this sounds intuitively wrong).<br><br>notice that as i have presented it, to be "cultured" is to have gone beyond the mere appearance or presentation of. it, rather, has in essence something that is gained or something bestowed after hard work or careful upbringing or training and encapsulates a genuine appreciation and love of the arts, literature, etc.<br><br>but what could it mean to have been brought up being cultured? it goes, as i have suggested, beyond good etiquette and manners.<br>to hazard a guess, i believe that what ppl have at the back of their minds when they call someone cultured is this: that in appreciating the arts, literature, philosophy or architectural feats of times gone by, the cultured person has also had a measure of the socio-historical, political, religious and economic antecedents which gave rise to, say, a particular work of art. if u take notice, almost every piece of european poetry, literature, painting, etc. reflects the Zeitgeist (the sign of the times) of a particular era.<br><br>that is to say, all art/literature, etc. is a kind of social commentary of the times which gave rise to it. it is a reflection of the kind of thinking, the ideas and values of that era.<br><br>this then is where our conceptions of "culture" and "being cultured" meet. the latter is a knowledge and genuine appreciation of the former. i.e. it is an awareness of the values, traditions and events which gave rise to this piece of painting on the one hand, that philosopher's reaction on the other or yet that playwright's satires and so on. these remnants of culture echo the Zeitgeist from which they arose and to which only a clear understanding of their historical contingency, development and place in time can shed light.<br><br>so to be "cultured" is a tall order isn't it? cos i think if by "cultured" u mean that u have to like art and literature and all, then this is what it really entails. not just visiting museums or art exhibitions in vacuo. you need also to appreciate the values and circumstances under which they arose.<br><br>as a brief example, you know all the wonderful buildings and architecture in europe? why don't we build them like this anymore? some say it's because of the Enlightenment, where rationality was exalted above all else and there was a dizzying feeling that scientific reason alone could bring mankind forward onto endless progress. one result of rationality was the emphasis on simplicity and pragmatism. hence, out went all the fancy architectural structures and in came straight (and boring) lines that define "modern" homes and buildings these days. why? beacuse straight lines are simpler, more economical and increased storage (or living) space. the postmodern critique of this style of architecture began just a few decades back, a reaction against this rationalising tendency in modern architecture. the same can prob be said abt a particular piece of literary work being under the influence of say, the christian church or a painting reflecting the ravages of war or one depicting the triumph of liberty and equality at the end of the french revolution. there is something behind it all. not just a particular style of painting or particular way of writing. these of course would be of interest to scholars (and some other wackos) but i think to be "cultured" you need to see the larger, bigger picture.<br><br>so how on earth can one be "cultured" if u dun noe anything about historical trends and the like?<br><br>i am not, mind you, a "cultured" person in this sense. but i think a "cultured" person so defined would want to set himself apart from ppl like you and i. so maybe this is what rinoa meant by being "cultured". so fine, we are all not really cultured in this sense. but that doesn't mean there isn't some sense in which this actually represents what it means to be truly "cultured", esp. to those who do consider themselves so inclined.<br><br>my goodness! what have i done! a bloody thesis of sorts! and i have more to say!<br>but next time maybe....esp some guy who wrote abt reflecting abt the value of life and all that.....i think that as a step towards this, there is a certain kind of self-reflection that can take place that is ahistorical. i am assuming of course that some insights into human behaviour and wants and needs are universal and hold true across space and time. these are psychological insights into human beings. and maybe if we could understand and appreciate this then we can be "cultured" in this quite different but equally important way.<br><br>erm.....just taking a break from writing my thesis so maybe some of that rubbed off here....yikes! sorry guys!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>okay....okay....i'm sorry.<br>for those wondering what the fark i was talking abt earlier, here is a summary of what i meant.<br><br>i was trying to define the terms we were using, since we seemed to be talking abt "culture" and "cultured" quite randomly.<br><br>"culture": something equivalent to the traditions and ideas and values of a particular place and time.<br><br>"to be cultured" (traditionally and eurocentrically defined): this goes beyond mere appearance, like going for plays or operas and listening to classical music and attending art exhibitions or reading the classics. it also includes a proper and genuine appreciation of the historical context out of which these works of art appeared. This historical context can take various forms, socio-political, economic, etc. a cultured person further knows something not just abt the history of events but also the development and history of ideas.<br><br>this is "cultured person" traditionally (and properly) conceived. so i believe this is what rinoa meant? could be wrong.<br><br>but a person not eurocentrically inclined can still be considered "cultured" as long as he knows abt the background out of which certain works of (perhaps oriental) art, literature and so on arose. these works of art, etc, then are expressions of a particular historical era.<br><br>but seen in this way, a "cultured person" would still be one that is steeped in history and tradition. does that mean that as s'poreans if we are not historically inclined we are never gonna be considered cultured?<br><br>what i am suggesting is that there is another (equally valid) conception of "the cultured person" that is ahistorical.<br><br>since, in the traditional view, a cultured person must be conversant in traditions and ideas and values of a particular place and time, what is important then is that you know about and appreciate these values, and their place in relation to the various arts.<br><br>but are there ahistorical ideas and values? values that hold good for all time? and that are the basis of all cultures? if there are these have to be values closely related to the very essence of being.<br><br>are there insights into human behaviour and action that could hold true regardless of space and time? could there be psychological insights into human nature?<br><br>if so, then to be "cultured" can also mean to know abt and appreciate these perennial human tendencies and inclinations.<br><br>on this view, a self-reflective person would be considered "cultured", since he would stumble upon "truths" abt human nature in general regardless of particular eras or cultures. what is of primary importance to a "cultured person", remember, are knowing and appreciating the ideas and values they find, not whether these values are historical or eternal.<br><br>erm.....i hope this is clearer? *cringe*<br><br>as an example of insights into human nature (and self-reflection and self-knowledge more generally), i am currently reading a book by La Rochefoucauld entitled Reflexions ou sentences et maximes morales. it is a collection of aphorisms abt the life experiences of the author. this book has nothing much more than short sayings by the author which reflect the nature of human beings (from his point of view). so perhaps<br>this is one way of looking at the world and seeing if it applies to ourselves, to our world. and i was thinking that this self-awareness may then be one sign of a cultured person?<br><br>i'll just leave you with some quotes from the book and maybe you'll have a better idea what i mean. u may not agree with all of them of course. dun worry they are short quotes (for ppl like me with short attention spans):<br><br>our promises are made in proportion to our hopes, but kept in proportion to our fears.<br><br>our temperament decides the value of everything fortune bestows on us.<br><br>if pure love exists, free from the dross of our other passions, it lies hidden in the depths of our hearts and unknown even to ourselves.<br><br>to refuse to accept praise is to want to be praised twice over.<br><br>when we resist our passions it is more on account of their weakness than our strength.<br><br>in most men love of justice is only fear of suffering injustice.<br><br>we cannot get over being deceived by our enemies and betrayed by our friends, yet we are often content to be so treated by ourselves.<br><br>we betray more often through weakness than through deliberate intention to betray.<br><br>some ppl would never have fallen in love if they had never heard of love.<br><br>few men are sufficiently discerning to appreciate all the evil they do.<br><br>there are many more of these of course.<br>but i am not saying that all self-knowledge comes from little witty one-liners. far from it, self-knowledge usu comes from one's own life experiences and from our reflections upon them. so maybe when we think abt our own lives and change for the better, we are really being "cultured" ppl after all.<br><br>gee....think i better stop, getting a cramp in my brain.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks fire for summarising,<br><br>Fadingstart.<br>First I was just wondering if you are the one who e-mailed me.just me and my psych instinct!As far as I can see, I now realise that diff ppl has got diff defination of what cultured is all about. Err, as for it is just the general defination which I unfortunately fell in to.I am really glad to see guys in this forum speaking up for themselves and defining what cultured really mean to them. I am also very hypertonic to even know that U wrote such a long thesis, and u were saying in the first place that u actually did not really think much about this thread. the summary that you wrote is still long but nevertheless I fully understood what u mean.(Now I know who are the more artisitic and cultured in the midst of us)Real cool! I hope to see all of u soon once I backin Sg. I think it will feel great to talk this in person and see all of your expression!<br>So long!<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi<br><br>firewire - erm....if i'm not wrong, i'm a couple of yrs older than you are. and before you run away with the idea that i noe my archi, actually i don't. it was just an example i heard when i was trying to find out more about structuralism, post-structuralism (or deconstruction) and post-modernity. i'm really more interested in the history of ideas and how they relate to epistemology, ethics and the like. fascinating stuff.....when you're in the mood for it!<br><br>actually, your idea of appreciating that thing "bigger than ourselves" sounds a lot like the celebration of the human spirit. in all that we do, there is a bit of the myriad of ways in which the human spirit (in its toils and labours and creativity) has manifested itself. so to celebrate the fruits of our labour (the work and labour of mankind, e.g. works of art, literary masterpieces, etc.) is to celebrate the power and ingenuity of the human spirit. wonder if this was what you had in mind?<br><br>i think some cultures appreciate the wonder of the human spirit more than others. they realise its potential and are spurred on to even greater expressions of that spirit because they understand that it is very much in their power, in their own hands to change things, to change history, to give creative expression to themselves.<br><br>hmmmm....i think i know what you mean about asking questions and all.....much like the Socratic reminder that the unexamined life is not worth living. we take stock of where we are now, our values and all, question its premises and assumptions and pre-suppositions and then learn more about ourselves in the process.<br><br>rinoa - nopes....wasn't me who emailed you. if i did, i'd be quite interested what i wrote too. haha!<br><br>well the summary i wrote was just the first half. the remaining half of my long-windedness was an elaboration of a separate point....i think it's always fascinating to learn abt human motivations and intentions...."Know thyself", Socrates once said. of course not everyone is cut out to be so self-reflective all the time but i believe that it is impt to start somewhere. it gives you a greater sense of awareness of yourself and of life in general. and i think self-reflective ppl are the most interesting kinda ppl too!<br><br>also, i think it's great you're doing a course in psychology....wanted to take it myself but they put me on the "reserve list" and so i opted out. anyways, contrary to what you may think, there is actually a growing demand for ppl with a psychology degree in both the public and private sectors in s'pore. i worked for two yrs and knew some psychologists myself....definitely an up-and-coming profession. so you dun have to worry too much....u can confidently pursue your dream and get a good job at the end of the day too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
