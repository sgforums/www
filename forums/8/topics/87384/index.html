Do u even know the major flaw of this joke of a gadget?<br><br>Today, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the first Walkman, Sony announced a new 20GB hard drive-based "MP3" player, called the Network Walkman NW-HD1. Sony continues to show off its sharp design chops, evidenced by the NW-HD1's ultracompact size and touch-sensitive directional control; but like every other MP3 player to come out of the company's consumer electronics division, <span style="color: red;">this model doesn't actually play MP3s</span>. <span style="color: red;">Instead, MP3s, WAVs, and WMAs must be transcoded to Sony's proprietary ATRAC3 format, which slows down file transfers.</span> If you plan on buying songs from only Sony Connect or ripping songs directly to ATRAC3, this won't be an issue for you. Gadget lovers who don't mind the format constriction can purchase the NW-HD1 beginning in mid-August.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cooleo: There's no where in the article which says Creative wants to kill/overtake Apple's ipod<br><br>I'm wondering why the over reaction...<br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/technologynews/view/96462/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/technologynews/view/96462/1/.html</a><br><br>SINGAPORE : Singapore's Creative Technology took on Apple Computer's iconic iPod portable music player with the launch on Monday of its own 20-gigabyte Zen Touch, capable of storing 10,000 songs.<br><br>"We are now playing in the big league. We are ready for the prime time. The PDE (personal digital entertainment) market is exploding and we cannot be left behind," chief executive and chairman Sim Wong Hoo said at the launch.<br><br>The Zen Touch audio player caps the company's transformation from computer sound card maker to a PDE maker and puts it in the same league as the industry's biggest players, he added.<br><br>Japan's Sony is widely recognised as the industry leader in the personal digital entertainment market although Apple Computer has captured a huge share of the portable music player market with its iPod.<br><br>The 20-gigabyte Zen Touch will be available this month for US$269.99, with a 40-gigabtye version also to be launched soon.<br><br>Creative claims the Zen Touch has up to three times more battery life than the iPod, is capable of holding up to twice the music and costs about two thirds of the price.<br><br>Mr Sim said the Zen Touch, which has a 1.8-inch hard drive, held further appeal because of its patented "touch pad" control, which allows easier access to musical selections.<br><br>"The Zen Touch is so easy and fun to use because the touch pad allows the user to find their favourite songs with a touch and drag of their finger on the touch pad in a neutral, vertical motion," he said.<br><br>"This makes it more intuitive than a circular motion in locating songs (as used by the iPod), or you can just hit the random button for a mix of music to match any mood."<br><br>With USB 2.0 connectivity, music can be transferred from a personal computer at one song per second.<br><br>Mr Sim said Creative would launch a ground-breaking marketing campaign to coincide with the launch of the Zen Touch to promote the company as a PDE heavyweight.<br><br>"We have so many products but I think not a lot of people know Creative has so many products. They still think we are a sound card company," he said.<br><br>Mr Sim said Creative had "under-marketed" itself to focus on profitability during the economic downturn of recent years but that was about to change.<br><br>He said Creative's marketing blitz would start in its home market of Singapore and expand globally if successful.<br><br>Sony also launched its rival to the iPod this month with a 20-gigabyte hard drive-based player capable of storing 13,000 songs.<br><br>At 110 grams, Sony said its Network Walkman NW-HD1 is the world's smallest and lightest portable music player. - AFP</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Give a read, its interesting.<br><br>Last para Extracted from <a href="http://www.ipodlounge.com/articles_more.php?id=4342_0_8_0_M" rel="nofollow">http://www.ipodlounge.com/articles_more.php?id=4342_0_8_0_M</a><br><br>Parting Thoughts<br><br>Though this article may seem partisan, we're certainly not closed-minded to the possibility that something could come along and really blow away the iPod. At the moment, however, we can't help but be surprised that such major competitors have been embarrassing themselves with cheap knockoffs, weak promotions, and scatterbrained product designs.<br><br>Apple's been more than lucky to date. It designed so well and acted so fast that the iPod was clearly ahead of the pack for two years. And we know that Apple has fantastic new things just waiting in its labs to be unveiled.<br><br>But as we've suggested before, even if the war over digital music players has already ended - which isn't entirely certain - there are still important battles yet to be fought over other features, from photos to video and games. This past month hasn't brought any serious challenges to the iPod, but who knows what this next month will hold? As always, we look forward to seeing what Apple has in store, and expect that exciting new announcements aren't too far off.</div>
