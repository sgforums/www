We are ready for the prime time. The PDE (personal digital entertainment) market is exploding and we cannot be left behind," chief executive and chairman Sim Wong Hoo said at the launch.<br><br>The Zen Touch audio player caps the company's transformation from computer sound card maker to a PDE maker and puts it in the same league as the industry's biggest players, he added.<br><br>Japan's Sony is widely recognised as the industry leader in the personal digital entertainment market although Apple Computer has captured a huge share of the portable music player market with its iPod.<br><br>The 20-gigabyte Zen Touch will be available this month for US$269.99, with a 40-gigabtye version also to be launched soon.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Creative claims the Zen Touch has up to three times more battery life than the iPod, is capable of holding up to twice the music and costs about two thirds of the price.</span><br>Mr Sim said the Zen Touch, which has a 1.8-inch hard drive, held further appeal because of its patented "touch pad" control, which allows easier access to musical selections.<br><br>"The Zen Touch is so easy and fun to use because the touch pad allows the user to find their favourite songs with a touch and drag of their finger on the touch pad in a neutral, vertical motion," he said.<br><br><span style="color: red;">"This makes it more intuitive than a circular motion in locating songs (as used by the iPod), or you can just hit the random button for a mix of music to match any mood."</span><br>With USB 2.0 connectivity, music can be transferred from a personal computer at one song per second.<br><br>Mr Sim said Creative would launch a ground-breaking marketing campaign to coincide with the launch of the Zen Touch to promote the company as a PDE heavyweight.<br><br>"We have so many products but I think not a lot of people know Creative has so many products. They still think we are a sound card company," he said.<br><br>Mr Sim said Creative had "under-marketed" itself to focus on profitability during the economic downturn of recent years but that was about to change.<br><br>He said Creative's marketing blitz would start in its home market of Singapore and expand globally if successful.<br><br>Sony also launched its rival to the iPod this month with a 20-gigabyte hard drive-based player capable of storing 13,000 songs.<br><br>At 110 grams, Sony said its Network Walkman NW-HD1 is the world's smallest and lightest portable music player. - AFP</div></blockquote>If Creative is not targeting iPod users, then why will they wanna keep on pitting themselves against iPod? It's simple and rational to pit yourself against the competitor if you wish to get a slice of their pie. It's as obvious as daylight. Anyway, Mr Sim will know what i am taking about.</div>

Unlike most (but not all) competing digital audio players available at the time, Apple relies on a hard disk for storage instead of flash memory or interchangeable CD-ROMs, and uniquely focuses on promoting the small size, power, and ease of use of its device. The first iPod has a 5 GB storage capacity - enough for over 1,000 songs - and works only on Macs, using iTunes as a music organization and CD-to-iPod conversion tool. Did Apple release iTunes with the iPod in mind? According to an official Apple timeline, development of the iPod began only six months earlier.<br><br>November 10, 2001<br>Apple ships the first iPod.<br><br>Mid-November, 2001<br>Third-party developers begin to write workaround software that lets the iPod work with PCs. While first demo versions of the software are available in January of 2002, final versions won't emerge until June of 2002.<br><br>December 31, 2001<br>By the end of 2001, Apple has sold a total of 125,000 iPods.<br><br><img src="http://www.ipodlounge.com/assets/images/articles/history/ipod-graph.gif"><br></div>
