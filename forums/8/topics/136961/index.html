            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &gt; Jan 31, 2005<br>&gt; &gt; When Mr Right comes at the wrong time<br>&gt; &gt; by Janice Wong<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; SOMETIMES, timing rather than love decides who we end up being with -<br>&gt; &gt; or without.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   Only some lucky people marry the loves of their lives. The rest marry<br>&gt; &gt; the most suitable person who comes along when they are ready to settle<br>&gt; &gt; down.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   A friend in his 20s came to this conclusion after confiding in me<br>&gt; &gt; that he had recently met a woman who is more attractive than his wife,<br>&gt; &gt; and so occupies his thoughts more often than his wife does.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;  'If only I had met her before I got married,' he said wistfully.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   But I think even if the love of one's life appears when one is<br>&gt; &gt; single, one may not be in the right frame of mind to recognise him or<br>&gt; &gt; her as such.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   And then love passes by.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   Life is littered with near misses and lost opportunities.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   I attended my ex-boyfriend's wedding last month, which triggered many<br>&gt; &gt; memories.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   We met five years ago when I was 23 and he 31. It was love at first<br>&gt; &gt; sight.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;      He had an established career, was down-to-earth and steadfastly<br>&gt; &gt; religious.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   I was then working as an air stewardess and my head was - literally<br>&gt; &gt; and metaphorically - in the clouds.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   I was also - well, let's put it this way - not religious.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   Despite our differences, we were soulmates. We had the same quirky<br>&gt; &gt; sense of humour and shared long, intense overnight conversations.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   But human nature is perverse. When someone is excessively nice to us,<br>&gt; &gt; we start taking things for granted, instead of appreciating them even<br>&gt; &gt; more.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   My ex sent me to the airport, fixed my PC, reminded me to take health<br>&gt; &gt; supplements - and go to church.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   He had everything I could want in a husband - except that I was not<br>&gt; &gt; looking for one. A boyfriend was all I could cope with then.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   I loved fast cars, danced wildly at Zouk and took off on shopping<br>&gt; &gt; holidays at a whim. My life revolved around I, me and myself.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   In the six months that we were together, he popped the question<br>&gt; &gt; several times and talked ad nauseam about having children. He wanted us<br>&gt; &gt; to enrol for a Christian marriage preparation course.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   Yes, I did often fantasise about a Vera Wang wedding gown, but I was<br>&gt; &gt; at that stage of my life when I was more interested in Guess than Baby<br>&gt; &gt; Guess.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   And where - dare I admit it? - I still wanted to meet other men.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   So I was a 23-year-old with the emotional maturity of a 13-year-old.<br>&gt; &gt; Responsibility? Wasn't that for adults?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   In short, I met Mr Right at the wrong time.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   The more he talked about marriage and religion, the more I felt<br>&gt; &gt; pressured and the more pressured I felt, the more irritable I became.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   I was too impatient to compromise. Every trivial matter blew up as a<br>&gt; &gt; big deal. My mood obliterated the good in our relationship and reached a<br>&gt; &gt; point where I just wanted out.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   He was heartbroken; I was sad but relieved. He still called me<br>&gt; &gt; regularly, beseeching me to change my mind.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   The calls stopped finally after a year. Now and then, we say 'Hi' via<br>&gt; &gt; e-mail.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   I had a few painful relationships after that. Served me right, as<br>&gt; &gt; those rude wake-up calls were necessary for me to realise the<br>&gt; &gt; meaninglessness of my hedonistic high life.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   I missed the tenderness of my ex and began having second thoughts.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   Perhaps I also felt more urgency to find someone marriageable before<br>&gt; &gt; my biological clock reached zero hour. It dawned on me that I am not a<br>&gt; &gt; pixie like Peter Pan who can flit around forever. One day, I'd wake up<br>&gt; &gt; sick and alone when my fair weather friends flit away.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   But I was too proud and too unsure of my ex's reaction to call him<br>&gt; &gt; until last year.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   The first thing he told me excitedly was that he had found The One.<br>&gt; &gt; My heart tumbled to my feet. So, that's Fate.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   If only I could turn back time. If only I had met him later. If<br>&gt; &gt; only... what feeble words.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   These days, I am more circumspect. I have come to terms with my loss.<br>&gt; &gt; There is nothing I can do about timing, but I can do everything about my<br>&gt; &gt; choices.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   Sometimes, when the nights get lonely, I toy with the idea of<br>&gt; &gt; marrying a platonic friend of mine, who often assures me earnestly that,<br>&gt; &gt; if the worst comes to the worst, he'd be willing to marry me.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   But I always dismiss that. I have already made one mistake. I should<br>&gt; &gt; not make another by settling for second best merely for the sake of<br>&gt; &gt; getting hitched - only to regret it soon after, as the guy who confided<br>&gt; &gt; in me did.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;   Hopefully, the best is not over but yet to be.<br>&gt; &gt;</div>
