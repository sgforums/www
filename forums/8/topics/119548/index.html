            <div class='col-md body'>This is what happens when you try to go against the rule of nature and put power/authority into people not meant for it..<br><br>Now you know why ancient china,vietnam and india etc, etc..  all practice very strict form of patriachale family structure.. not for fun mind you.. its for survival..<br><br>More battered hubbies seek court protection<br>By Ansley Ng, TODAY<br><br>SINGAPORE : For years, white-collar worker John (not his real name) had been enduring his wife's frequent violent outbursts.<br><br>Sometimes, she would throw ashtrays and books at him when she got angry. On other days, he would get scratched or punched.<br><br>But when the heavily pregnant woman threatened him with a chopper after a quarrel, John decided that enough was enough. He left home and sought a Personal Protection Order from the Family and Juvenile Justice Centre.<br><br>"What struck me most was that he really wanted the marriage to work," recalled court social worker Goh Soo Cheng. "He still loves her and merely wanted to remove the violent part from the marriage."<br><br>Distressed men like John made up a near-three-fold increase in the number of males applying for protection orders last year as compared to 1997, according to a study released by the Subordinate Court on Wednesday.<br><br>Last year, the number of men seeking protection was about 450, compared to about 161 in 1997, the study showed.<br><br>The study Faces of family violence: A profile study of family violence was based on a sample of 1,918 cases, picked randomly from the number of cases received in 2003 and last year.<br><br>Last year, the centre's Family Transformation and Protection Unit received 2,522 protection order applications. In 2003, it was 2,783.<br><br>Calling the increase in the number of men seeking protection orders "significant", the centre's director, Ms Annie Lee, said a lot of men could have suffered verbal abuse, threats or "actions that border on violence".<br><br>And some men have been at the receiving end of physical pain too.<br><br>"They scratch, they scream, they shout, they threaten," said Ms Lee, of abusive women.<br><br>One reason for the increase in male applicants could be heightened awareness.<br>.<br>"Men are more aware of their protection rights - they are more aware that they can complain," said Ms Lee.<br><br>Also, there might be more men who realise that it is not embarrassing to ask the court to protect them, she added.<br><br>Ms Braema Mathi, president of women's rights group Aware, suggested that more studies be done to find out if there are "deeper frustrations" within women.<br><br>"To be in touch with your pain is very much a human condition and for a long time, men have buried this side of them," she said.<br><br>"There is still a question of (the sexes) wrestling for power. We need to study why women are doing it, whether there are deeper frustrations.<br><br>"We need to track cases annually. The current gap of 1997 and 2004 is too big to really understand this phenomenon well," she said. - TODAY<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My ex-wife applied PPO against me but court granted PPOs for both of us against each other. She have to move out of the house.<br>Why?<br>Argument is very heated up. She throw things at me. Broke my camera lens, a fan, Glasses, broke whatever things that can be thrown. Police was involved &amp; take pictures.  Basically court still side women a little. But facts is facts she cannot denial the evident from police was against her. Because all items broken belongs to me.<br><br>Major argument reason is she cannot answer me why her handphone bill raise from usual $60 to $230. I was paying for her bill. As a clerk should not be this high. After checking she was calling a married man more then 30 times per day.<br><br>Then wanted me just to support her but cannot ask anything she was doing outside. My answer was "Ok, I can support you with $, only one condition. You want $, I want sex. Since you don't want to be a wife but want to be a prositute."  Because both of us know her boyfriend is a married man with 3 kids living on his wife business. Stupid women, start fighting almost everyday. Because I tighten my $ support to her. She even rejected family councelling which I requested.<br><br>All I want to say, now's a day women thinks differently. She want $, want hansband's support, wants fun, wants everything you cannot give. It's too much wanting &amp; way out of handle even for herself.<br><br>People out there, don't let being a man a issues of not applying it. Applying it do spell ending of your marriage. But apply if nesscessary,get your evident to ensure your case. Else usually court will see man has more strength then women &amp; will doubt to grant PPO.</div>
