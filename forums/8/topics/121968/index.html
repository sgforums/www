            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyah, wanna commit adultery also play smart lah.  Come on lah, most of us here have had such fun before....but do it in a discreet and respectable manner lah.<br><br>In some countries, this would be considered a crime of passion and the attackers would probably go scot free, or get off lightly.<br><br>And yes, I've always complained that our laws are a bit unfair sometimes.  It should go after the root of the problem - not the person who is forced into action.  I mean what is the husband supposed to do?  Stand there and polite ask the wife's boyfriend to leave?  Maybe even offer him a drink before that and help him put on his shirt??<br><br>Over here, I could stand on the street and scold you, scold your parents, etc....and you couldn't lay a finger on me, or else you'll go to jail.  Its really stupid.  Elsewhere, if its shown that you provoked the aggressor, you will take the blame too.<br><br>And yes, foreigners always say that we're weak.  And we are.  And its not our fault either.....I mean, how often have you seen a local win over a foreigner (certain type of foreigner) in legal cases here?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The simple answer is that Society does not generally benefit from escalating a situation. Therefore, the law encourages de-escalation.<br><br>After all, we can't have vigilantes running around settling blood feuds can we? The courts and the police are a facility. Ppl should not be afraid to use them.<br><br>I dunno about elsewhere, but here in the UK, provocation is no defence either.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm from a mixture of the new and old schools.  While I believe in strict laws, I also believe that sometimes, the only way is to fight fire with fire.<br><br>Er.....in this case, I didn't feel that the woman was more favoured by law leh.   The court case was about two guys fighting each other (criminal case).....not about adultery (which would be a separate, civil case).  So it didn't directly involve the wife....but of course her actions in provocating the husband into doing what he did should be taken into account for the husband's behaviour.<br><br>In this case, it wasn't a criminal case that the wife and lover were in the house....and so the police couldn't be involved.<br><br>And as for the courts, yes, you can sue the guy.  But no amount of money would erase the hurt in the husband.  I mean, the wife's lover could even tell the husband "hey, your wife is a good screw" in his own home.....and according to the law, the husband couldn't even lay a finger on him.<br><br>And yes, you can sue the wife for divorce too.  But a divorce is just a break up....and probably won't provide the husband with any emotional or psychological relief.  He wouldn't feel any closure.<br><br>I also feel that human nature/reactions should be taken into account.  The husband probably just felt his blood boil, didn't have a clear mind and kinda ran amok.  We've all felt like this before, at some point of our lives.<br><br>I thought in most countries, there is this thing about being legal to assault intruders in your house (in some countries, they'll even shoot intruders and its legal).  However, I don't know if the lover can be considered an intruder in this case, because he was probably allowed in by the wife.  Whatever, he at least should be considered a semi-intruder....someone who didn't use good judgement and knowingly/purposely entered someone else's matrimonial property (or equivalent) for immoral purposes.....which seems like a strong provocation action to me.<br><br>Having said all that, we don't really know the fine details, so we are in no position to pass any strong judgement.<br><br>Aiyah....what's Hotel 81 for?  Or if they don't want to give their names/addresses for the hotel room registration, then just use the car lah (like Carpark H at East Coast) also quite exciting mah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  The most get police cars flashing their lights at you only.....they won't stop you one lah, if you keep below the window sill level.<br><br>Yes, I also agree with lwflee's concerns and logic about encouraging vigilantes, etc.  There's gotta be some kind of law to prevent that too.  The primitive law of the jungle shouldn't prevail 100% of the time (although it seems to be happening on an international scale, where some big countries are using their muscle to coerce other smaller countries - but OK, thats for another discussion altogether).<br><br></div>
