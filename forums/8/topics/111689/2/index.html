            <div class='col-md body'>So guys want women to enter into another one of your "sacred" male dominated places and do better than you and perhaps clean it up - no more swearin', smokin', walkin' round in the buff and other guy stuff.  So next time when you talk to girl and want to date her, she will ask what's your rank and she higher rank than you leh? Then she developed better tactical skills or developed more muscle? Next, all the talking now only about NS and then girls hear all the guys talk like kuniang about their "hardship" in NS, so the girls usually get worse crap. Then the girls can officially look down on the guys for not being able to take a little bit of hardship.<br><br>To be fair, I rather the women get medical training which would make them more useful than all that mindless talk about nails, shopping, and who to "ka cai tao". Very irritating you know. And WTF see your bloody nails other than gays and metrosexual but do you really want a guy who preens himself more than you and people think you are dating a gay?<br><br>Interesting! But can the guys deal with that? I doubt very much the fragile egos can take it. Maybe all the head of states should all be females and the men just stay home and cook.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>I don't know if you guys ever know this, some guys or the weaker looking guys in NS gets bullied. In fact some even get arse raped by straight men. These men who does such things to their own "brothers" in the camp can do any thing if there are girls. Many such men are broken after army and they had to seek counselling. I know of a colleague who work in this department and he feels sad when he had to deal with these cases. Its tramatic and I don't know how men can bring themselves to do this. THe worse part is that, its not rape as in 1 to 1. Its usually gang activity.  And that department specialise in cover up, damage control of these situation. So you will never read about this stories in the papers otherwise, no one will join NS.<br><br>If women are around, the chances of getting raped if very high especially in jungles.  So who would save them when a gang of men prey on the women? Would anyone save them? Would you like your GF, sister, niece, cousin, or even your mother in reservist to be raped by men you know? Would women in NS make men bit.ch less about "inequality". The answer is a resounding NO. They will continue to make snide comments and bad jokes to show the childish and immature people they really are.<br><br>If you want equality, then our bodies are not the same. There can never be equality. For one, I would like to pee standing. I would like men to get preganat and carry that pregnancy for 9 months with about 20kg of weight every day of their lives with their breast lacating milk.  I would like men to know what's call glass ceiling and that condescending/patronising tone they use when they think they know more (or so they think).  How come men can get away with being a jerk and people call him stud but a woman are call slut. Then men go about talking about women as if women are objects, like check out that jug. Why do men make so much noise when they do a little bit more work but women have to bear with it, and take care of everything else and cannot make a sound. Women have to juggle multiple roles and the men still have the same basic roles. Women have advanced to the stage where electrical applicances, plumbing, and such, we can fix ourselves, but ask the men to go shop for groceries, they will always buy the wrong thing or whatever snacks they want to eat.  There is a whole list of inequalities. You point out others, but before you do that, look carefully if you have slefishly taken some things for granted and you yourself make the same mistake.<br><br>You want equality, then make sure in future, there are only men on the planet since most of you think women had it good.  That would solve everything and the arse hole will develop muti puspose.<br><br></div>

I hope for all the people who think the women get it good, come back as a woman and suffer all the things a woman have to go through. Monthly PMS, dieting, slimming, being considered unwanted in a male dominated society, having to hear crap from guys who are born of women and suffer the inequalities for a lifetime having to bend over backwards for the men and yet be unappreciated and taken for granted .<br><br></div>

In fact some even get arse raped by straight men. These men who does such things to their own "brothers" in the camp can do any thing if there are girls. Many such men are broken after army and they had to seek counselling. I know of a colleague who work in this department and he feels sad when he had to deal with these cases. Its tramatic and I don't know how men can bring themselves to do this. THe worse part is that, its not rape as in 1 to 1. Its usually gang activity. And that department specialise in cover up, damage control of these situation. So you will never read about this stories in the papers otherwise, no one will join NS.</div></blockquote>mistyblue where have you heard of men getting ass-raped ?!?! I've served my NS, have friends in nearly every kind of unit and I've never heard that kind of stories. Unless those that commit the crimes are white horses (VIP's son) or VIPs themselves, they won't go unpunished. The army keeps it low key (jia chou bu ke wai yang) as it is a disgrace but those involved won't go unpunished. The public doesn't get to know because they're probably charged under militay law and not civil law.<br><br>Men in NS are horny, but I really doubt straight men will get <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> desperate and arse rape other men. Afterall they book out once a week after which they'll just go geylang or JB or KTVs and relieve themselves.<br><br><blockquote><strong>If women are around, the chances of getting raped if very high especially in jungles. So who would save them when a gang of men prey on the women? Would anyone save them? Would you like your GF, sister, niece, cousin, or even your mother in reservist to be raped by men you know?</strong></blockquote>I can assure the LAST thing on your mind in the jungle is sex. All you want to do is get out of that stupid place. <strong>Every-bloody-thing else is secondary.</strong> Besides, sound travels very far in the field, and screams wouldn't go unheard in a place with hundreds of other men.<br><br>In fact there was a female specialist (sergeant) and a female officer in my unit, both chiong suah-ed, and nothing untoward happened to them that I know of.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Would women in NS make men bit.ch less about "inequality". The answer is a resounding NO. They will continue to make snide comments and bad jokes to show the childish and immature people they really are.</strong></blockquote>Seriously, what have you got against men ?!</div>
