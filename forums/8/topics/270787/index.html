            <div class='col-md body'>I have just finished watching this show just a less than 1hr ago from Channel 8.<br><br>The title of the show is "The Cheaters"<br><br>There was some rules being mention inside the show and was repeated which made me think of it.<br><br>Some of it are quite true..before I forget it again..here goes nothing..<br><br>In the society: there are 2 types of people..the good and the bad..<br><br>since this show is about cheaters naturally i'll talk about the bad people.<br><br>Theme: Cheaters.<br><br>Here are some myths and simple truths of cheats or people who commit crimes:<br><br><strong>Truth:</strong><br><br>1) Cheaters are smarter than average person (if not how are they gonna cheat others, just that they abuse their intelligence in the wrong direction)<br><br>2) Cheats/ Criminals are more discipline than a lot of people (if not how can they plan and hold delay their gratification whereby a lot of people seek instant gratification)<br><br>3) Criminals often commit a crime against their will, and do so when only left when no choice. Sometimes first-time offenders commit crime because they can't get what they want. (at times it's that simple thing, but not many people understand how a small little issue (like lack of love, attention or money) will lead to the start of the rise of a new yet-to-be-criminal.<br><br>When the minority of people who have experienced failed relationships and catch other half cheating on them, then when not handle properly, there's a chance for these minority people to become the next rapist/killer/manslaughter cases.<br><br>The lack of Attention will lead to:<br>Theft in youngersters should teenagers can't get what money can't buy from parents - family bonding and communication thus kids of either rich/poor families resort to theft/stealing to gain attention and get the thrill. With each successful attempt, they will feel good in certain ways thus increasing their confidence which they lack in everyday life..<br><br>As for lack of money: Depending on different situation, it will lead to different levels of crime seriousness.<br><br><strong>Myths:</strong><br><br>1) Criminals are often those un-educated people.<br><br>2) Criminals (Cheaters included) are just wants money.<br><br>3) Educated people seldom commit crimes. (Which has being proven to be false)<br><br><strong>Now back to the topic:</strong><br>What I have learnt from the show:<br><br>Cheaters don't trust their partners<br><br>Cheaters don't have real frens 'they are only making use of each other)<br><br>Cheaters will not put their real feeling in when getting to know anybody.<br><br>One of the cheaters' method of succeeding to cheat is to act and put in sincerity and 'real feelings' to cheat the victim's cash..<br><br>When the show was coming down to an end, than I realised that I've learnt something which can related to some of the cases of people being cheated..<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to cheat people:</span></strong> There are quite a few organizations out-there in Singapore to date still cheating people's money..<br><br>1st - Act Confident<br><br>2nd - Try means and ways to associate themselves with either the govt or give the public a false impression that by being in the building which is build the govt and related departments to work, then they are safe..<br><br>3rd - Will try to make themselves look presentable (but aren't merticulous..)<br><br>4th - Try to infulence people's thinking, not leaving any time for the person to think; using pressurizing methods/hard-selling to push the victim into signing the document/agreement<br><br>5th - Make use of peer pressure and environment to cheat people or claim that they earn a lot from doing these and that, but no proof as verification nor sufficient knowledge to discuss and answer to the questions thus they don't leave a chance for the victim to think.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How Not-To-Be Cheated:</span></strong><br><br>1) Ask for proper documents to check if he/she is a legal salesman/saleswoman (example if selling insurance, as for liscense)<br><br>2) Read the Agreement and think over it carefully, don't submit to pressurizing /hard-selling tatics..<br><br>3) Cross-reference information with Govt and relevert channels.<br><br>4) Put on our thinking hat..Do we really deserve such a good opportunity to earn so much? (if you think you deserve it; partly due to experience con-person knowing how to play around with emotions)<br><br>If it's really our turn to flip our destiny to be rich very fast, yet without doing a lot of things..than most likely you are already being cheated..but you don't know..<br><br>Victims only realize what happen when the name of the criminal has being Shown Clearly via Media means.<br><br>Perhaps some people who have either being cheated or was cheating people might want to share their experience..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>the_fallen</strong>: your first post was very informative. I've not watched the programme but you have given a very good summary... thank you.<br><br>Indeed, there are are lot of mistaken notions or myths about cheaters. We take them at face value but we know very little deep under.<br><br>Since the 'beginning' of time, when man was 'created' or so ......, there was already <strong>good</strong> and <strong>bad</strong> and it had been around since. This simple categorisation is correct.
