Of course there are cases where Singaporeans wanna do but our asking salary is too high and for a lower salary employers can get a foreigner who can do that same job as well.<br><br>Conclusion, are sporeans willing to take up some job task and if you are willing to take up, how easy is that job to be done by others who ask for a lower price to do the same stuff as you?<br>[/b]</blockquote>are those angmohs considered as foreign talent as well?<br>if yes, then what i want to highlight is that most of them come here and draw 5 figure salary monthly ..why must they employ angmoh to do it? why cant they employ singaporean to do it? this is unfair!</div>
