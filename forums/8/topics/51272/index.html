            <div class='col-md body'>Yuu and Ai were classmates. They were very close friends throughout the whole of high school till the very last day...<br><br>Yuu and Ai at the graduation ceremony.<br>: Yuu... I have something to tell you...<br>: (Busy adjusting his tie) Yah... Ai?<br>: Let me help. (With trembling hands, she slowly adjusts his tie.)<br>: What's wrong Ai? (Looks intensely into Ai's eyes)<br>: (Stumbled backwards) No... No...! Don't look at me like that!<br>: (Taken aback) What...what's wrong with you tonight Ai?<br>: Er... No... No... Nothing..<br>: (Taking Ai's hands into his) You look extremely stunning tonight.<br>(Bending foward and getting closer and closer to Ai's cheeks)<br>: ...<br>: Haha... Gotcha!<br>: (Flinched) I'm not in the mood of joking with you Yuu... I... I've got a matter to tell you.<br>: Yah?<br>: I'm... I'm leaving for States to further my studies... I had no choice... My dad...<br>: (Hugs Ai and whispered into her ears) Never mind the rest of the story. I understand.<br><br>Two weeks later at the airport<br>: (Tears welled up in her eyes) It's... time to say goodbye...<br>: Remember to call and email me okay?<br>: I will... I'll be back in three years time... We shall meet again.<br>: Promise?<br>: Promise. Same old meeting place, same time, same date. Deal?<br>: Deal!<br>: Okay... Let's part for now...<br>: Hey... Erm... I've got things to tell you...<br>: Yah?<br>: Erm... Nothing... (He wanted to express his feelings for Ai but never got the courage.)<br>: Oh... Okay... (Disappointed as she wanted Yuu to tell her that he don't want to just be friends.)<br>: Let me leave first. I do not wish to see you leave me. It's hard for me. This is for you. (Yuu handed Ai an expensive pendant and turned away, with quick swift steps, walked away... out of Ai's sight.)<br>Yuu never heard from Ai since then. They totally lost contact but Yuu never forgot Ai and was patiently wating for the day of their agreement.<br><br>Three years later. At the meeting place. A beautiful beach. It was sunset.<br>: Hi... Are you Yuu?<br>: You... you are?<br>: I'm Ai's husband.<br>: ...<br>: Ai wanted me to hand you this. (The man handed him the pendant and walked away.)<br><br>It was the expensive pendant. As Yuu was poor... It took his entire savings and the money he borrowed from his friends to get it. He did not leave the beach the whole night. He was still hopeful that Ai would turn up and would not break their agreement. When all hopes were gone, he grips the pendant hard in his hands... Tears which were about to burst, went straight back to the deepest place in his heart.<br><br>Two years later. A day at the cafe Yuu and Ai used to frequent.<br>Yuu was sipping his coffee when he noticed a girl not far away, having the same coffee as he does. She resembles Ai. He decided to walk over and try his luck.<br>: Ai...?<br>: (Slowly lifts her head) Yuu...?<br>: Is that really you Ai??<br>: ...<br>: (Frowns and slowly fuming) Don't you have anything to say or to explain?!<br>: ...<br>: (Hot in temper) You did not contact me for the 3 WHOLE YEARS in States! But I don't blame you! I've figured you must be too busy with your studies. I convinced myself to stick to this belief for 3 years!! But when the day of our agreement came, you DID NOT TURN UP! I waited and waited till my hopes were all dead. You are a real disappointement. I can't believe you actually did this to me. Not to say that you are already married and you wasn't the one who told me that. (Turned away and ran out, threw the pendant he had always kept with him for the past two years on the ground)<br>: (Sobbing) ...Yuu... (Picked up the pendant with great difficulty) Yuu... I'm sorry...<br>Ai managed to get herself back on her wheelchair and wheeled out of the cafe.<br><br>She was knocked down by a truck the very day she arrived States. It was a miracle she survived after a month of painful struggle in the hospital... All alone with no friends nor kins... All in the hope of seeing Yuu again. But<br>she never knew that she never found the courage to face Yuu again in her<br>handicapped situation. She ended up not contacting Yuu for the 3 years in<br>States and the man the day at the beach was not her husband but her<br>doctor.<br><br>NOt long after, she heard news of Yuu getting married with a air stewardess from a friend of theirs. She secretly attended their wedding although Yuu did not invite her.<br>The girl was beautiful and lucky. Yuu was a good guy. Ai saw her loved man marrying another woman. Her heart aches but she just silently sits at a corner, make herself unknown, and regretted not expressing her feelings for him.<br><br>Yuu puts the ring into the girls's finger after saying "I do". His tears fell. "Ai... I will always love you."<br><br>The story came to an end. Yuu never loved another besides Ai. He married the girl just because she loved him dearly and she was the girl who saved him when he tried to kill himself the day Ai never turn up at the meeting place... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br><span style="color: violet;">If i reach for your hands will u hold it?<br>If i held out my arms will you hug me?<br>If i go for your lips will you kiss me?<br>If i capture yr heart will u love me?</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">It's ok to kiss a fool, it's ok to let a fool kiss you, but never ever let a kiss fool you.<br>It is better to meet the person who will truly love you later, than meet someone now who promises to love you but sooner or later leave you forever.<br>Fate determines who comes into our lives. It is the heart which determines who stays.<br>Love is like a knife, it can stab e heart or it can carve wonderful images into e soul that will last a lifetime</span></div>
