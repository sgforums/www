            <div class='col-md body'><strong><br>The thrill is gone<br>While playgrounds are being made safer, some caution against taking things too far<br><br>By Irena Josoeb<br><br>Hardly any swings left<br><br>Monkey bars may disappear<br><br>Bouncy flooring instead of sand pits<br></strong><br><br>YOU hardly find swings in playgrounds here, monkey bars might soon disappear and those sand pits are being replaced by bouncy flooring. As one mother puts it: 'There is no more thrill.'<br><br>IT'S GETTING HARDER FOR KIDS to enjoy themselves at playgrounds like this one at Bishan Block 155, as swings are getting scarcer and monkey bars being reviewed. -- LAU FOOK KONG<br>Like many parents, Madam L.J. Yip, a 45-year-old engineer who has two daughters aged nine and 11, thinks playgrounds in Singapore have become too boring and unadventurous for kids. Her beef is that the slides are now too low.<br><br>These play areas made the news last week when The Straits Times reported that as many as 40 playgrounds out of about 1,500 here are to be replaced as they do not meet safety standards. Rubber-based flooring will replace the old sandpits, and gaps between ladder rungs will be reduced, all to make it safer for kids.<br><br>The Housing Board (HDB) is also looking at whether monkey bars should be standard equipment in future playgrounds. That's because more than 400 children fell from them in the 12 months ending in January this year and had to be taken to hospital.<br><br>Already, swings are disappearing. In a Sunday Times check of 14 playgrounds in HDB estates, only three, in Hougang, Clementi and Bishan, had swings.<br><br>An HDB spokesman said these are not installed in precinct playgrounds because there is less room to allow them to function safely.<br><strong><br>He added: 'There are also safety considerations...For example, the swing chair can hit others using the playground or careless users might fall off the swings and injure themselves.'<br></strong><br>But others cautioned against taking things too far.<br><br>Mr Sylvester Goh, 42, an event coordinator who also organises children's acrobatic classes, said: <strong>'Why do we want to overreact? If a kid falls and parents start to say he cannot do this and do that, in time to come, kids will grow up without having any adventurous experiences. </strong><br><br>'And these are the ones who are going to shape the future of the country!'<br><br>Housewife Giauw Kip Lee, in her 40s, thinks children today are overprotected. She encourages her daughter, 10, to have fun in their playground.<br><br>She said: 'Many children are now couch potatoes, and they are not able to explore on their own or have initiative. What will become of them? <strong>They will be a generation of softies.'</strong><br><br>Even child experts think there can be room for thrills on playgrounds.<br><br>Dr Brian Yeo, a consultant child psychiatrist at Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre, said: 'Take away the monkey bars and the big slides, and what is left is a rubber-padded place with rocking toys - a toddler playground in open air.<br><br>'Even a Primary 3 kid would be embarrassed to go there when he sees that there are only pre-schoolers there.'<br><br>But what do the children think?<br><br>Asked what he would do if the monkey bars were removed, Billy Tan, 11, who was seen swinging and climbing boisterously from a set of bars at a playground in Toa Payoh Lorong 1, shrugged and said: 'I'll just climb something else.'<br><br>And being hurt is nothing to be afraid of, said 10-year-old Phyllis Quan, from Paya Lebar Methodist Girls' Primary School. 'If I did, I'll take it as an experience and be careful the next time.'<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>over protection? knee jerk reactions to incidents? we haf lived and breathed and grown up wif old playgrounds for eons and no one ever questioned them - until now.<br><br>and we want these kids to grow up to be ENTREPRENEURIAL and RISK-TAKING?<br><br>wat an irony.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
