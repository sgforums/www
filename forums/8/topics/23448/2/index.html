            <div class='col-md body'>ok i guess no one is gonna let up,, but obviously both are needed like blood said... actions can sometimes be SEALED with words.<br><br>both are needed but then this leads me to another point.<br><br>asians a POOR communicators. i'm sure all of us out here have said i love u to certain pple. u think of loved ones, gfs bfs wifes husbands. but the argument goes further. when was the last time u said those words to ur MOTHER? do u love ur mother? if yes, when was the last time u said it to her? it's a rhetorical question really, u dun have to tell me the answer. u urself know.<br><br>and in all honesty, yes i believe that some mothers, upon hearing those words from their offspring, will react negatively. "siow ar u? must be u want something..."<br><br>this just amplifies the fact that asians are poor at expressing feelings thru words. it's almost like it's a TABOO to say the words "i love u"<br><br>when u say those words to someone who already knows that you do, it's just the cherry on top of the cake. It's not needed since she already knows. but it sure makes the cake taste better.<br><br>say it and mean it my friend, becos u won't be telling a lie..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

Even presenting the answer (usually in the english language for me!) requires the brain.<br><br>However the brain can NEVER answer on behalf of the heart. and the heart is where love comes from. so the brain can never answer that question correctly.<br><br>Even if the heart could speak for itself, i doubt any language in this world can even come close to expressing it's feelings. and it does not just limit to love.<br><br>Now you know why words betray you when u are asked that question.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I believe somehow there might be a 'BIG THEORY' behind this one...
