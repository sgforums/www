Unless you mean that US$11,000 is their starting pay over there, which i think it's very unlikely. My friend studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at US Berkeley(2nd in Engineering in the US btw) told me that the starting pay for them is about US$4000-5000 only. But that is not discounting the fact of the high cost(at least twice of SG) of living plus the high cost of health services, high insurance premiums and high taxes over there (30+% while most Singaporeans hardly pay any tax at all).</div>

The next $20k is only taxed at 4.75% only fyi. And 30+% of your income to your CPF contribution is also tax-exempted. Even after counting your property tax and water conservation tax and all, it's not even significant. That's unless you smoke or wanna have a car(quite needless for most pple IMHO)....</div>
