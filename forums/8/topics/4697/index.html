            <div class='col-md body'>Starhub offers free service but no email or dedicated dial-up which could mean that it won't be so reliable.<br><br>Singtel offers to give free service plus email accounts to all singtel phone line subscribers.  They will give us the account automatically without us having to sign up...good for us, but bad for everyone in the long run.<br><br>Pacnet doesn't offer free service.  Instead they are going to pay us to surf ...how I dun know yet and basically it's like their toll savings scheme but u can use it to purchase thingsonline as well as getting vouchers for Taka and offsetting your bill.<br><br>Great for us customers...in the short run, but Singtels free service has just made it very uncompettitve for the other two ISP's...<br>Because Singtel already has these users of it's telephone line, it basically is keeping them from switching...all I can say is that dun just look at the cover of what Singtel is doing...they are known for unscrupulous business practices...and they dun monitor themselves that's why sometimes even the big Gov has to step in and scold them...even then, if it was another company, they would get more than just a scolding, but hey...it's Singtel remmber...a Gov child.<br><br>Pacnet has the right idea...When you start to drastically cut prices, you do noone any good as you will suffer and the consumer will suffer later when you collapse. So an alternative scheme was brought up that didn't require them to cut any prices but still add value-added services...<br><br>Just a note...Starhub is also leasing lines from Singtel...and will be using those lines to offer services like Internet and exchange...:-)<br><br>Singtel, as the monopoly so far, has a very big advantage and their scheme wreaks of the same kind of action that Microsoft is guilty of...If a competitor comes in get SO competitive that there's no way the competitors can survive...and then if they go broke, then of course Singtel can raise prices again....Sorry but that's how these things work...very unscrupulous...and I hope you all rmemeber that Singtel got scolded more than one occasion where the Gov said that their tactics were detrimental to competition...<br><br>I beleiev it's the same here...Dun get me wrong, free net service and email is great, but not at the cost that we might be paying for in the near future....<br><br>Just a thought..<br><br>and just in case you think I'm anti Singtel...I am because they are a monopoly and every holds them up for being such a great and successful company...obviously...the're the only player in town!<br><br>Pacnet cheated me of $140.!!!!  They never sent me a letter to redeem my toll savings and when i asked the outlet about it they told me to wait, so  did...then when it never came I ased again and they said the period to redeem is past already and they can't help me because the letter specifically says that there i a period of redemption that I musrt follow...Fuck La!!!!  i never got the damn letter how I know...If the stupid outlert hadn't told me to wait I surely would have asked them earlier one...all they can manage to tell me was that they can't heklp me....<br><br>$140 +++ dollars just gone like that...Where's starhub huh...oh there they are...ok I'm signing up man.</div>

I had to practically chase them to get things done right. Talk to 2 different ppl and you get 2 different answers. I can't stand the double-standards.<br><br>Anyway, off track.<br><br>Hmm, about Starhub leasing Singtel stuff. SOmehow I thought of it since that's one of the few economically viable solutions.<br><br>Good thing TAS has been impartial all along (they seem to be). IF this continues, competition would bring benefits to the consumers.<br><br>Somehow, Singtel cannot remain monopolistic.
