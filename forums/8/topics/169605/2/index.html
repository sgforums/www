The extra expenditure will become a burden to the parents.<br><br>Lastly, money is used to improve the enjoyment of our lives. For some, being able to afford food, clothing and shelter is an improvement on their current situation. They can derive greater enjoyment from having food, clothing and shelter. For shade343, buying a house is an improvement and he derives enjoyment from owning and staying in the house. for children staying with their parents and are unable to stay on their own, they derive greater enjoyment from a new PSP, ipod nano etc. To all the above mentioned, their money is well spent.</div>
