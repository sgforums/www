Maybe if you have a certain intelligence, skill or ability and you know this chiobu in that same field as you're in.. but when you're outside in public, on the bus, MRT or in the clubs, WHICH GIRL/GUY ACTUALLY GOES FOR INNER BEAUTY? As if it radiates when you're out there and all these people have bionic eyes to turn you inside out. The truth is, it has always been the faÃ§ade. And when you're out there, nothing matters more than the face you display and the face they see.</div>

That kinda thing.<br><br>If on first impression then must be YanDao, but nowadays, I found a trend amongst the people around me: girls go for guys who might not look great but they have POTENTIAL.<br>What is this POTENTIAL? Lets say, if you're a President Scholar, PSC Scholar, scoring 4As and 2 distinctions for your S Papers, on the Dean's List, Honour roll, have your own IT company at the age of 21...yeah, THAT kinda thing.<br><br>The abovementioned types have what it takes to give the girls a 'good life' when they make it big...and believe me, they WILL make it big.<br>Normal Joes like my friends and I usually have no chance bec we i)skip lectures ii)have no idea when to hand up that Project iii)play too much pool iv)still on week 4 tutorials when the Lecturer is on week 8...etc.<br><br>So when girls say that they do not go for looks, BELIEVE them.

            <div class='col-md body'>My 2 cents.....<br><br>One thing that comes to mind abt singaproe gals, esp 'chio bus', are that most of the time they act cool, bueyhiaobai? like cryogenic say, they think they very goodlooking thus got a certain 'reputation' to maintain, hence the ice maiden facade.<br><br>I've been to Taiwan, Japan before. All I can say is that the girls there are much prettier. And furthermore, they are APPROACHABLE. Yup, the gals over there are very friendly! Not in a sexual kind of way, but just pure friendliness. They can just talk to you anywhere! Down the aisles of a shop, along the road etc. No icy looks, 'tao' faces at all! Perhaps it's because I'm a 'foreigner' there, but still I think singapore gals can learn a thing or two from their Asian counterparts.....</div>
