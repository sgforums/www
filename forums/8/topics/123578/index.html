            <div class='col-md body'>Dear New Towkay,<br><br>Err, don't say I don't tell you, but running a classic Chinese family business is not easy.. It's a time-honoured tradition and you cannot anyhow play-play..<br><br>But you're lucky.. Recently, don't know why, but got a lot of people call me and say they are now working for a family business (some funny company called Thema Sick Holdings or something) and want to know how to do things swee-swee..<br><br>Because of the demand, I am going to write a book..<br><br>But because you ask so nicely, I will give you some basic ideas.. But make sure when my book is published, please go and buy it, okay? Otherwise I will send some of my 'brothers' to come and 'visit' you..<br><br>Okay!! First thing is you must be very lucky to have a powerful daddy who owned this business to pass down to you, otherwise it will be difficult..<br><br>Nowsaday it's very hard to start a company because of unfair competition by all other family-owned business..<br><br>(To everybody else who don't have such family connections, you better give up and start looking for jobs in Australia.)<br><br>First, you must take care of your daddyÂ—give him a title like 'SM' or, in MBA-language, 'mentor'..<br><br>Also, don't forget to reward the stooge your father put you in place to run the company before you came of age.. Maybe you can give him your daddy's former title, but make sure he only gets the title and none of the perks that came with it.. Cannot boh tua boh suay, correct?<br><br>Now to the business Â— this is very important.. You must make sure that you control the money, because cash is king.. That's why in Chinese restaurants, a family member always sits at the cash register..  not only must you be the CEO, you must also be in charge of the finance as well, i.e. the CFO..<br><br>For example : if the business represents a country, you, became both the Prime Minister AND Finance Minister.. You must put the loyal old ah pek(your father) who warm the seat for you as member of the board (maybe make him 'Chairman' or 'mentor')<br><br>You must also staff his teams with your connections..  make sure the Board only makes suggestions and recommendations, but you will make the final decision..<br><br>To make things easier, put your wife in charge of all the diversified family holding companies, with control over the subsidiaries as well as the investments in other companies..<br><br>If you are a classic Chinese businessman, your wife is probably not a very good manager or maybe she is lousy and lost a lot of money before.. So you must have lots of yes-men and three legs men in your company..<br><br>These people will be there to take the blames when she c0ck up.. In the mean time, for good investments, she can take the credit and got promoted..<br><br>If you got a younger brother, put him in charge of the largest subsidiary, the family cash-cow that makes the profits for your enterprise..<br><br>Again, you must not forget your father.. He should be the grand Chairman of the secret company that actually controls all the assets, invested offshore, or deposited in secret banking accounts worldwide..<br><br>Important notice : under no circumstances must you make the operations of this company known to your shareholders.. Pick auditors and accountants who are loyal to you.. Maybe you got a former jaga? Make him the 'guardian' of these assets.. He should be loyal enough.. If not, you can always slap the  bugger.. when other independent directors question the value of the assets, tell them they must wait long procedures because it will take many, many man-years to calculate.. Then quietly retire them..<br><br>As for security, you must have the cooperation of a trusted gang to do your dirty work.. Like 'Band of Brothers'... but in your case, the brothers must be the 'same blood'-type..<br><br>These people will help you and do enforcement with minimum efforts.. you must also keep up with the times.. Bicycle chains, breaking peoples' legs, hanging pigs heads on their doors etc.. are a bit old-fashioned.. try IMH..<br><br>Nowsaday, all bullying and intimidation is done through the legal process, for example, by suing your enemies for defamation and bankrupting them.. More civilize and cleaner than having blood and dead bodies all over the place..<br>So make sure you got a team of lawyers that are loyal to you.. if you are lucky, own a law firm to save the trouble..<br><br>But what happens if the other side also have lawyers? No problem.. Just make sure you have judges on your side.. The best is if you got an old family friend who is a senior judge.. If your father knew his business, it will be easier..<br><br>As for the police, dun worry.. Go find a relative, for example, an uncle who used to work with the force before, is good enough..<br><br>You also need other security people but give them a respectable title, call them a 'department' like International Services Department (ISD) or some fanciful name, and adopt modern marketing techniques for developing trust and cooperation with business partners or competitors like the use of high-tech surveillance and air-conditioning.. You can sabo competitors by labeling them as 'Communists', but just be careful.. don't do that with the mainland Chinese, OK? They don't like it..<br><br>People who used to work for you in these security departments can also help you do the PR work by working for you in the newspapers or TV stations,  instead of reporting TO you, they can report good things FOR you.. Always Remember, 'PR' are the first two letters of the word 'propaganda'..<br><br>Well, this is only a short summary of what should be done..<br><br>As for what happens next, you must buy my book to find out more..<br><br>But you can take some tips from me.. Keep to the basics.. Drugs are good business, just call it 'pharmaceuticals' and you are all set for the 21st century.. Don't forget other traditional activities like gambling, which is always profitable, so big projects like starting a casino, should always be on the top of your list of priorities..<br><br>One final word of advice Â— your family business may have some established  customers and trading partners, like some really big-shot towkays, and you must not do anything to sabo those relationships..<br><br>So, congratulations, you have arrived.. Don't forget to pay yourself a good salary Â— a million dollars at least, so I can get a good 'cut' for future advice on your business..<br><br></div>
