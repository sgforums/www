            <div class='col-md body'>It's seems that the Pay and pay scheme is still ongoing...<br><br>Now they wanna implement Nitetime ERP to reduce the volume flow along the CTE which BG yeo claims is becoz of too many cars on the road.<br><br>Just like the sq006 incident where the investigating board pinned 98% of the blame on the pilots, BG Yeo pins 100% blame on the total number of car-driving users.<br><br>There are plenty of factors as well. In particular the zone just b4 the braddell road exit is disgusting, both in terms of bumper-bumper traffic and the fact that it lasts for almost 4 hr at one go.<br><br>The coincidence is that this location contains perhaps THE only myriad of inerlocking exits and filters out of and into the expressway at any one time.<br><br>And to top it all, the govt decided to throw a speed camera along this stretch too...<br><br>It's therefore sad that they use this excuse of too many cars on the road to continue implementing more and more ERP gantry points and at odder hours of the day. That is hardly the sole cause of the jams.<br><br>Left unchecked, we the future owners of vehicles may end up cycling to work instead, given the rapidly rising costs of owning a vehicle, much less driving it ard.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the lightning strike party is very clear about owning car policy. If you want to feed a car be prepared to feed those ERP, increase parking fees, road tax, COEs etc money else who ask you beat swollen face skin act as fatty? Take public transport lor.<br><br>However, in this recent move, it seems to target the car owners living north which I think is quite unfair as they pay about same amount to feed car any yet those car owners who don't live north no need pay extra.<br><br>Solution: Make those nite time ERP applicable to all roads and then it will be fair to all car owners.<br><br>Alternative solution: Abolish nite time ERP altogther.

Ask car owners who stay north to move house?<br><br>In this scenario, it hurts the pocket of car owners who live North but not others.
