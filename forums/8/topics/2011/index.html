I suggest you talk to her directly, preferable face to face, so that she can see and hear ur sincerity. She's probably a bit lost and confused now........so you only have to confuse, convince or simply con her a little more so that she'll fall for you....viola! If you donno what to say, the following might be useful to u, extracted from a sitcom....<br><br>ROSS: Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.<br><br>RACH: Ross, it's too hard.<br><br>ROSS: No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.<br><br>RACH: Ross, you're like my best friend.<br><br>ROSS: I know.<br><br>RACH: If we broke up, and I lost you...<br><br>ROSS: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?<br><br>RACH: Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?<br><br>ROSS: [pause] No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?<br><br>RACH: I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.<br><br>ROSS: Well, start looking.<br><br></div>
