            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Guys and Girls, I post this story here so that it can reach the maximum amount of people rather than creative corner. Feel free to comment after reading this, thanks!<br><br>Glass<br>-----<br><br>A long time ago, there was a Kingdom called<br>Asheron. Its people are like our people,<br>they carry on their daily lives just like<br>you and me. There was competition for food<br>and shelter, war with neighbouring states,<br>tax on income and even worship of many gods<br>and its related festivities.<br><br>One important festival is the King's annual<br>bear hunting. It began a long time ago when<br>the Kingdom's founder, killed a bear in retaliation<br>for it having scared one of his servants.<br><br>The people of Asheron celebrated whenever<br>that day begins, and every year, the King always<br>return with the carcass of a dead bear because<br>he was skilled with his bow and arrow.<br><br>On one year, the ruling King fell ill<br>and at his servants' advice, he issued a decree to<br>award anyone who hunts and kills bears. This ruling<br>was greeted by most people and some hunted bears purely<br>for the sake of prestige. Immediately the King complained<br>of this and told his subjects<br><br>"Let this be known again that I hunted for the sake<br>of my people's safety"<br><br>As time passed, his illness got worst,one night<br>he made a secret journey to a neighbouring Kingdom<br>and he decided never to return.<br><br>His servants knew about his disappearance only on the<br>next morning. They got worried and couldnt explain<br>his disappearance. Some thought it was an enemy kidnap<br>plot, some thought it was the bear-ghost that hunted<br>him. His servants searched for him through out the<br>whole kingdom, but he was never found. His people knew<br>about it all and many griefed. In their grief,<br>they dedicated a new god solely to him, his personality<br>grew into a cult, the bear-spirit. Over the years,<br>a new King replaced the missing one, and every year<br>the King and his subjects worship the bear-spirit and<br>bear hunting slowly ceased.<br><br>One night, the new King rest, having finished participating<br>in the rituals of bear-spirit worship. He slept<br>in his palace bed and dreamt about an old man<br><br>"What are you?" asked the King in his dream<br><br>The old man produced a transparent plate<br>in his hands and said "Give me this"<br><br>The King woke up, sweat on his brows, and he called<br>out loud for his servants. The next day<br>he called for his royal astrologist, asking<br>him to explain his dream.<br><br>"Who is the strange man?" asked the King<br><br>"He is the Bear-Spirit!" said the astrologer<br><br>The King was not surprised at his answer.<br><br>"What is that shiny thing that I saw?" asked the King<br><br>"That is what your highness must give him!"<br><br>The King was not pleased at his astrologer's reply.<br><br>Many of the courts' subjects were asked, and no-one<br>know of the answer, the King felt agitated and ordered<br>every shiny thing in the Kingdom to be brought to him.<br><br>Crystals, diamonds, bronze, gold, silver, none of them resemble<br>the object that the King dreamt of.<br><br>One evening, a servant interrupted the King's nap<br>and told him of an important message.<br><br>"Your highness, we have what you wanted!"<br><br>The King immediately asked for a court session<br>and a young maiden was presented to him<br>along with a shiny object.<br><br>"Yes! that is exactly what it appears in my dream!<br>Tell me what do you call it?"<br><br>"Glass" she said.<br><br>The King learnt that glass is being made<br>in other kingdoms, and he immediately fell in love with<br>it. After months of discussion with his subjects,<br>he issued a decree to build workshops that made<br>glass especially for him.<br><br>Beautiful glass wares were made and were presented<br>to the King. As the years went by, they became part<br>of the items used in the annual bear-spirit worship<br>rituals. One day, he accidentally broke a layer of glass<br>made to decorate over a table. He felt a state<br>of shock ever since. As the weeks passed, he felt<br>ill.<br><br>"Your highness, our traders are worried about<br>the civil war that is occuring in the neighbouring Kingdom<br>of Juggernaut" said one servant<br><br>The King sat on his bed and drank his medicine.<br><br>"Your highness, you must issue a decree to mobilize<br>our soldiers at once!" said another servant.<br><br>"Your highness, the bear-spirit will protect us!"<br>said yet another servant.<br><br>The King exhaled a depth of breadth and said<br><br>"Our children are not ready."<br>"They have improper values"<br><br>"What are the right values?" asked his servant.<br><br>A dying King wrote down a decree<br>which was going to be his last.<br><br>"Our school children must be taught the proper values"<br><br>One servant held up the decree and read it aloud<br><br>"On the 1st year of study, he must write and draw<br>on paper and keep them"<br><br>"On the 2nd year of study, he must rear a pet"<br><br>"On the 3rd year of study, he must pick red<br>seeds and keep them in glass jars"<br><br>"On the 4th year of study, he must release the pet"<br><br>The servants that surrounded the King looked at each<br>other. Some had the look of bewilderment. Some made<br>nods on their heads.<br><br>After the King died, a group of royal servants<br>designed a new administration to govern the entire Kingdom.<br>Invasions were made into neighbouring countries.<br>There were victories and defeats. Slowly, the Kingdom<br>of Asheron became the Republic of Asheron.<br>It grew into a powerful nation-state.<br><br>And the King's decrees were never put in place.<br><br>---<br>End<br><br></div>
