MG </div></blockquote>great to see finally some people taking the forum on a more serious tone unlike retards who try to fit into society but mostly fail, may it be their lack of intellect or pure childishness, its not for me to judge. But it clearly shows the different standards in the singaporean society, we got the people who whine and not do anything like 23 year old childish fark we have in this forum, or ppl who move foward towards their dreams and excel in them, perfect example : Sim Wong hoo. I cant stand being a bitch, sigh.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a bit to add on why the society in singapore is like this<br><br>as singapore is still a developing country, it wants to be a developed country but still lacks alot in terms of like its only the govt that wants singapore to be a developed national but the ppl living in here aren't up to standard ( i would say the chinese and malay and india ppl) not bias on any part but i juz feel this way tough i am a local born grown up in singapore chinese.<br><br>but i somehow feel that singapore is a bad country to live in, as in the economy, the world has changed, there is no longer a fixed job for life, as singpore has dropped in terms of world rankings of competiveness around the world from 2nd to 3rd.<br><br>the reason for this, i wun comment on tat as i still didnt really keep myself update on the country affairs<br><br>as for the treating of foriegn ppl better in singapore as in page 2, its usual as in singapore's lifestyle, we are taught in such a way whereby we have to go through a fix 10 yrs / 11yrs of education up to secondary, and the govt keep stressing on upgrading ourself in terms of knowledge via the teachers to pyscho us ppl into believing that a high education = high income and a bright future.<br><br>but this is no longer true in singapore, juz take a look and think, most of the university students graduate with a dregree and phd and are still be employed and getting a fix pay, why is it that ppl of high education level are still being employed by ppl of lower education?<br><br>that is becuase ppl who are the bosses who hire higher education levels  to work for them is because they are thinking out of the box. for singaporeans those born here and live here, dun u agree tat we are taught to believe that we have to get into uni and get a good cert thus getting a bright future by our parents?<br><br>this is becuase in singapore's govt, they protect us citizens too much to the extent whereby we (those born and live here ) are used to govt looking and taking care of us especially for the elders and those disabled and with illness, this is too much care as to the extent whereby we singaporean are too dependent on govt and we will not think that we are respondsible for our way of life and take the life in singapore for granted..<br><br>sad to say but true, singaporeans haiz, have a lot to improve on...any comments?<br></div>
