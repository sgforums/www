Its not possible for anyone to do so..its not easy..and the more you try to forget, the more u will remember.<br>As for whether or not they will patch back up, this depends on a lot of factors..these type of things are hard to say one lah...one factor depends on what actually caused them to break up in the 1st place loh..but there are too many possibilities already so i wun elaborate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if you read my posting "i got a sad valentine" u know what happened.  My friend whom she dont know well, call her and ask if she received any flowers on v.day.  She said "yah, and from her boyfriend."  Then she sort of piss of and warned my friend not to call her anymore and she hung up.  I wonder if that's true.  Anyway she didnt call me for a long time, mostly she called me everyday.  Seems like they  have patched back liao.  Just a guess only.  Anway they broke up for 2months liao.  During the 2 months, i dunno if they still contact each other.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what if it was the girl who initiated the break-up, and now (more than half a year later) she wants him back? breaking up factor was coz of some stupid misunderstanding......any possibilities of them patching?? comments?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ahh....i remember now...u're the "flower got bounced back" guy.<br><br>That was probably a good hint to u what she told ur "not-so-close-to-her" frd. Think about it, why would she wants to tell him that she did recieved flowers from her bf. And that bf is definitely not u. She could have not said anything to ur frd but she did!! Got it?<br><br>But i have to say her actions is a little....hmmm..inconsiderate. She should have clear it out directly with u what's happening instead of leaving u in the dark when she got something better. I guess she never ever try to put herself in your shoes, she probably didn't even think of it!!<br><br>Clear it out &amp; tell her off if it's gonna bugged u so much or just leave it as a learning-experienced dream.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tired:<br>If I were the guy ... I'd say quite a low chance. If the break was because of a misunderstanding.. obviously there is something wrong in the relationship to begin with. Relationships are supposed to be able to overcome all misunderstanding unless there is a miscommunication somewhere, which is not supposed to be there. It would then be a sign of incompatiblity between characters.<br><br>------------------<br>ZeroS</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tired, I think that the girl can still stand a chance after she clears up the misunderstanding with the guy. Unless the guy has fallen for another girl or he refuse to accpet the explanation for the misunderstanding, with apologies from the girl, reconcilation is possible I think. Even the most compatible couple can have misunderstandings sometimes. What is more impt is that both parties make an effort to solve the kinks in the r'ship.</div>
