            <div class='col-md body'>read through al the post and I think you all got all the angle covered. But I think it is a chain of event that led to the accident. What ever it is, both parties are at fault and shouldnt push the blame. I didnt like the taiwaness press point finger at the Singapore pilot. They are too quick to make judgement so we shouldnt do the same.<br><br>As for J, not every have shit for brains and dirt for heart. There are perple who really care.</div>
