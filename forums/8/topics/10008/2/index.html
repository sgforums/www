            <div class='col-md body'>well i guess that at this time no one should actually start blaming anyone..the pilot alone will have to face the fact that as a result of his neglience many lives were taken..i guess that is a punishment dat is even worse then death..<br><br>and to those who dun give a damn wheter the ppl of the SQ006 flight are death or alive...i guess it is the ppl like u den have resulted in this tragedy...onli caring abt oneself and one's benefits...<br><br>how come no one stopped the pilot when they realised he was on the wrong runway?<br><br>there was news that there were 2 crew who saw the airplane on the runway but how come<br>none of them bothered to stop the plane?<br><br>how abt the traffic controller? where was he?<br><br>all these questions n more...<br><br>if it ain't ur family ppl getting hurt..u dun give a damn..well i guess if the people at the air control tower, the bystanders blah blah were more concerned abt others...den perhaps the tragedy would have been prevented...<br><br>why wait till the accident has happened den start to find where the fault lies..it is really too late..<br><br>------------------<br>EndlEss rAin fAll oN mY hEArt...LeT mE foRgeT aLl oF thE hAte...aLl of tHe sAdnEss...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pointing fingers for the sake of pointing fingers is counter-productive, there is no argument there.<br><br>But finding fault does have it's uses. One cannot learn from mistakes until one finds out who, what, how, and why. Unfortunately, pointing fingers is part of this process.<br><br>Maybe, pilots around the world will be less over-confident, and double check to make sure they are on the right runway from now on.<br><br>Maybe, next time pilots will learn to voice out if they THINK something is not quite right with the plane ahead of them.<br><br>Maybe, new procedures/checks will be implemented to more effectively catch this kind of error before it's too late.<br><br>Maybe, airports will learn not to leave miscellaneous material just lying around on their runways, whether in-use or not.<br><br>Maybe, ground radar will be made mandatory at all major air transport hubs, or at least at the ones that experience regular low-visibility conditions.<br><br>If just one of these maybes materialises, and in so doing saves another plane-load of passengers from going up in a searing fireball, wouldn't it be worthwhile?<br><br>------------------<br>Cya,<br>Praetor<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those who were asking how come no one bothered to stop the plane. Well, it all happens so fast. Imagine the plane speeding down the runway at 300km/h so that it can take off, there is simply not enough time. I'm sure those people involved knows more or less who is/are responsible, but they are inverstigating still to make sure they are 100% sure. I'm very sure that some one knows that things go wrong at that time, but either didn't have the time, or somehow, some fatal miscommunication occurs.<br><br>Everyone is a victim in this incident. The pilots are facing tremendous pressure and will face even greater ones in time to come. And then there are those traumatised passengers and workers.<br><br>As for those who were asking why we care? Well, apart from Hollywood action movies, you don't get air craft crashing just about everyday. At least not as close as this.<br><br>But one thing that I couldn't quite figure out is that how come SIA is so slow in handling the situation - like contacting the families and relatives of those on the flight. They should have known how to handle since this is the second time a major accident happen. Anyway, for them, they have to get it right the first time, no use apologising now. What to do in the aftermath is just as important as preventing it from happening.</div>

Can you remember the boy who went to school alone, got knocked down by some vehicle and is still lying coma in the hospital? Somebody did care and raised money to help the family finacially.<br><br>It's not that people dun care. It's just that these really touched the heart of many people. And the fault didn't lie with the passengers. THey did not drink and drive or crossed the road blindly. And most of them are so young, with so many years ahead of them if they have lived, and one might just be your lecturer in NUS if he was given the chance to live.<br><br>Singapore is just a little red dot. If this is China, things will have been different. I might have been just any other person on the streeet, commenting that "yesh, one less people to compete with me for food!" Every lifes matters and it's a lot to just lose 11 people in a matter of seconds.<br><br>I can definitely say for myself that I care for those living and dead. The deads were once human, who laughed and breathed like anyone of us. I'm just saddened by the thought that they needn't have died unnecessary.<br></div>

As for deaths caused by car accidents, I did tot to myself y i didn't feel such a great impact, was becoz S'porean n S'pore's image are at stake. In the short term, S'pore might be affected a great deal. SQ006 has 179 passengers, different nationalities, taking S'pore airlines, n the pilot is alive! I believe he won't feel gd apologizing umpteen times, I tink he would rather die than be pressurized. I understand the agony of car accidents coz I witnessed wat happen to an car accident. I was v shocked n all of a sudden BOM then later sirens of ambulance came. But SQ006's pilot has caused the death of 82 lives!! Car accidents has its mistakes n aircrash 2..... I feel the same for all. I'm not trying to fake sympathy. In fact, my class was discussing n praying 4 the dead. I undestand some S'poreans out there are really sincere in this tragic accident. As S'porean, I really felt v sad.......to c their loved ones nv coming back...then suddenly in the night u received a call that there's an aircrash! Yes, I believed in ming zhong zhu ding, everything is predestined no one can prevent it.....frm the day we're born everything is fixed. Though we can make it better, we can't change the facts! Wat we shd do now of coz shd not pt fingers, but tink of how in the long term wat lies ahead of S'pore. Yes, as outsider, we dun understand the feelings n grief of the deaceased famili members.No matter how much compensation is given, their loved ones ar the most valuable.....irreplaceable. But we can do our bit by putting our feelings n tots n pray for them siliently........<br><br>[This message has been edited by Purplegal (edited 06 November 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>nothing is conclusive yet, so why push all the blame to the pilots? other factors, mainly the runway lights issue, have not been ascertained either, so it may not be totally pilot error. SIA acceptance of full responsibility earlier does not preclude it from absolving some or all responsibility should facts proved otherwise in future. Dr Cheong Choong Kong, SIA chief, qualified this acceptance of responsibility that the company needed to understand the "contributing factors".</div>
