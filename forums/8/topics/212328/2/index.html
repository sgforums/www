            <div class='col-md body'>this is because he recognized that money brings misery and we also often hear 'money is the root of all evil' etc. just as much as we toil so hard to earn it, or some even rob and steal, we also try their best to spend it away. this love-hate configuration helps to neturalize or bring some semblance to the purpose of our existance. it also makes one feel they have power over money instead of the other way round. so if the 'beggar' thinks that he didn't put in effort to earn that money, he wouldn't know how to spend it, e.g. feel victimized. so while you are reliving yourself of your misery for money, you are adding to his misery and to him that is against the balance of nature...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by I-like-flings(m):</div><div class="quote_body">no lah.. he's a beggar with honor lah.. he can feel the evil in u lah.. so he wont accept ur dirty money lah...<br><br>/me siam first i tio flame!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote></div>
