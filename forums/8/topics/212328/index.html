            <div class='col-md body'>yesterday i was taking the escalator down to the bus interchange at central. When i got down i saw a male begger, in his early 40s. He had lots of one dollar coins in front of where he was sitting. As i pitied him i decided to give him the remaining loose change to him. I GENTLY put $1.50(one gold coin and one fifty cent coin)  in front of him and turned to leave. Before i could make any step, he shouted fiercely:''oei! Oei!...I turned around to see what was the matter. The begger glared at me and shoved the money back on my hands VERY aggressively <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> i was so pai seh and quickly took and walked away. luckily only an auntie was watching in shock. Sp peiseh cos later ppl thought he is my family member and we kicked him out or what or i was trying to be rude or steal his money..
