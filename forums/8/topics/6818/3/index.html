If my parents were both chinese and yet if they themselves had not been able to speak chinese, I will still think that Mandarin is not my mother tongue.

I do not wish to convert your opinion, too, but I was hoping you would see why some people would rather not speak Mandarin or learn Chinese culture.  And to bring it back to the original cause of my squabbling in Terence's thread, if you ever read an old chinese aunty collapsed on the street after being scolded by a girl for admonishing the latter for being unable to speak Mandarin, don't rush to blame that girl.  My conviction and believe that I have the freedom to speak only languages I think I want to speak, and not letting what I am being dictated by the origin of my long dead ancestors,  are as strong as yours thinking otherwise.<br><br>------------------<br>Why be difficult when with a little more effort you can be impossible?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Revelations:<br><br>OK, but even so not all of them are like that.  Unless you look for them in little taly, you can't expect <strong>anyone</strong> with surname Minelli in USA to speak Italian.  The whole country are descendants of migrants and my contention is after at some point in time the family somehow didn't pass the native language down to the children, then that language is not their mother tongue anymore.  It's good if even when your family know naught of Chinese yet you still feel attracted to it and learn chinese on your own volition, but you should consider that for some, the language holds no attraction at all.  The colour of my skin or my slanty eyes do not make mandarin attractive to me, what can I do, force myself to?  So I would appreciate it very much thank you if no one alleges that I am abandoning something I shouldn't have.<br><br>Finally, we are who we are, I can't agree more with that.  But while some choose race as an identification, I choose to skip.<br><br>I think I've said all I can say.

            <div class='col-md body'>My 600th post!!!!!!!!<br><br>LittleMan:<br><br>No, I don't feel any obligation to keep the existence of any culture, unless of course I feel that I like the culture and would like to see more people enjoying it for themselves.  To approach this at a weird tangent, say, if I tell you that the sun will die in 4 millions years, what's your first reaction?  Oh oh, my ascendants are gonna die?  I don't think so.  I believe most will just go, well, that's still a long way...I would have died by then...my children too, my grandchildren too...and that's it.  I do not think my ancestors give a damn about me until I have to feel obliged to them about anything.<br><br>Javanese are not the same as Malay.  There is Javanese language and the people there, though they look like Malay if one doesn't look close enough, were Hindu once before the Islam religion spread.  So the Javanese language is influenced by India to a certain extent.  In fact the alphabets are variants of Indian's ones.<br><br>As for mother tongue, yes, chinese in singapore may be speaking mandarin but as you see for yourself indonesian chinese do not speak chinese much.  and my race, as far as I would admit, is indonesian chinese.  do all chinese worldwide really feel a sense of kindred among them all?<br><br>a)  I think they're playing scapegoat as usual.  The chinese in Indonesia have always viewed the discrimination as something so  inevitable it's a part of life.  Being resilient and practical as always they choose to have good education and good money so that they can build a house big enough to keep away from those who dislike them.  I am disappointed for being treated like a foreigner in my own homeland.  It's not as if I can ask China to repatriate me.  Bottom line is, I hate the treatment I have received so far but there's nothing else to do about it since they will never look beyond the my looks.<br><br>b) Yeah, man, I ran away to singapore, voila!  But migrating is not that easy.<br>1)  Where to?  Malaysia is almost the same as Indonesia.  Australia and Singapore only allow moneyed ones to stay and contrary to many people's impression, not all chinese are rich.  And I am not rich either, I got here by some back door (pssssst)<br>2)  There are opportunities in Indonesia and perhaps the competition is not as cut-throat as it is here.<br>3)  What about their properties and their relatives?<br>4)Finally, it's possible to love a country even if one does not agree with the government or many of the people around.  I mean, when there is no riot Indonesia is a nice place to be.  The reasons are : more leisurely pace, wide open spaces and beautiful scenery, and some really nice people like the Balinese.<br><br>------------------<br>Why be difficult when with a little more effort you can be impossible?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know about you guys, but just because you can speak Mandarin, that doesn't make you a Chinese. When people say Chinese, they usually mean mainland Chinese. Forget it. We are not and can never be mainlanders. Not now, not ever. To the mainlanders, all the other Chinese in the world are foreigners.<br><br>Deng Xiao Ping has already mentioned in the early 80s that Chinese who have taken up residence in other countries should become citizens of that country, and are no longer obligated to return to the mainland. These Chinese will no longer be mainland Chinese, but Chinese in the country they reside in.<br><br>In other words, they don't belong to China anymore. So the bottom line is, we should not feel obligated to so-call rediscover our ancestry and learn Chinese culture. Sure you can, but if your goal is to become like the mainlanders, forget it.<br><br>To me, my ancestry started in Singapore, here and now. I'm a Singaporean first, a Chinese second. If anyone thinks that by becoming proficient in Mandarin he is more Chinese than other Chinese, he is sadly mistaken. Because the fact is, we are Singaporeans first, Chinese second.<br><br>I'm really not sure about the sudden (to me) desire to so-call become more Chinese. If we long so much to adopt another culture in order to be accepted (by whom?), Singapore can never grow as a nation. Singapore doesn't quite have its own culture yet, but we're getting along. Just stay frosty people. Remember: we have no obligation at all to become so-called more Chinese. If learning Mandarin and Chinese Culture, and digging up old relatives in China mean so much to some, so be it. To me, my life is here at present.<br><br>------------------<br>This is merely the path I have chosen. You decide yours.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha ! Thanks Maya !<br><br>I think Maya has taken the word "heritage" to a whole new level. And yes, i think with "globalisation", races will start to mix and a time will come when boundaries become vague.<br><br>Actually when Yubbadoods questioned me about the definition of the Chinese's Culture and Heritage, i could not answer him. But too bad, he did not managed to link that to this topic and hence the idea was discarded in this thread totally. hehehe So i got away with it *phew*<br><br>But i did give some serious thought about what Chinese Culture and Heritage really means. And the examples Prodigal cited is not what i have in mind.<br><br>I study in "Chinese" schools for 6 years. Chinese is my first language and I do Chinese Literature and Drama as well. I am in close contact with the Chinese Philosophy and history, both in School and during my own free time (as an interest). And it is interesting to listen to views from people like Maya who is so different from me.<br><br>Perhaps one day we can really be "colour blind" and the whole world becomes one. Where there is no religions, no countries and only one race -- the human race. What we all need on Earth is peace. And i am willing to give up my race for peace.<br><br>One more thing, Maya, you kept mentioning about culture and heritage being "passed down from your parents". Do you mean that parents are the only gateway into your race's culture and heritage ? My parents are not educated. I learnt very little from them in fact, most of the things i learnt are from school.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you all for your views.  Very good to hear from you.<br><br>I think it's important that Singaporeans try to create a Singapore tribe and try we must even if in the short run we can't succeed.<br><br>To Littleman: I still think your distinction between race and nationality is artificial.  You say that our forefathers are immigrants. America is an immigrant nation as well.  It's impt to them that they have developed a sense of national identity and values, that of being American as embodied in their Constitution.  We as Singaporeans should strive towards that as well, to create our own unique blended identity rather than stick to old notions of Chinese from China.<br><br>Do Chinese all over the world feel connected to each other?  Hardly.  Ask an American Chinese for his views about China and vice versa and you'll get what i mean.  Also, talk to HongKongers or even Malaysian Chinese, you'll see that we're all so different despite having the same skin colour.  Do I want any bonding with them? Sure, as friends and fellow citizens of the world.  But surely I want a stronger and more coherent Singapore .<br><br>Mayajade's contribution in this posting is i think very important.  It shows that immigrants can come to settle in our country from all over the world.  Even from the same ethnic group, Chinese, we can come from all over the world.  No point trying to discover what so unique about Chinese and China. Let's try to look at what is unique about Singapore and being Singaporean.<br><br>From my postings, perhaps people might think that i've been angmohnized or Westernized.  Perhaps in a big sense I have.  There are lots of traditional Chinese customs and beliefs which i disagree with but I shan't elaborate.  I'll just single out the lack of questioning of authority as pointed out by prodigal.  How can we develop as a culture, as a nation, if we don't submit ourselves to scrutiny and argue and accept change?  This is the fundamental reason why i think the Chinese civilisation crashed from its pre-eminent state from 14th century onwards.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm baaaaaaaaaaack.<br><br>Littleman, I guess you see nothing contradictory with developing chinese culture while building singapore culture, in fact you may think that while doing the former, you are doing the latter.  Perhaps it is so, but meanwhile you'll get questions coming from a lot of people, why insisting on building Singapore from Chinese culture?  Can't we just move along and see what we'll get?  Probably we'll get something uniquely singapore and not some just an extension of chinese culture.  Oh.  we're building it on chinese culture because we are chinese and we have an obligation to keep the culture alive and it's such a great culture, what's wrong with it you might say.  *i know i'm putting words into your mouth, but from your posts i am pretty sure that's what you're gonna say, sorry if i am wrong, you won't shy from differing, anyway  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ?*  And there lies the disagreement, not everyone believe that it's one's duty to uphold a culture just because of one's ancestry.  Some think that the nationality is more important, or where you are may be more important.  Like if I were a Canadian Chinese I would want to know French and English first because they speak those languages there.<br>And perhaps sticking to chinese culture when you are somewhere else makes it as irrelevant as christmas trees in singapore decked with snow, there's never snow in singapore.<br><br>As for chinese worldwide feeling kinship, don't you think it's too large a group to form such a kindred feeling?  I tend to see this kind of thing as feeling too secure of other's affection.  I won't speculate about Chang, i don't follow tennis much, but while ST keep saying that Nakata is the pride of Asia in football, don't you think Nakata himself will be more concerned with being the pride of Japan?  Do you really think he thinks about the rest of Asia, including Singapore (who somehow is so proud of him) or Philippines?  Oh, and you see how the asia solidarity thing is trumpeted so loudly in the media.  This leads me to think that since chinese overseas is a large group itself, why would one feel more close to some vague relations overseas than one's own neighbour in the same country?<br><br>------------------<br>Why be difficult when with a little more effort you can be impossible?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, everyone is talking about this Singaporean identity, so let me ask, what constitutes the Singaporean identity??? Isn't the Singapore identity a melting pot of all the different cultures from different races?? Isn't Chinese one of the main races in Singapore apart from Malays and Indians? Malays being the original inhabitants of the island, so should that be the Singapore identity?<br>Singapore is a unique country in the sense of its multi-racial and multi-cultural characteristics. Therefore, it is important to know each other's cultures, but even before that, wouldn't it be more important to know your own culture first??<br>Maya, well, I guess if I were in your shoes, I wouldn't really be interested in Chinese too, but then, the question would be that for those in Singapore, with such suitable environment for the use of the language, why do people still find it a problem? I think it would be inappropriate to use the argument that no one speaks the language here, rite? ^_^</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Revelations, I was extending the arguments to all chinese overseas.  Not everywhere is as conducive as Singapore to learning Chinese.  And the topic of this thread was actually, from what I read in ST, what a Canadian old woman who scolded a young chinese canadian for not speaking chinese.  I shall try not to be personal again, but I think this thread deals more than just Chinese singaporean.<br><br>To move on to Chinese, I am not proposing Singapore adopting Malay culture.  Why is there a rush to find an identity, how old is Singapore?  Do you expect architecture and the arts to develop in mere decades and give singapore its identity?  For that's what I think Singapore is doing, maintaining that it has a culture of its own and making it rich by putting all races' different culture in one huge melting pot.  What do you get?  Just salad.  Don't you think your country deserve something more cohesive, what about a singapore culture, not lion dance, not deepavali, something which is singapore's alone because Singapore being what Singapore is conceive it.<br><br>As for Singapore, I feel that it is one's own loss if one has the chance to learn a language but decides not to take it.  But I also believe that one should be free to make the choice whther he wants to suffer the loss or not.  I don't know, but are there people who think Chinese is difficult or maybe they are not attracted to it.  Yes, I believe attraction to the culture is a must.  I don't know, anyone else want to comment?<br><br>------------------<br>Why be difficult when with a little more effort you can be impossible?</div>

Well, I guess it would be reasonable for the old woman's action because she is realising that something is being lost here. Be it Canadian Chinese or Afro-American, u have a set of culture which is brought over with you, and through time, influenced by the cultures around you, but still with your own culture as a basic core, well, I suppose she felt that it was going to be lost......and got excited about it......<br><br>For Singapore's identity, wouldn't its multi-racial multi-cultural background be its best identity?? Minus all these, what will the Singapore Identity be built upon?? Things like a make belief myth about the legend of the merlion?<br><br>Well, it is actually people's choice at the end of it all, whether they like it or not, but just letting something which has been around for like thousands of years, disappear into thin air because people just ain't interested, isn't that really a waste??
