My ancestors didn't speak mandarin.

You know about jia(2) gu(3) wen(2) ?? And has been the common language used by the Chinese in China since the first leader (*leader* NOT emperor) Yan(2) Di(4) (name of a person)<br><br>After his death, the next leader was Huang(2) Di(4) (name of a person) Hence Chinese are commonly called Yan(2) Huang(3) Zi(3) Sun(1), cos of Yan Di and Huang Di.<br><br>And it has nothing to do with the current Mainland China.<br><br>Well, your ancestors may speak their dialect, but that dialect is only for a certain tribe (is there a better word ?) not for the whole *race*.<br><br>Every country will have their own dialects. This is the result of geographical barrier. But they will have a common language which helps them to understand each other. And that language is the language of the whole *race*, in this case Mandarin. Even if they can't speak it, they'll know how to write it (if educated) Do you write Cantonese/Hokkien/Teochew/Hakka very differently ?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>2) What is the Chinese culture?  Is there a set of core values which you can list for me which are unique and so desirable?<br></strong></blockquote>Chinese Culture ?? There are too many things to write here, but you can easily buy such books in major book stores like MPH and Popular.<br><br>We shall not focus into the details of the culture and heritage cos it is out of the topic.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>3) What is the Chinese heritage?  From the Imperial times or the Communist times?<br></strong></blockquote>I have alredi explained above. It started since Yan Di. And at that time, people dun call him "emperor" he is simply a leader.<br><br>For your information, he is the one who invented fishing net (inspired by spider web) and the ba(2) gua(4) (inspired by tortoise shell)<br><br>Hope i have cleared your doubts.</div>

The answers you have given me are completely unsatisfactory for my purposes.<br><br>So what if we can trace our lineage back to ancient China and some Emperor who invented some fishing net?

What significance do you attach to them?<br><br>I ask you to explain to me what our so-called Chinese heritage is and you choose to talk about us being descendents of a Chinese leader to use your terminology.  Fine.  But you haven't answered my question. What is our heritage?  Are you saying that we should study or hold on to our Chinese cutoms and rituals, say ancestor worship?  Or are you saying that we should continue to read and appreciate Chinese literature from the ancient past or Mao's little red book?<br><br>What exactly is our Chinese heritage?  What exactly are the values which you expouse and which we can all learn and better benefit from through the study of mandarin?<br><br>The Chinese civilisation is a great civilisation.  It has had 5000 years of history.  Up till about the 14th century it was the most advanced civilisation in the world.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>After reading many replies, and it is time to get back to being serious again (after a good April fool day of course). This thread has rested on a few issues, particularly the most important is about what is it mean to be Chinese?<br><br>Let me start off with a little about my family background. I came from a traditional and disintegrated powerful family (who lost the entire fortune after the war), and my grandfather left 3 wives who have to fend and support the group of kids. Of course, my parents have brought me up quite a strict chinese customs. First of all, they made me learned Chinese calligraphy, so I ended up holding the ballpoint pen differently from my friends. But the learning of Calligraphy allowed me to learn old Chinese (Fan Ti) words, and, of course, I can read Hong Kong comics with no problems. I spoke Cantonese at home because my parents could not speak Mandarin well. Then we have the family dinner with my aunt, and we would stick to soup first and then the food and rice. Strict rules like cannot put elbows or drop the chopsticks are imposed onto me. I was quite a rebel to my strict extended family culture. But I was given the education outside my own for the four tenets : qin (music), qi (chess), shu (literacy) and hua (painting). With the exception of the first, I know the rest. But is that what Chinese culture is all about? If you asked me, these are just strict things imposed on me to know.<br><br>What it did, was to help me to learn about Chinese history and philosophy. Unlike Terence, who claimed that Confucianism is responsible for certain bad dogmatic practices, I do not agree because I took a long time to read the 4 books, which are the major tenets of Confucianism. The pure Confucianism seek to cultivate the individual, and asks him to question even if authority is there. I could go on talking about Confucianism, but there are other important stuff in Chinese Philosophy, of 3 which I am particularly spent a lot of time reading it in actual Chinese : Sun Tzu's Art of War (which mirrors Clausewitz's "On War" in the Western world), Lee Zong Wu's "Thick Black Book" (which mirrors Machieveilli's "The Prince" in politics but written in 1911) and Lao Zi's "Tao De Ching". Of course there are many other books like the 36 strategems, Wong Shi Gong's 3 government strategies. They have an impact to how Chinese culture have been found.<br><br>Then we come to Chinese history, the dynasties which has passed. The transition from Monarchy to Communism to the present hybrid form of Communism+Capitalism, the Chinese civilization has undergone a lot of change. Chinese literature is also interesting since we have the 4 famous books,"Journey to the West", "Dreams of the Red Mansions", "The Water Margin" and "The Romance of 3 kingdoms".<br><br>I once argued with a friend in my secondary school (since my sec school is reputated to have students who are lousy in Chinese and good in English), that it is rubbish that you want to learn about the Western culture without knowing your own culture. A person who does not know his culture, to me, deem unworthy to engage in the learning of other philosophies. I learned about Aristotle, Plato and Kant at that time, and as the years go, I read more about the Western world, and I realize that it is more than just being open and individualistic. The history is interesting as well. For one thing, I do not believe in communism and have always believed in Gorbachev's "Perestrotika" and "Glasnost" (he is my idol in politics) and championed the idea of democracy.<br><br>I could also tell you what is the major differences between Chinese and Western mathematical thought? The Western thoughts are influenced primarily by the Greeks, and hence by virtue of their political setting, their basis is on axiomatic reduction, whereas the Chinese based their form of thinking by checking the consistency of algorithms and devise methods to do things without using axiomatic reduction. There are very interesting parallels to draw. It was known that the Chinese civilization has the longest standing scientific institute called the Astronomical Bureau (from 1 BC to 199AD and it is about 200 hundred years) in the ancient era, compare to the Great Library of Alexandria which was burned down in less than 50 years...<br><br>There are so much one can talk about the Chinese culture, and my opinion is that the Chinese in Singapore do not know much about the Chinese culture.<br><br>Btw, to those gals, who are talking about cheongsams, apparently while attending important functions and balls in my university, I encounter Western blonds wearing cheongsams these days and it is of fashion as well...<br><br>Well, that is all I have to say so far...Awaiting opinions and arguments. Have a good time...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Littleman:  Your chicken analogy is not so wonderful.  Chickens are different from, say, eagles.  Eagles have strong wings and therefore can fly high.  So I am a Chinese.  What is so different about my <strong>physical</strong> attribute that make mandarin the most appropriate language for me?  Do slanty eyes help me in pronuncing those chinese words?  Do they in any way make it more difficult for me to grasp the concepts of Greek mathematicians than Chinese ones?  It is not enough to say that being of this race, you have to do this.  It's like women in the olden days, if you're a woman, you MUST marry a man, bear his children  and tend the kitchen for the rest of your lives.  Why, the women might ask.  Cause you're a woman, silly.  Duh.<br><br>And of course chinese culture is wonderful.  But so is Indian.  So is Greek.  If the chinese blood in me just gave me the look and I have your agreement that none of my physical attributes make Chinese easier, I can choose to learn some other culture, can't I?  As for never being English or Greek no matter how good I am in these languages, hey, who wants to be Greek?  And if I am missing something I don't know I am missing, then I can enjoy this blissful ignorance.  I've made it for 20 years without any longing to be Chinese or French or whatever.<br><br>------------------<br>Why be difficult when with a little more effort you can be impossible?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me, I never really valued the importance of the Chinese language and knowing the Chinese Culture until I came overseas.<br>I don't have a British or American accent, but I mix particularly well with the locals and the international community here. I can recall the number of times during dinners, whereby I tell them stories of the presumably "weird" Chinese customs that we Chinese have, and all the "weird" occurences like talking monkeys and pigs in Chinese Literature, and share Chinese recipes which has lots of spices, soy sauce and oyster sauce.<br>Well, I am getting a little long-winded, but the point is, it is diversity that makes life interesting, and we should take pride in what we are and who we are. Up til now, I have yet to meet a Japanese who doesn't speak Japanese, a German who doesn't speak German, or a French who doesn't speak French. I've been exposed to many cultures, and I am still proud to say that Chinese is most interesting. Keeping it short, u should know where I stand.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I look at the issues of nationality and race together because I don't believe they can be considered separately.<br><br>Honestly speaking, I'm downright scared stiff of racial and ethnic tensions.  Though race brings diversity to the world and we are better off with it (different cultures, different customs and food etc), it has also brought hatred, antagonisms and riots.  The most senseless thing that can happen is that I kill you simply because you don't look like me or consider you inferior simply because you are of a different race.  In my opinion, the Chinese culture (and many other cultures for that matter) have not tried to recognise that other races are equal.  Think of how China considers itself to be the 'Middle Kingdom' and all others outside to be barbarians.  Think of how we call foreigners as 'ghosts' etc.  I'm not saying that other cultures and races are free from this negative aspect, eg the French are notorious, but i'm just pointing out that race can be divisive if we keep harping on it.<br><br>Why I think Singaporeans should consider themselves Singaporeans first and their race second?  Simply because Singapore is our country, our home and if you've done NS you've sworn to defend it with your life.<br><br>I never swore to defend Chineseness, or Malayness or Indianness of Singapore but Singaporean Chinese,Malays, Indians and other races.  We are still a very young society with only less than 36 years of sovereignty as a nation and of course we have a long way to go.<br><br>I believe that we should look to celebrating Singaporeanness.  Under this umbrella, all different cultures come into play.  It is for this reason that I think Singaporean Chinese should be encouraged to learn and appreciate their roots but shouldn't be ostracrized if they choose not to and pick up some other language.  Perhaps it's a feeling of insecurity among us.  We want to reach back hundreds and thousands of years to legitimize our existence.  If we can claim links to some ancient civilisation, we feel more secure in our lives?  Just perhaps.<br><br>More on Singapore.  Just look at our education system.  Does it do very much to promote racial and religious harmony?  Perhaps they've not done enough.  For example some people have said that an inter-racial ministry or stat board should be set up with the sole purpose of promoting and inculcating inter-racial and religious ties. Yet from the way i see it, there are still ethnic enclaves in Singapore in the sense that the races aren't assimilated.  Perhaps i'm hoping too much and perhaps SM Lee is right to think that the Singapore tribe will never be formed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you prodigal for your interesting post. I've some questions for you so please bear with me.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by prodigal:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi all,<br><br>For one thing, I do not believe in communism and have always believed in Gorbachev's "Perestrotika" and "Glasnost" (he is my idol in politics) and championed the idea of democracy.<br></div></blockquote>Let me ask you some pointed questions.<br><br>1)Do the Chinese people have a democratic tradition?  If so care to share the development of that poltical strand of thought in China?  If not, your championing of the idea of democracy is championing a Western value is it?<br><br>2)Just out of curiousity, why is your idol not Deng Xiaoping?  After all he embarked on huge economic reform, bringing China on a stable platform of economic progress while still managing to keep order. (Of course Tiananmen was a bit harsh but still order was kept)  In the end, China is better off today economically than Russia isn't it despite China being led by Communist leaders?<br><br>3) On a historical note, Gorbachev was not a democrat.  He was a true Communist at heart who was desperately trying to reform the sclerotic and rotten Soviet system from within.  He chose to do it via relaxation of tensions with the west so that he can divert economic resources from the military to important internal economic reconstruction.  He was trying to create a new Communist utopia.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by prodigal:</div><div class="quote_body">I could also tell you what is the major differences between Chinese and Western mathematical thought? The Western thoughts are influenced primarily by the Greeks, and hence by virtue of their political setting, their basis is on axiomatic reduction, whereas the Chinese based their form of thinking by checking the consistency of algorithms and devise methods to do things without using axiomatic reduction. </div></blockquote>This is very interesting indeed!  So are u trying to say that Chinese don't believe in formulas and formula sheets and everything they work out is derived from first principles or.. wait a sec, since there are no axioms at all are there first principles even?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Yubbadoobs,<br><br>On your first point, the Chinese have undergone 5000 years of civilization, and the basis of the Chinese government were predominantly monarchy, i.e. you have an Emperor who looks after the Chinese people. The Emperor is the mandate from Heaven and of course, not every emperors are virtuous and hence we have wars.<br><br>The Chinese civilization have not developed the philosophy of democracy. This is surprising on one front, but can be understood by historical reasons. In Greek philosophy, the people in Athens gathered at the forum and argued their points. The Greek Philosophers were mainly teachers and the more they teach, they get more famous and more money. Hence, because there are so many of these teachers, they needed a basis to see whose ideas are better. This lead to the development of two things, first, a Parliament where people are allowed to speak on their side of the House (a basic tenet of the ideal of democracy) and second, the systematic rules of thought which lead to the axiomatic reduction, i.e. the more basic assumptions you have to deal with an argument, the more you are likely to be right.<br><br>Then we come back to Chinese civilization, because of the respect of Emperors, we are not allowed to speak for our minds, fearing that we might lose favour with the royal court. It stagnates the system. Hence, when it comes to the development of mathematics, the Chinese do not question the rightness of the ideas they use, but they check for consistency in the algorithms they create so that they can use it to predict things.<br><br>I don't admire Deng Xiaopeng, even though he started the economic reform in China. The main reason was the massacre of students in the Tiananmen incident. It was too harsh. I am more inclined to the democracy illustrated in US, with the Congress, Senate and President.<br><br>Well, Gorbachev could be the last communist, but he is a reformer by heart. I could spend a long time talking about why he is not a true communist based on his policies and ideals.<br><br>Have a good day...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LittleMan,<br><br>I mentioned those nationalities because Revelations posted: "I have yet to meet a Japanese who doesn't speak Japanese, a German who doesn't speak German, or a French who doesn't speak French".

Indonesian chinese should be able to speak Indonesian, but why am I obliged with speaking Chinese as well?<br><br>You say chinese is my mother tongue.  Oh, please, tell me what the meaning of "mother tongue" is.  I thought it's a language used by your home folks.  In that case, no, chinese is not my mother tongue.

How can you still insist that Chinese is my mother tongue?<br><br>Finally, so you still maintain that I should adopt Chinese culture because I have chinese blood and a chinese girl is the only thing I can ever be.

Not a must, like what LittleMan said.<br><br>People would always stick to their own race - birds of a feather flock together. I guess we should not be racist and at the same time recognise that we are different and that we should tolerate and respect each other. That's that.<br><br>Oh, and one last thing. In case you haven't notice, the chinese characters are so advanced that you can see its use in computer programming - modularity. Too bad they never discovered its use long ago, just like the bamboo helicopter (zhu2 qing1 ting2). In fact, the abacus is the first digital state machine (computer) known to man. Although it's not binary, it nevertheless is able to compute and store results. Perhaps, the downfall was due to too much pride and looking down on the rest of the world. A very expensive lesson indeed. Else, the keyboard we are using might well be consisting of chinese characters instead of alphabets.<br><br>Hmm...I think I stray too much this time round.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MayaJade,<br><br>When I mentioned things like Japanese, I wasn't actually referring to it as Nationality Japanese but more of a race, e.g. Anglo-Japanese, etc., because I happen to know quite a few of them, and they are very proud both being British (nationality) and Japanese (race). Race is one aspect of ourselves which we can't change, but can be proud of. It is nice going into an Oriental supermarket, and getting some special deals just because u speak Chinese to them. Chinese are blessed with such a rich culture behind them, that even foreigners are learning our cultures (I know of quite a number of non-Chinese with Chinese Studies Doctorate too). We are who we are, that we cannot change, so I guess the next best thing to do is to learn more of who we are, agreed??</div>
