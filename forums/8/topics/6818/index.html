            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with that statement. The only acceptable exception is when the environment is totally inconducive of its learning. For example, if a Chinese is born in say Thailand and everyone in the neighbourhood is speaking in Thai including the parents, it may be excusable that the child is not able to speak or write in Chinese. It will definitely be mroe realistic to expect the child to master Thai before Chinese. However the parents should attempt to at least inculcate in their child from young a basic knowledge of the native language and maybe allow the child to practise that at home.<br><br>Everyone should at the minimum be able to converse and understand their own native language. This is especially so if they live in a country or simply a town dominated by their own race. Writing and reading comes next in line followed by the culture. But these areas are arguably harder to master and<br>lots of poeple fall by the sidelines especially in the "hardest" area, culture. This is expected since most do not see the economic benefits and relevance to learn about the culture and historical developments and literature.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But in a place like Singapore where Chinese is the dominant race, some Chinese still think that it is alright not to know Mandarin.

            <div class='col-md body'>In Singapore, one of the problems lies in the mindset of "I want to learn something that will bring about economic gains". English is the universal medium and working language in most countries and is therfore deemed to be more impt. How many companies require you to be proficient in Chinese vs how many requires you to have a good command in English? The answer is clear.<br>Another reason is that some parents themselves do not have a good grasp of the Chinese language so how to expect the next generation to be interested when the parents themselves do not use it?<br>Dominance in race is one factor that affects one's urge to pursue a language but more importantly is the widespread usage of the language. Chinese is widely used now but its status is eroding with emphasis being on English. Furthermore the teaching language is English for most subjects. So sometimes it is not just the students at fault but largely the entire society locally and globally contributes in part to the lack of interest. Maybe when China emerges as an economic superpower, it will spark off greater interest in Chinese.</div>

Just what is Chinese and what is the Chinese language?<br><br>You are Chinese, you better know your language.. so should i learn to speak cantonese or teochew instead?<br><br>If I am Chinese and I'm from Singapore, do I take pride in being Chinese first and Singaporean second or Singapore first and Chinese second?  If Singapore first, then knowing Chinese becomes more instrumental doesn't it, to learn the language so that you can talk to the people, to read the local Chinese papers etc.  If I take pride in being Chinese first, isn't it illogical then that I'm still staying in Singapore? Why don't i migrate back to China, the land of my ancestors?<br><br>My point is, is there an automatic and compelling link to learning the Chinese language and culture(however you define it) just because you are ethnic Chinese as defined by skin colour and which race your parents were?<br><br>Honestly, I find this 'you are chinese, you better know your language' argument very weak.  What if I'm American Chinese?  And what if I want to celebrate my Americaness BEFORE my Chineseness?  Is that philosophically wrong or shameful in any way??<br><br>And on a personal note, I thought by learning lots of Chinese I would be able to 'communicate' and reach-out to the rest of the Chinese in the world.  Lo and behold, I wish I had learnt to speak more Cantonese from my parents instead becase in Chinatowns all over the world, they speak cantonese.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yubbadoobs, exactly what I feel.  Does being Chinese mean you owe allegiance to China?  Many people think so (both chinese and non chinese) but don't you think that the only country you should feel patriotic towards is your own country, Singapore?<br><br>Before I get flamed, I say again I am not anti Chinese.  But I resent that something which is outside my power is used to place an obligation on me.  I was born with Chinese blood, so I have to learn Chinese culture and be like other chinese all over the world?  What if I don't like it, can I change my blood with something else, please?  Maybe it was essential to hold the same values as people around you, but now people are more tolerant of different things, the extend differs from person to person, but there are many defients who could have been ostracized few decades ago but now they are tolerated if not accepted.<br><br>As for not intewrested in learning Chinese, I think it's just a matter of preference.<br><br>------------------<br>Why be difficult when with a little more effort you can be impossible?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess learning Chinese language is one thing. What's more important is that we should take pride of who we are.

Lo and behold, I wish I had learnt to speak more Cantonese from my parents instead becase in Chinatowns all over the world, they speak cantonese.  Use mandarin and many of the waiters will go.. huh?<br></strong></blockquote>Mandarin is not a tool, it is part of the Chinese Culture and Heritage.</div>
