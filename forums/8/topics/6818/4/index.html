The seeds had chose to come to Singapore to germinate more than a hundred years ago. Now we have a seedling and we are trying to help it grow healthily.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I will not say what is Singapore's national identity, only time will tell and give you one.<br></strong></blockquote>It is the law of nature that everything will proceed towards the direction which makes the system more chaotic if you do not try to control it.

At that time, we have no choice but to have our National Language in Malay and hoping that this will give Singapore peace, at least for a while.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>why must the government use Malay as Singapore's national language since only the malays and a minority of other races can understand the language.<br></strong></blockquote>in fact i think it is an excellent idea to let Malay be our national language.

The answer I had alredi written above.<br><br>Even though Malay is our National Language, how often do you see us using it ? Are we forced to learn it ?

            <div class='col-md body'>Littleman: on the discarding of our existing culture and creating on a whole new identity question, here is my answer.<br><br>Yes theoretically and No practically speaking.<br><br>The govt tried in the 1970s to do it but failed to create a Singaporean identity therefore they had to go back to creating self-help groups to promote the culture of each race and then hope they can live in harmony together.<br><br>There are strong feelings like yours for example which make the final desired outcome, creation of a unique Singaporean identity as distinctly different from a Chinese one quite impossible at this present moment in time, at least practically.<br><br>So if you ask me theoretically, yes, i don't see anything philosophically wrong with discarding all our old baggage and adopting a new one.  But I would also add that we must allow a new one to develop as Mayajade has mentioned.  Development will take a long time but in the meanwhile I don't think it's right that we insist ethnic Chinese speak chinese simply because they are chinese.  I would also admit that any new culture will evolve from the existing old one, but that doesn't mean we should dogmatically seek to follow tradition from ancient china. Take for example, the way we celebrate our Chinese new Year is I think significantly different from how the mainland Chinese people celebrate their new year.  My friend from Beijing was telling me about some specific things they do and food they eat which i've never heard of.<br><br>I don't think it is in the govt or anybody's else's right to dictate what sort of culture and practice you want to follow for example. In this sense I'm a Western liberal and much prefer the American or British style of things with their associated rights and freedoms.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no Littleman, the argument doesn't end with me.  I think everybody, including Chinese in Singapore, should have the right not to learn Chinese if they don't want to.  Certainly nobody else should barge in to our life and tell us what language we should speak.  I stated that it's a loss, but it's just an opportunity cost.

(i think i am the most appropriate person to do that cos i started the thread)<br><br>I have posted numerous questions but you choose not to answer. If this discussion carries on, I will just keep posting questions but no answers in return, and the both of you will just carry one yaking away about your thinkings.<br><br>Just like any other discussions, there is not right or wrong. I have a great time discussing these issue with you guys and we shall leave to the rest of the forumites to enjoy the numerous postings, if they enjoy, that is.</div>
