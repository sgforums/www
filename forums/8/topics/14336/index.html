            <div class='col-md body'>Now, the fact that Zhu Ying Tai had fallen for Liang Shan Bo since they met and were studying together.<br><br>The question now is... is Liang Shan Bo gay?<br><br>Look, Liang Shan Bo's affection for Zhu Ying Tai couldn't have spurred the day he found out that Zhu Ying Tai was female. Like Zhu Ying Tai, affections must have developed during the days they were brothers. Also, note the fact that Liang Shan Bo bothered to visit Zhu Ying Tai back home. Imagine this. You knew this other person the same sex as you in some Australia university and he lives in Taiwan. Will you travel all the way to Taiwan to visit him after both of you graduated? I wouldn't.<br><br>The next question... if Liang Shan Bo was truly gay, why did the author turn this story into the way it is? Assuming that Liang Shan Bo already loves the male version of Zhu Ying Tai. Then why did he commit suicide when he learnt that she was indeed a girl? Was it for the affection of Zhu Ying Tai? Or was it out of dispair that Zhu was actually female.<br><br>Nothing was mentioned abou the colors of the 2 butterflies at the end of the story. But if it was a modern tale, the butterflies must be purple.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u got watch/listen to the opera version?<br>ur this one is see movie one har?<br><br>the real story goes like this...<br><br>Beautiful, strong-willed and eager to learn, Zhu Yingtai came from a rich but conservative family in Zhejiang province during Eastern Jin Dynasty. She knew her father would not let her attend classes outside and tried hard to think of a way to convince him. She then disguised herself as a man and neither her father nor mother could recognise her. With their approval, Zhu set off for Hangzhou with her maid Yin Xin.<br>On their way they met Liang Shanbo and his servant Si Jiu from Huiji. They became good friends and swore brotherhood.<br><br>Once Zhu fell ill in bed and Liang made every effort to take care of her. She was so grateful of Liang that she gradually fell in love with him. However, for three years Liang did not have a clue that Zhu was actually a girl.<br><br>One day when Zhu was still feeling unwell in bed, she had a dream in which she was in beautiful costumes on her way to marry Liang. However, her guards of honour and other companions were soon attacked by a gang of devils and finally she was separated from Liang. Zhu woke in horror, knowing that there must be something wrong.<br>Zhu's father had been sending her letters forcing her to return home. Zhu had no choice but to quit. Before departure she asked her teacher's wife to be a matchmaker for her and Liang.<br><br>Liang saw Zhu off for miles. On their way Zhu tried to hint at her true identity, but Liang did not get the message at all. Before they parted, Zhu told Liang she had a twin sister at home and asked him to visit her as soon as he could for a proposal.<br><br>Liang was told the truth when he returned to the college. He then rushed off to visit Zhu with Si Jiu. However, Zhu's father had already accepted another proposal from a rich man Ma Wencai and refused to change his mind. Liang missed the chance and left with disappointment and frustration.<br><br>A few days later, Liang died of sorrow and illness. Grief-stricken, Zhu insisted to visit his graveyard before going to the wedding with Ma. She took off her wedding gown in front of Liang's tomb and cried with all her strength. Suddenly the tomb opened and Zhu jumped inside. Since then, Liang and Zhu became a pair of colourful butterflies which would never part again.<br><br>thankewt~<br><br>[This message has been edited by FireIce (edited 09 April 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>another version...in a more modern-day context<br><br>In feudal China, women did not have the right to go to schools or choose their married partners. Marriages were seen as a type of association between prominent families and the main reason for arranged marriages was to assure the status of families in society. The role of women was to be a dutiful daughter to her father and a dutiful wife to her husband.<br><br>Zhu Ying Tai was the only daughter of a rich landlord. Although he was rich, he did not have much social standing among the affluent and well known. Ying Tai had a thirst for knowledge and persuaded her father to send her to school. Her father thought that Ying Tai would have a better chance of getting a marriage offer from the son of a local wealthy man who had power in the court if she was more intelligent. Thus he agreed to Ying Tai's request and sent her to school disguised as a boy.<br><br>At school, Ying Tai met a new friend Liang Shan Bo. Shan Bo was from a poor family and could not pay all of his school fees. The school principal allowed Shan Bo to pay part of his fees by working part-time at the school doing odd jobs. Due to his background, Shan Bo was determined to study hard and pass the imperial examination so that he could get a job as a court officer. Shan Bo and Ying Tai became fast friends and later became sworn 'brothers'.<br><br>Ying Tai was not very good at her studies whereas Shan Bo excelled in every subject. During their final examination, Shan Bo helped Ying Tai to cheat and they were both caught. The examiner decided to give Ying Tai another chance with the condition that if she failed the new examination, Shan Bo would be failed too. At this, Ying Tai studied hard and passed the exam, much to their delight.<br><br>At this time, Ying Tai had fallen deeply in love with Shan Bo. Shan Bo felt great affection for Ying Tai but was worried because Ying Tai was a 'male'. Before Shan Bo headed to the capital for the imperial examination, he told Ying Tai that if Ying Tai were a female, he would marry her. Ying Tai then pledged her 'sister' to Shan Bo and told him to return to ask for her 'sister's hand in marriage. Shan Bo agreed and went on his way. Not long after, Ying Tai's father summoned Ying Tai home for her impending marriage with the rich man's son.<br><br>Shan Bo passed the imperial examination and was offered the position of district officer in his hometown. He met up with Ying Tai and was delighted when she revealed her true self. They made vows of love and Shan Bo promised to send emissaries to Ying Tai's house to ask for her hand in marriage. However, Ying Tai's parents rejected Shan Bo because he was not of equal status with their family, and they had accepted the marriage offer from the rich man's son.<br><br>Needless to say, Shan Bo was greatly devastated and went home in misery. When Ying Tai heard the news, she was distraught and refused to join in the preparation for her marriage. She managed to contact Shan Bo with the help of her loyal maid and together they made plans to escape.<br><br>Unfortunately a servant found out their plans and informed Ying Tai's parents. On the night Shan Bo and Ying Tai tried to flee, they were confronted with Ying Tai's parents and their servant. Ying Tai was forcefully carried back to her chambers and Shan Bo was beaten repeatedly with cudgels. After they saw him heavily wounded and covered in his own blood, they threw him out into the streets. Through the help of a few kind souls, Shan Bo managed to return home. His mother brewed a lot of medicine for him but he never got better. Ying Tai was locked in her own chambers with only her maids for companion. Her parents turned a deaf ear to her cries and pleas and went on with wedding preparations.<br><br>A few nights later, Ying Tai's mother went to see Shan Bo. She requested him to write a letter to Ying Tai advising her to accept her marriage to the rich man's son. Shan Bo refused to do such a thing until he saw Ying Tai's mother kneeled down before him. His own mother also persuaded him to write the letter. Shan Bo started writing the letter reluctantly and paused to envision Ying Tai's lovely face. Suddenly he coughed out blood and went limp. Ying Tai's mother took the bloodied letter and told her daughter that if she calmed down, she would let her read Shan Bo's letter. Ying Tai agreed but her mother took the letter away. Ying Tai's loyal maid stole the letter and took it to her mistress. As soon as Ying Tai saw the blood on the letter, she was heartbroken because she knew that Shan Bo had died.<br><br>Ying Tai told her mother that she would only agree to the marriage if her wedding sedan passed by Shan Bo's grave on the way to the groom's house. Her mother agreed.<br><br>On the wedding day, the wedding troops took the opposite way from Shan Bo's grave. It turned out that Ying Tai's father had specifically instructed them to take another way. On their way, a sudden storm occurred and fallen trees blocked their path. They had no choice but to take the other road, which passes by Shan Bo's grave. Upon nearing Shan Bo's grave, Ying Tai jumped from her sedan and tore off her wedding attire to reveal mourning clothes. She ran to Shan Bo's grave and knelt down to mourn for her lover and their cruel fate.<br><br>Suddenly a crack of lighting split open Shan Bo's grave. Without hesitation, Ying Tai jumped into the opening and the grave closed, burying Ying Tai together with Shan Bo. The storm ceased and the servants found Ying Tai's mourning clothes by the grave. At this moment, two butterflies appeared out of nowhere and rested on Shan Bo's grave. After some time, they flew away together, seemingly reluctant to leave their resting place. The servants believed that the butterflies were incarnations of Shan Bo and Ying Tai and that they were finally together at last. That is why this determined couple is also called "The Butterfly Lovers".<br><br>[This message has been edited by FireIce (edited 09 April 2002).]</div>
