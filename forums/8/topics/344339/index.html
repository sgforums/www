              <p>JUST A TEXAS COWBOY</p>
              <p>"They misunderestimated me,"</p>
              <p>-- Bentonville, Arkansas, November 6, 2000</p>
              <p>"There's
              an old saying in Tennessee -- I know it's in Texas, probably in
              Tennessee -- that says, fool me once, shame on ... shame on you. Fool
              me -- you can't get fooled again,"</p>
              <p>-- Nashville, Tennessee, September 17, 2002</p>
              <p>"I
              want to thank my friend, Senator Bill Frist, for joining us today ...
              He married a Texas girl, I want you to know. Karyn is with us. A West
              Texas girl, just like me,"</p>
              <p>-- Nashville, Tennessee, May 27, 2004</p>
              <p>"I'll be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this Oval Office,"</p>
              <p>-- to Israeli journalists in Washington in an interview published May 12, 2008.</p>
              <p>ON WAR</p>
              <p>"I just want you to know that, when we talk about war, we're really talking about peace,"</p>
              <p>-- Washington, June 18, 2002</p>
              <p>"Our
              enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop
              thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither
              do we," -- Washington, August 5, 2004</p>
              <p>"You know, when I
              campaigned here in 2000, I said, I want to be a war president. No
              president wants to be a war president, but I am one,"</p>
              <p>-- Des Moines, Iowa, October 26, 2006</p>
              <p>FRIENDS AND FOES</p>

              <p>-- Tokyo, February 18, 2002</p>
              <p>"I'm looking forward to a good night's sleep on the soil of a friend,"</p>
              <p>-- on the prospect of visiting Denmark, Washington, June 29, 2005</p>
              <p>"Thank you, Your Holiness. Awesome speech,"</p>
              <p>-- Washington April 16, 2008 to Pope Benedict XVI.</p>
              <p>"I remember meeting a mother of a child who was abducted by the North Koreans right here in the Oval Office,"</p>

              <p>-- Saginaw, Michigan, September 29, 2000</p>
              <p>DOC BUSH</p>
              <p>"Too
              many good docs are getting out of the business. Too many OB/GYNs aren't

              <p>-- Poplar Bluff, Missouri, September 6, 2004</p>
              <p>"It would be a mistake for the United States Senate to allow any kind of human cloning to come out of that chamber,"</p>
              <p>-- Washington, April 10, 2002</p>
              <p>THE EDUCATOR</p>
              <p>"Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?"</p>
              <p>-- Florence, South Carolina, January 11, 2000</p>
              <p>"You teach a child to read, and he or her will be able to pass a literacy test,"</p>

              <p>-- Tucson, Arizona, November 28, 2005</p>
              <p>AND ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE</p>
              <p>"We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them,"</p>
              <p>-- Washington, September 11, 2001</p>
              <p>"The
              deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against
              our country were more than acts of terror. They were acts of war,"</p>
              <p>-- Washington, September 12, 2001</p>
              <p>"I
              can hear you. I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the
              people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon,"</p>
              <p>-- New York, September 14, 2001</p>
              <p>"I want justice. There's an old poster out west, as I recall, that said, "Wanted: Dead or Alive,"</p>
              <p>-- Washington, September 17, 2001</p>
              <p>"Every nation in every region now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists,"</p>
              <p>-- Washington, September 20, 2001</p>
              <p>"States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world,"</p>
              <p>-- Washington, January 29, 2002</p>
              <p>"My fellow Americans: Major combat operations in Iraq have ended... The tyrant has fallen, and Iraq is free,"</p>
              <p>-- USS Abraham Lincoln at sea off the coast of San Diego, California, May 1, 2003</p>
              <p>"There are some who feel like -- that the conditions are such that they can attack us there. My answer is, bring them on,"</p>
              <p>-- Washington, July 2, 2003</p>
              <p>"I'm the decider, and I decide what is best. And what's best is for Don Rumsfeld to remain as the Secretary of Defense,"</p>
