They'll be using solar energy to cut cost in electricity. RP's way of teaching is Problem Solving. Rather ridiculous as students are given a new problem to solve each day.<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>

Oh my!  Are you blind?  if you walk in NP from the entrance, you can at least see 2 or 3 security guards around, controlling the traffic.<br><br>NP has one library, but it's 5 storeys and a building by itself.  How much information and valuable assets?  Oh well, if SP dun have enough reference books for you, then feel free to come NP and find.  We have at least a few copies of each.<br><br>Maps?  what's the use of having map in just one location and no signage around?  There's no mountain in NP ya, for your info.  If you die die wana say something, then it's called 'hill', kid.  At least we are sheltered everywhere we go.  People who are not familiar with NP will say we climb hills.  But for us who know, we always know how to avoid walking the slopes, where's the short cut, shelter etc.<br><br>Who are you calling a kid?

Been there countless of times and the impression of ur school really hasn't change. Oh? Securtiy Guard CONTROLLING THE TRAFFIC? Madam, that is call a TRAFFIC POLICE and not SECURITY GUARD.<br><br>5 storeys so? Did u make full use of it? Since there's only one library, wad if the information that u wanna find is not available? Well, SP has 2 libraries. The main and the Business and IT library. Copies? We have plenty! So do u wan any information?<br><br>Now's my time to tell u this. When's the last time u visit SP? There're signs and maps everywhere. Even the keyword of each buildings are underlined by a yellow line. Kid? Ain't u the one? Yeah. At least SP has map available but for NP's case, if u're lost, good game.<br><br>Oh? Am i that un-specific?
