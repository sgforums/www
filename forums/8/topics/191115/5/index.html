Becos SP student intake has been declining in recent years(according to my lecturer) and NP, being nearest to us, is touted as the culprit. Hehe..<br><br>(U (may or may not) know, in soccer matches, Derby is the term used when teams from the same city compete against each other. The teams, being in the same city, fought hard to win the match to determine who's the best and who's the wimp. Thus in the city of Manchester, The red devil triumps the boo-boo boys of blue(off topic).)<br><br>And so SP and NP are loggerheads. Oh by the way, if u've been to both schools, u wouldn't have tot that SP is an older school.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The rivary is definitely not pointless cos the director's and the shareholder's income is at stake. Let me give u a simple anology. Our school fee for 2 sem = $1050 * 2 = $2100. And the number of student in each department is roughly 1000 to 1800(year 1 to year 3, but we'll take the number of student as 1500). Total amount of money receive from each department = $2100 * 1500 = $3.15 million. How many departments are there? SMIT, SB, SEEE, SME, SMTS, SCLS = 6 = about $18 millions in revenue generated.<br><br>If SP were to keep on losing its student intake and NP's student intake is on the rise, see how many millions of dollars is lost?<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</strong></div></blockquote><strong>peaceful my @ss...who the hell said SP and NP were at loggerheads?i have never heard this theory in my life...i have good frens in both NP and SP...<br>you just shot youself in the foot kiddo...contradiction is one major nono in a debate...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Sekundes:</div><div class="quote_body">Thats all for it, So C K !!!<br>SP also good NP also got Good Points.<br><br>Diaoz...<br><br>Personal Perference, Don't fight over it please....<br>One Guy 2 Girls...-_-":</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by coffeekia:</div><div class="quote_body">relax.. relax.. both are good! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>im from np. =)</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by darkensun:</div><div class="quote_body">SP DEEE....any EEE senior can tutor me if I dunno anything in the future? haha...
