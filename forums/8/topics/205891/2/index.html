Does it mean that ppl from lower stream means cannot study? ?  I doubt so.

Only way to go.. no choice.<br><br>During my sec school, all the express students actually look down on me. Passing hurtful remarks like .. stupid class.. etc. However, that was the time I kai qiao. I start to work hard. Seriously, my parents, teachers and friends kept on asking" Hey wad happen to u? suddenly so hardworking?" honestly, I don't know. The feeling just came. The motivation just there. I was not angry or troubled by the hurtful remarks. As I was immuned since my primary school days.<br><br>At the end, I managed to get to Poly wth 11 pts.<br><br>So from my story, I am not boasting the good grades that I have got / I just wanna share my experiences to all of you.

Ya, sad to say, express students always look up high when walked past our class, but i bo chup la, as long never say me in my face, can already. but my science teacher used to say tat we are of lower mentality ple thats why we are here and that made us to stop playing attention in his class. but in actual fact, not that we are stupid or lousy or low mentality, just that we are lazy. coz we have got a very strict and onz CS teacher, and no one dare to fail his subject for exam n surprisingly, the lowest grade was a B4. and also we used to have our discipline mistress as our geography teacher, n same too, no one dare to fail their subject. conclusion, no one is born stupid, just not enough motivation and hardwork, with all that, u can make it to the top or 2nd???</div>
