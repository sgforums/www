You based ur idea of perfectness based on ur observations of his creations. Is that enough? Let me give u an example. Supposing you studying everything about a house. Everything inside and outside of the house. Every items. Can you then claim to know the character of the architect who designed the house?<br><br><strong><br>He who has created 'free will' in mankind, He has also created Lucifer, the most beautiful angel, the greatest Musician.<br><br>Yet the creation has turned against Him.<br>Could he not have predicted this, why would he let his creation be condemned to Earth instead of ceasing his (the Lucifer) existence?<br></strong><br><br>The bible clearly stated that it is in His plans to cease the existence of Lucifier. The question is when? What has not come to pass doesn't mean it will not come to pass. If you study the bible, you will notice that a lot of times, God can just give to Moses, to Joshua etc. But He chose to withheld first. He chose to make them toil and sweat for their fruits. In the end, the rewards are much more sweeter. I am sure many of them then would have questioned God, may have doubted God during the times of labour.

What happen to these infants/children who die before they get to know the world?<br></strong><br><br>Ppl DON'T born into this world with sin. They only inherited the NATURE to sin from Adam and Eve. The fact is that when we die, we need to come face to face with God and account for our sins. If you have been sinless throughout ur life, then fine, you dun need Jesus. Otherwise, the only way to pay for ur sins is through Jesus.<br><br><strong><br>God is almighty, He is seen as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.<br>But, He had let evil lives on.<br>Why did He allow Good and Evil to coexist?<br></strong><br><br>Refer to above.

One would say my faith is weak, but faith grows along the way you seek the truth.<br><br>True. I do not know God well, the lot of Christians here do, you are more in touch with Him. Seen your debates on the recent topics that were put on. They were excellent.<br><br>But my point stands on the questions I have put up.<br><br>Why such questions? One would ask. Because to the Christians, He is God, He is perfect. How do you define that?<br><br>I have put my definition of perfectness in the previous reply. Isn't that perfectness to what the Christians would think too? A world without sin?<br><br>The contradiction comes in because its His Creation (Lucifer) that has plagued the Earth. You are fighting against His Creation.<br><br>For example,<br><br>The Shepherd (Lord) rears a wolf cub. As the wolf grew up, it no longer obeys the Shepherd. He wants to take the sheep away from Him.<br><br>You are a farmer's boy armed to protect the sheep.<br><br>But why in the first place does He not get rid of the wolf? Instead of needing the boy's help to fight?<br><br>He has the power, you have the Word of God.<br>The battle against evil, evil stands no chance in His might. Against you, it is always lurking at the corner, ready to pounce and devour.<br><br>Hope I did not intentionally offend the Christians for I am sharing my views to all.<br><br>Enjoy your day.<br><br></div>

I have also wondered why He does not destroy it back then. Well, perhaps only He knows.<br><br>Then on perfection, if God(who is generally accepted as perfect) is not perfect, then what is? I cannot find other measure on the relativity on this.<br><br>Third, in order then for me to ask God these questions and a few more in my mind, so I have got to see him then can ask right? So now I do what He said on how to see Him, that is my acceptance of Christ so can one day ask him mah. If not, ask humans, where got answer isn't it? You have asked and I have asked. Afterall, He is God mah, and His ways are higher than mine, a mere mortal. So I accept it lah.<br><br>Like when we young, our father sometimes scolds us for something we donch understand and we get angry and thinks he old and fuddy up there already but when we grow up then we understand the reasons behind it. Our earthly father who is not perfect also we kena this "donch understand syndrome" so hor, I think there must be much more we donch understand lor.<br><br>At least I stand to state that I will have the opportunity to ask him one day.<br><br>This is why religions are called faith. Just that, faith. Anyway, no harm in accepting for if I have chosen the wrong faith and when people are dead and remain dead, then I die like the rest lor, just like everybody. However, I chose to believe in everlasting life. That gives me hope. That give me a sense of belonging. That gives me confidence in whatever I do and therefore that gives me positive thinking in every area of my life and if that is not good, what is?<br><br>You have a slplendid day too, my friend  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> DuH<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a></div>

Your opinion is that people who have never heard of Jesus before will be judged differently. In short, the doctrine of Original Sin is not metaphorically universal to all mankind.
