So who do you think your god is? As a bystander, we can see who is innocent and who is not unlike you who is blinded and biased. Did the firstborn of the Egyptian offended your god?

What ever contradiction that you think might be possible is within yourself. So is his words being post against him a contradiction to you, the faithful follower? When such a contradiction exist, what did you do? You counter back at those who tried to knock some sense into you. Hopeless.<br><br>As for the crusades, It's a fact which you cannot denied, what did you explain to me? Is it reasonable and acceptable in the first place? Is the history of a crusades erasable?? Can we allow it to happen again? Can we allow majority to be blinded by faith? It's the same theory as in whether the pain and suffering during the jap occupation can just be write off and forgotten ?? We can't.
