            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Choco,<br><br>Even if they give you the answers, it will not convince you. These questions that you ask hit into the bulleye and weakness. I left christ because I found that i can't save my parents and grandparents if I am still a christian. These questions are questions that I oso ask myself that time.<br><br>When they can't anwer the questions, they will tried to skip the topic or said something else, this is very common.<br><br>But if they answer, for example:<br><br>You: Is God perfect?<br>They: Yes, god is perfect.<br>You: If God is perfect, why the creation has turned against Him.<br>They: Because God give us Free will.<br>You: But couldn't God know that adam, or eve or lucifer will betray him when he created them since he is all knowing and all power<br>They: Because god is love, and god give us free will. It is like your father who give birth to you and he has given you gift which he will not take back. And your father will forgive you and so and so...<br><br>You get what I mean, you can't get a good answer from them. Their belief circles around jesus and the bible. take either one away, and they will fall. But they won't allow it, just like all other religion will try to protect what they said. It is the same. But I can answer all your questions using buddhism, of course I am not very well verse like monks, but at least it is able to show you some light. In the end, I can only be a lantern carrier, to get to the other side of the river, you have to steer the boat yourself.<br><br>I know what you are trying to do, you want answers and answers that can convince you, but to get a real answer from christianity, it is sometimes better to ask the pastor. But for me, even the pastor can't answer my questions. Imagine the pastor himself has lost his way trying to bring me to the river, how can I reach the other side of the river.<br><br>And for me, although christ is good, it is not good enough for me, so i choose other path. Christians are not at fault, it is their faith and what they believe.<br><br>Although they are bad christians, but there are also bad buddhists, bad muslims too. I rather hope a lot of ppl becoming good christian than end up murderers, rapists and criminals.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>

Is He trying to proclaim that He is still yet perfect and letting his imperfect creation live on?<br><br>Everyone is born into the world with sin. What happen to these infants/children who die before they get to know the world?<br><br>Born with sin into the world, they die, yet they will become the children of the Lord. 'Sin and salvation by the Lord' in this particular case, how do you equate them?<br><br>I have added another question which is beyond my comprehension and understanding.<br><br>God is almighty, He is seen as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.<br>But, He had let evil lives on.<br>Why did He allow Good and Evil to coexist?<br><br>If He would have stump the roots of all evil.<br><br></div></blockquote>I blur blur cannot answer your question. If I can, then I am God aren't I? So why ask human, when they are not God? Ask you? Do you have the answer? If so, let's share, can we? Are you God? Do you have the answer? Or do you just speak out, with no solution? If you do have, then why is evil still abound?<br><br>So evil lives on. Ya, of course. So what are we doing about it? Do we sit still and do nothing yet ridicule people who are trying to stop the spread of evil? I'm not talking only about you, but talking about people that ridicule each other, Christians included and myself too.<br><br>May I ask a question? Can we see how we can help the poor, the sick, the sufferings, the sadness and bring happiness to our fellow human beings? I am trying, hopefully you can too instead of just talking.<br><br>Will you?<br><br>Whatever God or philosophy you belief in, I hope one thing is clear, in this forum the last month or so, the Christians, Atheists, Agnostics, Muslims, Buddhists, Jedi Knights( referring to u, obiwan   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.... etc had presented their views. It is up to you to think whether they are right or wrong.<br><br>Just because one or two over zealous ones talked down others, are you the one that is gonna fill in their shoes to do the same? If so, should God strike you down as you have suggested as that's what you have said can also arouse religious sensitivity and in your own words, letting evil exist?<br><br>Yup, He cud hve stumped the root of all evil, why He did not do that I dunno. Why no other gods stump evil too, I oso dunno. So why accuse the Christian God unless you know the answer? Do you?<br><br>Some food for thot lah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> DuH<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by blurblop (edited 20 February 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok, here's a possible theory:<br><br>Good/Bad, These is a relative term, w/o bad, how can the 'good' be measured?<br><br>Only if bad exist, does one seek good.<br>Only if misery exist does one seek happiness.<br>Only if hate exist does one seek care and love.<br><br>If there is nothing to complain about, we no longer need a complain department. Divinity is the manifestation of human's dissatisfaction of things beyond his control.<br><br>Notice, how pple often seek divine help when they feel they have reached the end of the rope. And the best part is, IT WORKS, not because of divinity, but because some religions bind people together for mutal help/support/encouragement, which is very commendable. That's why we often hear of 'miraculous changes' and success.<br><br>On the other hand, those for which divinity failed, perhaps they're too dead to talk about it. An auto cover up mechanism 'he has greater destiny to fulfil beyond mortal existence' is a super morale booster as well as effective stamps for the eyes.<br><br>If there exists only happiness, the complaint department will automatically be retrenched in a cost cutting move.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>[This message has been edited by CS (edited 21 February 2002).]</div>
