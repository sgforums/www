            <div class='col-md body'>I met a new person from Singapore today. I didn't know her, nor she me. I was just showing my apartment for her to rent.<br><br>Upon first meeting her, I said "Hi." One word, one syllable. "Hi." She immediately asked, are you Singaporean, you sound like one. Oh my god. Three years of living overseas, trying to enunciate and articulate my Rs, and Ls, going for speech making preceptorials and she can tell I'm from Singapore just by listening to one single word out of my mouth.<br><br>I give up. Once you've been infected, its with you for life. If anyone knows of any effective speech therapy suitable for this case, I'm all ears.<br><br>PS: I love Singapore, love the people and the food, but I can't afford to remain heavily accented, especially as it is not exactly sexy like French and British accents.</div>

Or you think you dont sound angmo enough?<br><br>Singlish is only a problem if you have problems with your grammar. YOu can speak perfect English with a local accent. Accent is really pretty much a style of intonation - considering that most people from other countries don't have an issue with themselves speaking English with an accent - ask the Australians and the Americans.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I know a few people who are versatile enough to be able to switch back and forth from speaking Singapore accented English to a more American like inflection. My sister constantly amazes me when I observe her on the phone changing her speaking style depending on who she is talking to. Some might called it two-faced, I call it practical.<br><br>But going back to an issue that has been raised, I know its easy to say that everyone should be proud of Singlish, but lets have a look at reality. Even the government is against the mutilation of British English. I know they concentrate more on the fact that Singlish mangles grammar, but pronounication is also important in that everlasting "first impression."<br><br>Take a look at the forum threads. Not all, but a significant percentage of posts reveal a very abbreviated form of English. Singlish, mixed with slang, internet abbreviations, and Singapore-centric terms such as NPNT. A foreigner coming upon sgForums would probably not understand, and worse, have a low opinion of our English skills.<br><br><strong>This is absolutely not a problem and infact a plus for the the site as SGForums is built for Singaporeans and frequented by Singaporeans.</strong> However, compare the language to that of an American forum site like Craigslist's Rants and Raves, and you'll see the difference. In the case of Singaporeans living overseas and working overseas, we have to adapt to their culture. <strong> After all, we are guests in their country, so if we want climb their social ladder and advance ourselves in their system, we have to play by their rules.</strong> As a result, it is frustrating not to be able to adjust speaking style when others do it so effortlessly.<br><br>Again, I would like to stress, there is nothing wrong with Singlish, but that only applies if you restrict yourself to a small corner of the world.</div>

It is not like you are babbling sth that is totally not understandable to the Americans. And face it, if Americans were to make to speak Chinese from scratch, they too will speak it with an accent. But does that mean he does not know how to speak it well? He might have gotten the grammar and sentence structure right, but his accent is something that has been with him since birth, something that he cannot  change unless he wants to come out sounding all wrong and fake. Does having an accent make him less intelligent?<br><br>And so what if your accent is different from everyone else's? Like I said, as long as people can understand what you are trying to communicate, why want to strive so hard to blend in with the rest?</div>
