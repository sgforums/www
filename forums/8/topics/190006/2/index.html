But again, your own perspective (which admittedly is the politically correct version) is that you do not think a person speaking heavily accented English is in any way lesser than a person who speaks flawless textbook style British English. A lot of people in Britain would disagree with you. Similarly in America, people have a certain opinion of those who speak heavily accented English. Sad, but true. You may say that these people are ignorant, but if by some twisted fate of the stars one happens to be your direct superior, then   thats a problem isn't it.</div>

It is not like you are babbling sth that is totally not understandable to the Americans. And face it, if Americans were to make to speak Chinese from scratch, they too will speak it with an accent. But does that mean he does not know how to speak it well? He might have gotten the grammar and sentence structure right, but his accent is something that has been with him since birth, something that he cannot  change unless he wants to come out sounding all wrong and fake. Does having an accent make him less intelligent?<br><br>And so what if your accent is different from everyone else's? Like I said, as long as people can understand what you are trying to communicate, why want to strive so hard to blend in with the rest?</div></blockquote>i understand where u are coming from, i think that sometimes its not about blending in, but the recognition and acknowledgement as someone being flexible and able to adapt to the different accents. i myself do not think it is a necessity, but i feel that they would rather want someone who speaks/acts/talks like them.<br><br>i believe in the saying<br><br>when in rome, do as romans do.<br><br>not only does it help you get along better with the people there, it allows others not to look down on the minorities there. it may sound very simple, something like, "how can a mere accent cause people to take sides". however, through my experience, i realised that the ones that do not blend in, are the ones that are always picked last, the outcasts, and people that are harder to associate with. i post this through observation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One question I have - which perhaps one (or many of you) may be able to enlighten me.<br><br><strong>What and Who</strong> determines the perfect form of English, anyhow? Are we to say that one form of accented English is inferior / superior as compared to the other?<br><br>As far as I'm concerned - as long as people understand what you are trying to put across, even if they were to initially "see you no up" because of your "peculiar" slang, IF you were to be able to communicate with them and are able to adapt to a certain point of discussion intelligently, I'm sure they would respect you regardless of your accent.<br><br>Those that stereotype and have a fixed mindset about others just simply based on their "accents" - aren't worth their weight in gold, anyways.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Koreans take English extremely seriously. I know quite a number of Korean families living in Singapore. Most of the time, the father is working hard back in his homeland, sending money over to the mom and kids who live overseas. They do this because they want their children to have an English based education so that it'll be all the more easier for them to enter top universities like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Oxford etc... This has become so common, that its commonly refered to a societal ill as the separation between father and his family has led to many issues.<br><br>Of course, more so than Singapore, the top favorite english places to rear your kids are Canada and Australia, where its not as expensive as the UK or America, yet English is the predominant language.<br><br>Korean mothers are typically near obsessive about their children's education, even more so than Kiasu Singaporean mothers.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually the best ENglish is to speak it WITHOUT an accent. If you notice, many newscasters actually speak that way, which is why regardless of whether you are in American, Australia, Britain or even Singapore (though over here, some have weird accents) - the news is actually easier to understand. Of course it is inavoidable that certain cultural pronunciations are different but by and large, it is the clarity of speech that should be the focus.<br><br>Having said that, a lot of Singaporeans speak with a very 'clipped' enunciation - THAT may be the reason why Singlish is not so easily understood because we tend to shorten a lot of our vowels, and harden a lot of the consonants. You can definitely improve on that without needing to fake any accent at all.</div>
