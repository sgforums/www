And cats, like humans, have different characteristics.. Jus take my Baby for example, she's a very jealous cat.. Can't even stand a neighbour's cat passing by, esp when i show friendliness towards the cat.. And we gave more bcuz we dun wan them to be hungry.. some cats they eat abit, then later they'll eat again one.. So dun worry about the mess..

A few days later, I would see the rotting remains of the food badly decomposed.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
