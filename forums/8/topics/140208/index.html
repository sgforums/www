            <div class='col-md body'>"1900-112....", you hear this phrase over and over again. Almost every advertisement you hear the oh-so-familiar words. Celebrities cajoling viewers to pick up the phone and dial those numbers with touchy scenes of cancer patients voicing their grief and anguish against the battle with the disease. Alas, in the midst of the charity, how could one forget the most "important" thing? Yes, the prizes, be it a car, cash or other items, it seems that all these prizes are always there whenever NKF holds it's charity shows. As a matter of fact, the prizes gets bigger and fatter each time NKF airs the next charity show.<br><br>From yesterday's ST forum, a fellow reader mentioned that charity in this era no longer seems so innocence and pure. He even said that donating is akin to buy 4D. You "bet" a small sum of money in hopes of winning more. It seems that the focus of charity now is more on the luxurious prizes rather than the actual act of donating.<br><br>Of course, the above does not apply to everyone. I am sure there are some good samaritians who donate not because of the prizes but just because they want to help the needy. But seriously, do you really think without those prizes NKF is able to raise the amount of money need? Without those prizes or sponserships, do you NKF can survive to this day?<br><br>I feel that in the harsh reality, there is no free lunch. You want me to donate? Ok, I will, but I expect something in return. A chance to win $10,000 cash, a car, or even a simple voucher. What I am trying to say here is typical Singaporeans expect something back after giving out something. I think that what NKF is doing not really wrong.<br><br>So, fellow forumnites, what say you?</div>

It may look ugly on Singapore's charity scene.. but at the end of the day, if they are able to raise more money by making NKF look like TOTO... then why not?<br><br>But after so many years.. my philosophy towards NKF is..

I don't think the contractor who told ST about this matter was lying. Also, many rumours have been spreading via email that Durai flies 1st class all the time.<br><br>If a tabloid reporter is allowed to infiltrate the Queen's security detail, the same should be allowed to happen with the case of NKF. Some TNP guy lands a job as an accounts clerk with NKF during their recruitment drive, using some photoshopped testimonials his editor supplied. He sees anything suspicious with the accounts and tips off his bosses @ TNP, and we get a juicy scoop. Unfortunately, this can only happen when Singapore's media laws are changed to follow those of the UK, as Iveco has mentioned in another post.</div>
