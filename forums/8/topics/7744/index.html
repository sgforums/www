            <div class='col-md body'>Recently, there is a wide range of difference between the top 10% &amp; the bottom 10% income earners.<br>Why, when our per capita income is increasing and yet the poor gets poorer? Is it a reflection of their inadequate job skills? Income inequality, if not addressed, can lead to social dissent and much problems. Should we tax the rich more? Or do they deserve their wealth since many of them had worked very hard to get to where they are today? Or is income inequality a fact of the modern economy?<br><br>Can anyone have a better solutions to these problems..........??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can't simply force everyone to go for training and upgrading.. not everyone is willing to embrace changes.<br><br>There is no sure way to close the gap between the top and bottom income groups. Neither will I approve of the government handing out grants to all the poor people, some do deserve and need the grants.. and we should give it to them, but they will always be people around who are waiting to exploit the situation. Hence, caution is needed.<br><br>Not everyone in the older generation recieved much education, so they will always be those that lag behind and earn less, and I pity them.<br><br>BUT... the younger generations have all got equal chance of education, so if any of them don't make it and fall out half way... they deserve being in the lower income bracket (less those with exceptional reasons.) IE.. all the bengs and lians who roam around... skip school.. etc......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some of the lower income people must realise that going for retraining although will mean less pay for them(for some,even no pay)and lotsa sacrifices for them in the short term will translate into easier for them to retain or finding a new job in the future,it is a short term sacrifice which will help in their future</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think they should freeze the income for the top 10% till the gap has been filled up appropriately. If these goes on...
