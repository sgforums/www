            <div class='col-md body'>Good that you are beginning to think now. Most students now a days don't give a damn about how their family is doing since they are those rich A-hole children.<br>Think you should go study JC. When you finish your O level, the market for Diploma and Degree holders may have changed. And don't forget your NS which is another 2 years. The demand would might have changed by then. Example: IR Diploma courses now most probably are for the ladies cuz for the guys, while they are in the Army, 2 batches of Diploma and 2 batches of Degree holders would have come out too.<br>Degree, on the other hand, is always on demand since our dear government likes to make changes, so degree holders aren't so much of a "bookworm" compared to diploma holders 2~3 years ago.<br>True that being an accountant can earn you big money: those very high up in the management level where you just need to sign documents. Provided that you have worked long enough and not much of a life since accountanting jobs are quite bored and require long hours (feedback from my KPMG accounting friend. No relation with NKF one!).<br>So go into JC. While in the army, you still got some time to decide where you want to go and what to study.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah accountants earn big bucks.. I was from JC and in about 3 months time I will be finishing my NS and soon after that I'll be in SMU doing Accountancy. I'm having a headache trying to figure out how to pay for my degree. Anyway, you are in Sec 3 now? Train on your fitness until you can be super fit. During NS try your best to qualify for OCS and when you do qualify you sign on and get their scholarship. Settle already. Actually if your very keen to do accountancy and very sure you are not going to do anything else, go for the diploma. So you can work first and later on upgrade yourself to a degree.</div>

Why do most people go to JC? Its because they do not actually know what they want to do but what they know for sure is getting into university is easier through the JC route. However this guy has already know what he wants to do which is accountancy. Furthermore, I doubt most of the subjects in JC will help much in a degree in Accountancy, only economics and maths I guess. Also, if you don't do well in JC, you may not qualify for the degree you want whereas if you go do accounting in poly, at least you can have a diploma to fall back on. You are right, Singapore changes its demands in the workforce quite often but for accountancy, I'm quite certain it is still in demand. Almost all companies or businesses that open up would require someone to do their accounts right?</div>

They sponsor your education in poly. The condition is that you have to work for them. There is also a restriction of courses. IT and Engineering seems to be the courses they sponsor. If want to go SP and is interested in marine studying, the courses are also under this scheme. This will greatly lighten your parents' load.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
