You have to apply for it. All polys will provide you the forms to do so. So, assuming all goes well and you graduate at the age of 19, you will start NS around 19 or 20 years old, depending on how much deferment you applied for and when is your birthday.<br><br>There's always pros and cons to every route you choose. You have already stated them. What you need is to weigh them. Seek advice from your friends, relatives, teachers or even your councellor in school.<br><br>Since you want to help lesser your parents' burden, I would suggest you choose the poly route. That's because with a diploma, you can work. Plus, when you are in NS, you also collect some salary.<br><br>I don't understand the blue part.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not sure about being an Accountant can make alot of money(but I hope so!) but I know it should be able to provide a stable income and lead a decent life. At least, at least thats what I heard when I applied for that course...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Since you want to have a stable job and I recommend that you do go to JC and after that apply to enter Uni(NTU or SMU). It is not difficult to enter Accountancy (Since I can get in) and it is, as far as I know, the surest way to enter that course and get a job. It is only a 3yr honours course (compared to almost other course that is 4yrs) but the starting pay is among the lowest (like 2k) but the increment is fast and job opportunites are pretty ok. You can take a science course and still enter Accountancy.<br>I am not sure about the poly route but I know its longer or maybe tougher?<br><br>Thats what I know but anyone please correct me if I am wrong.<br>Anyway I am doing my NS now and probably enter somewhere around 2007(anyone else?)<br><br>Anyway, you are still so young now. Sec3! and many things can change along the way.<br>Think if you can make it to the triple science stream don't think you will have much problem in JC at least. Steady chop chop job must be Sec&gt;JC&gt;Uni&gt;work I guess.<br><br>Anyway now its so enter Uni from poly so if you really wanna go poly its still good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just a word of caution, what jobs are 'hot' now may not be so hot in the future and different skillsets may become more important in the future as well, as to what these are, it is impossible to predict. Some countries have too many accountants and the pay is not so good, some country they starving for accountants and pay more. Also, there are a lot of other well paid occupations other than accounting, have you actually had a look around?<br><br>It's very difficult to make choices like that esp when you are only sec 3, I am about to graduate from my (accounting finance) degree and I'm still not sure what is the best path career wise for me.<br><br>My advice is to pick something you think you will enjoy doing, but if its something like painting or acting or becoming a rock star then pick something else first lah, not meaning to offend those people trying to be rock stars but the realistic choice is to do something a bit more 'practical', you can always try to be a rock star part time.<br><br>Good luck!</div>
