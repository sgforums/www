Ron Hubbard in 1952 as an outgrowth of his earlier self-help system, Dianetics.[1] Hubbard later characterized Scientology as an "applied religious philosophy" and the basis for a new religion.[1] <strong>Scientology encompasses a spiritual rehabilitation philosophy and techniques, and covers topics such as morals, ethics, detoxification, education and management.</strong>"<br><br>Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology<br>I reckon wikipedia should be credible enough since this isn't any scientific writing. (:<br><br>Secondly:<br>You probably have forgotten that we are living in 4 perceivable dimensions. 3 spatial dimensions and one dimension of time. As such, how sure are you to state that Pluto, in due respect to the time transcended since its birth, as well as its predecessors, does not have any sort of environment conducive for habitation by homo sapiens? I wouldn't declare anything like you did.<br><br>Thirdly:<br>Where in the article does it says that our human ancestors came from pluto?</div>
