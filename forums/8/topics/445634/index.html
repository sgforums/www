              <p>You are a guy and a poly graduate earning less than 2k a month doing normal office admin job.</p>
              <p>You thought of getting a degree so you can earn more as you know singapore girls are materialistic and want a husband who can support her financially well.</p>
              <p>Even if you get a foreign wife, you still need to earn quite alot too as she can't work in singapore and you have to feed her and your kids.</p>
              <p>You can't take stress in your job. Whenever you have a difficult job that you can't do and you have to do OT till very late, you will give up and resign and find a new job.</p>
              <p>So will you go and take a degree so you can find a higher salary job?</p>
              <p>You take a very big risk as taking a degree is very expensive and you do not come from a rich family.</p>
              <p>You earn less than 2k a month and you have to pay yourself if you take a degree.</p>
              <p>You can only work and study part time. You can't afford to study full time.</p>
              <p>You are afraid that you might fail your degree and waste all your money and time.</p>
              <p>Even if you pass your degree, there is a possibility that you can't find a better job.</p>
              <p>Even if you find a better job, you may not be able to take the stress and resign after working a few months.</p>
              <p>It will be hard for you to find job if you work a few months only for each job plus because the position you are applying is high, like for example manager job, the company will definetly do reference check with your ex company</p>
              <p>Age old saying that nothing is free. If they give you a high salary job it means it is a difficult and demanding job to do.</p>
              <p>The good thing is that if you do not take a degree and you earn less than 2k a month, you can chose to be single forever and do a simple no stress job. You do not have to support your parents as they have enough savings for themself.</p>
              <p>So will you take a degree when you know there are so many odds against you?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>1) You sure you will have no stress?</p>
              <p>2) Why would taking a degree put so many odds against you? What are you afraid of?</p>

              <p>If you think you do not have the capability to take, agreed, no need to waste your time and money. But also nothing to complain right? Look for something else to do!</p>
              <p>A uni degree while being an excellent stepping stone, doesn't guarantee anything else!</p>

                                      full time."</p>
              <p>Why not? Even if your CPF does not have enough, the government has liased with the banks to offer interest free (for the uni years) loan for your education.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"You take a very big risk as taking a degree is very expensive

                                      you take a degree."</p>
              <p>And you earn near 3k or more a month if you have a degree. Who cares what you earn before or what your position was? Monthly salary is all that matters for you right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Conclusion:<br>Just do what you think is right. Life is too short for you to think too long.<br>The above 2 sentences are what made me re-consider taking a PhD come Jan 2013. Will I be able to find any work? Or will it be useful? Will I pass it? I seriously don't know, but I'm giving it serious consideration, and there will be a high chance I will apply for it.</p>

              <p>To the TS, I can say, everyone have their own type of stress. Please don't think rich people don't have stress, in fact, they may have more stress than you. It's about how different people react and handle situations that sets each of them apart.</p>
              <p>Personally, I think going to school is a good investment. Usually it will pay off if you're planning to be an employee.</p>
              <p>If you are really lazy, then you only have 1 option. Do your own business. It's the only way out to allow you to be a lazy bum and lives a good comfortable life, but that's assuming you will do the hard work first.</p>
              <p>Once you succeed, then you can relax everyday go enjoy your life. And even if you don't succeed, doing your own business means you lead a more satisfactory life even with the same amount of work compared to a job.</p>

              <p>well....its really a question of self determination and goals setting...</p>
              <p>i had been down and out when my dad was retrenched and drown in alcoholism and depression....i had to support my dad/mum, my brother's education and my own school fees during my NUS undergraduate days....i could understand how the end of the road is like...and no one is there to help...</p>
              <p>but i have to tell myself that a basic degree is necessary, and that i must make it...working part time ktv club waiter surviving on good tips from rich patrons, giving tuition and watever i can....and sleep less than 4 hours aday ..catching up in between classes ...saving meals money by eating at buddhist temples....attending to my dad's manic depressions...</p>
              <p>looking back ... its a matter of self persuasion that life will get better...and there isn't much choice to say never...</p>
