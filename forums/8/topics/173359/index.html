            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Here's the story:<br><br>My friend met me under his block just now and we began chatting. He told me he and his friend was smoking at the lift landing of his floor (he stays at the 10th floor) and his kind of HDB flat only has 5units per level. He can't smoke at home also. Suddenly, he heard a slam of the door and realised it was his neighbour's door. His neighbour's unit is located in front of the lift, where he was smoking. But he wasn't really smoking directly in front of his neighbour's house. It's abt 8m away.<br><br>After he heard the slamming of the door, he heard a girl shouting, 'My lungs!.' And then loudly complaining to her parents of the smoke. My friend feels emabarassed but somewhat unsure whether if it's wrong of him to smoke there. We can't really expect him to take a lift down to the 1st floor just to puff on 1 cig... Moreover, that place is a public place too where no one really owns it. So, the question is was my friend wrong in smoking there? If he was wrong, what should he have done instead? Thnx!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your friend have the rights to smoke there but he don't have the rights to make other people suffer from his smoking.<br><br>Why can't he smoke at home?  I think the same reason should apply for him to avoid smoking at the lift landing.  He should take lift to 1st floor and puff at the open space.  He can always has the option to smoke 1 carton of cig instead if he feel that 1 cig is too trouble some for the trip.  At the end of the day, he is killing himself not thy neighbours.<br><br>You are right about lift landing being "public" place.  Public means the community or the people as a whole.  Meaning, the lift landing is belong to everyone, including the family who slam the door on your friend.  Tell your friend to be considerate, afterall majority of Singaporean don't smoke and its mean majority rule!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by PriscillaTang:</div><div class="quote_body">Here's the story:<br><br>My friend met me under his block just now and we began chatting. He told me he and his friend was smoking at the lift landing of his floor (he stays at the 10th floor) and his kind of HDB flat only has 5units per level. He can't smoke at home also. Suddenly, he heard a slam of the door and realised it was his neighbour's door. His neighbour's unit is located in front of the lift, where he was smoking. But he wasn't really smoking directly in front of his neighbour's house. It's abt 8m away.<br><br>After he heard the slamming of the door, he heard a girl shouting, 'My lungs!.' And then loudly complaining to her parents of the smoke. My friend feels emabarassed but somewhat unsure whether if it's wrong of him to smoke there. We can't really expect him to take a lift down to the 1st floor just to puff on 1 cig... Moreover, that place is a public place too where no one really owns it. So, the question is was my friend wrong in smoking there? If he was wrong, what should he have done instead? Thnx!</div></blockquote></div>

If your friend is smoking 8m away, the second hand smoke isn't going to kill her more than other air pollutants.<br><br>For smokers, wherever they smoke, some no-smokers will kpkb. I sympathise with your smoking friend. Let's face it: 20% of adults smoke and we all have to live with one another. If I smoke in my flat, upstairs neighbour can also kpkb about her lungs and she'll just have to live with it.</div></blockquote></div>
