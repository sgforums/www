              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">On 19 July , my son went to see a neighbourhood clinic to consult a doctor for his running nose, sore throat, cough and fever. He was given 2 days mc with medication and doctor has asked to monitor his condition. If it gets worst, they might want to start him with Tamiflu. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The next morning <span> </span>on 20 July at 11am, he was coughing very badly and was still running a temperature and I decided to bring him down to KK Hospital. After consultation,the doctor said <span> </span>that it is just a normal flu virus and was only given paracetomol and promethezine. On the afternoon, my boy came down with vomiting. Each time when he took his food, he threw out. At the same night around 1 am(already 21 July), I decided to bring him back to KK. We took a cab there. To my surprise, we were not given any mask upon arrival, no temperature scanning was done too. During daytime, temperature was taken and mask was given but why not in the night time?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">My boy has the symptoms of H1N1, but why is he not given a SWAP test? If he really has H1N1, wouldn’t it be spread to other patients at the waiting area of A &amp; E when he was not given any mask? We have waited for nearly 3 hours before we consult a doctor but to my disappointment, no test was given and was asked to go back after prescribing me additional cough syrup. The doctor say that 50% it might be H1N1 but there won’t be any test given anymore as now they treat it as normal flu. It will be the same treatment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In this case, how would I know if my son is one of the H1N1 case? On 23 July, my mum came down with the same symptoms but with additional diarrhoea and breathing difficulties, she decided to go to CGH. Upon arrival, she was given a mask and temperature taken. She told the nurse about my son’s case and was immediately send to the isolation side and was admitted to isolation ward which they will test her for H1N1. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I think CGH has made the right move by taking precaution to test temperature and given mask. I was satisfied that they had my mum tested for H1N1. Until today at 11:55pm, I am still not sure if my son is H1N1 positive. I brought him down to neighbourhood clinic as he is still having very bad cough and the doctor there dare not prescribe him with medication but was asked to send him back to KK.He also has a doubt on why KK did not do the SWAP test I was in doubt this time whether should i send him there as KK has already said that they will not test for H1N1 unless it is very serious in his condition. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Must I wait until my son’s condition to get worst? To slip into coma before they decide to test for H1N1? </span></p>
