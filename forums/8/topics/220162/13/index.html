Can't complain though, Li Nanxing won.</div></blockquote>Like Ann, Qi Yuwu's award is totally stolen by LNX. For a long time, I haven't seen any local actors delivering that range of emotions, from betrayal to cockiness to guilt and finally to lovey-dovey. Most actors have two expressions. Case-in-point: Ix Shen. All I can remember of LNX's performance is the constant yelling with the same frown and angry look from episode 1 right to episode 20. And he's reprising the same thing now at 9pm.<br><br>And Ivy Lee. I mean I liked her, but her win for that stupid and tiring lawyer show is criminal. She basically did the same thing for Happy Fish, that stupid lawyer show and the recently concluded thing. The same victimised wife stucked in stupid love triangles. C'mon, who can forget Ann Kok's pink bra!?!?!? That scene will be remembered ten years down the road.</div>
