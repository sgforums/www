            <div class='col-md body'>Another explanation is that the riches have the mentality that they try their best to contribute to government coffer and one way is to create the situation where they can pay fines.  Majority of the money from fines will go back into government coffer, eg traffic fine, parking fine, etc.<br><br>Looking at the way traffic police is setting up speed traps, eg behind the pillar of the Telok Blangah Via Duck, to detect speeding cars from behind, we need these good rich man to help to pay more fines to top up government coffer expecially now that the COE price is low and the government need a lot of money to make up the difference.</div>
