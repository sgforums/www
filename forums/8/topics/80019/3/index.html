            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>what i do not understand is, the basis of your apparent objection. </blockquote>Wat I do not understand is, why do they object to a behavior tat was stated to be good psychologically, physically and socially. Psychologically because it relieves sexual pressure, physically because it eject unused fluids and a "form of exercise" for a specific part of the body and socially because since it relieves sexual pressure from a individual, they will not commit offences such as molest and rape. The bonus of tis is no harm has been done to anyone. Tat is why I want to know wat is the reason given for objecting to a practise where there appears to have more benefits than good and is even recommended by psychologist and doctors.<br><br><blockquote>no, i think we share that definition</blockquote>The problem is tat from the definition it does not include "natural" contraceptives. But I guess it is silly to argue about it.<br><br><blockquote>but if one chooses to adhere to catholicism, THOSE are the teachings at this time. there are pple who object and are rasing awareness to get the church to moderate its views on contraception, but until then, these are the stated teachings.<br><br>whether we agree with them or not on a personal level, is another matter altogether. ( u should guess from my other posts that i mostly don't  ) </blockquote>So they r implementing a policy tat is not following the times and they do change their stand on certain issues like using natural rhythm for birth control too. If u ask me, followers do not have to follow tis order on restrain of masturbation or feel guilty about it since it is not explicitly said by God itself but it is actually "conceive" out from humans. If the priest hunt down a line or sentence from the bible, then please read it literally, a.k.a please read it from the viewpoint of a layman or from dictionary sense and do not add in meanings into it.<br><br><blockquote>the title of this thread is about christians and masturbation... so why did u bring in birth control??? </blockquote>The emphasis is on christianity. However I feel equally strongly on their stand on not using contraceptives as part of their teaching. Personally I know of a couple who end up with too much kids just because they follow this doctrine. They cannot control the kids now and they r having problem to make ends meet (their parents is living with them and they aren't high wage earners).<br><blockquote><br>because contraceptives have MORE than one dimensions and are used NOT JUST by married couples in family planning.<br><br>the Catholic church's views on sexuality, to me, is naive but noble... and i don't think anyone but the strictest observers of the faith follow it 100%. if they do, i think its their choice and i respect their faith</blockquote>Even if a men goes for adultery the use of contraceptives still benefits everyone. But lets just say we should just emphasis on legitimate use of contraceptives instead of making the scope wider by throwing in adultery.<br><br>Actually the numbers of strict observers on the faith is not... few but many. To me they r just blindly following the orders from the priest and do not question nor go against their decision. Establishing such a rule tat contraceptives cannot be used can result in more pain and problem to society as it is unrealistic. I respect their faith on a religion but I don't for a religion tat abuse their follower's faith on it.<br><br><blockquote>here, we have the right to question. but shouldn't we venture to find answers as well? </blockquote>From my viewpoint which is from science, I really do not think the answer about banning contraceptives which I "explore" myself to be any... logical...<br><br><blockquote>also, times change and no one pretends that all the answers are to be found in ONE holy book. but new things come up all the time and the Holy See does try to address them and give directions to Catholics worldwide.<br><br>millions look to them for directions and instructions every day... its not possible to find an answer that everyone likes. </blockquote>So again i must iterate tat banning masturbation or prevent using contraceptives r not WORDS from God but from mere humans. In other words do wat u like, do wat your reasoning tells u to do. Don't follow the orders which is unrealistic in this world we r living in.<br><br><blockquote>to me, the church's views on sexuality are difficult to follow in real life, but when people DO follow them, they should be judged for the strength of their faith, and not the apparent weakness of the doctrines. </blockquote>So u r saying tat we should praise them for following blind orders and the more difficult or unrealistic these orders r, the more we should praise them ? I believe tat even in following a religion, there should not be blind following of orders and one should use its own discretion for questioning and ignoring.<br><br><blockquote>but the church does not hold believers to to their teachings with threats... if u read the Persona Humana, it is a moral and theological position. </blockquote>Arrr.... there is a threat involved since if men sin, they go to hell.<br><br><blockquote>and because such views are not unique to Catholicism, but the Catholic perspective is the most public, most well known one, it becomes misleading when we talk about it so intensely without addressing the other perspectives. </blockquote>Since u have already said tat the catholic perspective is the most public one, I believe it is right tat we mention in it first. The viewpoint from the other "perspective" r also largely similar to the catholic perspective isn't it ? Wat is the difference between the other perspectives and the catholic one ? Addressing the catholic perspective can also answer the other perspective too.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Actually in all my years in church, I have never heard a sermon on masturbation (please note the correct spelling) </blockquote>I do not know if u r a christian or a catholic but please note their official stand on tis issue. Otherwise why will some poster to tis thread remark the guilt feeling some of them have when masturbating.<br><br><blockquote><br>When I see a pretty girl, I admire the beauty - again a natural progression. But the moment I mentally undress her, it becomes lust. </blockquote>Tat is silly. If I see a pretty girl, I admire her beauty. I can undress her mentally but tat has not create any harm either. It is only when I go and physically undress, molest or rape her then lust kicks in.<br><br>U think it is controllable ? If some pretty girl suddenly undress in front of u, lust still kicks in<br><br><blockquote>When I am hungry, I eat - a natural progression. When I eat, I can decide to eat well - an economic decision. But the moment I eat ceaselessly regardless of whether I am hungry or not, it is glutonny. </blockquote>If by following your above argument tat even mental model on "lust" is prohibitied, then if one think about the many delicious food tat he will be eating later in a buffet, then he have already committed gluttony, never mind whether does he really eat or pig himself later or not. Mental thinking is already prohibited by u.<br><br>U acknowledge tat eat is a natural progression. Isn't masturbation a natural progression as well ? Male body holds some fluid which have to be emptied one time or another. Why stop tis natural progression as well ? It is as natural as sh!tting and sleeping, why only stop tis ?<br><br>BTW gluttony is spell with a single n and a double t.<br><br><blockquote>When I work, I work for money. But when I plot against another person to take over his property, it becomes greed. </blockquote>As stated in the lust column, if I picture myself having tons of money and picture myself using this money on the things I want, then I had already committed greed since u already disallowed "mental picturing" of girls due to lust. Even if I earn my money legitimately I still had committed greed since I cannot do any mental picturing of future scenario.<br><br><blockquote>THERE IS A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT IS GREED AND WHAT IS NOT, WHAT IS LUST AND WHAT IS LOVE, WHAT IS GLUTTONY AND WHAT IS HUNGER. It is strange that you cannot see that. </blockquote>I don't see your clear distinction... rather I only see your unfair or biase positioning of your stand.<br><br><blockquote>Rape and molest DID NOT occur because of refraining from masturbation, it is caused by people LACKING SELF-CONTROL. . Churches, for that matter, any religious bodies exist to be the moral compass for the masses, without taking such a position, one might as well join a community club. Whether you as an individual agrees to the role of the moral compass is really not important. The church (or any religious bodies) CANNOT enforce most of their teachings and at the end of the day, it is up to the individual to answer to their gods and no one else should question this relation the individual has with his god. </blockquote>Tat is actually stated by socialist. They also claim tat postitutes do lower the number of sexual offences in a city, can u deny it ? Wat contribute to the lack of SELF-Control ? There is a high chance tis is due to the lack of a venue for sexual pressure to escape.<br><br>Churches should be moral compass. But they should lead in the right direction based on new knowledges. If they stop violence or discrimination I totally support them. Why masturbation and contraceptives ? Is tis the right direction to lead the masses ?<br><br>Churches do have his means of enforcing its belief on the followers. I am pretty sure u know the peer pressures one will face when they r in the church. I know of a lesbian friend in a catholic church. U cannot imagine the stress tat she had to went through and the many counselling she had to go if she choose to follow her faith. Is tat enforce ? It pretty much is.<br><br><blockquote>To me, it appears to be absolutely loony for people to be vegetarian, but again, an individual reserves to right to have that dietary choice because he sees his god in that decision. If this individual sees that eating meat is sin, that is is own choice.</blockquote>As a doctor, and after knowing the ills of just following vegetarians, won't he advise or at least provide some iron or protein tablets for these people ? They have their own right to follow their own faith, I did not enforce it either. Surely I can try to lead them to the right path isn't it ? Tat is my own personal decision and my own choice isn't it ?</div>

But lets just say we should just emphasis on legitimate use of contraceptives instead of making the scope wider by throwing in adultery. </blockquote>religion covers a broad scope... and adultery is one of those things thats causes one to go to hell in this context... hardly appropriate for u to be so frivolous about it. so if contraceptives encourages adultery and pre-maritial sex (which it did when it was first introduced) a 2000 year-old institution is not wrong to be concerned about it and call for a return to conservative values.<br><br><blockquote>I respect their faith on a religion but I don't for a religion tat abuse their follower's faith on it. </blockquote>then there must be MANY religions that u do not respect...<br><br><blockquote>From my viewpoint which is from science, I really do not think the answer about banning contraceptives which I "explore" myself to be any... logical... </blockquote>faith isn't always logical... it is idealistic. and religion is such that pple follow it's ideals when they join it.<br><br><blockquote>So again i must iterate tat banning masturbation or prevent using contraceptives r not WORDS from God but from mere humans.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>the church has been around for two thousand years... they've seen civilizations rise and fall and theories and doctrines proved AND disproved... the institutional memory is very, very long.<br><br>expecting them to take everything at face value and jump on the bandwagon is just unrealistic. psychology, physiology and sociology are all relatively new disciplines by comparison.<br><br>their position seems conservative and unrealistic now, but we will be bones and ashes in several decades but the church will still be there to see if it has made a mistake and review its position. </blockquote>The church have been around but the people governing it falls to bones and ashes at the same speed as everyone else. They r not better than u nor me. The institutional memory is long... but human history appears longer. In it there appears to have many conflicts between science and religions as well. Maybe one of the main problem of religion is its slow speed in adapting to changes. In fact there seems to have made little changes during these many years.<br><br>Masturbation has been an issue probably since very early... so does contraceptives. Is 50-100 years really not sufficient for them to review their changes ?<br><br>Anyway going by your logic, r u suggesting tat church shouldn't review their stand or policies... forever ?<br><br><blockquote>what is time to a 2000 year old institution</blockquote>It just make itself more and more irrelevant to today society. (No reaction to changes or new knowledge just makes it more and more... irrelevant). Maybe countries like china shouldn't change or go through any revolution since they used to have a proud history of 5000. Egypt has a history surely greater than christianity. Does having a long history means anything at all ?<br><br><blockquote>So again i must iterate tat banning masturbation or prevent using contraceptives r not WORDS from God but from mere humans. In other words do wat u like, do wat your reasoning tells u to do. Don't follow the orders which is unrealistic in this world we r living in. </blockquote><blockquote>that's not for you to judge. faith is an issue of personal convictions. if u're Catholic and u do not agree, that's YOUR crisis of faith. </blockquote>So from your reply, u want the people to follow the orders of the priest with no questions asked ? They ask u to jump, u will ask how high ? I told the people tat masturbation is a sin is conceived out from human being. They should exercise their own discretion as it may turn out to be a wrong interpretation after all. U want the poeple to follow orders blindly ?<br><br><blockquote>u mean to say that pple who do not enagage in masturbation and who live by abstainance and natural rhythms for birth control and do fine ought to change their behaviors and beliefs because YOU say so? that's hardly reasonable</blockquote>Did I ever ask the people who r fine with their lives now to change ? No ! I am asking the people who had problem "adapting" or facing a crisis trying to follow the orders to think whether following it is reasonable. If u r happy without masturbation or contraceptive, then please carry on. If u r unhappy, constantly masturbate while feeling guilty or hope to use contraceptives to prevent birth, then please do wat u must.<br><br>U know wat is unreasonable ? Forcing people not to masturbate and forcing people to give birth to more than they planned.<br><br><blockquote>no... this being Chit-Chat, i would be inclined to think that the emphasis is on masturbation </blockquote>Tis is not a bar, why do u think masturbation is the emphasis ?<br><br><blockquote>so what does your friend think about it? are they now considering birth-control? </blockquote>Nope. They still stubbornly follow the orders from the priest and they end up with an accident child recently. Early 40 with a child age 0. So there goes their retirement plans.<br><br><blockquote>religion covers a broad scope... and adultery is one of those things thats causes one to go to hell in this context... hardly appropriate for u to be so frivolous about it. so if contraceptives encourages adultery and pre-maritial sex (which it did when it was first introduced) a 2000 year-old institution is not wrong to be concerned about it and call for a return to conservative values. </blockquote>Why do u link contraceptives with just "adultery" ? Why r u telling me it encourages adultery or pre maritial sex ? We r talking about banning the correct use of contraceptive, NOT whether should it be invented in the first place. Don't tell me a lawfully married couple cannot use contraceptives ? Wat r u trying to say ? Contraceptive promotes adultery so happily married couple can't use them too ?<br><br><blockquote>then there must be MANY religions that u do not respect... </blockquote>Tat is correct<br><br><blockquote>faith isn't always logical... it is idealistic. and religion is such that pple follow it's ideals when they join it. </blockquote>So faith is illogical, only idealistic ? How practical will tat leads to ?<br><br><blockquote>a central aspect of religion is the upholding of morality and values. whether its the buddhist sutras, the confucian analects, taoist philosophy, muslim quran, jewish torah, or christian bible. </blockquote>Just a comment... religion upholiding of morals is only because it is supported by the ruling gov since it makes them rule easier. There r many instances of other religion being eliminated by the gov because it promotes agenda tat endangers governing. Does the truth about the beginning or end of the world have to teach people to uphold morals ? Think about it.<br><br><blockquote>in a world of variables and uncertainties, religion offers the only absolutes. we call it unrealistic, unreasonable or anything we like, but the fact remains that pple choose to believe in them and i have no problems with it. </blockquote>Absolute in wat ? People choose to believe in it and u have no problems with it. I choose to believe tat they r a potential problem and u should have no problem with my belief either.<br><br><blockquote>in a way, YES. if they chose it, YES. but any religion founded on blind faith is in trouble... i don't think its ever sustainable. and Catholicism doesn't expect that of its followers. but they do expect its followers to follow its teachings on faith, family, love and procreation. if pple only understood and followed well what was taught, the world would be a much better place. </blockquote>I think almost all religion is founded on blind faith. And they still flourish because it gives a big reward to his believers and a big curse to the others. Moreover they nearly force your family members to be of the same religion as well. (In the past they really do, convert or die. Now, if just one family member is not from a certain religion, u do not belong to tat religion as well)<br><br>As of most faith system, there is no way to tell wat is right or wrong. Following the teachings base from someone has an effect of being controlled and being brainwash. Just take terrorist for example. They r brainwash to a point tat they do not fear death nor do they think beheading anyone is wrong. Religion do help in solving small crimes like thief etc. However it also help in manifesting major conflicts like wars and terrorists. If everyone follow science and logics, then only will the world be a better place.<br><br><blockquote>it is modern arrogance to suggest that religion doesn't have all the answers ( which is sometimes true ) and we know what's best for ourselves ( which is not always the case ). </blockquote>So we should let the people decide for themselves or being force to go through something which is potentially wrong too. As u have said, there r so many millions of followers in a religion, how can they come up with a set of doctrine tat can apply to every single one of them ? In tis sense, aren't we in a better position to make decisions ? Since nothing is certain, at least when we realise we have took a wrong route, we can at least feel at ease since it is made from our own decisions and not from someone tat had made a set of guidelines for the millions.<br><br>Is tat arrogance ? I called tat reasoning. Following a set of guidelines and rules tat was inappropriate is a fool action.<br><br><blockquote>at the very least, religion preaches its teachings to young minds. how these minds grow up and takes these teachings, is up to them. if religion teaches a "free for all", i wouldn't dare send any kid to church! </blockquote>If u want children to grew up learning to be good citizens or achiever, i am certain tat a normal school teaches tat as well without anything linked with god etc. Must teaching of good morals only come with religion ? Any socialist can do tat and be better at it.<br><br><blockquote>most rest on the premises that artificial birth control is permissible if pregnancy causes a health-risk to the mother *FULL STOP* no wriggling room at all.<br><br>so technically speaking, its not just the Catholics who frown upon artificial birth-control. </blockquote>Watever, so when we have answer the stand based on catholic, then we had answer the stand based on other religion as well. Lets make it into a cleaner picture, just rope in the catholic. If u really insist then u can always try to rope in the other religions but please tell me their reasonings and differences.</div>

Then wet dreams must be a deadful act too. So how to prevent it when men can't masturbate nor use contraceptives ? A male probably have to find a woman and do it with her before he has a wet dream and make sure every single drop of his "seed" is shot into her body, not drop onto the ground. No form of contraceptives or watever form can be used when performing tis act. How moral or how is tat going to help society ?<br><br>If u ask me, my interpretations is tat god seems to have a problem with "withdrawal" method (pulling out at the last minute) to prevent birth as suggested by CX. In fact he seems to have a higher tolerant on adultery (brothers sharing a wife), no women right (if a husband want the wife to sleep with his brother, she do not have a say), incest (well... sex within the same family. Though not truly incest but surely low morals. It may encourages people to sleep with the wives of his brother) than withdrawal method... Tat is it.<br><br>Otherwise wat lessons do u derive from this section ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>but the fact that u use very secular reasoning to argue your case<br>shows that u're just talking over and under the Church's position. </blockquote>Secular = normal world we live in ? Why not ? U don't live in the secular world ? Their decision certainly affect the secular world we r living isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>at the most basic level, the church's position is such that love, marriage, sex, and procreation are for very sacred and noble purposes and any methods that interferes with these purposes needs to be addressed. </blockquote>Wat is the year now ? There seems to have multiple benefits and no ill harms from the use of masturbation and contraceptives. Why position it as non-sacred or un-noble ?<br><br><blockquote>your refusal to acknowledge that contraceptions contains both a legitimate purpose AND an illegitimate one is rather suspicious to me.<br><br>i can use a knife to cut fruits, i can also use it to hurt people. i agree that we shouldn't ban a knife simply because the possibilities exists, but i firmly believe that the other side of a knife's nature be properly understood. </blockquote>Oke, since u r so interested in the other side of it, lets do it then. If a person want to commit adultery, it will still be better tat he use contraceptives so tat there will not be unplanned birth or in certain cases dieseases. Using a contraceptive in tis case is still better than none. So u prefer an adultery man to have sex with others without wearing contraceptives and end up with a illegitimate child and sexually transmitted dieseases or a person committing adultery and end up without the above ?<br><br><blockquote>i am sympathetic to the position of the church because i know that it is not unitary and monolithic. the birth control commission of the 1960s came to a very liberal position on birth control... but it aroused the opposition of some as well, and a "minority report" was submitted which re-affirmed the Vatican's conservative position on sex and procreation.<br><br>the recommendations of the commission was not followed, which i think is tragic. but this issue reveals that many voices exists within the church and change is not unlikely. </blockquote>So in the end it just means there r too much red tapes in the system of the church and it now function like a big clumsy dinosaurs tat cannot response and react to new stimulus and situations. I sympathise with their difficulties faced in changing withthe times but it still means tat their stand on masturbation or contraceptives r not rational nor relevant.<br><br><blockquote>now, of course i do not agree with the current position... like u, i believe that the real world is more complex than that...<br><br>of course pple who do not feel comfortable with certain beliefs will choose to find other answers.<br><br>but religion is such that it makes rules and affirms certain ways of lives for their believers. people can and do subscribe to these believes in their entireity and if they do not see a problem with it, then can we speak on their behalf and say that they have a problem? </blockquote>As I said before, I am not speaking on behalf of those who r comfortable with it. I am speaking for those who can't adapt to the rulings. There r people who <strong>cannot</strong> subscribe to these believes in their entireity and I am telling them don't force yourself to do it. In the end tis ruling may just be some age old policies tat doesn't change with times due to the red tape it had to gone through. These r not god words but mere ideas conceive from human.</div>

It is the acting out the emotions that is the problem. Meaning if I need to subject another person to bodily harm in order to suppress my emotion will be considered wrong.

Here the point is, you are NOT in a church, you are NOT a Christian, you don't have to live by the ruling in the church. Period.
