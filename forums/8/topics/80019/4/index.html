They also denounced polygamy etc, which I have absolutely no problem about it. But then here comes a sticky issue. Contraceptives and masturbation, in some sense r necessary to certain people. In a sense they r making situations worse to society instead of helping it by their strict stand.<br><br>U have also mentioned about the ethical of science nowaday. I don't know man.... it seems to have taken a totally new path altogether when u mention tis issue. One thing about science is on the use of reasoning when making the final decision. The repurcussion and "ethic" have been carefully weighted and debated before they came to a decision. An example is cloning where laws have been set up to prevent it from using it on human.<br><br>How about religion ? How do they come up with their final decision on their stand ? Is it based on reasoning or rigourously debated but by scanning 2000 year old book ? It seems to be discussed within a small committee and they release out the result for the other people to follow and preach. There is nothing holy about it.

The final decision on wat their faith be like still rest on their own shoulders. Tis doesn't go against wat u had said previously. The decision is still up to them. Do I have to be an "insider" to be valid ?<br><br><blockquote>the year has advanced, but i think we should agree that some values are timeless and still relevent. love for our family, care for our children, the institution of the family for instance. </blockquote>true true true... but does masterbation or contraception corrode these values ?<br><br><blockquote>theologically speaking, if sex is a sacred union between husband and wife, and reproduction is the equally sacred result of that, any processes that hinders or removes this aspect of intimacy is bound to raise Vatican eyebrows. </blockquote>Masturbation or using contraceptives, a couple can still reproduce.

Now we can do it as said by u. Why not ? Contraceptives is here and it gives us more control. Why make life difficult for yourself deliberately ? in the past women right is virtually of non existence too. Does tat justify male to continue leading dominantly in tis age ? Now is now then is then.<br><br><blockquote>its hard to be "relative" or "moderate" when many things are at stake... a whole way of life that pple value is at stake. </blockquote>Since so much is at stake as wat u mentioned, then they should have come up with a proper doctrine. Why blame the person who spot a mistake and not the person who had made them ?<br><br><blockquote>i have open views on sexuality, but i also subscribe to the values of monogamy. personally, i believe that individuals should remain faithful to their familes ( at least for the duration of their marriage  ). </blockquote>I agree with u too.<br><br><blockquote>i hardly see "protected" adultery any more condonable or desirable than plain adultery itself.<br><br>and if contraceptives ENCOURAGES adultery and pre-maritial sex, i hardly feel comfortable about it... we think about the parents... but what about the kids? what are u gonna tell them?</blockquote>Your only issue is contraceptives ENCOURAGES adultery. Is tat really a factor of great consideration to a person who want to commit adultery ? They still can use your natural contraceptives idea when committing adultery isn't it ? Isn't the lack of self control and lust the main culprit for adultery ? It is like I go and kill a person and blame it on the knife.<br><br><blockquote>a lot of what u said make sense and i would agree with them under different circumstances... but u sound so anti-Catholic that i felt i had to balance your perspective with an alternative viewpoint. </blockquote>Maybe my words r too harsh but I am glad they at least make sense.<br><br><blockquote>its so easy to say "times has changed" ... but i wonder sometimes if it has changed for the better.</blockquote>Alas maybe situation now is worse than the past. But why make it worse by rejecting artifacts tat will made an improvement to it ?</div>

All I said was that I HAD NOT heard any sermon, does not mean that no one had preached such a sermon. Just a personal comment. Like saying I have not been to Tampines before, does not mean Tampines does not exist. So difficult to make you understand something so simpleÂ…. Sigh!!!<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">Good, at least we agree on something.<br>My stand on people who self inflict injuries on himself ? Send him to a psychologist. There are definitely many problems associated with tis behavior.<br></div></blockquote>There is no evidence that masturbation is NOT  psychological problem. Just because there are claims that many people do it does not make it right.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">Then please tell me wat is your meaning of the above statement ? Wat r u trying to imply with your example of a chick stripping naked ?<br></div></blockquote>First and foremost, the example of a chick stripping naked was yours, not mine. The point is because you do not have religion to guide your mortal soul, your reaction to any temptation is basically primal, not very different from an animal Â– a chick offers herself to me, I bonk her. Do not mean to offensive here, just an observation that people with some kind of religion or moral understand will not react at a primal level. It is also evident in your writing that all you want to do is to get any issues you have off your chest, there is very little regards to sensitivity, finesse in writing styles, and anything that is associated to good writing skills. You basically REACT!<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">So r u going to say tat it has no effect watsoever ? I am pretty sure men have limited or little sexual desire after they had "spent their load". Is tat correct or wrong ?<br></div></blockquote>It does not mean that after one unload, the desire goes away, it depends on the individual. Some can go on and on.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">Those who do it certainly won't be stopped by wat I said. I was hoping tat those who initially feel guilty about it will stop feeling so now. If my effort is futile, then so be it. I will still keep writing if there is still a need.<br></div></blockquote>My thought is that a Christian has his peers and Pastors to talk to, recognize the Bible as his guideÂ….comments from you? NahÂ…. DonÂ’t think anyone cares. May I suggest that you channel your efforts to other more constructive issues.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">From the above paragraph, it seems tat u do not want me to talk about it just because I am not a believer myself. U say tat I have every right to ask for any rationale yet in the latter part of the paragraph u do not want me to because it does not affect me ? Wat is the message u want to bring across to me ? To write or not to write ?<br>I do not live in Iraq either, watever sh!t tat happened there does not concern me. Does tat means I cannot comment about the situation there ?<br></div></blockquote>No, I reiterate that you have every right to ASK for rationale. The point herein, is you refuse to accept any rationale given. Note the word Â“<strong>ACCEPT</strong>Â” not  Â“<strong>AGREE</strong>Â”. You will never agree with any rationales given by Christians or churches. The least you can do is to accept that the rationales work for those who are believers. Whether the believers have personal struggles with church teachings or not remains personal to the believers themselves.<br>I do not agree to the anti-contraceptive stand that the Catholic church takes, but I accept that it is their teaching and will never attempt to change the ruling, unless, of course if I am a Catholic, which I am not. I also do not understand why Buddhist practice vegetarianism but consumes bean products in the form of, say, mock duck. But again, I accept that it works for them.<br>You have shown yourself to be extremely anti-Christian. At least have the grace to be fair to all religion, please write something on your feeling about some irrational practices in temples and mosque.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">Hahahha ! True u did not link kleptomaniac to contraceptives. I notice u seems to be okay with my stand on contraceptives. However u did not deny linking it with masturbation isn't it ? So does people who masturbate become people with an extremely high desire to have sexual experiences, which may be a mental condition to u ? If tat is the case then more than 50% of the population, regardless of guys or girls r having mental condition.<br>So u r trying to say u don't believe in it ? Why don't u try to list down a list of cons for masturbation then ?<br></div></blockquote>Not that I want to bring out another internet link, but you did ask:<br>http://www.whitehouse.org/initiatives/purity/index.asp<br>www.new-life.net/mastrbte.htm<br>Let me just predict your reaction. You will refuse to accept these site and information as the are also church related. So they probably donÂ’t mean anything to you. So please donÂ’t bother to check.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">Answered ? So wat is your answer ? After looking through all the relies u had made, the only answer u have given is tat having sexual fantasy is the cause of all sin. In your reply on 26 May 2004 Â· 02:13 PM u say yourself tat emotions come and go. It is the acting out the emotions that is the problem. So nothing has been acted out during masturbation, then wat is the problem with it ?<br></div></blockquote>The question was: Does Christian Masturbate Â– this question is right smack on top of the page. The answer is: YES. Period.<br>Anything beyond that discuss the validity of the church teaching, the guilt that the church had implanted onto Christians, how you object to church teachings, church must update etc etc.<br>If the church amends itÂ’s teachings and constitutions based on feedback such as those from you, we will have a church that will probably ok adultery, homosexuality, piracy of music etc and eventually we might even change the title Â“churchÂ” to country club.<br><br>Masturbation IS THE ACT. What do you mean that Â“nothing has been acted out?Â”. Masturbation is the end result of a chain reaction that is not checked.<br><br>I do not have lofty goals. I don't assume that Christians will stop masturbating because of what I have written. It's between them and God.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Apologise to those who cannot stand such a long discourse...</div>

Do not mean to offensive here, just an observation that people with some kind of religion or moral understand will not react at a primal level. It is also evident in your writing that all you want to do is to get any issues you have off your chest, there is very little regards to sensitivity, finesse in writing styles, and anything that is associated to good writing skills. You basically REACT! </blockquote>I do not agree tat since if one do not have a religion, any reaction to any temptation will be primal. Talking about stereotyping, isn't tis one by itself ? Does tis stereotyping have any basis on just from your own opinion ? Many people also say tat believers r fanatic zealots who will hit out at anyone who talk bad about their religion. How true is tat ? Non believers still practise morals and resist temptation simply because they know tat they r living in a society and they know about human compassion and empathy. Is there a correlation tat link morality and religion ?<br><br>"The United States is the most religious of all the industrialized nations. Forty-four percent of Americans attend church once a week, compared with 27 percent in Britain, 21 percent in France, 16 percent in Australia, and 4 percent in Sweden. Yet violent crime is not less common in the United States--it's more common. The murder rate here is six times higher than the rate in Britain, seven times higher than in France, five times higher than in Australia, and five times higher than in Sweden. Japan, where Christianity has almost no adherents, has less violent crime than almost any country....Within the 50 states, there is no evidence that a God-fearing populace equals a law-abiding populace. The Bible Belt has more than its share of both praying and killing. Louisiana has the highest churchgoing rate in the country, but its murder rate is more than twice the national average. The same pattern generally holds in the rest of the South..." - Steve Chapman in Praise the Lord, Pass the Ammo.<br><br>A vastly superior moral framework is already provided by secular humanism which uses human reason and empathy to construct moral values. Humanists believe that morality should be based on human values, not arbitrary edicts from an imaginary god.<br><br><a href="http://freethought.freeservers.com/reason/morals.html" rel="nofollow">http://freethought.freeservers.com/reason/morals.html</a><br><br><blockquote>It does not mean that after one unload, the desire goes away, it depends on the individual.

NahÂ…. DonÂ’t think anyone cares. May I suggest that you channel your efforts to other more constructive issues. </blockquote>Maybe so and maybe not. I am sure tat since u do not go to all the church in the world, neither do u know everyone nor know wat they r thinking. Unless u tell me u do I do not see any reason to take your words seriously.<br><br><blockquote>No, I reiterate that you have every right to ASK for rationale. The point herein, is you refuse to accept any rationale given. Note the word Â“ACCEPTÂ” not Â“AGREEÂ”. You will never agree with any rationales given by Christians or churches. The least you can do is to accept that the rationales work for those who are believers. Whether the believers have personal struggles with church teachings or not remains personal to the believers themselves.<br>I do not agree to the anti-contraceptive stand that the Catholic church takes, but I accept that it is their teaching and will never attempt to change the ruling, unless, of course if I am a Catholic, which I am not. I also do not understand why Buddhist practice vegetarianism but consumes bean products in the form of, say, mock duck. But again, I accept that it works for them. </blockquote>In other words when i receive the reason why they r performing such task or restraint, I am suppose to accept it no matter now ridiculous, absurb, irrelevant it is ? R u trying to say they cannot stand any wave of questioning ?<br><br><blockquote>You have shown yourself to be extremely anti-Christian. At least have the grace to be fair to all religion, please write something on your feeling about some irrational practices in temples and mosque. </blockquote>Sorry to say, other religion do not go around asking me to convert to their religion. At least I do not meet one and they have actually go door to door in my HDB flat. I hope u know how irritating is such people going around and asking wat religion u r and then if u answer u r a freethinker, u r going to be stuck with them for a long time. Actually tat is the start of why I want to talk about christainity. Too bad for catholic since they r closely related to it.<br><br>I went to your website.<br><br><strong>Myth: Masturbation is harmless.<br>Reality: Medical science proves that chronic masturbation causes weakness, depression, forgetfulness and nearsightedness. </strong><br><br>I belive there is something very wrong with tis fact.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  There r many more medical experts tat argue otherwise.

Why does masturbation have any problem with productivity ?<br><br><blockquote>Myth: Masturbation is not immoral.<br>Reality: Read your Bible. God was so offended when Onan spilled his seed upon the ground that God struck Onan dead! It is true that Onan wasn't masturbating, but the point is that God hates it when men waste sperm, no matter what the reason. </blockquote>I think they say it themselves, Onan do not masturbate and get kill for it. Wet dream is also wasting sperms isn't it ? So all men should have sex with a girl before they have a wet dream and not use contraceptive ?<br><br><blockquote>Myth: Masturbation is a "Victimless Crime."<br>Reality: <strong>Theological experts </strong>on masturbation have come to the conclusion that masturbation is what is known as a "gateway" sin.

Wat is the explanation for banning masturbation ?<br><br><blockquote>Masturbation IS THE ACT. What do you mean that Â“nothing has been acted out?Â”. Masturbation is the end result of a chain reaction that is not checked. </blockquote>Has any criminal act has been acted out ? As said even from a christian website 95% of population masturbate. So if chain reaction inevitably "occurs", then we expect 95% of the people will be sexual offenders. Wat is the harm ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>are they? the main concern is always that a small step in the wrong direction ERODES values and standards. that is something i am sympathetic to. </blockquote>Why does masturbation or contraceptives be a small step in the wrong direction ? Can u elaborate ?<br><br><blockquote>religion is mostly based on intepretation. that is a fact no one can argue with. and in intepreting it, religion depends on the words and leadership of the few "chosen" ,"learned" , or "present" to do it.<br><br>'tis the nature of the beast... desirable or not, how to judge? </blockquote>Tat is right, so tat is why there r many cases of people committing atrocious crimes and being made used of by religion.<br><br><blockquote>ah... if one was a KNOWLEDGEABLE outsider, with proper knowledge of theology, doctrines and history, one can make a compelling argument supplemented by "reason" , science and philosophy.<br><br>one can make a stand that one is "objective" and not biased in favour of the religion.<br><br>but your stand seems coloured by the narrow experiences of ONE friend... it's dodgy... </blockquote>Everyone tat had given long replies to tis thread has a clear stand. It is because their stand is different tat is why we have to discussed it out. R u really being objective BTW ? I sure have given ample reasons on why I choose tis stand isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>that's what i've been trying to tell u... within the framework of Catholic theology and doctrines, IT DOES. </blockquote>And who set the framework ? Not god but humans. So should we question about it ? If u don't, doesn't tat make u naive ?<br><br><blockquote>u're missing my point... the position is not marriage OR sex OR reproduction.<br><br>the position is marriage AND sex AND reproduction. </blockquote>So lets change the wording to AND. Contraceptives make marriage easier since u can afford the number of children u have, able to let u have more sex which is an expression for love at any time u desire and u still reproduce your offsprings, only at a number which u desire.<br><br><blockquote>ah... but we can clone too... so why not? didn't u point that out earlier? </blockquote>Because cloning may have severe malign repurcussion to human society. Does contraceptives have any malign repurcussion to society ?<br><br><blockquote>women's rights is a social institution. contraception is a scientific artifact... hardly the same. if u tie in the two together, it might relate, but u'll a whole new can of worms altogether. also, one can make the case that in certain cultures, women historically, had more rights than they did now. </blockquote>It is used in context with u refering tat since it (no contraceptves) works in the past, why change in the present ? Male have been dominantly in control in the past too, but it sure have to change because society have changed. Now contraceptives r available, and we should not ban it just because in the past we do not have it.<br><br>In certain cultures a cow is more important and sacred than a man. Isn't it better to refer to the majority of the cultures rather than bringing out a culture tat is of a minority ?<br><br><blockquote>making life difficult? but aren't they called "bundles of joy" ?</blockquote>If everyone think like u then develped countries won't face the probem of declining birth rate. I think using an idiom to justify having babies is a bit... silly...<br><br><blockquote>its a matter of how we see sex in marriage. do we see it as an essentially physical act of pleasure in which impregnation is an undesirable effect, or do we see it as a sacred union whereby impregnation is another sacred and inalienable aspect of it.<br><br>the church's view is the latter. </blockquote>True... but wat is the problem tat it had caused ? So church have been trying to reduce people to have sex ?<br><br><blockquote>THEY DID! didn't i give u the hyperlink? and what is "proper" to you</blockquote>My "proper" is not their offically stand. Wat I mean for proper is to made better planning and consider all aspects before coming up with their official stand.<br><br><blockquote>i told u before... i don't blame the knife, but i want to understand the nature of it... that it is sharp means it can cut and wound. that contraceptives removes the risk of unwanted childbirth and enables unmarried individuals to engage in premaritial sex without commitments and fears means that it is eroding the values of chastity and marriage in society. </blockquote>Do u think tat without contracetives they will not engaged in premarital sex all the same ? Most will still probably do and worse still it comes with undesirable effects like illegitimate child. It is just a tool being made use by men. If it is men tat is the one losing control, why blame it on the tool ? As I said before I kill a man, and I blame it on the knife. If the knife is not invented it just means I will kill him with a stick. For premarital sex it just mean they will use more dangerous contraceptives like withdrawal and calculation. Won't tat make situation worse ?<br><br><blockquote>ha... thats the problem isn't it... we can't be sure if accepting makes it worse or rejecting makes it worse. </blockquote>If u can't be sure, don't force people. Why force people to make a bad decision ? Let them make the decision themselves.</div>

I did not specifically state RELIGION, but I mentioned also people with Â“some kind of moral understandingÂ”. I certainly am not stereotyping. At the end of the day, even an unreligious person can have moral values that prevent him from robbing and killing and in the case you'd mentioned, having casual sex with a woman who drops off her dress in front of him.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">If it still does not satisfy him he can surely go for a second round.

And stemming from the fact that they go door-to-door to preach their faith. May I ask how often do they come? Daily? Weekly? Monthly? So all you anger comes from the fact that they are bugging you. Boy, you sure can hold a grudge. Hence the conclusion is still, it is really not about asking about rationale, it is really about your pent up anger and frustration and irritation by people who knock at your door.<br><strong>Let the world now judge how irrational you are</strong>. In spite of the fact that there are illogical and controversial issues with other religion too, you had chosen to vent your anger at Christianity because of your pent up frustration.<br>Hey, note too that I get peeved when I received in my office email to ask me to contribute money to the seventh month celebration, or when I go to Woodlands interchance, Muslim kids come up to me asking for donations for their mosque.

The church only owes believers explanation. <strong>Since you are already pissed because Christians knocking at your door</strong>, there is really no more need to explain anything.

You damn stylo-mylo, add words and change the argument.<br>Chain reaction to a mental process of lust, thinking that one needs to release the sperms and then proceed to jerk off.

Jealousy is not criminal, selfishness is not criminal, apathy is not criminal but they are sins.<br>I don't want to go into whether you see these issues as sins or not, not important anymore because <strong>it still about the Christians at your door.</strong><br><br>Anyway, it is been interesting corresponding in such a manner. At least now I know the root of your aggression is that you got upset because Christians knock at your door. Whatever credibility and honorable stand about seeking truth and rationality no longer exists. Your apparent desire to look for rationale no longer holds water because you have chosen only to target at Christians even though other religions also have their idiosyncrasies but you have chosen to ignore because they do not irritate you that much.<br>'nuff said....</div>
