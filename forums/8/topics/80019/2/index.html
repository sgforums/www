            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>is it a sin?  where does it say that "thou shalt not wank" ???<br><br>and are u sure anyone feels guilty about such an obvious fact of life? </blockquote>Certainly some churches have been telling people tat one shouldn't masterbate etc. I am pretty sure the bible doesn't state anything like tat but some churches can go and hunt down one sentence tat vaguely associate with it and claims it is a sin to wank. R u going to tell me tat it didn't happened ? Can u say tat all the churches in singapore do not condemn masterbation ? From the many replies here it doesn't reflect tis situation.<br><br><blockquote>not no contraceptives... no ARTIFICIAL methods of contraceptions. withdrawal and calculation of ovulation cycles are perfectly ok. </blockquote>Ovulation cycle ? Withdrawal ? From a medical point of view tat is a risky business. I am pretty sure not all women have regular cycles and calculation won't work for them. Men do emit small amount of semen during the intercourse and withdrawal has its risk. Why couldn't they use artifical contraceptives ? They r the most effective means up till tis date. Why resort to old risky and unreliable methods to prevent birth ? Even Gov or medical agencies around the world recommend ARTIFICIAL contraceptives as the most reliable means to prevent birth. R u going to say they r all wrong ?<br><br><blockquote>if u ask me, that is quite immaterial... if one is taking the perspective that having too many children that one cannot afford leads to a cycle of poverty and social problems, the solution is NOT just contraceptives, but education. </blockquote>Education ? Educating them not to have sex or psychoing them to raise too much children than they can afford ? If I had planned for 2 and end up with 10, then how ? Children is hard and expensive to raise isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>if one is taking the perspective that artificial birth-control is an individual right, then it really depends what your position is...<br><br>sexually active single individuals would certainly welcome artificial contraception and there is a commandment against adultery... </blockquote>Tat is strange, does sexually active individual have to commit adultery ? Can't they do it with their own wife ? If I had planned for 2 and within 40 years being "sexually active" with my consenting wife without artifical contraceptives, can u be sure I won't end up with 3 or more ? Or do your sense of adultery includes your own spouse ?<br><br><blockquote>anyway, many pple treat religion like a buffet table nowadays... pick and choose what u want... mass, confession, communion, pay lips service to the rest, ignore what u dun like...<br><br>the church doesn't have to come out to sanction it for pple to start ignoring it...</blockquote>There r certainly many other people who treats the words of church as laws and rules. If they fully believes and do wat the church recommend, then doesn't the church have to explain why it state ridiculous rulings tat doesn't go along with the times ? When one ends up with too much children, who get to carry the burden ? Certainly the church have nothing to do with it. Only the parents who had unwittingly followed its orders.</div>

Tat is the thing I am curious about. Why infringe on human rights ? Whether an individual masterbate or not is an individual choice, why does the chruch have to enforce it on its people.<br><br><blockquote> unless someone can masturbate thinking about a cup of coffee than it is not a sin<br>... the point is, together with masturbation comes the thought of lust or the desire for the flesh. That is the sin part.<br>One can hardly classify wet dreams, which is totally involuntary, as a sin. </blockquote>Wat has the thought of lust or desire for flesh wrong in anything ? Everyone thinks of "lust" since all men and women r built tis way. <strong>I am sure one will feel lust even when looking or doing with his own wife. Do u think about a cup of coffee or a software book when u r doing it with your wife ? </strong> So is making love with your wife a sin ? Why want to deny it ? Why want to stop it ?<br><br>DO u like to eat ? I am sure gluttony is a sin too. So do all men have to eat tasteless food tat is without seasoning to prevent them from the sin gluttony ? Greed is also a sin. So all men should not be moltivated to work lah ? All men should just strive to be floor sweepers earning enough just to feed themselves ? I am sure vanity is a sin too. So all men and women cannot dye their hair, wear contact lenses or put on makeup lah ? R u being realistic ?<br><br><blockquote>Going back to the original question, of course Christians (not all) masturbate.

They already discourage people from masterbatign just because of this verse<br><br><blockquote>It's the one Jesus said about "looking at a woman in lust is a sin"... </blockquote>Why discourage such a society norm ? Just because of tis statement u prohibit men from masterbating ? I tell u one thing. If all men do not masterbate, then the cases of rape and molest will increase by a lot. Tat is where the real sin had occurred.</div>

So all men and women cannot dye their hair, wear contact lenses or put on makeup lah ? R u being realistic ?<br></div></blockquote>When I am hungry, I eat - a natural progression. When I eat, I can decide to eat well - an economic decision. But the moment I eat ceaselessly regardless of whether I am hungry or not, it is gluttony.<br>When I see a pretty girl, I admire the beauty - again a natural progression. But the moment I mentally undress her, it becomes lust.<br>When I work, I work for money. But when I plot against another person to take over his property, it becomes greed.<br><strong>THERE IS A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT IS GREED AND WHAT IS NOT, WHAT IS LUST AND WHAT IS LOVE, WHAT IS GLUTTONY AND WHAT IS HUNGER</strong>.

Churches, for that matter, any religious bodies exist to be the moral compass for the masses, without taking such a position, one might as well join a community club. Whether you as an individual agrees to the role of the moral compass is really not important. The church (or any religious bodies) CANNOT enforce most of their teachings and at the end of the day, it is up to the individual to answer to their gods and no one else should question this relation the individual has with his god.<br>To me, it appears to be absolutely loony for people to be vegetarian, but again, an individual reserves to right to have that dietary choice because he sees his god in that decision. If this individual sees that eating meat is sin, that is is own choice.</div>
