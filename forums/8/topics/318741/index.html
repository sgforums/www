              Divers from India and England made the discovery based on the
              statements of local fishermen and the old Indian legend of the Seven
              Pagodas. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The ruins, which are off the coast of Mahabalipuram, cover many square kilometres. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">A further expedition to the region is now being arranged which will take place at the beginning of 2003. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>'International significance'</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The discovery was made on
              1 April by a joint team of divers from the Indian National Institute of
              Oceanography and the Scientific Exploration Society based in Dorset,
              UK. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Expedition leader Monty

              "The scale of the site appears to be extremely extensive, with 50 dives
              conducted over a three-day period covering only a small area of the
              overall ruin field. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">"This is plainly a discovery of international significance that demands further exploration and detailed investigation." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">During the expedition to
              the site, divers came across structures believed to be man-made. One of

              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The myths of
              Mahabalipuram were first set down in writing by British traveller J
              Goldingham, who visited the South Indian coastal town in 1798, at which
              time it was known to sailors as the Seven Pagodas. </span></p>

              The myths also state that a large city which once stood on the site was
              so beautiful the gods became jealous and sent a flood that swallowed it
              up entirely in a single day. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">One of the expedition
              team, Graham Hancock, said: "I have argued for many years that the
              world's flood myths deserve to be taken seriously, a view that most
              Western academics reject. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">"But here in Mahabalipuram, we have proved the myths right and the academics wrong." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Scientists now want to
              explore the possibility that the city was submerged following the last
              Ice Age. If this proves correct, it would date the settlement at more
              than 5,000 years old. </span></p>

              <p>Ruins recently discovered in southern <a href="http://www3.nationalgeographic.com/places/countries/country_peru.html">Peru</a> could be the ancient "lost city" of Paititi, according to claims that are drawing serious but cautious response from experts.<br><br>The
              presumptive lost city, described in written records as a stone
              settlement adorned with gold statues, has long been a grail for
              explorers—as well as a lure for local tourism businesses. <br><br>A
              commonly cited legend claims that Paititi was built by the Inca hero
              Inkarri, who founded the city of Cusco before retreating into the
              jungle after Spanish conquerors arrived. <br><br>On January 10 Peru's
              state news agency reported that "an archaeological fortress" had been
              discovered in the district of Kimbiri and that the district's mayor
              suggested it was the lost city. <br><br>Mayor Guillermo Torres
              described the ruins as a 430,000-square-foot (40,000-square-meter)
              fortification near an area known as Lobo Tahuantinsuyo.<br><br>Few
              other details about the site were offered, but initial reports
              described elaborately carved stone structures forming the base of a set
              of walls. <br><br>The state media report quotes Torres as saying the area will be "immediately declared" a cultural tourism site.<br><br>Officials
              from the Peruvian government's Cusco-based National Institute of
              Culture (INC) met with Torres on Tuesday, according to Francisco Solís,
              an INC official.<br><br>"It is far too early to make any definitive
              judgments," Solís told National Geographic News. "We are going to
              dispatch a team to investigate."<br><br>Officials expect more details to emerge in the coming days, he said.<br><br><strong>Legend of Paititi</strong><br><br>Paititi
              is believed to have been located somewhere east of the Andes Mountains
              in the rain forest of southeastern Peru, southwestern Brazil, or
              northern Bolivia (<a href="http://plasma.nationalgeographic.com/mapmachine/index.html#theme=Street&amp;sf=18468599.9106785&amp;c=-63.5887%7C-16.2902">see map</a>). <br><br>In
              1600 a missionary reported seeing a large "city of gold" in the region
              where Paititi is believed to have been built, according to archival
              records discovered by an Italian archaeologist in 2001.<br><br>However, the location of the newfound site falls counter to where historical records indicate Paititi should be, Solís said. <br><br>Officials were nonetheless intrigued by the possibilities, he added. <br><br>The first task will be to determine if the newfound ruins are the work of the Inca or pre-Inca ethnic groups, Solís said.<br><br>(Read related story: <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/09/070926-peru-bodies.html">"80 Ancient 'Cloud Warrior' Skeletons Found in Peru Fort"</a> [September 26, 2007].)<br><br>Gregory
              Deyermenjian, a U.S.-based psychologist and explorer who has led many
              expeditions to investigate the Paititi legend, said many people in the
              tourism-rich region of Cusco have embraced the legend as a business
              promotion. <br><br>But he said the claims could have merit, as there are still many important sites to be found.<br><br>"It is a bit off the beaten path but still within the Inca's reach," Deyermenjian said. "I'm very interested to know more." <br><br>Daniel Gade, professor emeritus in geography at the University of Vermont, cautioned about jumping to conclusions. <br><br>"Paititi
              is frequently the first thing people mention when something like this
              is found," Gade said, adding that there are many ruins in the jungle
              regions of the area.</p>

              <p>The first physical clues to a long-rumored town that existed on the
              site of present-day Alexandria have been uncovered—by accident.<br><br>While
              searching under the waves of Alexandria's East Bay for Greek and Roman
              ruins, archaeologists discovered signs of building construction 700
              years older than Alexander the Great's invasion of <a href="http://www3.nationalgeographic.com/places/countries/country_egypt.html">Egypt</a>. <br><br>The conquerer founded Alexandria in 332 B.C. (Related: <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/05/070515-alexander-great.html">"Alexander the Great Conquered City via Sunken Sandbar"</a> [May 15, 2007].)<br><br>The
              new find is "the first hard evidence" of Rhakotis, a town mentioned in
              several histories of the region but whose existence had never been
              substantiated, said geoarchaeologist Jean-Daniel Stanley of the
              Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History.<br><br>And the results, which are published in the August issue of the journal <em>GSA Today</em>, were "a bit of serendipity," Stanley said. <br><br><strong>Sunken Surprise</strong><br><br>Stanley
              has helped the Franck Goddio Society and Egypt's Supreme Council of
              Antiquities search for clues to what might have caused the structural
              failure of Greek- and Roman-era buildings, roads, and piers now sitting
              at the bottom of the bay.<br><br>The team sunk a half-dozen
              vibracores—vibrating three-inch (eight-centimeter) hollow tubes—into
              the muck and silt of the bay's floor. <br><br>The tubes contained layered soil samples, or cores—some as long as 20 feet (7 meters). <br><br>Stanley took his samples back to Washington, D.C., and dated them using a radiocarbon technique. <br><br>Though
              he was searching for cracked or damaged rocks that might suggest how
              Greek-era structures had failed, he was surprised to find older signs
              of human endeavor. <br><br>The cores turned up lead and human waste
              that were more than 3,000 years old—evidence of a significant
              settlement centuries before Alexander stormed Egypt. <br><br>Stanley
              assembled a team of specialists in terrestrial magnetism, anthropology,
              paleobiology, and geology to examine the core samples. <br><br>After a few years of study, the team confirmed the findings did indeed point to Rhakotis.<br><br>In
              addition to the 3,000-year-old lead, which was used for construction,
              the cores contained stone building materials from central and southern
              Egypt. <br><br>"There are signs of a flourishing settlement going back
              to Pharaonic times, but it's too early to say anything about it,"
              Mohamed Abdel-Maqsud, an Alexandria expert from the Supreme Council of
              Antiquities, told the Associated Press. <br><br>Jean-Yves Empereur, director of the Center for Alexandrian Studies, said he had not yet read the findings and could not comment.<br><br><strong>Sailor Haven</strong><br><br>The
              city's bay, anchored by the island—now a peninsula—of Pharos, has long
              been known as a haven for sailors. The bay is even mentioned in Book
              Four of Homer's <em>Odyssey</em>: "Therein is a harbor with good anchorage, whence men launch the shapely ships into the sea. ..."<br><br>When
              Alexander arrived in 332 B.C., he apparently agreed with Odysseus's
              reasoning. His new Egyptian capital would be close enough to the Nile
              for southern travel, but far enough away that seasonal flooding
              wouldn't be a problem.<br><br>Ptolemy I, Alexander's political heir,
              built the nearly 500-foot (152-meter) Lighthouse of Alexandria on
              Pharos, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.(<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/07/photogalleries/seven-wonders/photo10.html">See an illustration of the lighthouse</a>.)<br><br>The
              lighthouse served as both a beacon and a symbol of Alexandria's
              greatness until a pair of earthquakes sent it tumbling into the bay
              1,600 years later. Alexandria today is a breezy Mediterranean city of
              five million people.<br><br>The next step for researchers will be unmasking the culture and people of Rhakotis, now the bay's earliest known inhabitants.<br><br>"Were they seamen, agriculturalists, traders?" Stanley said. "We don't yet know."</p>
