Jesus' teachings were based on those from the old testament.<br><br>The New Testament is written after Jesus was crucified and ressurructed.<br><br>------------------------------<br>For the different churches, here's how (in lamen's terms) it breaks down.<br><br>Church--&gt; Broken into:  The Roman Catholic Church and Protestant Church.  (Read up on Martin Luther for the reason there are two)<br><br>Protestant Church:  Broken into--&gt; Lutheran, Presbyterian, Methodist, Weslyan, Baptist, etc.<br><br>Each denomination has different beliefs and traditions but with pretty much similar core beliefs/values.  Reasons are due to the environment, geography, and founder of the denomination.<br><br>The Mormons, Adventists, Jehovah Witness, etc are sometimes not considered mainstream because their teachings are essentially different even though Jesus is mentioned.<br><br>Yes, there are arguements between religions, denominations, even within a single church.  Remember these are human beings afterall.  People tend to put blinders on when it comes to things concerning them. No one's perfect no matter who they believe or worship.  But that doesn't make what is taught useless.  People are just being people when they don't act on what they're taught.<br><br>So why pick one over the other?  Faith, I guess.  As a Christian, I believe whatever is taught in the Bible rather than the Torah or the Quaran because I find that it makes more sense to me and it's the least religious* of all the religions.  I would also tell someone to give it a chance instead of just brushing it off.  Other than this last part, I'm not really promoting anything.  Neither am I arguing how one is better than the other.  Down to it, it's still has to do with personal choice.<br><br>*Meaning it's has less rituals.</div>

Actually, most Protestant churches do put away their denominational differences aside and do non-denominational events.  Campus Crusade for Christ is one such organisation.  Still it has it's own set of codes and beliefs.  Anyways, Jesus never said he brought peace.  "Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division."  Luke 12:51.<br><br>The Pope can't abolish all the different "sects", he doesn't have authority over anyone but the Roman Catholic Church.<br><br>Honestly, you need know more about church history to comment on this.<br><br></div>
