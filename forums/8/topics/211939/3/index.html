Surpisingly the mother fcuking police even side with them . From that time onwards whenever i do sumthing that they think is wrong they threaten to put me in Boy's Home saying what that they have a record of me doing this and that and it is easy to put me in. it was dam fcuk lor i talk on fone with my friends only they kpkb also cannot den with girl they say is my gf with boy they suspect i g@y den what can i do? sometimes in the middle of the night i cried upon thinking of this  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I even make a deal with my female friend that we will moved out and stay on our own when we reach 18  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> And did the deal occur?<br><br>Anyway, for me, not so abusive. But my parents could not tolerate me not eating with them, even if I was in the midst of important things. If I did not appear after a few calls, the cane would soon arrive.<br>Besides that, my mum does not seem to understand that the phrase "you can go to hell" was something like a casual speech (at least between me and my cousins and friends) and uttering that without care in front of my mum once earned me a nice tight slap from my mum, in front of my grandmother.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>On the other hand, I think it was my fault though, I once had to see the principal in P5 for saying "f-u-c-k you".<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those ppl scarred by the parents punishment, fret not. They maybe doing it all becuz they dun wan us to turn bad. It is said if parents are not willing to teach their kids well, then let the government police &amp; prisons teach for them instead. If the police &amp; prisons have to be called in, the situation is pretty at the most desperate times.<br><br>So for those still not happy with parents punishment, simple solution is next time go get married and have kids and then as parents you can finally inflict the punishment you received last time onto them.
