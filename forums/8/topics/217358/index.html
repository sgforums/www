            <div class='col-md body'>(Nullified)<br><blockquote>They will send in the regulars 1st. You think for $350 a month i will go fight the war?</blockquote>yeah lah, but then, i think that given the nature of SG's government, they'll surely force one. in fact, i think it's already a law that if SG is invaded, NSMen and NSFs will have to go to frontline. because regulars not enough : in my NS days, the regulars in every camp i've seen make up only 10% or so. the rest all NSFs.<br>somemore, almost all regulars are all sergeants and officers.....u think Mindef will despatch them to fight first meh? i think they'll use the "ground people", which is NSMen and NSFs.<br>after all, i don't think SG government will be stupid enough to spend billions of $ to train us for nothing if they don't intend to send us to war and death.<br><br>(Hellraiza)<br><blockquote>yah of course not. But when the enemy lays hands on your family, would you still think of the $350?</blockquote>the thing i fear most is that they'll send soldiers to come into our homes and drag us to war, like what hitler did to german men during WW II.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once, my moral education teacher said that plans have been made to 'defend then attack KL'. I asked him during lesson why SG Army don't have heavy tanks like the M1A1 Abrams the US are using. His reply was that SG Army would have one day fight Malaysian troops, this is INEVITABLE. Quote: 'Once Malaysian troops have intention on pushing south and crushing us, our Army will defend and try to push the Malaysians back north... and through Pahang, try to capture KL as soon as possible.'<br>Ask Col Benedict Tan (I met him before) and he WILL refuse to say...<br>Isn't this a good plan?<br>I will not disclose the plans I have on these movements, but I gurantee you, it will be very very fun...<br>Dream on SG!
