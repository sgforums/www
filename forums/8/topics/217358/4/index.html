Look at the current UN, although it's better and stronger than the league of nations of last time, it's very much dependent on US which is the main financial support of UN. UN itself is to prevent any possible war or threat through peaceful means, but it seems it can't do any thing to US when they decide to declare war on another country in the name of terrorism. Someday history will repeat itself.</blockquote>yeah, but as Clinton once said, "Asia will be the region to watch in the new millennium". i think very true. the terrorists are dangerous, but they're nothing compared to huge superpower countries. USA now distracted by terrorist and it really has it's foot stuck deep in quicksand. if it's foot is still sinking in the terrorist/Iraq quicksand 8 years from now and china's military strength is more powerful, it can defeat the US with no problem and I think the terrorists will be glad as well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>but if china really attacks, no problem as well, because i believe Japan(with it's self-defence force) can still hold them off a little and South Korea will also do something. maybe N. Korea and Russia will help China(thereby the new Three Axis of Evil) to defeat their long-time eye-sore, the US.<br>after US is down, then we all die liao.<br><br>(SixSentinels)<br><blockquote>"The nations of the world will have to unite, for the next war will be an interplanetary war. The nations of the earth must someday make a common front against attack by people from other planets.</blockquote>that remark from McAurthur is really naive. the next war, WW III, will involve entire continents capable of destruction never witnessed before in history. the destruction scale will be a lot more than WW I and WW II combined together. it'll probably be the mother of all wars ever fought.<br><br>anyway, if humans managed to survived, then McArthur's statement might be right : we'll be facing aliens in WW IV.<br>or maybe we call it Star Wars I already? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>(Nullifed)<br><blockquote>If nuclear weapons are involved i sugges we don't waste any of our time and effort and let's all sit down and take a smoke break and look up in the sky where there will be a bright flash of light.</blockquote>the night before that happens, i'll have all the sex i can first before i die. don't care liao.....all human lust will run wild.<br><br>(NewAge)<br><blockquote>Have anyone notice the different in age which equal experience between Singapore generals and those of other countries. Ours are mostly in the 30s or 40s while the US generals are in their 50s or 60s. So do anyone still have confident in yr general?! Please dun forget most of them are scholars. They might not be promoted because of merit but becasue of them taking mindef scholarship thus mindef nurture them.</blockquote>the generals in other countries(in this case, i'll focus on the US) get promoted not because of paper qualifications.<br>all of them are true war veterans who've at least participated in the Vietnam war, the Korean War etc., serving as young officers back then. they're not like SG, whereby if you're a President scholar and you sign on in army, you get promoted to Captain right away and get promoted non-stop until you reach Brigadier/Major-General.<br><br>our generals are more like having ceremonial purposes, such as always visiting foreign countries to cut red ribbons, receive "regional cooperation medals", get confered a title in a certain regional country(Highest White Knight by the Order of the King of Thailand, try that) and make "so-and-so" pledges.<br>everyday sit in air-con office sign documents, approve contractor/public works, review the financial budgets of camps blah blah blah....they make better executives in SG Shenton offices, though.<br><br>(AigloSicle)<br><blockquote>Such a situation is entirely hypothetical. the chances of any country attacking singapore is quite slim. anyway even if we do get occupied it is relatively safe to say that the occupation wouldnt last forever as history tells us that no occupation has truly succeeded.</blockquote>yeah, but i don't want to see my family killed or get myself tortured!<br><br>anyway, one of the posters mentioned something like even if china rush down upon us with no weapons, they also win.<br>correct le! china's army alone is a lot more than entire SG population!!!!!<br>even if let's say, 500, 000 china troopers descend upon us non-stop from all directions carrying swords and spears, we also no chance one, because the outnumbering problem overshadows our gun-and-bomb advantage. by the time we load our ammo, their next batch is coming again, like the tide at sea. die liao.</div>

Also, many acts and sanctions were being passed in the UN after WWII. In fact, during WWII whoever have nuclear weapons makes the decision. The struggle for power then blinded everyone from war restrictions.<br><br>Also, for those who are afraid of being nuked, US, Russia, UK, France and China had sign treaty to ban usage of uncontrolled nuclear usage.

            <div class='col-md body'>The atomic bombs, so fondly called, had 15 and 21 kilotons of destructive force of TNT.

Buildings in Newton, Yio Chu Kang, Bukit Timah, Bukit Batok, City, as far as Hougang and Geylang will suffer heavy, un-repairable damage. Jurong Islands, Tuas, Jurong West, Changi, Bedok and Punggol/parts of Sengkang will suffer minor shockwave damage. Just to think of, planes in Changi Airport would be blown sideways, and you can think of the damage.

            <div class='col-md body'>First they will ask the enemies to study for 6 years to understand the singapore basic social defense system, then they will take the Preliminary Success in Learning to Eradicate SG (PSLEs). Then they will have to study for another 4-5 years to understand the second layer of total defense. Which then they would have to take another exam, this time much harder, commonly known as Operation SG ('O' lvls). After that, they would undergo a harsh academic pseudo situation to interpret the true meaning of civil defense. This requires at least 2-3 years of focused studying. Afterwhich they would have to take a much tougher exam, generally known as Advance into SG ('A' lvls). Now~! things gets exciting~! Certain enemies would decide to skip the 'A' lvls and go for a more practical approach to invade, through polymorph techniques (polytechnic), this outspoken method is very specific in its details, hence it would require at least 3-4 years of pure research and hardwork to truely understand the millitary defense. If they manage to successfully get through this problem scenario, then they would be offered a diploma, making them qualified to even ponder about invading SG. Others who finished the 'A' lvls would then be offered one last obstacle to overcome, which is... the... Nuts Unto SG (NUS). This is the final lap in order to start discussing plans to invade singapore. After 4 damn agonizing years of tormenting, sadistic pure studying, those who make it would then graduate with a certificate, which is globally recognised, grants the permission of enemies to openly declare economic sanctions against SG. For those enemies who really really really want to conquer SG, they might considered suffering for a few more years and take the MASTERS course... Omg.. This course has a pessimistic meaning to it. Must all subjects tested eternally receive success. (MASTERS). If they manage to obtain this piece of paper, they would be able to send spys into SG and steal internal information... After all, in a war, knowledge of the enemy is invaluable, hence these papers are vital in order to fight with SG. Enemies with brain levels as high as einstein would then further probe for more information in order to really really crush SG.. That is.. The feared... Psychologically Harmful Dope (PhD). To the few who ever attained the PhD level, these are the enemies who are would then just send a nuclear bomb into SG, and TaTa~<br><br>The reason for writing this totally absurd passage is a totally understandable for such a profound question. sarcastic measures have to be implemented. No harm intended. Have a nice day</div>

Countries then focus on recovering from war and to do this they need to side with the super-powers. Also, many acts and sanctions were being passed in the UN after WWII. In fact, during WWII whoever have nuclear weapons makes the decision. The struggle for power then blinded everyone from war restrictions.<br><br>Also, for those who are afraid of being nuked, US, Russia, UK, France and China had sign treaty to ban usage of uncontrolled nuclear usage. Meaning only nuclear  plants are allowed. Even using a tiny amount of nuclear energy (controlled nuclear fallouts) to blow up a cave for land developing is not ok.<br><br>So just worry bout N.Korea, nah they are screw up/</div></blockquote>well even though they had signed a treaty to ban usage of uncontolled nuclear bombs, however superpowers like US, are constantly stocking up their supplies of nuclear warheads. Thus when a war breaks out the treaty itself will render useless and even though there's UN, i doubt its capability as a peacekeeping organisation. However the usage of nuclear bombs will not come in so early in a war unless the conflict worsens to a degree of unrepairable situation.</div>
