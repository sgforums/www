Draw arms immediately, and station at all airports and seaports. Then wait for the Elites to come because they want to fly off. Hold them hostage till they pay up with their million dollars of jewelries and assets. Shoot them when they pay, accusing them of treason. Finally, run away on the planes that they are supposed to escape in.<br><br>3. Shoot your commanders first because they are paper generals only. Fight for them, sure die.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Imagine yourself in the night with a night vision... where the other party has nothing but a rifle... I think even if I do not have experience I could easily win the battle. War is no longer just ane xperience game... but also a technological game... I planes could easily flew over other's territory without anyone stopping us simply their planes couldn't even flew in the fast place... what does it prove?<br><br>Only think that we didn't fought war before... how about our opponent? They fought a full scale war before also? no the new generation also.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its stupid when people fight each other, since we are all the same species. war that strengthens humanity as a whole may also destroy us one day. but if an alien force invades Earth, I would gladly fight to the bitter end to protect our homeworld.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with the thread starter that one day war will bring out again. Look at the current UN, although it's better and stronger than the league of nations of last time, it's very much dependent on US which is the main financial support of UN. UN itself is to prevent any possible war or threat through peaceful means, but it seems it can't do any thing to US when they decide to declare war on another country in the name of terrorism. Someday history will repeat itself.</div>

Do u really still think that you care about the $350.. even though u may not wish to fight, but u have no choice unless u can manage to leave the country. If u can't how? The best thing left is to fight the enemy le.</div>
