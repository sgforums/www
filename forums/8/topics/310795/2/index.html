              <p>The <em>wake-initiated lucid dream</em> "occurs when the sleeper enters REM sleep with unbroken <a title="Self-awareness" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Self-awareness"><span style="color: #0000ff;">self-awareness</span></a> directly from the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Awake" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Awake"><span style="color: #0000ff;">waking state</span></a>".<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/forums/8/topics/#_note-18"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[25]</span></a></sup> There are many techniques aimed at entering a WILD. The key to these techniques is recognizing the <a title="Hypnagogia" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Hypnagogia"><span style="color: #0000ff;">hypnagogic</span></a> stage, which is within the border of being awake and being <a title="Sleep" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Sleep"><span style="color: #0000ff;">asleep</span></a>. If a person is successful in staying aware while this stage occurs, he or she will eventually enter the dream state while being fully aware that it is a dream.</p>
              <p>There are key times at which this state is best entered; while success at normal bedtime after having been awake all day is very difficult, it is relatively easy after sleeping for 3–7 hours or in the afternoon during a nap. Techniques for inducing WILDs abound. Dreamers may count, envision themselves climbing or descending stairs, chant to themselves, explore elaborate, passive sexual fantasies, control their breathing, counting their breaths to keep their thoughts from drifting, concentrate on relaxing their body from their toes to their head, allow images to flow through their "mind's eye" and envision themselves jumping into the image, to maintain concentration and keep their mind awake, while still being calm enough to let their body sleep.</p>
              <p>During the actual transition into the dream state, one is likely to experience <a title="Sleep paralysis" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Sleep_paralysis"><span style="color: #0000ff;">sleep paralysis</span></a>, including rapid vibrations,<sup id="_ref-ldobe_1" class="reference"><a href="http://politics.sgforums.com/forums/8/topics/#_note-ldobe"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[13]</span></a></sup> a sequence of loud sounds and a feeling of twirling into another state of body awareness, "to drift off into another dimension". Also there is frequently a sensation of falling rapidly or dropping through the bed as one enters the dream state. After the transition there may be the sensation of entering a dark black room from which one can induce any dream scenario of one's choosing, simply by concentrating on it. The key to success is not to panic, especially during the transition, which can be quite sudden.</p>
