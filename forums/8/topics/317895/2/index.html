              <p>ahhh thanks for all your constructive comments.</p>

              <p>i know when i put it, people associate me with negative
              influences. i have a few tattoos in the covered zones of my body
              and they mean a lot to me. some are works of art, some with
              meaning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i feel that putting words may mean a lot to me. sometimes these
              words help me understand what i have been going through.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>however, people who may have tattoos put it for different
              reasons, not just putting cuz we are pai kia or we want to hao lian
              so people think we are not someone to mess with.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if i put one; lets say at a sleeve area, probably the only fears
              are that people might think im dangerous and relatives think i m
              deviant already!!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>

              <p>Why get a tattoo? what if one day tattoos are not fashionable

              <p>Sori, i am still single and virgin, no child yet. Therefore i drew art picture of my own liking, and art need to be expose inorder to be call art, so i show it to my frens, some give good comments, some said it is like shit, i take it with open arms and improve on it.

              <p><br>Locally, i believe most go for the sake of fashion. For us gals, if u look around, we gals bare back to show our shoulder tattoo, lower jeans or skirt to show our rear butterfly or eagle etc etc. Half tank top to show our belly button tattoo. It not only protray a fashionable style, it also tell others that we are game for it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But as a gal and for the gal out there, you need a good shoulder, slim stomach and a good rear to looks real good and cool. If not, with crooked shoulder, big tummy, and fat or no bum rear, you become a laughing stock. I have seen that on the streets, real awful.</p>

              <p><br>life is a journey, why miss out on some parts when you can enjoy the whole thing?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so we are not to talk about fashion and art at all until we are making money? i hope you arent practising what you preach because thats a very sad life i see.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>prudence and limits are there for a reason.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway its using money from working.</p>

              <p>Sori, i am still single and virgin, no child yet. Therefore i drew art picture of my own liking, and art need to be expose inorder to be call art, so i show it to my frens, some give good comments, some said it is like shit, i take it with open arms and improve on it.

              <p><br>Let me clarify.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think to depend on public taste to judge whether something is good art or bad art or not is very dangerous when you are going to be the canvas. A lot of artists were not appreciated until they are dead :) And i did not say that art cannot be sold - but rather, not ALL art pieces is for sale or for the public.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is also art that you do for self expression. It's like writing a diary, its something you want to say or you feel but you can't express in words. And it really doesn't matter whether it is beautiful or good or not - because we don't say/think/feel beautiful or good stuff all the time anyway. And if we change it because of someone else's opinion, then it means you don't feel all that strongly about it to begin with.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the case of a tattoo, unless you are doing it to impress people and look chio, otherwise for many people, getting a tattoo is a way of using  body art as a way to chronicle events in life, or a reminder of your own convictions or beliefs. If it is for the latter - why bother what people think? </p>
