            <div class='col-md body'>I met M when I was still studying in NUS.  That was during my second year.  We had a few dates but eventually, things didn't quite work out.  Her answer to me was, "I am not ready for any relationship".<br><br>And so, I waited. 1 year (M said, "I am not ready)...2 years (M said, "I don't want to think about relationship")...3 years (M said, "Relationship is out of the picture for me now")...4 years (M said, "I don't think I will ever want to get married or be in a relationship)...5 years....<br><br>During the past 5  years, I had the benefits of knowing a couple of really nice ladies.  Dated a few but none of them had made me felt the same intensity I felt for M.  Had met 2 lovely 'wife material' ladies but had missed the boat because I couldn't get M out of my mind.<br><br>It's been 2 years plus since I last met M.  We are still in contact though, mostly through SMS.  To be frank, I am still very much in love with her.  But then again, people do change.  She has changed over the years and so have I.  I must admit that she is not the same undergraduate I knew years back.  I too have changed much.  But my feelings remain the same.<br><br>You may think that it's just an infactuation.  That was what people said to me years back.  But years had gone by and the kid in NUS back then has now became a seasoned member of the working society.  Yet, I still feel very much the same for her.  I may not know what she has became today but I dare say she is still very much in my heart.<br><br>I wish I have a chance to get to know her all over again.  I wish I have a chance to woo her again.  I wish I can prove to her that certain things in life do not change with the waves and tides of time.  I wish...I can only wish.<br><br>The truth is, she has probably forgotten much about me if not for my occasional sms.  She would probably think I am crazy if I tell her how much I still feel for her.  But like I said, certain things in life do not change or fade with time.  Perhaps if this is a script from a movie, I would appear to be a lovelorn hero.  But this is real life and real life is no fairytale.  I know how I still feel about her.  But then again, all I can to is to post in this forum.  Not to prove anything non to get any answers or solutions.  Perhaps, my intention is just to get it out of my heart.<br><br>It's not that I want someone that I couldn't have.  It's just that I had to hold on to it so hard and then I had to watch it slip away...leaving me chasing only ghosts and memories of a time long forgotten by many, even by the woman I so deeply loved once and still do.<br><br>How do you tell someone that you still love her after her rejection to you 5 years ago?  I wish I know.  But then again, I wouldn't be here if I do know.  Reality bites and reality is not fairytale.</div>

Time is not on my side for one thing.  I am at that age whereby the BIG COMMITMENT is neither a dirty word nor an object of fear.  The honest truth is, I had tried accepting others into my heart.  But none of it ever last.<br><br>They said a wife is seldom the person you most wanted to be with but rather, she is someone you know you can always be contented with.  M is someone that I have always and most wanted to be with.  I guess the issue for me now is whether do I give up pursuing along a hopeless thread that will most probably lead to nowhere or do I give it one last shot and run a few more extra miles for her.<br><br>I am not as young as I used to be.  If I am still the young kid that I was in NUS, the answer would have been quite clear to me.  But then again, regret is a frightening thing.  I have had regrets that has since been buried so deep underground that digging it up is no longer a viable option.  But choosing between living in regrets and reopening a very painful wound, which would be the lesser sin?<br><br>Reality bites and reality time is no fairytale time.<br><br></div>

(wondering if tat the reason nowadays the iceberg is melting, too hot...) of course, love also cant be forced... reopening a wound is painful, but living with regrets throughout yr whole life is worst...<br><br>true, tat is why a lot of ppl are having so much problem with life after marriage, marriage is always about love, if yr wife think about the same way about u, how would u think? if your wife think tat u are only someone she is contented with, but not the one she always wanted? how would u feel? if tat is the case, i rather not get married, i can be contented with alot of women, but i will love one the most...<br><br>Fairytale exists only if u believe... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> </span><br></div>
