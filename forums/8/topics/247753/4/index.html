And asked them to lend him their notes. The classmates will be left without notes at all to prepare for their tutorial the next day.<br><br>And he just took the notes from them without asking, cos got one day the student came to see me and told me her notes missing, turned out that this student took it from her to copy the notes he missed out on.<br><br>So i told her not to lend the notes to him anymore, and after that class i dragged him aside to give him the lecture about being more serious abt his studies.<br><br>Well, he took my words seriously and never showed up for class ever since. Then when it is near the exam, i gave him the notes for all the lessons he has missed, but obviously he never went back to look at them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
