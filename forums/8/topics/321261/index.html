              <p><strong>Singapore River's diesel bumboats go green</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: An icon at the historically-important Singapore River has undergone a transformation. </span></p>
              <p><span> The bumboats there have gone green! The last of the 10 diesel-powered
              bumboats were replaced with electric-powered vessels last weekend. </span></p>
              <p><span> This is to ensure that the water quality will remain good, as the
              Marina Basin will be turned into a freshwater reservoir when the Marina
              Barrage is completed. </span></p>
              <p><span> Bumboats have been plying the Singapore River for decades. </span></p>
              <p><span> At first, they were used to ferry goods to warehouses and then over the past 20 years, they have been carrying people. </span></p>
              <p><span> The smell and noise of the diesel engines have been part of the experience for the people taking the bumboats. </span></p>
              <p><span> Ryden Fang, Singapore River Cruises &amp; Leisure's director, said:
              "What people usually comment is: it's very noisy, the diesel's smelly.
              But now, I really miss the smell a lot... because we try to maintain as
              much flavour of the old boat as possible, we actually designed and
              built the new bumboats according to the old bumboats but in a bigger
              version." </span></p>
              <p><span> At the succession ceremony, Ah Gu - a boatman for 30 years - handed
              over the kerosene navigation light from the old diesel bumboats to the
              new electric bumboats. </span></p>
              <p><span> Then it was time for the diesel boats to make their final journey along
              the Singapore River. On board were 80 senior citizens from Chinatown
              Kreta Ayer Senior Activity Club. </span></p>
              <p><span> The Singapore River Cruises &amp; Leisure is willing to donate the old
              boats to corporations and institutions which are interested in
              showcasing the bumboats for heritage preservation and educational
              purposes. - CNA/ir </span></p>
