In fact, enough food is grown around the world every single day currently, even with the still staggering amounts of unsettled or open land in the world - even as it sits RIGHT NOW - enough food is grown every day to feed 18 billion (THREE TIMES the number of people actually alive) people three completely healthy meals every day, in a totally balanced diet.<br><br>The reason that so many people starve is not from a lack of food, agricultural technology, or arible land. But because of the politics that make getting the food to where it needs to go impossible.<br><br>P.S. Answer the question please and state your reasons.<br></div>

You are scared of change and you are scared of me. Anyway please answer the question and state your reasons. It doesn't have to destroy mankind or cause armageddon,... I just wanted to know that's all.<br><br><blockquote><br>however<br>u may like to answer my question though:<br>how long does it take to boil a can of coca-cola presuming that i have oredi put the ice-cream into the washing machine at 4am this morning after i washed the calendar with milk tea?<br></blockquote>It's a trick question and you just need to read the first part, how long does it take to boil a can of coca-cola. Using standard heat, room temperatures and at sea-levels it takes about 12 minutes and 27 seconds to boil a can of coca-cola.</div>

You all know the saying: "the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few". Well, thats the case. The millions of starving people are numerically more important than a single individual.</div>
