            <div class='col-md body'>i discovered that nowadays secondary school students prefer going to a junior college to going to a polytechnic. they often have this misconcept that poly is a dumping ground for students who can't make it to a jc. i mean...what's wrong with going to a poly? c'mon guys, go ahead and share ur views.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO, JC is the fastest and easier route to a uni education ( 2yrs compared to 3 yrs for a poly education). However "A" level grads will have a disadvantage compared to their poly peers  if they are ineligible for uni because "A" level certs count for nothing in the job market as they are not trained in any technical field. In a sense, poly students have something to fall back on even if they can't enter uni. Actually, going to a poly first may be a better option even though it takes 3 years because poly grads are exempted for a number of modules offered in certain uni faculties such as computer science and as a result they can even graduate within 2.5 years. Hence they only lag behind their counterparts by 0.5 years in entering the job market. However based on my knowledge 5 years ago, one has to be the top 10% of ur poly cohort in order to be eligible for uni. Quite tough though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i kind of agree with suzi in a sense.  having a jc education would mean that it would be easier to judge, by your A-level results, whether you can enter a LOCAL university. i personally was a poly student and because of the local universities' miserly small intake of poly students, i was forced to come to manchester to pursue my further studies.<br>when the local unis look at poly students' enry results, the O-level results were taken into consideration, whereas the jc ppl, ONLY the A-level results were looked into.  so in that perspective, it's kind of unfair.  i am not discouraging poly eductaion, i personally feel that poly provides someone with the knowledge and skills to go out into the working society earlier.  but some choose to further study their interest.<br>some might say if they are ready to work, they should not compete with the jc students. well, if the government encourages upgrading, i feel they should let poly students have a fair share.  doesn't mean someone who has a clearer picture of what they want to do in future should be deprived because they can go on with life with a diploma. and let jc students become "superior".<br>people like us, will be forced to spend the extra money, which is a colossal amount, just to get their degree while a minority of the local uni students take for granted the amount of money they save.<br><br>so to answer the question, poly is NOT a dumping ground.  in fact, many people who come out of poly excel in education both overseas and locally.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.....this is a question for many sec. school leavers on whether to go to a JC or Poly...alot of my frens did not dare to enter poly coz they were afraid that they can't make it to the uni in the future as it is very difficult to do so.....thus many end up opting for JC...there is stereotype thinking that Poly students r inferior to Jc people...but i beg to differ coz i think in some course its better to go to Poly...well</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If u are aiming to go to U (which is what most ppl are doing these days) then JC is a better choice (shorter time)though both allows u to go to U in future.If U intend to start working earily then Poly is a better choice cos u get on job training.<br><br>Its a very important choice cos I got frens who applied for Poly courses after they got their A-level cos they realised A-level is not what they want.<br><br>Ploy is not so favourble at one time as they view as a place to train technicians but then it suddenly got "hot",lots of 8,9 pointer for O-level applied and the cut off point to enter to the lousiest course (those ppl don't ususlly do)is 20pts (nows 20+ I think)As more people are getting degrees, both local and oversea,JC became a favourite again.<br><br>One thing for sure, Poly is NOT a dumping ground.It created ppl with great achievement too e.g Mr Sim (boss of creative technology) EE student of Ngee Ann (Hope I got the facts right)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>let me stress this : Poly IS NOT A DUMPING GROUND!!!!!<br><br>I went to JJC for the first three mths but after that went to enrol into a polytechnic course (computer studies in ngee ann). Let me tell you : down there in my course during my year, we had single pointers that occupies most of my class. All of them had 7, 8 or the worst 9 pts for 6 SUBJECTS. Later, I learnt from my three years in poly that poly students are more exposed to technical knowledge that JC students. Personally, I feel that JC students are more spoon fed during exams and their scope of study is only on the subjects or faculty which they wanted to take if they will to successful enrol into U.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I graduated from JC and to speak the truth, I dun feel that what I have learnt in JC very useful. In fact, I've forgotten most of my A levels stuff...and in University, we learn much more in a shorteer period of time as compared to the 2 years in JC. Maybe someone can tell us what the poly system is like. I can't really compare JC and poly coz I dunno what poly is like, but for practicality, I guess for those of u who want to enter local Uni, JC would be the faster route. However, if u are really really very sure of what u want to do in Uni, then poly gets u there in about the same time, coz if u enter a related course in Uni, u can go straight on to year 2.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>both have their merits but you must know what you eventually want to do or an idea what is the career you r pursuing.<br><br>me poly grad but going to SIM next year.  I hv many poly frens who score under 10 points for O levels during my batch and they've gone on to overseas' universities and graduated.<br><br>but if you want to go JC, you hv to strive to get to NUS/NTU.  If you think you cannot handle JC, then poly would be more suitable.  look @ the courses available and make your decision.<br><br>I think Life really begins when you start working.  So think carefully what career path you want before you choose.<br><br>------------------<br>the good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, this is something I would really want to speak up on.  ultraman, x-men, JC may be the FASTEST route to a Singapore uni but if you are talking about any uni, then a poly route may actually be faster.  I was a poly grad from TP and I'm now doing an australian uni program in Singapore. This program only takes me 1 year 8 months to complete so its definitely faster than the jc route.  Some of my classmates even completed the program in only 1 year 4 months.  And yes, the degree is very much recognised in Singapore.<br><br>I chose to enter poly coz I wasn't particularly good at or interested in academic subjects.  ;p  although my results weren't fantastic, they could have gotten me into an average jc.  What i'm trying to say here is jc is not THE only route to an university education.  IMHO, a poly gives a more practical aspect to education compared to jc, which is more academic. An additional advantage, as pointed out by ultraman, is that poly students have a diploma to fall back on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">just to keep this topic active...</span><br>i personally feel that poly offers a wider variety of courses, whereas jc only has the science and arts courses now after having removed the commerce course. also, poly courses are much more interesting, compared to dull and boring jc courses.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i had these problem many years ago. jc will only be good if u can get to the uni, if not poly is the best choice. people avoid jc mainly cos of G.P. however, if u think u will stop at poly, think again.<br>i always tell my junior, poly will get u to the door of opportunities but will not give u the key. for uni grad, there are lots of opportunities like doing the masters, CFA or CPA (accountants).<br>as a poly grad, the most u earn after yrs of working is probably 2K, but for uni grads, 4K to 5K is within reach after 5yrs</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Where you go will depend on individual preferences really. Poly and Jc and PRe-U got their own bad pts and gd ones.<br>I went to Outram Institute, noone expect me to go uni but i still did it.<br>so it really depends, but i would have to agree tht it is for difficult fo Poly students to get in.</div>
