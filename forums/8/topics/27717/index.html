            <div class='col-md body'>The Three Stars<br><br>Tom Cruise, Steven Seagal, and Alec Baldwin were in a<br>jungle filming a movie. Sadly, they were taken<br>prisoner by the local tribe. As they were about to be<br>executed, they begged the queen of the tribe for<br>mercy.<br>She considered their plea and said, "Get me something<br>good to eat. If I like it, you will be freed." The<br>three stars looked at each other and agreed. They then<br>went into the jungle to look for some food.<br><br>Tom Cruise was the first to come back. He came up to<br>the altar and offered grapes. She tasted one and<br>immediately spat it out. She ordered her servants to<br>shove the rest of them up his bum. They did and he<br>cried out in pain.<br><br>Seagal was the next to arrive with some yummy apples.<br>The same thing happened to him, but curiously he<br>laughed as the apples were shoved up his bum.<br><br>Tom Cruise was shocked. Here he was howling in pain,<br>but Seagal was still laughing. Tom asked him, "What<br>the hell is so funny?"<br><br>Seagal, still laughing, replied, "Alec is coming back<br>with four pineapples."</div>
