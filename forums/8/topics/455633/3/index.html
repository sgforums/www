              'Ah Long' runners splashed paint at neighbour's door. They are harassing the innocent parties instead of the borrower. Why are they doing so?
              
              The borrowers made a Police report when they are harassed. They installed CCTV to instill fear to runners, who in turn changed their tactics and splashed paint at doors of innocent parties.
              
              Should such runners be sentenced to longer term of imprisonment and more strokes of caning?

              Innocent victims must be very frustrated.

              "Ah Long" runners have crossed the line by harassing the innocent parties. They have declared war with the community. It is time for the community to strike back. Our community should have zero tolerance  for unlicensed money lending activities. Ah Long, runners and borrowers should not be forgiven lightly. We need to send a strong message to them.
              
              Ah Long and Runners, "Stop before you are caught!" Wake up your idea! There are legal ways to make money.

              We should share the operation grounds of "Ah Long" with the authority.

              How they carry out the transaction?

              The community should have zero tolerance to unlicensed money lending activities.
              
              We should act now. Our flat may be the next target.

              I think loan sharks and their runners should be barred from entering Casinos. Reasons are as follows: -
              
              1). To prevent unlicensing money lending activities within the Casino premises;
              2). To prevent them from identifying potential clients or borrowers who are gambling inside the Casinos;
              3). To prevent them from approaching their potential clients outside the Casino premises.

              Should loan sharks and their runners be deprived from buying or renting a HDB flat?
              
              They are harassing innocent neighbours and flat owners. They are disturbing the neighbourhood peace.

              Do not respond to the gimmick of loan sharks. They slot their name card with message,  under your door, offering loan between $500 to 10K at low interest rate, no guarantor needed and shorter processing time to solve your financial difficulty. 
              
              What would you do if such name card is slotted under your main door?

              Most people who are desperate because of financial difficulty are likely to fall victim to such gimmick of loan sharks.
              
              Be wary. Don't be the next victim of endless loan shark harassment.

              Installation of CCTV will to a certain extent deter loan shark runner from splashing paint at borrower's door. But it will not deter runner from writing on the wall or splashing paint at area not covered by CCTV.
              
              To stop a borrower from taking a loan from loan shark when he or she is desperate is more challenging than detering loan shark harassment.

              It is common for borrower to take loan from loan shark A to make payment to loan shark B. The loan amount will snowball and it will come to a time the borrower cannot cope anymore.
              
              Some borrowers will become very depressed. Some will end their lives. Some will just run away from home, leaving their family members to face the problem.
