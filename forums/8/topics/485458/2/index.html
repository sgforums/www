              <p>That is why it is so important leaders set good examples.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, probably freedom of speech only applies to those few prominant figures, others subject to be sued   when ..........   <span style="line-height: 1.231;">The society is thus stifled.    </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Freedom of speech is not the absence of responsibility.   However, some people who stifle freedom of speech are very fond of ignoring this and go on to quote freedom of speech is equivalent to lack of responsibility.   It cannot be denied some people base on protecting selfish interest sue and quote freedom of speech is negative and destructive.    Tsk tsk tsk,  this is so uncalled for and unacceptable.</span></p>

              <p>Pls keep this lawyer's letter here for all to see cos it is a very nasty letter threatening to waste court time. I always believe in mediation and mindchamps, if they claim to be an honourable company then they  OUGHT to use more mature negotiation based methods to resolve problems rather than write threatening lawyer's letter treating to sue in court when it is <strong>well clear that the moderators of open forums only act on the basis of complaints</strong> (U do not have the time/manpower to screen all threads/posts).</p>
              <p>Opinion is also extremely subjective and the aggrieved party needs either to join the forum to dispute the accusation, or else explain to the forum owners WHY the author of an offending article ought be censured of banned, keeping in mind that personal opinions vary WIDELY across the board and it is IMPOSSIBLE to satisfy all. Unless there is overt malice/falsehood in an article, it should be allowed in so far that an opinion constitutes honest personal experience although vulgarities ought to be frowned upon if this forum is a dignified/ decent one.</p>
              <p>The forum moderator should be able to make temporarily invisible or to temporarily suspend discussion with a statement to the effect that an article (usually FP) is under investigation, a challenge having been issued by an aggrieved.</p>
              <p>The article author will then be challenged about facts in question and may apologically withdraw his comment/ edit the original version with a penalty of some sort: e.g. allowed 1 post a day for 5 days etc/ ban for serious defamation.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Pls keep this lawyer's letter here for all to see cos it is a
              very nasty letter threatening to waste court time.</span> I always believe
              in mediation and mindchamps, if they claim to be an honourable
              company then they  OUGHT to use more mature negotiation based
              methods to resolve problems rather than write threatening lawyer's
              letter treating to sue in court when it is <strong>well clear that
              the moderators of open forums only act on the basis of
              complaints</strong> (U do not have the time/manpower to screen all
              threads/posts).</p>
              <p>Opinion is also extremely subjective and the aggrieved party
              needs either to join the forum to dispute the accusation, or else
              explain to the forum owners WHY the author of an offending article
              ought be censured of banned, keeping in mind that personal opinions
              vary WIDELY across the board and it is IMPOSSIBLE to satisfy all.
              Unless there is overt malice/falsehood in an article, it should be
              allowed in so far that an opinion constitutes honest personal
              experience although vulgarities ought to be frowned upon if this
              forum is a dignified/ decent one.</p>
              <p>The forum moderator should be able to make temporarily invisible
              or to temporarily suspend discussion with a statement to the effect
              that an article (usually FP) is under investigation, a challenge
              having been issued by an aggrieved.</p>
              <p>The article author will then be challenged about facts in
              question and may apologically withdraw his comment/ edit the
              original version with a penalty of some sort: e.g. allowed 1 post a
              day for 5 days etc/ ban for serious defamation.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, that is the responsibility of the managers of
              open forums, however, hope the effort gain one good karma (besides
              membership/ advertisement revenue).</p>

              <p>A bit difficult considering I am really not so obsessed about Mindchamps/ their service (who are they anyway). </p>
              <p>Anyhow, I believe that many of these new fangled performance therapist are mostly just passing fads for lazy people who don't want to study real religion (the type with 1000yrs plus history).</p>
              <p>Many new aged performance therapist also use loud, noisy and even threatening methods to get the adrenaline running: probably the closest thing to taking a performance enhancing drug: their students often show spectular one dimensional results: e.g. get hitched and married in 6 months, hit S$1 million sales in 1 year but they end up having zero character and end up like zombies walking about.</p>
              <p>My guess from reading what has transpired here is that Mindchamps rather take easy way out of hiring lawyer to do dirty work. Unfortunately, in taking this lazy path of least resistance, Mindchamps is actually sowing the seeds of its eventual demise since <strong>many people reading its lawyer's letter will be left with same bitter taste and public discourse will most probably be critical of such arrogance/ highhandedness.</strong></p>
              <p>I could be wrong and only time will tell. However, the owners of this forum have every right to publish the Mindchamps lawyers letter in perpetuality since it is now their physical property. Whatever the result,<strong> people will always remember how high handed Mindchamps CEO is...</strong></p>

              <p>Maybe ALL SG forums threads like HWZ A1, sammyboy SHOULD NOT be closed/ locked unless dangerous (e.g. getting libellous, off topic(discuss/ criticise religion etc against forum rules etc). Otherwise the complainant lawyers could say: see, your closure of the thread precluded my right of response: and then the trouble starts. Let people comment as much as they want, unless the thread hits technical limit and has to be restarted for hard/software performance reasons etc.</p>
              <p>If people want to dig out old threads because they want right of response, then so be it: these are open forums: as long as one is truthful and honest, at most freedom of speech respecting sites, anything (with a semblence of decorum ) goes.</p>
