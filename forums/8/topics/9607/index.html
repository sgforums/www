Shimena guarded the northern approaches to Ireth Lassel research colony from Pelagian sea-nomads.<br><br>RE 213: A larchess tree is planted within the walls of Shimena Keep.<br><br>RE 221: Hearing from former Shimena garrison troops of great riches on this island, Lord Gevran Loritane of Elancia visits aboard his sailing skyship Tinoriel. He discovers great mineral wealth, and magma flows of sufficient temperature to permit the forging of mana-alloy. The enchanters Eosonn and Auriam are crushed by a magma tube cave-in when the land quakes. Without the ability to levitate Tinoriel, the ship returns to Glystenae over sea.<br><br>RE 222: Loritane sends sixteen great ocean-galleons and two skyships to the island, carrying the supplies necessary to build a mining outpost. Lord Loritane and Lady Raina accompany the vessels in Tinoriel.<br><br>The navigation channel into the lagoon is dredged.<br><br>Reservoir dug to collect rainwater. All local water sources tainted with sulphur and ash. An Old Ring, buried under ash and ejecta, is found during the digging. It is left undisturbed, but considered a good omen.<br><br>The island is titled Aerlinthe by Lord Loritane, a name which came to him in a dream. The central volcano is known of old to be called Tenkarrdun, Dericost for "Stoic Blood." The smaller peaks to the northwest and northeast are found to have been named Cunara ("Steaming Heights") and Ernassen ("Land Reflected"), respectively. The lagoon is dubbed Raina's Harbor.<br><br>RE 223: Completion of the light-towers of Weretirae and Eretirae, on either side of the navigation channel.<br><br>RE 225: Tenkarrdun's forges return their first profit. Loritane and Raina return to Elancia. Lady Raina convinces Loritane to appoint master smith Hare Aralea as governor of Aerlinthe.<br><br>RE 230: His Most Dignified and Serene Majesty Emperor Kellin, seventh in the Line of Alaidain, dies. His son Delophon takes the Cerulean Throne, assuming the Imperial Name of Caerlin ("Lord of the Deep Waters").<br><br>RE 274: The Blessing of Aerlinthe. A gromnatross makes her aerie on the peaks of Cunara. She is named Aurlanaa by the people of the port.<br><br>RE 313: Expansion of the foundry; two new forges added.<br><br>RE 317: The outgassing of noxious fumes from Ernassen forces a two-month evacuation to Ireth Lassel.<br><br>RE 323: Battle of Shimena. Twenty Imperial chevairds and forty-four household troops of Loritane perish while holding at bay a raiding force of five hundred Pelagic sea-nomads, embarked in two dozen sailing vessels of war.<br><br>Battle of the Towers. Seeking revenge for the defeat at Shimena, the Pelagian band returns and attacks from the south. Mages under the direction of Aralea ascend the light-towers and pour fire down upon the decks of their ships. The Coral Golems used to keep the navigation channel clear rip the keels from their ships. The southern attack is repulsed, though sunken vessels block the channel for a month. A second landing to the west, near the reservoir, results in the looting and partial razing of the port. Over one hundred die, and many are taken captive by the sea-nomads.<br><br>RE 324: In response to the raids, Emperor Caerlin declares the port of Aerlinthe an Imperial anchorage and treasure port. Four war galleons and seven fast skysloops, for scouting and messenger duty, drop anchor in Raina's Harbor. They bring with them an additional hundred chevairds to garrison the island. Aerlinthe is acknowledged as one of the most important sources of pyreal in the Empire.<br><br>RE 329: The sailing platform-city of the sea-nomads that raided Aerlinthe in 323 is tracked and taken by the Imperial naval force. Most of the Aerlinthe captives are found enslaved in galley oarlocks.<br><br>RE 331: The Eaulinthe ("Star-Stone") is found in the deepest crevasses of Tenkarrdun. This large diamond contains a small amount of liquid magma, kept hot and brightly shining through unknown magical means.<br><br>RE 340: Raina's Harbor boils. A new fumarole opens at the bottom, heating the water to scalding temperatures. The Imperial ships are anchored at Shimena while golems dig a new land outlet for the gasses, then seal the fumarole.<br><br>RE 349: Memorial Stone erected in Shimena Keep, inscribed with the names of all who died in the Pelagic raids of 323.<br><br>RE 371: The forges begin to produce weapons designed by Lord Atlan of Knorr. Lord Loritane takes the finest axe, and has the Eaulinthe fixed upon its blade. With this weapon he joins the northern army at Planae.<br><br>Loritane disappears in the Dericost Marches, along with most of Atlan's army. Lady Raina assumes control of Loritane's house and holdings. Hare Aralea renews his oaths of fealty to the Lady in person, traveling to her castle in Glystenae via fast skyship.<br><br>Lady Raina announces she carries a child of Loritane.<br><br>RE 372: Raina gives birth to a daughter, whom she names Clari.<br><br>RE 388: Nesortania Province overrun by the forces of the Hopeslayer. Lady Raina takes Clari and her household, and flees to the Imperial Archipelago.<br><br>RE 392: The city of Elancia in Glystenae falls under shadow.<br><br>RE 426: Caerlin replaces the galleon Minaera, last of the original Imperial patrol squadron, with the new sailing frigate Reithyis.<br><br>RE 502: Prince Durglen Realaidain, son of the Emperor, announces that he will take the hand of Clari Loritane, Mistress of Aerlinthe, and walk by her side into darkness or dawn.<br><br>RE 507 Prince Durglen joins hands with Mistress Clari in the Iphvircae Cliffs Cathedral.<br><br>RE 567: A large colony of mulardil are discovered in the Naarcaerel Reef by the fisher-woman Julitaen, a poor resident of the harbor tempest floats. She is titled mistress of the mular-pearl harvest by Hare Aralea, and hires all the other residents of the floats.<br><br>RE 886: Ejan Aralae, son of Hare, succeeds his father as master smith and governor of Aerlinthe.<br><br>RE 893: Emperor Caerlin is brushed by Black Madness in battle, and becomes leprous with Ayai Heauviri.*<br><br>(* Translators note: Ayai is Empyrean for "burning." Heauviri, literally means "high-thought-wind." This may be the Yalain equivalent of "soul." Based on context, which suggest disease and decay, I would judge our closest translation of Ayai Heauviri to be "the Soulburn Plague." - Bretslef)<br><br>RE 895: Aurlanaa leaves her aerie on the peak of Cunara. She meets several other gromnatross south of Aerlinthe, and they ascend, disappearing into the heavens. No gromnatross are seen on Auberean for twenty-two years.<br><br>Severe lightning-storms and strange glows come over the southeast waters. The population is evacuated to the west.<br><br>Darkness falls upon the shores of Ireth Lassel. A vast reach of Black Madness and fifteen Thorns accompany the Hopeslayer, his generals, and their army.<br><br>Darkness defeated. The Hopeslayer is entrapped in the mage council's array. The explosive power released destroys the Jailne Lyceum, kills the entire council, and shatters the array into pieces. One piece lands on Aerlinthe, but is recovered before it can dig itself into the ground.<br><br>With the defeat of the Hopeslayer, the Rhethis Eipoth (Era of Lore) is concluded by decree of Emperor Caerlin. The Torethis Eipoth (Second Era of Lore) is declared.<br><br>TE 1: The population returns to Aerlinthe, and the forges are reopened. Raina returns to Elancia.<br><br>Elders from Ithaenc arrive to care for Aurlanaa's abandoned childer.<br><br>Hare Aralea and his wife Malestra return to their homeland of Elancia. Hare becomes one of Lady Raina's counselors.<br><br>TE 2: His Most Dignified and Serene Majesty Emperor Caerlin, eighth in the Line of Alaidain, dies from the Soulburn Plague after six months of insanity. He is 773 years old. His son Caerlin II ascends to the Cerulaean Throne, and Clari, Mistress of Elancia and Aerlinthe, becomes Empress of the Thousand Seas. Raina remains the Dowager Lady of Elancia and Aerlinthe.<br><br>TE 8: The older forges are replaced.<br><br>TE 11: A daughter, Alhallie, is born to Caerlin and Clari. A Festival Year is declared in Elancia and Aerlinthe.<br><br>TE 17: The Return of Grace. The gromnatross come down from the stars. Aurlanaa alights upon her aerie at Cunara. She looks into the eye of Kelderam, a ward of Ithaenc since her early 100's, and considered hopelessly mad. Kelderam is jauniril*, and lapses into unconsciousness. When she awakens, she weeps for a full day, and is afterwards restored in mind and spirit. In her waning years, Kelderam led the Adjanite Order, and was renowned for her wisdom and serenity.<br><br>(*Translator's note: By context, "jauniril" would seem to be a verb. I have never encountered this word before, however, and know not what it means. - Bretslef)<br><br>TE 101: A landquake blocks the navigation channel.<br><br>TE 218: Lady Raina dies in her sleep, at the age of 1013.

She uncovers a small group of undead hiding in the bowels of the reservoir, and destroys them. The chamber in which they performed the deed is sealed. The origin and motives of the undead remain unresolved.<br><br>TE 413: Empress Clari dies in a boating accident at the age of 937. Princess Alhallie becomes Lady of Elancia and Aerlinthe.<br><br>TE 416: Catriae Tamanea's rogue fleet defeats the flotilla at Aerlinthe, and pillages the port. Over twelve million pyreal coins are looted.<br><br>TE 422: Piteous screams are heard from behind the door Inquisitor Alibec sealed in 334. It is forced open, but the room is empty, and the scene of Galaeral's murder remains as it was when the door was erected. Shrieks of pain and incomprehensible, mumbling chants are occasionally heard from the room, leading workers to whisper that the missionary's soul remains in torment at the place of her death.<br><br>TE: 428: Princess Alhallie visits Aerlinthe, while on her tour of the provinces. She gathers research for a planned travelogue.<br><br>TE 450: After the census, Emperor Caerlin announces that Tentael has a population of over one million, most under the age of 400. Aerlinthe's population is less than 100, but nearly 1000 golems work the forges at any time.<br><br>TE 463: Massive collapse of the Tenkarrdun forge tunnels during a landquake. Four workers are crushed, another sixteen trapped and suffocated. The entire lower quarter of the foundry is cut off. Shifting rock makes reopening the tunnels too risky, and Ejan decides to build a new forge works further up the mountain.<br><br>TE 464: The new forges are completed. Due to the distance between them and the magma flows, production is less than half of that before the collapse.<br><br>TE 477: Princess Alhallie joins hands with Lord Cashtal Ronain of Haebrous. Lord Cashtal's last name is changed to Realaidain.<br><br>TE 504: His Most Dignified and Serene Majesty Emperor Caerlin II, ninth in the Line of Alaidain, dies at the age of 1022 years. Alhallie ascends to the Cerulean Throne, and takes the Imperial Name of Cellaurai ("Consecrated by Starlight").<br><br>TE 513: The Great Northern Tempest. Mages hold off the worst of the storm for three days. The Naarcaerel Reef is ripped apart by storm-tides.<br><br>TE 622: A Skytower arrives at Shimena, and is used to patrol the northeast waters.<br><br>TE 664: Isin Aemil, child of Aerlinthe, becomes an admiral of the Imperial fleet.<br><br>TE 761: With the development of practical portal travel by Asheron, Empress Cellaurai declares a new Era has begun. The Torethis Eipoth is concluded, and the Hyrethis Eipoth (Third Era of Lore) begins.<br><br>HE 95: Adept Delacim arrives at Aerlinthe and opens fixed portals to Ithaenc, Haelan, Knorr, Nesortania, Elancia, Jalis, Aribel, Alastinae, Dernehale, Larchess, and the works at Seral Ipharsis and Lamihaar.<br><br>HE 142: Nali Athanas reforms the northern church.<br><br>HE 145: A new temple is built in Aerlinthe.<br><br>HE 232: Empress Cellauri disappears while on a tour of Haebrous, with the ultimate intention of holding a moot with the Nali and other high dignitaries of the reformed northern church at Aventin. The Haebrous report that her party attempted to ascend the peaks of the Venalben Range, where gromnatross are known to reside.<br><br>HE 233: After eighteen months of fruitless searching for Empress Cellauri, Cashtal Realaidain is declared Emperor. He takes the name Kellin II ("Righteous Lord").<br><br>HE 239: The Nali relocates from Aventin to Tentael at the invitation of Emperor Kellin.<br><br>HE 347: Fifty-six people of Aerlinthe answer the call of Nali Valind, and participate in the extirpation of the Adjanite heretics.<br><br>HE 348: The Rejection. Troops returning from Valind's desecration and sack of Ithaenc climb Cunara to seek Aurlanaa's blessing. The gromnatross slays them all on sight, and departs Aerlinthe, never to be seen again.<br><br>HE 459: Severe landquakes cause magma flows in the upper forge tunnels. Smiths remove to the port while golems effect repairs.<br><br>In the wake of the recent attacks on our honored gemstone armor smiths, my colleagues and I have embarked upon extensive investigations into the properties of shadows, crystal beasts, and gems. The weakening by repeated death of our three master smiths, while a terrible tragedy and an ill omen for all Dereth, has actually provided exciting new avenues of inquiry. The fused gems never cease to amaze us with their versatility and mystifying qualities.<br><br>Due to a precipitous loss in their skills, the master smiths are no longer able to invest as much of the fused gems' power in the armor suits they craft. More specifically, the gemstone armor's power, have suffered dramatically. My esteemed colleague Gondo Kanezo has bent his considerable mental prowess to an effort to restore the lost elemental strength. Thanks to my own research in the abstract realm of the armor's abstract qualities, we may have found a solution.<br><br>It all goes back to the legendary work of the Lady Maila, once the head of a great school of learning in the Empyrean civilization. Artifacts and writing point to Lady Maila as a sorceress and enchantress of great power and learning. We know she was part of the mage council that crafted the crystals, means of imprisoning the essence of Bael'Zharon and exiling him from our mortal realm. We also know from more recently unearthed evidence that Lady Maila was instrumental in the creation of the stones used to empower Atlan weapons.<br><br>Far be it from me to criticize a lady of great learning and accomplishment, but it seems that Lady Maila took some of the shortcuts which all of us involved in magical experimentation and creation are wont to use. It seems Lady Maila re-used many of the alchemical and magical techniques she used in the elemental stones' crafting when she and her council decided to craft great crystals to imprison Bael'Zharon. I will not fault the Lady Maila for this method. No doubt her ability to borrow from her previous work simplified the process of creating the crystal array.<br><br>Serendipitously enough, Lady Maila's work of convenience becomes quite a boon to our people, the inheritors of the war against the shadows. As any mage worth his reagents knows, sympathy and resonance is indispensable to proper and effective magical work. The fused gems, one half crystal essence, seem to have an affinity to the resonance of the elemental stones, crafted as they were by the same great mage. One can only hope that we sages and the magicians of Dereth will be able to leave as strong and enduring a legact as the honored Lady Maila.<br><br>This resonance remained undetected for so long because the fused gems sacrificed so much of their power to the strength of the armor. With the inert metal of the armor leeching away less of the gems' essence, the suits themselves become more compatible with the resonance of the greater elemental stones.<br><br>Gondo Kanezo has confirmed that the new suits of armor, while intrinsically less powerful that their previous incarnations, can be imbued with the strength of the elemental stones. The individual stones confer a greater resistance to their associated elements than the original suits of gemstone armor were ever able to provide, though it must be noted that drastic improvement comes at the price of increased vulnerability to the 'opposed' element.<br><br>The effect of the Atlan stones, however, are not solely beneficial. When the armor takes on the elemental properties of the stones, and even becomes physically, it becomes resistant to magical enhancement. Thus the armor becomes immune to the augmentation normally provided by Item magic. The elemental stones need to be removed from the pieces of armor before one is able to enchant them as normal.<br><br>I have yet to divinde the exact reason for the incompatibility of elemental armors and magic. I can only speculate that there are greater magical forces at work, resulting from the intricacies of Lady Maila's craft, than I, a newcomer to this world, am able to fully comprehend. One would hope that in the future, I will be able to solve the mystery of Lady Maila's creation.<br><br>Ben Ten was, they say, among the first of our people to arrive upon this island, in the days when the Olthoi still ran rampant. Some say Ben Ten was the first Sho to arrive. Whether man or woman, we do not even know for sure; we know only that Ben Ten was tall, thin of frame, and wore always a dark hood. Speaking softly, wielding a tachi of a quality that rivals even the mythical swords of the Dragon Temple, Ben Ten walked the land in search of the desperate who needed help. I know this because I was one of those rescued by Ben Ten.<br><br>As a child of only twelve summers, I was torn from my land and brought here, alone. As I wandered the plains, it happened that a pack of what I later learned to be reed sharks came upon me, and I remember fleeing toward an unfamiliar cluster of houses, screaming, sobbing, and knowing the terrible monsters would soon catch me. I saw a shadow come running from a house, and I saw the flash of a sword, but then I tripped and fell. As I lay cowering, I heard snarling and snapping and growling, and then a long silence.<br><br>At last I heard footsteps approach, and a soft voice - a voice neither deep nor high, neither obviously male or female - asked, "Are you all right?"<br><br>I looked up and saw a smiling face shadowed by a hood. When I said that I was unhurt, the person said, "There, in the building with the thatched roof, is a woman who will help you. Tell her that Ben Ten sent you."<br><br>I did not see Ben Ten for many years after that, but, as the years passed, I heard of Ben Ten's other deeds. Others have surely written of them better than I. The only other story I can offer of Ben Ten's bravery is the story of Yanshi, my town, the Town of the Boulder.<br><br>As more and more of us began to arrive in this land called Dereth, drawn by the same mysterious magic, it was quickly decided that our main city should be built at the mouth of the great river and be called Hebian-to. But I and some of my friends settled near the plains where Ben Ten had rescued me, almost within Aluvian territory. We had found a large boulder alone in the middle of a field, standing like a lone sovereign looking out over his land. Knowing we had found a divine symbol of protection and good fortune, we built a few houses around the boulder, and began to farm.<br><br>In those days tumeroks were more plentiful in Osteth, and it was not uncommon for travelers in the far north to report a tumerok attack. In the plains just south of lands held by the legendary Elysa Strathelar, however, we did not fear such creatures. Reed sharks were our main worry, but our simple weapons sufficed against those.<br><br>But one evening, as we settled into rest after a long day in the fields, we heard harsh cries that chilled our blood. A horde of tumeroks had come down from the north, with a vanguard of banderlings and drudge slaves. Somehow they had slipped through the Aluvian lands.<br><br>We hastily dispatched our fastest runner via portal to Hebian-to, to beg for warriors and weapons, and we fled into our houses, barred the doors, and fought the monsters as long as we could with arrows. We managed to kill all the drudges and banderlings, but a tumerok captain and his lieutenants still remained. They burned our houses and pursued us until we stood against the great boulder at the center of town, only our crude spears and swords between us and death. Yet our weapons were no match against the tumeroks' heavy shields and armor.<br><br>I know not how Ben Ten arrived, or how Ben Ten knew to come. I only know that I saw a familiar tall shadow arrive in the middle of the chaos. I saw a fine tachi gleaming in the torchlight, flashing as it cut through tumerok shields and armor and flesh. In silence did Ben Ten strike; in silence Ben Ten whirled, and slashed. I thought I saw Ben Ten's eyes once, beneath the hood; I thought them somehow haunted, yet kind. But perhaps I only dreamed it, for the battle raged fiercely. How could I have seen Ben Ten's face in the chaos of spears and swords and blood?<br><br>But before I fell over from exhaustion and loss of blood, I remember seeing Ben Ten standing upon the boulder, fighting alone against the towering tumerok captain: a scene worthy of any myth or legend, except I know it to be true. I know I did not dream it. It seemed to me that Ben Ten was the boulder itself, the protector of our town, of our people; a sturdy rock in the midst of desolation. I remember wondering if Ben Ten might be the Unicorn of compassion incarnate, or perhaps the Firebird: mayhap Ben Ten was Jojii himself. That is the last that I remember thinking.<br><br>When I awoke, the tumerok captain lay dead, crumpled beside the boulder, and guards from Hebian-to had arrived. While some stayed to tend to the wounded, the rest scoured the land, finishing off the last of the tumeroks who had hidden or fled. The guards had come as fast as they could, I learned, but by the time they had arrived, the tumerok force had already been largely destroyed.<br><br>I discovered that I had lost three of my good friends. This was long before resurrection came into existence, so mine was a permanent and devastating loss. But I am sure I would have lost many more friends - and my life - had Ben Ten not come. And where was Ben Ten? Others had seen Ben Ten fighting, too, but no one knew how Ben Ten had fared at the end. My only clue was the torn hood that I found upon the boulder, and several strands of long black hair still wet with blood.<br><br>I feared the worst, but later I heard rumors that Ben Ten had been seen elsewhere. In Mayoi, I heard, Ben Ten had appeared during the Battle of Confusion. Near Sawato, I heard, Ben Ten had rescued travelers from mosswarts in the swamp. And once, while traveling in Hebian-to, I heard it whispered that someone had seen Ben Ten's tachi, and had recognized it as the legendary magic sword of Koji. Thereafter, I heard new rumors that Ben Ten was actually Koji herself, sent to this new world by Jojii.<br><br>I don't know if any of those stories are true. I only tell of what I have seen. If Ben Ten lives today, surely he - or she - must be advancing in years, as I am now. But if you happen to be lost and in danger in these new lands of the Sho, perchance you might meet Ben Ten too.<br><br>Woe did come to the children of mighty Dericost. The Lords of This World, in their arrogance, were thrown down - Sarvien and his circle slain by the whelps of Yalain and Haebrous. The Kingdom crumbled, the Ice Throne was toppled by victorious barbarians. So did we, whose doom was wrought by the arrival of the Falatacot priestesses six thousand years ere, come to have our presence suffered in our own land.<br><br>Feared by the simple creatures who presumed to rule in our stead, we were forbidden to practice the crafts that had made our Lords mighty. We were turned out from our own ancient fortresses on the fastness of Gelid, and resettled in the rank grasslands of Yalain, among herdsmen as dull as their flocks. We were watched and mistrusted - blamed for everything that did not occur as those ignorant peasants thought should. As if we, the living, had had anything to do with the vile acts of the Lords! As if we had traffic with the Thing Ilservian roused!<br><br>They would hear none of this of course; our blood was that of the royal houses of Dericost, and that was guilt enough in their eyes.<br><br>Doomed by the cold that had driven the Falatacot south, shunned by our conquerors, we sought the blessing of another time of cold. Such things come in cycles. The southern barbarians may have forgotten, but the memory of Dericost was ancient of days. Does not the sun itself turn wan and pale every several millennia?<br><br>We only needed to wait until the next Great Frost, and then our oppressors would burn from wind-whipped ice. If we prepared properly, we should outlast them, and return in glory to high Gelid, which stands mighty over the plains.<br><br>It was foretold by the priestesses that the Fourth Sending would begin in a city of Dericost called Frore, which means "Black Frost." No such city existed during the 6000 years of the Kingdom. So it was decided that we should make for ourselves a city by that name; being blood of the noble houses, our city would be of Dericost.<br><br>Debate raged among the brethren - when should Frore be built, and where? Was it not presumptuous - dangerous - to attempt to fulfill such a prophesy? The prognostications of the Falatacot witches always had hidden barbs.<br><br>As we debated, our oppressors blamed us again for a thing which was not our doing. One of the Old Lords was found in hiding, in the farthest reaches of Haebrous. The Burning Time began, and the sons and daughters of Old Dericost were put to fire and sword for the errors of their grandsires. It was decided that we could endure no more.<br><br>Even as our people were subjected to cruel tortures at the hands of the Yalain, two brave souls exacted our revenge against the Grand Inquisitor, who oversaw the persecutions against us.<br><br>Thus the Burning Time ended, but the barbarians looked at us with renewed fear. Peasants again made the Gesture of Shunning as we walked among them, wrapped with the cool shadows of our robes, and praying only for isolation and deliverance from the ignorant savages.<br><br>It was then decided that we should escape our enforced exile, and begin again in a new place. The Work must begin. But, where should we go? The Council of Three held fierce debate, but in the end Blessed Fenngar's suggestion won favor; Killiakta, Isle of Woe.<br><br>So did we enjoin our meager wealth, and covertly book passage on ships headed to the isle. All at once, we left the squalid cities of the south, and met with sea-captains in hidden coves along the shore. Our convoy, six ships strong, met off the Rock of Sennaj, where the slate-grey sea endlessly beats itself into a useless froth.<br><br>We sailed northwest for uncounted leagues. One cold blue twilight, the Great Light of the Yalain mariners was seen over the horizon. We knew then that we had reached the southeast of Killiakta. As the moons crept up the dew-dappled spider-strands of stars, we ordered the captains to steer north.<br><br>Our convoy rounded the shoulder of Ifistra, taking care to avoid the patrols from the Yalain port at Aerlinthe. Unmolested, we landed on the northern shore, where the peaks of Ifisveraqu meet the sea. It was here that Blessed Ferundi turned to the ship captains, thanked them for a safe journey, and signaled that we should begin.<br><br>As the moons stood a placid watch, the shrieks of sailors drowned out the crush and roar of the surf. Though we had not used them for many years, the arts of the Lords were well known to us in lore. So did we use the crews' blood and ash and bone, entrails and meat, for our conversion. A ghastly business it was, but the Work needed to be done. As the sun's first rays shone through the frigid north shore fog, we fired the charnel-house ships, and watched until they had burned to the waterline. No vessel or man passed as we waited, becoming used to our new forms.<br><br>Once certain no trace would be left of us, we began the trek south, into the mountains. How can we tell of that endless march into wind and snow? It was like coming home. Each gust, curling clouds of fine powder off the ground, cheered us. Truly, this was the next best thing to old, blessed Gelid!<br><br>At the direction of the Council, we began to seek our home. Some, under Blessed Ferundi, explored the peaks to the east, but this proved too close to the Aerlinthe. This party was lucky to escape detection when a party of Yalain's so-called mages suddenly emerged from a shelter at the base of one of the greater peaks. Others, under Blessed Fenngar, trekked west, but the height of the peaks there were found lacking, and the area too easily approached.<br><br>A third group, under Blessed Frisander, searched the mighty peaks of old Velacixque, "Blood-Heart" to the Falatacot. Alas, the covetous Yalain were present in large numbers, forging coins of magical alloy in the depths of the mountain. Turning back north, they were halted by a call.<br><br>There before them stood Lord Rytheran of Menilesh, who had commanded our forefathers before the fall of the Ice Throne. He now amused himself as an academy master for the barbarians, teaching the barest shreds of magic to the dullard children of Yalain.<br><br>"Ho," said he. "Declare yourselves! Be ye Winds from Darkness or Lords of the World?"<br><br>"Neither," spake Blessed Frisander. "We are our own, come from exile in the southlands. We seek only to be left in peace, until we may return to the Plateau of Gelid."<br><br>"You are of our kind," spake Rytheran. "You must declare for one or another, lest ye wish to be seen by both as a threat. I ask again: Winds from Darkness or Lords of the World?"<br><br>"We forsake ye!" cried a formidable young mage, Frisirth by name. "Your games are your own, and we want none of it. For millennia you have played here, ignoring the suffering of your kin as you scheme. Get away now, or ye shall be blistered by all the power of our arts!"<br><br>Rytheran's face darkened, and he turned to his retainers. Before he could speak a word, however, Frisirth loosed a powerful blow against him, nearly destroying the Old Lord where he stood. At this, Rytheran's retainers charged the group, while he himself cast one of Facill's plane-slant spells, and retreated back into his lair. The retainers were weak, and Blessed Frisander's group quickly drained the life from them.<br><br>The Council met again in the northern reaches of the Ifisveraqu shortly after, and agreed that we would need to build in that area to be safe from enemies old and new. So, on a small, windy peak overlooking green valleys, we moved underground. Natural caves were expanded and restructured, and, at long last, construction of Great Frore began.<br><br>4th of Frostfell, 13th Year of Exile<br><br>Today a most curious thing occured. Asjan and I were discussing worker productivity when there was a soft knock at the door. Upon opening it, a violet cloaked figure wearing a mask floated - floated! - in the air before us. Asjan gasped and froze. I asked the creature if I could help it, reasoning that since it knocked politely, in our fashion, it must have intellect. The Thing introduced itself as "Lord Sarvaen", a noble of Arwic, and offered me a business proposition. I asked what it had in mind.<br><br>"Sarvaen" floated in the room, the ragged trailings of its cloak fluttering, and explained that it had need for the unique crystals I had discovered in the mountains. Its voice was... Ah, but I lack the words. Deep it was, and oddly cadenced. It was beyond question not a man's voice and sounded as if it came through a tunnel, or from the grave. Straight-faced, I asked what it offered in turn. At this, one violet-draped "arm" rose and placed a gem upon the table. I did not see its hand for the folds of the cloak.<br><br>It was a ruby; large, flawless, and more finely cut than any stone I have ever seen. I have not the words to do justice to this amazing artifact.<br><br>Exchanging raw crystal of undetermined worth for such incredible craftmanship seemed like a sound decision, so I offered to draw up a contract. "Sarvaen's" cloak rippled, as if a swarm of insects were beating against the interior, and it said that true men preferred to do business without records.<br><br>At this, Asjan's nerve snapped, and he ran through the room shrieking hysterically. The Thing turned to mark his passage, and I believe I saw a flash of violet-blue light from behind the corner of its bizarre mask.<br><br>The deal, fortunately, was quickly agreed upon, and "Servaen" left a small pile of jewels behind, as a token of its good faith. I calculate their worth to be in excess of 100,000 Pyreal.<br><br>I do not trust this Thing by any account. But one cannot argue with the profit - which is, after all, why I am in this hellish place!<br><br>7th Frostfell<br><br>Asjan has disappeared. A badly written note, supposedly from him, was found, saying that he went home to Qalaba'r. I know the Thing did it. It still believes that I believe it is a man, and it must remain so improbably ignorant.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The second half of this journal is found on Lord Cambarth in Mount Lethe.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>22nd of Seedsow, 15th Year of Exile<br><br>The deal with Sarvaen continues to be most profitable. Today I received three chests of his peerlessly wrought sapphires. Best of all, he remains ignorant of the Pool's existence. What a sending of the Hope Bringer! Money from Saervaen, money from the desperate who hear of the Pool's remarkable ability. Brelax, that impossible idiot, blithely said to Sarvaen today that, "it does not matter that we have never seen your face." Cursed Fool! I beat him soundly.<br><br>Brelax and I today finished work on our Lord's Altar. Such a beauteous thing! After so long hidden away in that lost crypt we found, the words of the Hope Bringer are once again worshipped openly, in the places where men walk. Most of the guards have joined us in celebration. The miners must remain ignorant, for now. They work hard, but I would not trust them all with this freedom, this new-found feeling of strength and vulnerability.<br><br>Blast. Again, the mountain quakes. It has been doing so since Sarvaen left this afternoon. I hope it does not interfere with our next delivery.<br><br>So who is this, that wishes to write down my tale of the dark days of when we were enslaved to the Olthoi? A historian? To make sure none of it is lost? A noble goal, though I should hope that, with only twenty years' history, there isn't much to lose yet. All right, then, I will speak slowly. You take care to write what I say without error. See that you miss nothing.<br><br>My first memory is of stirring the pots. Big, stone-like vats that came up to my chin at the time. Soup pots, my mother called them, and it took me years of normal village life to come to think of simmering meat and vegetables as soup, instead of those grey-green vats of liquid stench. At least, I am told the soup pots smelled horrible. I myself cannot smell very well; I grew up in the midst of too much that smelled of Olthoi. Even now I can scarce tell you whether a fire burns nearby, or if the bread is scorched; neither can I smell the fields in flower.<br><br>So, then, soup pots were those containers of gruel that Olthoi would take to their grubs; the grubs, which we called white worms, would bathe in and consume it. I am sure you have heard this from other old-timers already. I didn't actually see very much of this, but I was told about it by braver and older souls who had managed to snatch quick glimpses.<br><br>I grew up stirring soup pots with rounded long stirring sticks. You see, if you left the gruel sit too long, it would grow a thick skin on top, which would not dissolve again. And if you left it far too long, it would grow fuzzy and turn strange colors - or so they said. So you had to watch carefully and stir often. For while the Olthoi tolerated some laziness, any failures were met with instant reprisal.<br><br>I remember seeing a woman who had fallen asleep beside her soup pot; something in the brew must have alerted the Olthoi, for they came swarming in with their claws swinging, and all I remember from there is a lot of blood. Such scenes were common, especially since we were so often exhausted.<br><br>Yes, the Olthoi had no reason to treat us well, for many of us were still arriving into this world. We were an endless supply of labor for them. Some have questioned us, saying we could not have done so much work for a creature that cannot speak to us or order us about. Yet, I tell you, we learned. And once a few of us had learned what to do to please our masters, we quickly taught it to the newcomers, lest they be killed immediately.<br><br>Of course, many newcomers still tried to fight, and they met a quick and bloody end. And any bodies were added to the soup pots. The only fortunate thing amidst all of this is that the Olthoi had no taste for fresh meat itself, despite rumors to the contrary. Thus we were spared becoming like cattle. Instead, we were slaves. Thus we were like men enslaved by monstrous ants. You have probably heard that before, too. The irony is apparently worse for those who remember our homelands clearly. My mother, after her freeing, could no longer abide the sight of ants.<br><br>She delighted to step on them, especially the big black ones, to spread their innards across the ground and to watch their legs and mandibles twitch helplessly and grow slowly more feeble.<br><br>Oh, of course you would wish to know about how we were freed. I must have been about five when Elysa Strathelar and Thorsten Cragstone finally brought us freedom. There had been rumors of a revolt for some time; I remember the adults murmuring about it amongst themselves. Oh yes, we could talk; it was a blessing that the Olthoi could not understand human speech, and did nothing to stop it unless it grew too loud.<br><br>But anyway, despite the rumors, news from outside was hard to come by, and the revolt itself must have taken many by surprise. I clearly recall the cheers and the screams when first the fighting reached us, when we first saw the fallen corpses of Olthoi and men together. I remember a woman's voice shouting above the battle, exhorting the able-bodied to take up whatever weapons we could find and to stand against the Olthoi masters. I think it was the voice of Elysa Strathelar herself.<br><br>And I also remember how there were some men and women dressed in gleaming armor, and wielding blades that glowed with magic. Whence those came from, I myself do not know, but I am sure you have heard rumors enough about that.<br><br>My mother immediately joined the revolt. She snatched up a dagger from a fallen man and tied it to her stirring stick. I followed her through some long corridors until we came to a vast lake of gruel - or so it seemed to me - and I remember how she slit open every white worm she could reach, piercing them through and shredding them apart while she laughed and cried at the same time. Then she left me in the care of an older child, and she went running after the others.<br><br>She later told me that she reached the deepest chamber of the Olthoi nest, where Elysa Strathelar and Thorsten Cragstone battled the giant Queen of the Olthoi. I have wished many times since that I could have seen that battle, but I do know I am glad I did not see the terrible and final blow that struck Thorsten Cragstone. That I am glad to have missed, and I wish it had never happened. But I did hear they fought valiantly, to make High King Pwyll himself proud.<br><br>Rhethis Eipoth 371<br><br>To Maila, Mistress of the Lyceum of Knorr<br><br>We fear that unpleasant news provokes Us to send thee this missive, Lady.<br><br>As thee know, We were compelled to send forth thy husband, the honored Lord Atlan of Knorr, to Our mainland realms of Nesortania and Glystaene, there to deal with certain disturbing events which vex Our citizens in the north. We have been receiving regular reports from the field, as We are aware that thee have been receiving reports of a more personal nature. These dispatches ceased without explanation four weeks ago.<br><br>This very morning We did entertain at Our court a young woman in shocking condition, who bore Us troubling news. This girl was known to Us as Ihdare Kelderam, squire to thy Lord Atlan. She was bloodied and soiled, and nearly mad with a dark fear which seemed to possess her entirely. She did come before Our august throne atremble, there to tell a tale which We would think unbelievable, were it not for the reports which brought thy husband to the north.<br><br>She did say that on the fifty-second day of the march, Lord Atlan's army entered the Valley of Tresimaen, in the former lands of Dericost. Upon ascending the heights, a most notable phenomenon was witnessed by the assembled host. The entire valley floor, from the town of Cannthalo in the northeast to the peak of Zemal in the southwest, was enfolded in a darkness most unnatural. Though the sun shone but slightly past its apex, Tresimaen seemed to cup shadow as if it were water.<br><br>Only a few tall trees could be seen rising clear of the pitch, from which angry whispers seemed to issue forth. At this spectacle, the host became unnerved. Atlan bade the army march back out of the valley, to make camp on the plain below. There he set a strong watch and lit bonfires.<br><br>Squire Kelderam's tale became disjointed at this point, We regret to say. As the night progressed, she claims the moons and stars faded and went out. By the time Alb'arel was to have risen, the watchfires on the northern perimeter began to struggle and die, as if damped by an unseen hand. He claims that insubstantial patches of darkness, like black fog, flowed through the camp. The woman described it to Us as "a mist which ate light."<br><br>Bleak laughter and whispering could be heard from all quarters. Atlan roused the chevairds and soldiers of the army at once, with cries that they were besieged. Yet, no enemy could be seen.<br><br>Kelderam then tells Us that the black mist did coalesce before Lord Atlan. The torso of a man, trailing off into insubstantiality at the waist, formed. A cluster of smaller forms, solid and giggling like mad children, stepped out of the roiling darkness behind it. These appeared as full-bodied boys and girls. The large being did point to Atlan, and say something in a language Kelderam did not recognize. Thereupon the small forms rushed to attack thy husband with fists and feet, and the Lord was obliged to defend himself with the sword Rez'arel.<br><br>The squire saith that Atlan smote all sent against him, as the army was cut down around him. Screams were heard, and men and women disappeared in scores, nought to be seen again. Only Atlan held fast, the fiery light of Rez'arel holding the shadows at bay. Kelderam stayed by thy Lord's side for some time, I gather, until a hoarse roar was heard in the unnatural dark.<br><br>At this the girl broke down entirely at Our feet, and could only scream of a black winged form, whose horrible eyes drove her to flee in terror. Lady Maila, We are saddened to admit that Lord Atlan's fate seems bleak.<br><br>There is a darkness in this girl's mind, Lady. It is not within the power of a sovereign to order it out. Therefore, We have commended her to the care of the Elders of the great cathedral on far Ithaenc. We have sent lone riders north to investigate further, in the hope that one or two may evade notice where a legion did not.<br><br>We know of but one survivor of almost twenty thousands. This is an unnatural magic, of a sort not seen since Our ancestors resisted the vile intentions of old Dericost. Our entire northern army has disappeared into the night. This distresses Us mightily. Rest assured We will do all in Our power to avenge the loss of Atlan, who was Our friend, cousin, and most trusted captain.<br><br>As ever, We remain at your disposal. If We may be of any comfort to thy Ladyship, do not hesitate to seek Us.<br><br>Yours in sympathy,<br><br>Caerlin, Emperor of Yalain</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>able to stand me playing games alll nit long!!!!!!<br><br>------------------<br>Shakespeare's life<br>Shakespeare's plays are read and performed all over the world. Yet they were written by an ordinary Englishman almost four hundred years ago. Ben Johnson, a fellow writer of Shakespeare, said that he was not for any one century, but for all time. One might add that he was for all places and all races.<br>We do not know many firm facts about most ordinary people of William Shakespeare's time, but we do know quite a lot about him. Several documents, or papers, about him survive. They include baptismal and burial records, business and theatre papers, and his Will. We also know a great deal about life in the sixteenth century. From all this we can build up a picture of Shakespeare's life.<br>Shakespeare was born about the 23rd April 1564, in the family home at Henley Street, in Stratford-upon-Avon, a small town in England about 100 km from London, the capital city. He was christened on that day in Holy Trinity church in Stratford. He was the third of the eight children, four boys and four girls, of John and Mary Shakespeare.<br>John's father, Richard, had been a farmer in a village a few miles from Stratford. John, like others of his generation, rejected the farming life in favour of learning a profitable trade. He became a glove-maker in Stratford, which was quickly becoming bigger and richer.<br>Stratford was a flourishing market town of about 1400 people, with many trades, the chief of which was brewing beer. It had regular trading fairs and markets, and many travellers passed through it. John Shakespeare made many other leather goods besides gloves. He became rich and rose rapidly to positions of importance in the town, becoming bailiff (i.e. mayor) in 1569. Shakespeare's mother, Mary Arden, was from a rich and ancient landowning family, so John had made more than one step in the world.<br>John Shakespeare's son, William, almost certainly attended the local grammar shool, the King's New School. Girls received little education. They had some training at home in needlework, singing and other skills, but boys of prosperous families started school at the age of four or five. A great deal of time was spent studying the 1-atin language. '1'he school day was a demanding one. It started at six in the morning and went on with little break until five in the afternoon.<br>William Shakespeare probably left school at the age of fifteen or sixteen. He then probably became an apprentice or trainee in his father's shop.<br>At the age of eighteen he married Anne Hathaway, the daughter of a neighbouring farmer, who was seven or eight years older than him. Anne gave birth to their first child, Susanna, about six months later. 1,ess than two years after that, in February 1585, the twins, Hamnet (who died at eleven) and Judith (who lived to seventy-seven) were born.<br>Almost nothing is known about Shakespeare's life between 1585 and the early 1590s, though there are many legends. For example, it is said that he stole deer from a rich man's estate and had to escape to London to avoid being prosecuted. Some people believe that he worked as a schoolmaster, a lawyer's clerk, a soldier, a printer or a seaman. We shall probably never know.<br>We know for certain that at some point in these years he went to London, and eventually became an actor and playwright. (The 'Wright' in 'playwright' has nothing to do with writing, but means a 'craftsman' or 'maker', as in 'shipwright', or 'wheelwright'.)<br>By 1594 Shakespeare was one of a group of actors called the Lord Chamberlain's Men. There were several such groups, each depending on a patron, a rich man who supported them with gifts of money. The best groups soon be- came profitable enough for the actors to grow rich, as Shakespeare himself did. By 1598 he was famous for writing tragedy, comedy and history plays, and also poetry.<br>In 1597 he was rich enough to buy New Place, the second largest house in Stratford, and in the 1600s he bought several more pieces of land around the town. He stayed with the Lord Chamberlain's Men, who were renamed the Kin's Men when James 1 became King in 1603, until he retired from the stage. He did little writing after 1610 and none, as far as we know, after 1613. He spent his last years in Stratford, only occasionally visiting London. He concerned himself with his business affairs, over which he was extremely careful. He remained a countryman, although he was a man of wide experience in the larger world of town and city. His plays reflect both town and country life.<br>In his will he remembered his family, his old friends from the theatre, and some ordinary people of his native town. He died on 23rd April 1616, and was buried two years later in the church in which, fifty-two years earlier, he had been christened.<br><br>Shakespeare's England<br>The England that Shakespeare knew was very different from the modem industrialised country it is today.<br><br>The countryside<br>Most people lived in small towns or villages, and the great majority were farmers. They kept sheep, chickens and cattle, and grew fruit, vegetables, wheat, oats and barley. They used horses for pulling ploughs and carts. Many farmers, like William Shakespeare's grandfather, Richard, were tenant farmers (that is, they rented land from rich landowners). Far larger areas than today were forest or marshes, and were not used for agriculture or housing.<br>Most rural people stayed in the same village throughout their whole lives. Transport was very difficult, as there were, of course, no buses, trains or cars, and roads were few and extremely bad. Ale main ways of travelling were on horseback, by horse-drawn carriage, or by boat along rivers and along the coast.<br>Houses were usually one or two storeys high, built of brick or of wood and mud, with thatched or tiled roofs, like Anne 1-lathaway's cottage. Rich people, however, lived in far bigger houses, and some in huge and beautiful palaces with hundreds of rooms. There were also many beautiful churches.<br><br>The towns<br>Towns were far smaller than they are today, and there were no big industries as we know them. People carried on many different trades and crafts, working at home or in small workshops. Clothmaking, leatherwork (such as Richard Shakespeare was engaged in), pottery, carpentry, baking, brewing, preparing meat, working in iron and steel, gold and silver, were examples of trades carried on in towns and villages. A great deal of very beautiful and skilled work was carried on in architecture, wood-carving, plasterwork for walls and ceilings, painting, embroidery and jewellery.<br><br>London<br>London was the capital city, then as now, but it had many fewer people than nowadays. It was a rich city that traded with many countries. It was also crowded, dangerous and dirty. There were many beautiful buildings, but there was no clean water supply or proper sanitation. Sewage ran into the river Thames. Rich people used to carry bunches of flowers or spiced oranges close to their noses when they walked in the streets because the smell was so bad. Not surprisingly, there were many outbreaks of the plague and other diseases. Most houses were built of wood and were crammed close together. In 1666, fifty years after Shakespeare died, most of London was burnt down in the famous 'Great Fire'.<br><br>The social system<br>There was a great difference between the way ordinary people and the rich and powerful ones lived. Rich landowners could keep hundreds of craftsmen working for them, as well as hundreds of permanent servants. Some- times they also supported drama or music and became 'patrons' to a group of actors or musicians, paying them for their work. The Earl of Southampton was Shakespeare's patron. At the head of all these rich and powerful people was the Queen, Elizabeth I. From Whitehall in London, she and her chief ministers ruled the country.<br>Queen Elizabeth I ruled England from 1558 to 1603. Her position was very "rent from that of the present Queen, Elizabeth II. She had more power than a modern-day President or Prime Minister: she often disagreed with Parliament, and could order the imprisonment or death of anyone, even an important minister or landowner.<br>Like other rich people of the day, Elizabeth I was a great patroness of poetry, drama, music and all the crafts. She loved beautiful clothes and had thousands of highly decorated dresses stored in her various palaces.<br>Elizabeth, and her successor James I, who ruled from 1603 to 1625, were, like all the kings and queens before them, different in one very important way from most modern Presidents or Prime Ministers. People believed that they were the representatives of God, and had a divine, or God-given, right to rule, which put them above everyone else in the country. People believed strongly that everyone had a fixed position in life. Anyone, for example, who opposed a king, as Macbeth does when he kills King Duncan, is breaking the proper order of things. Just as all parts of the body should obey the head, so the wife should obey the husband, and the subject the Queen (or King). Highest of all was God, whom everyone had to obey.<br>Everyone at any level of society was very likely to remain there: a farmer's son was likely to remain a farmer, and, unlike today, could not easily rise to a position of power through education. William Shakespeare's father, John, was an example of a farmer's son who was quite successful in his own town, but most really important people of Shakespeare's day were from a few powerful old families.<br>Shakespeare's plays reflect the big differences between the classes of people. His heroes and heroines are usually kings, queens or other aristocrats - rich and powerful people. Often such people came to watch his plays so they were, of course, interested. Even the ordinary men and women in the audience usually expected to see plays about exceptional or famous people, not about ordinary people like themselves. Shakespeare's plays are mostly written in poetry, but his poor people and servants usually speak in prose (that is, ordinary, non-poetic language). Most of the humorous scenes in Shakespeare deal with ordinary people rather than aristocrats, so that we laugh at 'lower-class' people more often than at 'upper-class' ones.<br><br>Religion<br>England had been Catholic until the middle of the sixteenth century when Henry VII quarrelled with the Pope and broke away from the Church of Rome. Elizabeth 1 enforced Protestant Christianity by law. Those not attending church regularly were punished. Catholics were increasingly oppressed.<br>For the first time, the Bible was widely available in English, and the large numbers of illiterate people could at least hear it read. Shakespeare's work uses the rhythms and images of the Bible, though he does not often mention characters or stories by name.<br><br>The Renaissance<br>The Renaissance (rebirth of learning) began in Italy in the fourteenth century and spread throughout Europe. There was new interest in the ancient Greek and Roman classics, and also new forms of art, architecture, music and literature. It was a period of change, questioning and vitality. People no longer believed everything they were told, but tried to find things out for themselves. Shakespeare's plays are part of this 'rebirth'.<br><br>Poetry and drama<br>In England it was above all an age of great poetry and drama. Besides Shakespeare himself, there were Spenser, Sidney, Marlowe, Chapmen, Johnson, and many other important writers. The drama especially flowered as never be- fore in England. Elizabethan music is also still performed and enjoyed in many places today.<br><br>Science, magic and medicine<br>Scientific and medical knowledge was progressing very fast in Shakespeare's day, but there was still a great deal of ignorance. People knew very little about health care, and did not understand that dirt breeds disease. William Shakespeare was one of eight children, but three of them died in childhood. Only he and one sister lived to over fifty. This was typical for that period. 'Apothecaries', or chemists, like the one in Romeo and Juliet, knew a lot about medicinal herbs, but there were many mistaken beliefs. People believed that a sick person could be cured by having the bad blood taken out of him: leeches, which look rather like small worms, were put on sick people's skin to suck out the 'bad blood'. People often died of the medicine they were given rather than of the disease!<br>People thought that everything was made up of four 'elements', Air, Water, Earth and Fire. In the human body there were four liquids, the 'humours', which corresponded to the elements and affected a person's behaviour. These were melancholy (bitter black bile from the liver) which made one sad; blood, which made one courageous; choler (bitter yellow bile from the liver) which made one angry; and phlegm (the mucous from one's nose, etc) which made one quiet and calm.<br>The ideal person was supposed to be a good mixture between the humours or elements. For example, in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, (Act Five, scene 5), Brutus is described as having 'The elements/So mixed in him, that nature might stand up/And say to all the world, this was a man.'<br>Many people believed in witches, who co-operated with the devil and could harm others by their strange prayers and medicines; they could see into the future, like the three witches in Macbeth. Many harmless people, especially weak-minded old women, were accused of being witches, and were burnt to death.<br><br>Astrology and astronomy<br>Many people believed in astrology, a study of the stars and planets which, they thought, affected people's lives. The sun, the planets and some of the stars seem to move through the twelve groups of stars we call the Zodiac. Ale position of these stars when a person is born is supposed to affect his character and the events of his life. For example, the unlucky Romeo and Juliet are called 'star-crossed lovers'. Because the stars were in a certain unfavourable position, Romeo and Juliet had to die. In other words, people cannot control their own lives, but are controlled by the stars. '1'he horoscopes, or star signs, in today's newspapers and magazines are based on a belief in astrology.<br>Until the late seventeenth century, people thought that the earth was the centre of the universe, with moon, sun and stars revolving around it. Shakespeare probably believed this. Astronomy, the science of studying the planets and stars, was progressing very fast but, as late as 1616, the Italian astronomer Galileo got into trouble with the Catholic Church for supporting the view that the earth went round the sun.<br><br>Exploration<br>In general, however, people in Western Europe were finding out more and more about the world. Explorers sailed to Africa, Asia and America in their small (by our standards) wooden sailing boats, bringing back information and riches to their countries. Scientists were looking at the sky through the telescope (which was invented in 160<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, and performing many experiments to find out about the body, about medicine, and about the world around them.<br><br>Elizabethan drama<br>Today's theatres are comfortable buildings with seats for all the audience, and powerful electric lighting to illuminate the actors performing on stage. Often there is complicated scenery made of wood or cloth, representing walls, trees and so on, to give the impression of indoor or outdoor scenes.<br>In Shakespeare's day, theatres were Very different. The central part had no roof. As there was no electricity to light the theatres they had to depend on sun- light. The central, open-air part contained the stage and a yard. Many of the audience stood in the yard in front of the stage. The stage was raised so that everyone could see. Those who could pay higher prices sat on seats arranged in two or three storeys in a rough circle around the yard, rather as in a very small football stadium. Sometimes they even sat on the stage! The top storey of seats had a roof, and there was also an extra storey, the 'heavens', above the back of the stage, which contained machinery (for example, for lowering and lifting actors playing gods). At the back of the stage were large double doors or curtains leading to a dressing room for the actors. The space behind was also used for some inside scenes, for example, Juliet's tomb in Romeo and Juliet. Actors also went in and out (entered and exited) through these doors. There were trapdoors going down through the stage, for use as tombs, prisons or even hell. Unlike today's theatres, there was no scenery, so actors in Shakespeare's time could move very freely. Costumes were often rich and impressive, but not historically accurate. For example, the Romans in Julius Caesar would have been dressed more or less as Elizabethan gentlemen. Without costumes or scenery, plays had to rely on words to show the audience where and when the story was taking place. For example, in Romeo and Juliet, the play opens with lines which 'set the scene':<br><br>'Two households, both alike in dignity In fair Verona, where we lay our scene ...<br>(Act One, scene 1)<br><br>The audience had to use their imaginations far more than we do in the cinema or theatre today, and especially in one matter: there were no actresses! The theatre was not considered a respectable place for women to work, so all the women's parts were taken by young boys whose voices had not yet broken.<br><br>The origins of western European theatre<br>The western European tradition of theatre began in Greece in the fifth century BC. Tragedies and comedies were performed in huge open-air theatres for thousands of people. The tragedies usually dealt with traditional heroes of the past and with the gods.<br>The tradition of Greek theatre continued into Roman times, and famous Latin plays were written until about the first century AD. These Greek and Latin plays continued to be read, first in the original languages, and later in translation. Shakespeare would have known many of their stories and characters. Theseus and Hippolyta, Pyramus and Thisbe in A Midsummer Night's Dream, Hecuba and Helen, Acneas and Dido in Hamlet, for example, are all characters from Latin and Greek poetry and drama. Juno, Jupiter, Mars and Venus are some of the many gods that the Greeks and Romans believed in before the introduction of Christianity. These gods are often mentioned in Shakespeare's plays.<br>There was another tradition of drama in Western Europe. 'Mystery' plays based on Bible stories were performed on religious holidays in churches and market places. These were lively, often exciting and humorous plays, and they may well have helped to fire Shakespeare's imagination and point him towards his career as a playwright. Shakespeare, and the other playwrights of his time, also took stories from English and European history, and from novels, poems and plays by earlier writers.<br>In the sixteenth century, plays were first performed in the yards of inns (hotels) with a stage set up against a wall. Groups of actors used to travel round the country performing plays in inns and the houses of rich people.<br>The first building specially designed as a theatre was opened in London in 1576. The Globe Theatre was opened in 1599. Shakespeare's plays were performed here and in other London theatres such as the Swan and the Blackfriars Theatre.<br><br>MACBETH<br>Historical and theatrical background<br>Macbeth was written early in 1606, and the earliest recorded performance was in 1611 at the Globe Theatre, London. It is likely, however, that the play had been performed earlier than this.<br>It is one of the shortest of Shakespeare's plays. From the nineteenth century onwards, Macbeth has often been performed by companies as a special attraction when business was going badly. This is one of the reasons why actors consider it bad luck to quote from the play, or to mention it by name, especially inside the theatre - they always refer to it as 'the Scottish play'!<br>Shakespeare took the story from the Chronicles (1577), a history written mainly by Raphael Holinshed and known by his name, 'Holinshed'. He in turn had taken the story from the work of a Scottish historian called Hector Boyce, writing about fifty years earlier. Though Shakespeare develops the story in his own way, and invents a good deal, the central characters and events were closely based on actual history. King James I of England (who was also King James VI of Scotland), for example, was proud to count both Banquo and King Duncan among his ancestors.<br>The central theme of the play is the destruction caused when an ambitious man usurps power and undermines social and political order. In the process, moral and spiritual order are also seriously attacked, but in the end order is restored under a wise, strong and legitimate king. It is likely that Shakespeare wrote the play partly as a compliment to King James and as a celebration of that ordered rule which had very nearly been destroyed by the Gunpowder Plot.<br>Two difficulties which modem audiences sometimes have with this play concern the witches and the ghosts or apparitions, and these need some comment. In the case of the ghost of Banquo and the apparitions apparently conjured up by the witches, our difficulty need not be so great - if we do not believe in ghosts or visions, we can respond to these things as if they were hallucinations or delusions on Macbeth's part, caused by a guilty conscience or a vivid imagination. There are, however, people in the West who do believe in such phenomena, or who think that there might possibly be such things.<br>As far as witches are concerned, the position is more complicated. Belief in witchcraft is widely distributed in human society, past and present. Records of such beliefs go back to probably the prehistoric period, though some people (e.g. the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert) do not have a belief in witch- craft. Generally witches are thought to be strange, abnormal people who use what they believe to be supernatural means in order to achieve some harmful, evil ends. Some societies, however, recognise 'white' witchcraft, the use of such powers for beneficial aims such as curing the sick. Witches are often blamed as the cause of things going wrong - e.g. for illnesses or untimely deaths, or the failure of crops.<br>Some people in Shakespeare's time thought that the beliefs about witches were simply superstitions. Others, like King James I himself, at first doubted but later appeared to be convinced that witches did have extraordinary and evil powers. He was very interested in the subject and wrote a book on it called Demonology (1597; Published in England 1603). Most people in those days, however, did believe in the evil power of witches, who were thought to be earthly representatives of the Prince of Evil. An Act of Parliament of 1604 made the practice of witchcraft an offence punishable by death. The campaign against witches was waged relentlessly, by Catholics and by Protestants, for centuries. It was not until the more secular philosophy of the modem world began to emerge from the late seventeenth century onwards that the European witch-craze died down. Many innocent women must have been killed over the centuries, however. There are still reports of traditional witchcraft practices and beliefs in Western societies in recent years.<br>Whatever we think of witchcraft, one thing is clear about Macbeth: Shakespeare does not put the blame for what happens on the witches. They have a keen interest and delight in encouraging human evil, but Shakespeare shows that evil is really in certain human beings themselves. Supernatural powers and their human agents can encourage this human evil to flourish, but they do not create it. The witches foretell the future - Macbeth, briefly, makes it.<br><br>Language and structure<br>Shakespeare telescopes the events of the play into what seems a short space of time, and the play has a very tight structure. We see Macbeth at the beginning and end of the play as a soldier - at the beginning he is a hero, loyal to the rightful king, and part of a system of order. At the end, however, he is a hated tyrant who has killed the rightful king, dispossessed his heir, killed others who would be in his way, and reduced the ordered kingdom to terror and anarchy. He is also, at the end, no longer part of a coherent society, but instead he is alone.<br>The first movement of the play is triggered by the prophecies of the witches - that Macbeth will be Thane of Glamis (as he is), Thane of Cawdor, and king hereafter, and that Banquo, though not becoming king himself, will be father to a line of longs. The prophecies add to what Macbeth has evidently already been thinking and help to impel him to the various actions of killing the king and having Banquo murdered. The second meeting with the witches also contains three prophecies - that Macbeth is to beware Macduff; that he should not fear anyone born of woman; and that he would be safe until Birnam Wood moves to Dunsinane. His reactions to the second set of prophecies lead to his downfall and death.<br>The witch scenes are therefore important in relating the two movements of the play, but the turning point of the plot is the banquet scene. Macbeth here briefly is able to act the part of king. The murder of Banquo should have made him secure, but ironically it is this which leads him to give himself away. Though Macbeth is able to gain control of himself eventually, it is too late, and though Lady Macbeth is still strong and determined, it is for the last time. There can be no looking back for him, and he determines that he has no choice but to go on killing.<br>It has been said that the play has some of the symbolic force of a morality play, and this is true. Yet the characters are not personifications of abstract virtues or vices, but living human beings, and sometimes very complex ones. Instead the symbolic force springs from the formal structure - what we have is a tight pattern of cause and effect, with every action leading to consequences which in turn have further results. The structure gives a sense of inevitability to the play, with nothing irrelevant and yet everything seeming natural in its place. Everything springs from the character of Macbeth himself and its impact, in action, upon those around him. The short scenes which occur from time to time, e.g. between Ross and the Old Man, or between the doctor and the gentlewoman, serve as a commentary on what has been happening, and enable us to see the events as part of a universal context.<br>The language of the play is particularly memorable for several related groups of images which powerfully help to achieve the presentation of the themes of the play. Especially noticeable are the following: images of clothing, particularly pointing to the difference between external appearance and the reality beneath, and sometimes implying that the clothes are too big for the wearer; images of bloodshed, and the attempts to wash away blood; images of sleep and sleeplessness; images of food and of banquets; images of disorder in the worlds of animals; images of health and disease.<br><br>The themes<br>The major themes of Macbeth are as follows: the sanctity of rightful kingship; the destructive nature of usurpation; the inwardly as well as outwardly destructive nature of evil (i.e. that it destroys the evildoer as well as his victims); the correspondence between order and disorder in the state, in nature, and in individuals; the justifiable killing of the usurper.<br><br>Summary of the plot<br>Macbeth and Banquo are generals in the army of Duncan, King of Scotland. They have just defeated an army of Norwegian invaders and Scottish rebels. They meet three witches, who greet Macbeth as Thane of Cawdor and 'king hereafter'. The witches tell Banquo that although he will not be king himself, he will be the father of many kings. The witches vanish, and news comes that Duncan has made Macbeth Thane of Cawdor, in place of the former Thane, who has proved to be a traitor.<br>Macbeth writes to tell Lady Macbeth of his adventures and the witches' prophecies about his future, and about the new title Duncan has given him. She starts to plan Duncan's death.<br>Duncan decides to spend the night at Macbeth's castle. Macbeth's own ambition, and the fact that the witches' prophecy came true, lead him to give in to his wife's persuasion and to kill the sleeping king. The king's sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, are suspected, and run away, and Macbeth is crowned king.<br>Macbeth determines to defeat the witches' prophecy concerning Banquo's children. He therefore tries to have Banquo and his son Fleance killed while they are out riding, but Fleance escapes.<br>The ghost of the murdered Banquo appears at Macbeth's banquet to haunt him, and he decides to consult the witches again. They tell him to beware of Macduff, Thane of Fife; that no one born of woman can harm him; and that he will never be defeated until Birnam Forest moves to Dunsinane. He therefore believes that fate is on his side. On learning that Macduff has gone to England, to raise an army to come back and fight him, Macbeth kills Lady Macduff and her children. Lady Macbeth goes mad and dies, and Macbeth is alone. The attacking army led by Malcolm and Macduff cut branches from the trees in Birnam Wood and use them as camouflage as they walk to Dunsinane - so that it looks as though the wood itself is moving, as the prophecy foretold. Macbeth goes to fight Macduff, who reveals that he was not born in the normal way but by Caesarean section (i.e. 'untimely ripped' from the womb) - thus the last prophecy comes true. Macduff kills Macbeth and Malcolm becomes King of Scotland.</div>
