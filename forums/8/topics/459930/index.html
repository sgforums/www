Limbs violence is the most evil force in the world today, which is the result of following reasons:</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16pt; " lang="EN-US"><span> </span>(1) many tall or strong males (such as rogue) never create any productivity, they rely on limbs violence to plunder gain of workers.</span></p>

If tall or strong males create 60% of productivity then they get 70%-80% of social power, which is the result of that females and other males never have full ability to defend their lives and property. Tall or strong males control the lives and property of<span>  </span>females and other males.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16pt; " lang="EN-US"><span> </span>(3) Prevalence of violence makes that most of males are eager for tall or strong figure and that the whole society fall into admiring tall or strong males, which breed Football World Cup, NBA, Olympic Games, open tournament of tennis. So that bone and muscle of many males overly grow. Appropriate sports are necessary to human health but society despise popular sports. So many people, particularly women, rarely participate in sports. But a lot of tall or strong males and professional athletes overly play sports. Excessive growth of bone and muscle not only waste much food, leading to worsen ecological environment, but also inhibit development of human brain because excessive sports waste much time and energy which should be used to develop human brain. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16pt; " lang="EN-US"><span>    </span>Why tall or strong males have the ability to create more productivity than others? Not because they are naturally more clever than others but because they always use limbs force to threat or violate others to gain more opportunities and spaces for survival and development. Girls are always fostered as "vase" by the whole society so they dare not be alone in the middle of nowhere , dare not touch dirty things and dare not face burning sun ...... . So females can only live cowardly and passively like vegetables in greenhouse and never have the opportunity to let their potential give full play . But tall or strong boys are always fostered as "savior" so they can always follow their inclinations to explore and try all kinds of things. Not gene but more opportunities make tall or strong males smarter and more capable than others.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16pt; " lang="EN-US"><span> </span>Why Hillary Clinton couldn't be President of the United States? Because she had lived like "vegetables in greenhouse" for a long time ,like other women. She hadn't accepted enough "savior" training so that she did not have the vision and ability of the President of the United States. Limbs force is the root of all advantages of tall or strong males .

For example,if the United States government takes over all enterprises then all enterprises about bank, car , energy , software and so on can be merged as "US Bank, US Car, US Energy, US Software" and so on. And the US Congress should establish an enterprise committee to lead and supervise these large enterprises. Investment experts such as Warren Buffett can become members of the enterprise committee. Fully democratic elections should be carried out in all enterprises and all of enterprise leaders should be elected by common staffs. All large enterprises develop and produce different products with different prices according to different people. The government's quality inspection institutions regularly announce quality inspection reports on all kinds of products to the whole society. Quality and reputation of all products stand for quality and reputation of the government and the country. All mature products will not need any ads any longer. Only new products still need ads. Only quality inspection institutions have qualification to help enterprises truly advertise. So 99% of ads will disappear. All enterprises will not compare unrealistically and not attack mutually.
