            <div class='col-md body'>Recently borrow a book from library. In it the author speculate and try to argue that the so called King Arthur we know as King Arthur and the Round Table story about his strength and warrior capability leading the British kings? According to his theory, Arthur is just a name meaning bear and it is just a title not a actual name. He theorised that Arthur is one who fought with the British kings as in he is not a pure bred Briton but more likely hail from a friendly Pict tribe called the Votandini who is being asked by the British king Ambriosius to battle against the Anglo-Saxons which the british deal a crippling defeat to them at the Battle of Badon.<br><br>It is interesting to know the mediavel history of britain of how they progress from being deserted by the Romans to being invaded by Picts, Angles and Saxons etc etc.....<br><br>No wonder now there are so many country in that area. Britain? Wales? Ireland? Scotland? Northern Ireland? They play cheat send so many teams to qualify for World Cup hahahahhaa........  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually the book is split into 2 parts. First part about King Arthur origin. Second part about Arthur quest for the Holy Grail. That holy grail is another story... legend has it contains Jesus blood or he uses it at the last supper. That I will follow up after reading it.<br><br>Pssss..... heard the holy grail has the power to heal all illness and maybe provide immortality and that is what I WANT !!!!!!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok conclusion from the author is out. King Arthur married a ger from the Roman Empire family. When Rome was to be sacked by Visigoth, they bring the Grail Hallows (plate used by Jesus at last Supper, chalice (cup) that contains Jesus blood at Crucifixion, lance that is used to pierce Jesus, sword that behead John the Baptist) and the most holy grail of all, secret word of Jesus that is recorded to Britain the last Roman province for hiding.<br><br>The ger and hence Arthur are the guardians of the holy grail. The story of Arthur search for grail is mixed up with search for the magic cauldron which according to the Celtic tribe which is said to cure all illness and magic power. Writers tend to sensationalize and linked that search to search for holy grail.<br><br>Then Arthur descendent, Fulk Fitz Wariner is guessed to be Robin Hood and it is he who later search for the holy grail. In that story all the holy grail are seen but the best of all is the secret word of Jesus recorded in a book.<br><br>After Jesus, who is the head of Church? It seem there are two paths. The path of St Peter more commonly known and the lesser know of Joseph of Arimathea. According to the latter, he is passed the secret word of Jesus Christ and the word recorded by a disciple. The chalice (cup) is held by a lady Mary Magdalene to contain Jesus blood when he died.<br><br>Conclusion: The chalice (cup) is just one of the four grail but the most holiest grail of all is the secret word of Jesus that is said not to be recorded in the Bible. Recently it is found to be the Gospel Of Thomas. So go figure.<br><br>Maybe for one to gain the highest knowledge is to decipher the Gospel of Thomas. Tale about the holy grail holy powers are over exaggerated. An interesting read neverthless.<br><br>Psss.... read that there is a female Pope dressed as men for a while. She is known as Joanna aka Eagle and later she give birth to a son (Mathars?) fathered with a servant. That is new news to me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
