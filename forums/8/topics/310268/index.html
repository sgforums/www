              A SG male divorcee cited:
              
              Having stupidly married a Singaporean woman - seven years of monotonous robotic accents, mechanical sex and mind-numbingly repetitive conversations about Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's "superiority" over other Asian nations and how Singapore had become "first world" thanks to hard work and "discipline," I can confirm that Singapore is the last place you should look for female company.
              
              The idea of svelte Asian honeys with a decent education and adequate English skills looks great - on paper. (Much like Singapore itself, where the theory is far more attractive than the real thing.) But Singaporeans have taken the worst of all worlds, and created a uniquely charmless national character that is all their own.
              
              The experience of being married to one of the island automatons was so bad that the idea of suicide seriously crossed my mind on literally dozens of occasions.
              
              The day of our divorce - the happiest day of my life so far - coincided with her birthday. To this day, I make sure to send her a big bunch of roses every year on this most auspicious of anniversaries.

            <div class='col-md body'>Increasing numbers of Singaporean men are marrying foreign women who are viewed as more demure and accommodating, a report said yesterday. Malaysians currently form the bulk of the foreign brides but Vietnamese and Chinese are gaining ground. Men queried by The Sunday Times said they want a woman who will put family and husband first, instead of demanding condominiums, cars and credit cards. Figures showed 6,520 males and permanent residents married foreign woman last year, a quarter of all marriages -</div>

               Was once in China (Shenzen), not that many ladies, went to this bar/nightclub and alas sitting on the bar counter were some attactive looking women, I did the man thing and went over to say howzit. After the introductions sure enough they asked for a whole bottle of tequila and sure enough they were from Singapore with their as if western accents. When she says she's from singapore ...run don't walk.

              <p>Probably a universal phenomena for men and women alike.</p>
              <p>Met some korean guys who reflect they'd never go for women their own kind. Reason being they're ugly, need to go under the knife, cannot even cook etc.</p>
              <p>American guys and some Vietnamese colleagues born and bred in Oz and Nz prefer Korean women who are petite, gorgeous and more demure.</p>
              <p>Irish and Australians prefer Asian women.</p>
              <p>English men say too many of their own kinds like to 'up' themselves, are way too cocky for their liking.</p>
              <p>Female ang moh expats mock at their own kind for 'going local' here in Singapore.</p>
