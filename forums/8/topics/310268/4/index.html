              <p>I also kena rejected so many times by sggirls but do i blame them? NO. I am just not good enough for them, plus if i cannot provide myself, why should i drag a girl to suffer with me? Unless she wants then diff case.</p>

              <p>That's why I say SG society has the best combination of the worst: oriental materialism and western feminism leading to a highly dysfunctional society.</p>
              <p>Best of east and west, my foot<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"> we're neither east and west and inherited the hybrid monster of both cultures.At least in China, women though materialistic are willing to bear kids and be a homemaker.In US, women who have feminist leanings paid their share of taxes and bills with their spouse ,and have kids too..though they can be argumentative at times with their men.</p>
              <p>Down here in SG,you have the worst traits being displayed yet not much contribution,ask the sociologists why our fertality rates keep plummeting and need PRC and FTs to breed</p>

              <p>So you are saying that the women here in SG once married dun pay their tax and bills with their spouse? Funny seriously because most family have a dual income because the bills need to be shared because the burden is just too great on one person.</p>
              <p>Kids? These days, a lot of men don't want kids either. I'm sure if the circumstances are better, most people want kids, but seriously 3 mths maternity leave vs the 1 year maternity leave you get in the USA and the discrimination you face if you get pregnant? Seriously not having kids is not a problem of SG women only. It is the way society is structured. Don't put all the blame on the women not wanting kids, because ultimately it is a decision made by both parties.</p>
              <p>The other problem I think is that most parents bring up their sons with the ideal planted in them that they are the king of the house and that he will be served hand and foot by his wife, since he is already being served hand and foot by the maid and mother when he was a child, whereas for daugthers, parents these days bring them up that they are equal to men and either they are pampered  by the parents like the guys or they are taught with the expectation that housework and chores will be shared and that their value as a woman is not in the house only. </p>
              <p>This is where the conflict will start. Of course, the woman not dependent on the man anymore acts differently. When you have a choice and able to stand on your own feet, you will not eat humble pie and put up with whatever nonsense since you have the ability to walk out anytime.</p>
              <p>As for the materialistic bitches you find, the only people you can blame are yourself guys. Most likely they are 'hot' and have many suitors who pile them with jewellery and other items so a priviliage has turned into a right.</p>

              <p>Its basically a flaming session between bcloud23b and u, nothing to do with
              SG ladies. Like Mr Lau had pointed out, Hello Kitty is after all an inanimate

              <p>As for spilling of beans, did u mean those PM from me? If i rem correctly, I
              still find u witty and enjoy ur
              sarcasm remark. But lately, u seems to have lost ur touch and more inclined into flaming. I
              wonder why.</p>

              Increasing numbers of Singaporean men are marrying foreign women who are viewed as more demure and accommodating, a report said yesterday. Malaysians currently form the bulk of the foreign brides but Vietnamese and Chinese are gaining ground. Men queried by The Sunday Times said they want a woman who will put family and husband first, instead of demanding condominiums, cars and credit cards. Figures showed 6,520 males and permanent residents married foreign woman last year, a quarter of all marriages 
              
              Agree...seems Malaysina made good brides not the arrogant selfish SG(gal)...Vietnamese or China brides may marry U because of no choice but U bought them literally with yr $$$..may not be easy to find true love.Take your time ny widening yr social as there are now many female foreigners working in SG..SG(gal) U can't blame them...with independence and higher education ..may want to exercise their rights too often to the extent of irritating...but not are all bad ..possible to find good ones too ..that's why a marriage is always a gamble....protect yr assets as the Woman's Charter is always not to yr advantage in the event of divorce just like my neighbour who married an atrocious SG(gal) and then all the drama started..all the best in yr endeavour
