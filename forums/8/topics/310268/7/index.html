              <p>hi spawnie! i like girls, especially sg girls <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">. i don't like it when you insult them, so i think you're just being a big poopyhead!</p>
              <p>y u act all high and mighty in an internet forum? euu ish asking to get whacked ah lan jiaowsss.</p>
              <p>anyway the content put into this thread doesn't really matter. as many others have already mentioned, the number of TS threads on this topic makes people just ignore whatever he says liao. he refuses to listen to solid reasoning from others and his opinion won't change.</p>
              <p>actually, i probably know about as much of girls as ts, i will admit im one of the early teens you are accusing of posting here. but i'm not being a total prick and attracting flames by being so moronically steadfast in a personal opinion that sg girls are horrible. there is no point debating with such donkeys as ts. i rather get some free +1s. in MY opinion, i think girls are great! :D maybe the girls catknight speaks of do exist, but there is always some good and some bad, don't judge if you never get to see the good.</p>

              <p>TS and his supporters are just no brainers. They assume foreign gals are all kind-hearted and obey husband, which in fact they are wishing them die earlier so that they can inherit their meagre assets.</p>

              <p>Not another thread on Sg girls again. Apparently, it's always the same person who has grudges against women in this forum.</p>
              <p>If TS is so so unhappy with local women, then please pack your luggage and get ready to fly off to another country to look for a bride soon. Don't waste your time to talk so much and complaining about Sg girls of how we are this and that.</p>
              <p>Materialistic? Yes, in some way Sg girls are, and that's because we are in a economically advanced country, not in some sub urban countries like whatever you name it. You can go to rural areas and look for a country girl, I'm sure she will fall in love with you with no strings attached because she's not exposed to these kind of matters where money is concerned in this world.</p>
              <p>If that's what you are looking for in girls, go ahead and look far beyond singapore. Don't complain and whine about Sg girls because that's how and where we are born in and we have our own mindset and thinking. You are not behaving like a man yourself, yet keep finding faults in Sg girls.</p>
              <p>Seriously, this is a never ending debate of guys and girls.</p>

              <p>We dun post here to turn u "ON"! Go bar forum if that is wat u want. Then again, u dun really expect someone to be capable of finding the bar fourum when he relate high post count = high IQ ! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>When ppl start hijacking thread, it juz goes to show how stupid the thread is. If a girl married someone for money, there is nothing wrong leaving that someone when he is broke, rite? U choose to marry this kind of ger, then why expect her to be any different after u married her? If not, why married someone hopping to turn them into something they are not? Isnt it silly to divorce someone for what they never are, even b4 u marry them?</p>
              <p>TS complain that sg girls isnt this, isnt that, etc, then why still marry any of them? So that he can divorce them later? If he think that his ideal ger can be found in some china bride, then by all mean go for china bride. Why even bother complaining about sg girl for not being like a china ger?</p>
              <p>Beside, who give a sh1t arse of what u think of our post or if ur eye is hurting! For all i care, ur eye could be blind as the as that sh1t licking dog i came across this morning, and i wouldnt even turn a head if it gotten run over.</p>

              <p>I don't have much time to write.</p>
              <p>But here's my take: the problem with most guys is that they treat the girls too well,</p>
              <p>hence they take advantage of the men. All the societal rules about being gentlemanly to them 24/7 is crap. They (women) have not earned your privileged right to treat them well so do not bother to do that. Equality applies across the board.</p>
              <p>Girls do not dig nice people. Girls are not nice themselves. Just take a look at Edison Chen. I  would say a man should always have the most say in a relationship, regardless of nationality. And the girl is always happy when the man is the leader .</p>
              <p>That's my 2 cents. No point debating. Girls will only respect guys who have power.</p>
              <p>When you have no power, you are perceived as weak and easily stepped on. Men regain you power.</p>
