Good to see singaporeans are still humanely racist against my kind.<br><br>anywayz, cyclists are cool with me, local or white, coz unlike most locals, cyclists KNOW the roads and the routes in singapore.<br><br>e.g. If an average singaporean non-cyclist is having a party, he will not be able to guide you PROPERLY to where he lives. Unlike a cyclist who would be able to. The cyclers i know all know how to guide you to whereever it is they live or where u wanna go, unlike non-cyclists.<br><br>Ha if a  dude ever cursed me while doing that i would run up to him and topple him off his bike and say "oops".<br><br></div>

When I say aggressive.....I mean you are entitled to your right of way. Ignore those freaking motorists who think that cyclists are 2nd class citizens on the roads.<br><br>If I am on my right of way and those rude &amp; impatient motorists who keep on horning at me, I just ignore them. If they persist I show them my two fingers!<br><br>Don't be afraid, they can't run you down for sure unless they wanna be charged for homicide.<br><br>In short, cyclists who are too timid on the roads would usually end up getting bullied by some rude and inconsiderate motorists.<br><br>To know more cyclists, visit the above link.</div>
