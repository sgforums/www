            <div class='col-md body'>Just for the fun of it.<br><br>There was this girl whom admired this guy for the longest time. If she could just have a date with this guy for one night it would be just perfect.<br><br>Then finally,the guy noticed her and asked her out. The girl was elated! And on the day of their date, she felt butterflies in her stomach.<br><br>The guy brought her to a roller coater park which she thought was romantic. She had her lunch but she thought<br><br>"Oh heck, I've been roller coatering for so many times now so whatever"<br><br>So they both went and sat together and rose the roller coaster. They went round and aroung and around the roller coaster and had the time of their lives.<br><br>At the end of the ride, the guy finally had the guts to hold the girl and when they reached a less crowded place, he decided to kiss her.<br><br>"Oh!" She thought excitedly "He's gonna kiss me!"<br><br>She closed her eys and parted her lips and their lips touched. But then she had a little rumble in her stomach and before you could say timbuktoo, she puked right into the guys face! Vomit spewning all over him!<br><br>Of course the guy went away hastily and the girl felt like dirt.<br><br>He never spoke to her again<br><br>(based on a true story)<br>(not mine)<br><br>P.s I know its not gross enuff.

            <div class='col-md body'>Spy,<br><br>You don't have to be so graphic, whether the guy in the picture is really dead or if the picture is doctored, it's in extreme bad taste to post it for shock value. Have most of us become so desensitized to the gory images that bombard us daily from the newspapers that we no longer feel anything when we pictures like these? Plese respect the dead, if this is a newspaper carrying a news article on the guy, it's a different ball game altogether as they're there to report news events, however unappealing. I'm really saddened &amp; disappointed to see this in the forum.</div>
