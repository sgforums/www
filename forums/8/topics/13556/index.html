            <div class='col-md body'>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.<br><br>1. (As for) those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah's<br>way, He shall render their works ineffective.<br><br>2. And (as for) those who believe and do good, and believe<br>in what has been revealed to Muhammad, and it is the very<br>truth from their Lord, He will remove their evil from them<br>and improve their condition.<br><br>3. That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood,<br>and have given them their dowries, taking (them) in<br>marriage, not fornicating nor taking them for paramours in<br>secret; and whoever denies faith, his work indeed is of no<br>account, and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers.<br><br>6. O you who believe! when you rise up to prayer, wash your<br>faces and your hands as far as the elbows, and wipe your<br>heads and-- those who believe follow the truth from their<br>Lord; thus does Allah set forth to men their examples.<br><br>4. So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then<br>smite the necks until when you have overcome them, then make<br>(them) prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as a<br>favor or let them ransom (themselves) until the war<br>terminates. That (shall be so); and if Allah had pleased He<br>would certainly have exacted what is due from them, but that<br>He may try some of you by means of others; and (as for)<br>those who are slain in the way of Allah, He will by no means<br>allow their deeds to perish.<br><br>5. He will guide them and improve their condition.<br><br>6. And cause them to enter the garden which He has made<br>known to them.<br><br>7. O you who believe ! if you help (the cause of) Allah, He<br>will help you and make firm your feet.<br><br>8. And (as for) those who disbelieve, for them is<br>destruction and He has made their deeds ineffective.<br><br>9. That is because they hated what Allah revealed, so He<br>rendered their deeds null.<br><br>10. Have they not then journeyed in the land and seen how<br>was the end of those before them: Allah brought down<br>destruction upon them, and the unbelievers shall have the<br>like of it.<br><br>11. That is because Allah is the Protector of those who<br>believe, and because the unbelievers shall have no protector<br>for them.<br><br>12. Surely Allah will make those who believe and do good<br>enter gardens beneath which rivers flow; and those who<br>disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat as the beasts eat, and<br>the fire is their abode.<br><br>13. And how many a town which was far more powerful than the<br>town of yours which has driven you out: We destroyed them so<br>there was no helper for them.<br><br>14. What! is he who has a clear argument from his Lord like<br>him to whom the evil of his work is made fairseeming: and<br>they follow their low desires.<br><br>15. A parable of the garden which those guarding (against<br>evil) are promised: Therein are rivers of water that does<br>not alter, and rivers of milk the taste whereof does not<br>change, and rivers of drink delicious to those who drink,<br>and rivers of honey clarified and for them therein are all<br>fruits and protection from their Lord. (Are these) like<br>those who abide in the fire and who are made to drink<br>boiling water so it rends their bowels asunder.<br><br>16. And there are those of them who seek to listen to you,<br>until when they go forth from you, they say to those who<br>have been given the knowledge: What was it that he said just<br>now? These are they upon whose hearts Allah has set a seal<br>and they follow their low desires.<br><br>17. And (as for) those who follow the right direction, He<br>increases them in guidance and gives them their guarding<br>(against evil).<br><br>18. Do they then wait for aught but the hour that it should<br>come to them all of a sudden? Now indeed the tokens of it<br>have (already) come, but how shall they have their reminder<br>when it comes on them?<br><br>19. So know that there is no god but Allah, and, ask<br>protection for your fault and for the believing men and the<br>believing women; and Allah knows the place of your returning<br>and the place of your abiding.<br><br>20. And those who believe say: Why has not a chapter been<br>revealed? But when a decisive chapter is revealed, and<br>fighting is mentioned therein you see those in whose hearts<br>is a disease look to you with the look of one fainting<br>because of death. Woe to them then!<br><br>21. Obedience and a gentle word (was proper); but when the<br>affair becomes settled, then if they remain true to Allah it<br>would certainly be better for them.<br><br>22. But if you held command, you were sure to make mischief<br>in the land and cut off the ties of kinship!<br><br>23. Those it is whom Allah has cursed so He has made them<br>deaf and blinded their eyes.<br><br>24. Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Nay, on the<br>hearts there are locks.<br><br>25. Surely (as for) those who return on their backs after<br>that guidance has become manifest to them, the Shaitan has<br>made it a light matter to them; and He gives them respite.<br><br>26. That is because they say to those who hate what Allah<br>has revealed: We will obey you in some of the affairs; and<br>Allah knows their secrets.<br><br>27. But how will it be when the angels cause them to die<br>smiting their backs.<br><br>28. That is because they follow what is displeasing to Allah<br>and are averse to His pleasure, therefore He has made null<br>their deeds.<br><br>29. Or do those in whose hearts is a disease think that<br>Allah will not bring forth their spite?<br><br>30. And if We please We would have made you know them so<br>that you would certainly have recognized them by their marks<br>and most certainly you can recognize them by the intent of<br>(their) speech; and Allah knows your deeds.<br><br>31. And most certainly We will try you until We have known<br>those among you who exert themselves hard, and the patient,<br>and made your case manifest.<br><br>32. Surely those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah's<br>way and oppose the Apostle after that guidance has become<br>clear to them cannot harm Allah in any way, and He will make<br>null their deeds.<br><br>33. O you who believe! obey Allah and obey the Apostle, and<br>do not make your deeds of no effect.<br><br>34. Surely those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah's<br>way, then they die while they are unbelievers, Allah will by<br>no means forgive them.<br><br>35. And be not slack so as to cry for peace and you have the<br>upper hand, and Allah is with you, and He will not bring<br>your deeds to naught.<br><br>36. The life of this world is only idle sport and play, and<br>if you believe and guard (against evil) He will give you<br>your rewards, and will not ask of you your possessions.<br><br>37. If He should ask you for it and urge you, you will be<br>niggardly, and He will bring forth your malice.<br><br>38. Behold! you are those who are called upon to spend in<br>Allah's way, but among you are those who are niggardly, and<br>whoever is niggardly is niggardly against his own soul; and<br>Allah is Self-sufficient and you have need (of Him), and if<br>you turn back He will bring in your place another people,<br>then they will not be like you.<br>ï¿½<br><br></div>
