Then we spread from Africa to other parts of the world, ruthlessly out-competing and out-smarting the other predators, securing our position as number one on the planet.<br><br>But as the human species grows, it has become weaker. Humans do not have any natural defences, whether they be chemical, physical or psychological. Humans do not have camouflage, making us stand out in the wild, a lure for other predators. But, it is our intelligence that compensates for our other lack of abilities. With intelligence, the human race has proved itself time and again that it will, and forever will be, number one on this planet. However, technology is destroying the human race. Our dependence on technology and the integration of technology into our daily lives, and even into our bodies has made us a species which cannot live without technology.<br><br>In the distant future, the human species would reach the peak of its intelligence and cannot go further. We would've mastered Science, manipulated Nature, meddled with Physics, played with Genetics. We would ourselves become a species that would no longer be biological, but artificial. Our minds would remain trapped in the digital world, our bodies weakened through the lack of Natural Selection, which is needed to keep a species healthy and growing.<br><br>The Human Species, a race destined to great power, would have its intelligence and its never-ending thirst for knowledge be cause for its demise, its downfall, and very likely, its extinction...</div></blockquote>For God sake, natural selection only determines the stronger species. As there are many different kinds of humans, only a certain kind will survive.<br><br>You need to go read up more. While at a glance such things may happen, they can be kept under control. Maybe you ought to know more about pseudoextinction.</div>

However, there are limitations. As the queen ant is the only one leading, the views are limited. And they respect the higher ups, no matter they are right or wrong.
