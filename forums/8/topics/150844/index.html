            <div class='col-md body'>Everything comes with a price. You gain some you lose some. It's never perfect world. Singapore is unique bcos of our multi racial society. There are many sensitive issues where open discussion may trigger tense feelings. What's the feeling like to be a Niger amongst the Caucasians or vice versa? Surely there are sensitive issues that are taboo.<br><br>What's the price of democracy? You fight for your rights, you discuss many issues openly, you talk about races and religion. You invite unnecessary tension. For the price of democracy, you have lots of unrest, strike and conflicts. We can't afford it. We are only a tiny red dot without natural resources. There are trade-offs for Safety and Security.<br><br>Even if it's not the real world, we don't need to experience it to know what is happening in Baghdad today. We can read whatever we want, we know that danger exists, we know the differences betw war and peace, democracy and trade-off. We cannot live in "Disneyland" all our life, but we built it the way we want.</div>
