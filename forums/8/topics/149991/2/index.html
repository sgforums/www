It is better to win a war without fighting one, attacking the walled cities will put casualties on both sides which is look upon as the last resort. Just imagine the time, wealth and energy needed to support a war is tremendous which will dry the coffers and with bodies mounting and spirit tormented.<br><br>2) If you pursue a desperate enemy too relentlessly, he will fight till the end. There is a saying, if you force a desperate dog to jump the wall, it will bite you back. A corner or desperate enemy will choose to fight till the end as if he presses on; there is a chance he may survive. Anyway, it is already lose-lose situation, he might as well take this gamble. In this way, even if he was defeated he had already inflicted heavy casualties on his pursuer's side. Let the desperate enemy have some breathing space, he will flee and lose his steam and will to fight, then observe for the best opportunity, use tactics and strategies to capture him.<br><br>3) A war that is not carefully plan will lead to unexpected defeat. Finance (Wealth), people, resources, location, weather, timing, training, strategies and etc need to be planned and coordinated. As the saying goes, nobody plans to fail, but always fails to plan. The importance of planning cannot be underestimated as warfare will lead to destruction or survival of a nation.<br></div>
