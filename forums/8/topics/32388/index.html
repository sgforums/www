            <div class='col-md body'>1.   "Fine"<br>This is the word women use at the end of any argument<br>when they feel they are right but can't stand to hear you<br>argue any longer. It means that you should shut up.<br>(NEVER use "Fine" to describe how she looks.  This will<br>cause you to have one of those arguments.)<br><br>2.   "Five minutes"<br>This is half an hour.  It is equivalent to the five minutes<br>that your football game is going to last before you take<br>out the trash, so women feel that it's an even trade.<br><br>3.   "Nothing"<br>Nothing" means something and you should be on your<br>toes. "Nothing" is usually used to describe the feeling a<br>woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside down,<br>and backwards. "Nothing" usually signifies an argument<br>that will last "Five Minutes" and end with the word "Fine."<br><br>4.   "Go Ahead" (with raised eyebrows)<br>This is NOT permission; it's a dare!  If  you mistake it for<br>permission, the result will be the woman will get upset<br>over "Nothing" and you'll have a "Five-minute" discussion<br>that will end with the word "Fine."<br><br>5.   "Go Ahead" (normal eyebrows)<br>This is NOT permission, either.  It means "I give up" or<br>"do what you want because I don't care."  You will get<br>a raised eyebrow "Go Ahead" in just a few minutes,<br>followed by "Nothing" and "Fine" and she will talk to<br>you in about "Five Minutes" when she cools off.<br><br>6.   "Loud Sigh"<br>This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal<br>statement.  Very frequently misunderstood by men.  A<br>"Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are a complete idiot<br>and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here<br>and arguing with you over "Nothing."<br><br>7.   "Soft Sigh"<br>Again, not a word, but a verbal statement.  "Soft Sighs"<br>are one of the few things that some men actually<br>understand.  It means she is momentarily content.<br>Your best bet is to not move or breathe in the hope that<br>the moment will last a bit longer.<br><br>8.   "Oh"<br>This word -- followed by any statement -- is trouble.<br>Example; "Oh, let me get that".  Or, "Oh, I talked to him<br>about what you were doing last night." If she says "Oh"<br>before a statement, run, do not walk, to the nearest exit.<br>She will tell you that she is "Fine" when she is done tossing<br>your clothes out the window, but do not expect her to<br>talk to you for at least two days.<br><br>9.   "That's Okay"<br>This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman<br>can say to a man. That's Okay" means that she wants to<br>think long and hard before deciding what the penalty will<br>be for whatever you have done. "That's Okay" is often<br>used with the word "Fine" and in conjunction with a raised<br>eyebrow "Go Ahead." Once she has had time to plan it<br>out, you are in for some mighty big trouble.<br><br>10.  "Please Do"<br>This is not a statement, it is an offer.  The woman is giving<br>you the chance to come up with an excuse for what you<br>have done.  In other words, a chance to get yourself into<br>even more trouble.  If you handle this correctly, you<br>shouldn't get a "That's Okay."<br><br>11.  "Thanks"<br>The woman is thanking you.  Don't faint and don't look for<br>hidden meaning. Just say "you're welcome."<br><br>12.  "Thanks A Lot"<br>"Thanks A Lot" is dramatically different from  "Thanks."  A<br>woman will say Thanks A Lot" when she is really ticked<br>off at you.  It is usually followed by the "Loud Sigh."  This<br>signifies that you have hurt her in some callous way.  Be<br>careful not to ask what is wrong after the "Loud Sigh," as<br>she will only tell you "Nothing."<br></div>

Be<br>careful not to ask what is wrong after the "Loud Sigh," as<br>she will only tell you "Nothing."<br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Copy and paste into Word.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by shock1234:</div><div class="quote_body"> 1.   "Fine"<br>This is the word women use at the end of any argument<br>when they feel they are right but can't stand to hear you<br>argue any longer. It means that you should shut up.<br>(NEVER use "Fine" to describe how she looks.  This will<br>cause you to have one of those arguments.)<br><br>2.   "Five minutes"<br>This is half an hour.  It is equivalent to the five minutes<br>that your football game is going to last before you take<br>out the trash, so women feel that it's an even trade.<br><br>3.   "Nothing"<br>Nothing" means something and you should be on your<br>toes. "Nothing" is usually used to describe the feeling a<br>woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside down,<br>and backwards. "Nothing" usually signifies an argument<br>that will last "Five Minutes" and end with the word "Fine."<br><br>4.   "Go Ahead" (with raised eyebrows)<br>This is NOT permission; it's a dare!  If  you mistake it for<br>permission, the result will be the woman will get upset<br>over "Nothing" and you'll have a "Five-minute" discussion<br>that will end with the word "Fine."<br><br>5.   "Go Ahead" (normal eyebrows)<br>This is NOT permission, either.  It means "I give up" or<br>"do what you want because I don't care."  You will get<br>a raised eyebrow "Go Ahead" in just a few minutes,<br>followed by "Nothing" and "Fine" and she will talk to<br>you in about "Five Minutes" when she cools off.<br><br>6.   "Loud Sigh"<br>This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal<br>statement.  Very frequently misunderstood by men.  A<br>"Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are a complete idiot<br>and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here<br>and arguing with you over "Nothing."<br><br>7.   "Soft Sigh"<br>Again, not a word, but a verbal statement.  "Soft Sighs"<br>are one of the few things that some men actually<br>understand.  It means she is momentarily content.<br>Your best bet is to not move or breathe in the hope that<br>the moment will last a bit longer.<br><br>8.   "Oh"<br>This word -- followed by any statement -- is trouble.<br>Example; "Oh, let me get that".  Or, "Oh, I talked to him<br>about what you were doing last night." If she says "Oh"<br>before a statement, run, do not walk, to the nearest exit.<br>She will tell you that she is "Fine" when she is done tossing<br>your clothes out the window, but do not expect her to<br>talk to you for at least two days.<br><br>9.   "That's Okay"<br>This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman<br>can say to a man. That's Okay" means that she wants to<br>think long and hard before deciding what the penalty will<br>be for whatever you have done. "That's Okay" is often<br>used with the word "Fine" and in conjunction with a raised<br>eyebrow "Go Ahead." Once she has had time to plan it<br>out, you are in for some mighty big trouble.<br><br>10.  "Please Do"<br>This is not a statement, it is an offer.  The woman is giving<br>you the chance to come up with an excuse for what you<br>have done.  In other words, a chance to get yourself into<br>even more trouble.  If you handle this correctly, you<br>shouldn't get a "That's Okay."<br><br>11.  "Thanks"<br>The woman is thanking you.  Don't faint and don't look for<br>hidden meaning. Just say "you're welcome."<br><br>12.  "Thanks A Lot"<br>"Thanks A Lot" is dramatically different from  "Thanks."  A<br>woman will say Thanks A Lot" when she is really ticked<br>off at you.  It is usually followed by the "Loud Sigh."  This<br>signifies that you have hurt her in some callous way.  Be<br>careful not to ask what is wrong after the "Loud Sigh," as<br>she will only tell you "Nothing."<br></div></blockquote>wah...i nvr knew sia.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
