Rain1407  if you are not happy there, you can seek greener pastures - I encourage you to do so - There are better places to work in .<br><br>The treatment of nurses in Singapore is rubbish . Now for all you fellows who told her to seek another job or something , there are quite a lot of nurses I know who wants to leave Singapore.  Grievances from nurses are not advertised openly because MOH fears negative impacts on recruitment.  You don't hear of :<br>1. Chronic back pain - usually hospitals put the blame on the nurses for poor "body mechanics" but it is rubbish according to Occupational health and safety.  Most Australia /USA  hospitals have hoisting equipment to prevent nurses from breaking their backs .<br>2. Six day weeks which can translate into 12 days of work and 2 days off and then 1 work day and 1 day off then 11 days on . They shouldn't allow any staff to work more than 7 days at most.<br>3.Nurses are constantly yelled at by doctors , demeaned by nursing officers - no sense of respect in the profession at all. Some doctors order nurses like maids . At least , in australia , the doctors work with nurses , not WORK over them.<br>4. Medical certs - if you get sick more than 5 times in two years - u get called up for "counselling" even if you are genuinely sick .<br>5. Nurses' rights are not even comparable to other developed countries<br>6. Pay is as above not even comparable to other developed countries<br><br>In other words, Nurses are humans too and they deserve some rights.<br><br>However publicly, there is only the beautifully painted picture of nursing in Singapore  :<br>1. MOH shows the "oooh we treat nurses so well we have awards and recognition for them" public side .<br>2. Constant caring nature shown on television and interaction with patients seem so heavenly and trouble free  but never show patient aggression.<br>3. There was one time that the english recruiters came and tried to recruit nurses to England and MOH said no nurses took up the offer. Bullshit , some singaporeans did. There is one singaporean I know who took it up and happily living in manchester .<br>4.Of course PSC nursing scholars ( "future rulers" )  get to be their main models since they are treated better than the commoners.<br><br>Some nurses and people think they must sacrifice alot since they enter a calling. Well ,admirable but not all nurses are matyrs.<br><br>Let MOH worry about workforce problems and how to retain staff then. Now they are not worried because people are doing nursing to secure jobs but once the economy gets better, I think I will see some of them immigrating once they have the experience or switching back to their old jobs.  Let MOH  employ all their foreign nurses who would leave them for the western countries after<br><br>Well judging from the responses of the above, I would state the Australian Nurses' federation motto which they sling so proudly over one of the buildings : <strong> Care for those who care for you </strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey FYMK,<br><br>Tanks man for being supportive...<br><br>Actually this mishap isnt about me... Its about the plight that i heard from a couple of my friends working in that particular hospital... Everytime I meet them, they will definetly have some stories to share, stating about patients "drama", demanding relatives &amp; other stupid events that constantly haunts their daily working hours.<br><br>It seems so real that I have to agree that nurses aren't really truly appreciated as what the TV often potrays them...  U r right when u mentioned that nurses are being hollered @, being ordered around... I've seen it...<br><br>Although I'm not a nurse myself but to be honest, I feel for them...<br><br>Some other people who replied to this thread, suggested that we can just quit... It sounds so easy but what if nursing is their only profession?  jobs are getting so scarce nowadays &amp; we cant just leave as when we like &amp; seek another job... What I'm talking about here is just a simple form of RESPECT &amp; appreciation; not how to quit a job!<br><br>Tanks again fymk!<br><br>To u others who thinks that I'm talking cock, maybe I am... But to the nurses, I dont think so...<br><br>Try to be a nurse for a day then...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is preposterous that annual leave for Year 2005 has to be submitted now.  Frankly, are we able to foresee what's going to happen a year from now?  So, does that mean if I decide to get married in October 2005 but the deadline for submitting leave for 2005 is already over, I'll have to seek my ward sister's permission before my parents to see if the date is ok and that marriage leave can be granted?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Apparently, this deadline is to help in staffing and rostering of staff which is, excuse me, 'bovine defecation'.  Despite receiving our leave applications way in advance, staffing and rostering is sometimes still ridiculous.<br><br>Any idea why every year, we work so hard at recruiting nurses?  Why do we need an enrollment of hundreds in nursing school every year.  That is because, surprise!  surprise!  every year, a large no. of nurses quit for another profession or migrate to another country to practice nursing.  They do not bother to retain staff at all and when I asked one of the senior nursing manager once if it bothers her that our turnover rate is so high, she arrogantly proclaimed, 'The staff who leave are mostly foreigners (not true!).  If they want to leave, let them leave.  We can always get new staff!'  Excuse me but it isn't cheap to train new staff.  Besides, they are foreigners here but also foreigners in UK / Australia / US but why do they flock there in droves AND stay put there and set up homes there?<br><br>We used to recruit Filipinos to beef up our nursing staff but when I questioned a senior management staff lately, she admitted that 'the market is drying up', which effectively translates to mean that it's harder to recruit Filipino nurses to work here because we don't treat them well and working conditions here are outrageous compared to developed countries.  So, we turned to China, then India.  Nurses from China tend to be well-educated and those whom I've worked with resent the working conditions here too.  According to my foreign colleagues, Singaporeans are demanding, spoilt, rude, threaten to complain at every little thing, manipulative, selfish and inconsiderate.  I don't really blame them for complaining so much since the system rewards complainers - you complain, you get better service because everyone from management downwards will then kow-tow to you, no matter  how outrageous your demands and insolent your attitude and behaviour is.  I always feel bad that these foreigners leave with such a bad impression of us Singaporeans.<br><br>This is not just a problem confined to the poor nurses.  Folks, you and your loved ones will all grow ill and/or sick someday and you'll wish to have a pool of competent nurses to take care of you in hospital.  It's high time to look into staff retention and staff welfare instead of thinking that 'This issue doesn't concern me, thus I don't care'.  It is getting bad especially since really senior staff nurses who have more than 10 years of experience I know are really unhappy and even contemplating resignation / migration too.<br><br>It'll be real interesting to see how the nurses who are currently degree-holders in a different field who entered nursing due to the poor economy will cope.  They'll definitely be outspoken like me and my cronies and they'll soon learn that in this archaic system, you have to really kow-tow and shutup and not ask any questions in front of the seniors and management staff or they'll misconstrue whatever good intentions you had as 'arrogance', 'obnoxious know-it-all smart aleck', 'trouble-maker' and 'questioning our authority'.<br><br>Chronic backache?  Welcome to my world.  No thanks to all the lifting and transferring and turning of patients we have to do, sometimes, all alone.<br><br>As for writing to an official channel, the letter won't be published, forget it.  If it does, they'll probably find a way to dismiss you or blackmark you.  To those of you who are not in the know, nursing management seems to be frozen in the 1960's, with McGregor's Theory X Assumptions in operation.  I'm not kidding you - we work with a bunch of Empress Dowagers.  Greener pastures beckon and fymk, I've set the process in motion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Rain 1407, I think I know you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  *high 5's*</div>

I have 2 friends of mine who used to be staff nurses but left, 1 for the army as a nursing officer, the other for the SCDF as a paramedic. They seem to be much happier now, away from all that hospital politics.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rain, I once had a patient in my room under my care who suddenly turned critically ill.  I had to go and administer an injection to him stat (immediately) as ordered by the doctor.  So off I went but was stopped halfway out of the room by some visitor who wanted his mom's diapers changed.  We had just changed her and the junior staff had gone to another room to tend to the other patients there so I told him to wait for my colleagues.  Then I went to get the urgent injection.  When I returned to the room, he said, 'I don't want to wait, I want you to change my mom's diapers NOW!'  I glared at him, then went to tend to my critically ill patient.  When I was behind the curtains tending to that patient, this man was ranting and raving outside, threatening to write some complaint letter, bad service etc etc.  Then, later, I was called into the Ward Sister's office about being rude, checking my tone of voice, etc.<br><br>Or, get this, a critically ill patient was wheeled in under my care.  We had to get important lines in, get blood transfused, get drugs running, all to be done STAT!! or we lose her.  So I'm running into and out of the room doing several things at once, she's an active bleeder so things get hectic and messy.  And then, after my duty, I was called up into the office because two guys complained that I was rude and ignored them!!!  Excuse me!  I didn't even know anyone was trying to speak to me!!  Excuse me for working so hard to save a lady's life and trying to achieve hemostasis!!  Excuse me for concentrating so hard on the multiple things I had to juggle to save her that I didn't even know you were asking for directions!!!<br><br>On several occasions, when pushing a patient on a trolley to the Operation Theatre or back, I've had idiots stop me to ask for directions!!!!  Sometimes, we have critically ill patients with monitors beeping away, infusion pumps running, and we're concentrating on keeping the patient stable on the journey back to the ward and someone stops us for DIRECTIONS!!!!<br><br>I thought Singaporeans are an educated lot, well, we may have all the paper qualifications but definitely not the social responsibility nor the social finesse.  Please, in a hospital, don't treat the place like a hotel.  We're there to save lives, not occupy our time doing PR work trying to pacify ranting and raving lunatics who don't get the 'service' they want.   All that talk about filial piety and sometimes, families won't even lift a finger to get water for their mom / dad and end up pressing the call bell for everything.  Some of them won't even help do stuff like comb their mom's hair or wipe their dad's sweat, or shave their husband, like their loved ones had the plague.  I feel like we're a waitress, maid, front-line service staff, housekeeper, counsellor, clerk, secretary, trainer, and oh,... I forget, Nurse, all rolled in one.<br><br>We work hard to make sure all patients are stable and getting better.  But get this, the ratio is like 1 Staff Nurse : 4-12 patients, or more.  Yes.  They don't tell you this in the glossy ads.  Sometimes, we don't even get to go for our breaks.  I've turned up for work at 7am and worked non-stop and finally only got to eat a morsel at 4:30pm.  And when you get questioned as to why some trivial task has not been done and you tell your ward sister that you've been so busy you didn't even have a break, they'll just say, 'work faster', or 'I don't care, the fact is, this and that wasn't done'.  And in the meantime, there's a deluge of visitors who refuse to comply to visiting hours and visiting rules, who constantly stop us for all sorts of things and who won't fail to complain if they didn't receive the 5-star service they're being highly subsidised for.<br><br>Life is a bed of roses... but nurses are lying on the thorny end of it.<br></div>

Its just simply sad that some people refuses to understand!  Y can they simplay have this basic form of courtesy of enquiring &amp; respect?  Rhonda u are correct when u say that Nurses are an unwilling breed of "all-rounders"...  Simply saying, nurses needs to be everywhere!  Period!<br><br>Well I cant be too sure about the strenght of the nurses in Singapore to meet up with our patients quota (honestly Rhonda thats new to me!).  But from the ratio that Rhonda states, it must be a back breaking workload for our dear nurses...  I believe its time that we Singaporeans stop pasting "photogenic" posters of our country to foreigners.  I believe we Singaporeans are simply too pampered as to being spoonfed all the time.  Sometimes, I'm really ashamed...<br><br>Although in the frantic relatives' point of view, they want the best for their kins.  True... But I believe the way they asked for it is totally wrong!  Y cant they put themselves in tragic situations where their own parents are in the clutches of death when someone else comes in the way demanding the nurses to have a cup of Milo for their father who has a pain in the stomach?  When the nurses politely (which i believe they always do) request another 5 mins, the idiot pens down a complain &amp; the poor nurses on duty gets fried on their ass!<br><br>Chew on that!</div>
