            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rhonda:</div><div class="quote_body">We used to recruit Filipinos to beef up our nursing staff but when I questioned a senior management staff lately, she admitted that 'the market is drying up', which effectively translates to mean that it's harder to recruit Filipino nurses to work here because we don't treat them well and working conditions here are outrageous compared to developed countries.  So, we turned to China, then India.  Nurses from China tend to be well-educated and those whom I've worked with resent the working conditions here too.  According to my foreign colleagues, Singaporeans are demanding, spoilt, rude, threaten to complain at every little thing, manipulative, selfish and inconsiderate.  I don't really blame them for complaining so much since the system rewards complainers - you complain, you get better service because everyone from management downwards will then kow-tow to you, no matter  how outrageous your demands and insolent your attitude and behaviour is.  I always feel bad that these foreigners leave with such a bad impression of us Singaporeans.<br><br>This is not just a problem confined to the poor nurses.  Folks, you and your loved ones will all grow ill and/or sick someday and you'll wish to have a pool of competent nurses to take care of you in hospital.  It's high time to look into staff retention and staff welfare instead of thinking that 'This issue doesn't concern me, thus I don't care'.  It is getting bad especially since really senior staff nurses who have more than 10 years of experience I know are really unhappy and even contemplating resignation / migration too.<br></div></blockquote>I like the filipino nurses - they are very polite people.  I work with a few before and I think they are fabulous nurses.<br><br>China and india-trained nurses - I don't really like them because of the bad impressions I got from the majority  I work with. One used to keep complaining about showering patients because it seems in China , relatives bath the patients ( but I think it is a very good idea  that relatives do that , just that I hate to listen to that nurse's droning).  Another thought she was the nursing officer  when she was employed, which I found laughable since she is lazy (took a 3hr break and said she didn't know when in fact she was told it was a 1/2 hr break).<br><br>Sometimes they don't ask for help if they don't understand the drugs interaction, then later you find out they gave the wrong drug (happened to one india-trained nurse once and she kept denying it despite the patient showing us the pill he was not prescribed).  One didn't even know how to read the drug names  properly and kept asking me if she was correct  continousy  , like some sort of guessing game, which resulted in me getting pissed off . They shouldn't allow them in when their english is not strong enough in medical terminology - <strong> not fair to those nurses , their colleagues and the patients </strong> . I had to be the spell check for one of them in their notes because I am "chinese" so I must "help" her (that is in australia).  I was angry because that china nurse pulled the ethnic card on me and my aussie colleagues were busy avoiding her since she has been getting them to do her work for her.<br><br>Australia is allowing the china and india-trained nurses to come in and I am having the same problems I had when I was working in Singapore.  I am not snobbish but if english is not their language and they are crap at it  - how can we expect them to provide care properly especially when it comes down to drugs. Why let them in? <strong> Because there is a worldwide shortage of nurses. </strong> Even the african nations are begging to WHO to step in and prevent developed countries from taking their nurses and here we have MOH and restructured hospital upper hierachy taking our nurses down one by one. So Singaporeans , you think it doesn't affect you? Wait til all your singaporean nurses leave and foreigners take care of you ( some who has a poor command of english) - then you will know how it affects you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Having said all those in my above comment , there are a minute minority of china and india trained nurses who are truly trying their best and asking for help when they need it.<br><br>In Australia , the nurses have a union to help them while <strong> Singapore nurses have not much of a union at ALL. </strong>  In the australian state I am living , there was a nurses' strike - the nurses shut down all non essential services , such as elective operations and social admission beds ( which meant patients came in because their families couldn't cope with them socially) . It created a large impact enough to push the state government to accede to some of the requests made (which I feel is reasonable) , for example :<br>1. zero tolerance towards physical and verbal aggression of patients and their family. They get aggressive knowingly ,  we can file police reports for patient attacks on nursing staff.  Security staff will escort all offending family members off the ward and there is a ban on them coming in (as in where I work , where one patient's husband took a swipe at the nurses )<br>2. yearly increment in pay, and 3% increase in nursing salaries<br>3. patient ratios to nurse ratios kept  to what they call a safe level.<br><br>Unfortunately , in Singapore, no nurses can do that . They get blacklisted.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, fymk, the Filipino nurses have my respect for being able to tolerate rudeness and ill-treatment by patients, relatives and superiors.  They are very long-suffering and are very good at pacifying patients and often swallow their pride to do whatever the patients and relatives demand, reasonable or otherwise.  I think they are a very friendly and helpful lot in general.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   Without them, our workload would be horrendous!  Sadly, there's an exodus of them every year to Australia, UK and for the lucky few, the US.<br><br>I'm sure medics have to face superiors who can be like dictators.  Not easy.  However, you don't have to clean 7-12 patients everyday, don't have to face people who treat you like a lesser human being, and etc etc.  I know about three nurses who chose to sign up with the military because they really couldn't tolerate working conditions in hospitals here.</div>
