            <div class='col-md body'>November 8 news on new paper.<br><br>THE parang attack ended as swiftly as it had begun.<br><br>In less than five minutes, the attackers had fled the scene after pouncing on a group of seven friends.<br><br>The silence was telling too. It was as if the gang of around eight male attackers was focused on just slashing their victims.<br><br>One victim said the attackers were so quiet that all he could hear was the sounds of parangs slicing their bodies.<br><br>But the ferocity of the attack was never in doubt.<br><br>It left two victims lying in a pool of their own blood.<br><br>One had his left hand nearly chopped off - he 'could feel it dangling'.<br><br>Another victim managed to flee the scene, but not before getting a deep cut that stretched from his right ear to his mouth.<br><br>A fourth man and the three women who were with them escaped unharmed.<br><br>All three victims, men in their mid-20s, survived the vicious attack, which happened outside Liang Court shopping complex near Clarke Quay at about 4am on Sunday.<br><br>It was the latest in a string of similar horrific incidents.<br><br>The trio, who are colleagues at a pest control company, and their family members declined to be identified when The New Paper spoke to them in hospital.<br><br>All three victims claimed the attack had been unprovoked and that neither they nor their friends had offended anyone recently.<br><br>They also insisted they had not stepped on anyone's toes while partying at the nearby Ministry of Sound (MOS) on Saturday night, shortly before they were attacked.<br><br>'DIDN'T OFFEND ANYONE'<br><br>David (not his real name), 25, who nearly lost his hand, said: 'We didn't offend anyone there. Nor are we involved in any gang activities.<br><br>'It could be a case of mistaken identity or it could be something else. But I have no idea why we were attacked.'<br><br>He said the group had gone to a fast-food outlet at Liang Court for supper.<br><br>One of them, a man, entered the outlet to buy some food and drinks while the rest waited for him on the steps outside, facing River Valley Road.<br><br>Mark, 25, one of the victims, said he saw a stranger pushing his friend the moment he emerged from the outlet with the food and drinks.<br><br>Said Mark: 'The stranger appeared from nowhere and started chasing my friend, who was running away.<br><br>'He was shouting 'jangan lari' (do not run, in Malay)'.<br><br>What happened next was so sudden that Mark had no time to react.<br><br>He said: 'I turned around and saw two men on my right. One of them slashed my face and the other slashed my head with parangs.'<br><br>He needed 26 stitches on his face and six on the head.<br><br>Mark, who described the attackers as men in their late teens to early 20s, said he then fled towards MOS.<br><br>The attackers didn't pursue him.<br><br>The three women in the group were unharmed but stunned by the attack, he said.<br><br>Mark choked on his words as he recalled how he ran back to the scene to check on his friends David and Luke.<br><br>But he realised that they were not as lucky as he was, as both were slumped in a pool of blood, right where they had been sitting with him.<br><br>Luke, 24, recounted: 'There was no time to run at all as the attackers appeared from nowhere.<br><br>'The attack was over in less than five minutes but it felt like it lasted a very long time.'<br><br>He said the first blows landed on his head, leaving two 10-cm slashes on his scalp.<br><br>Luke said he then raised his hands to cover his head, but that left him with badly-damaged nerves on both hands.<br><br>His mother said doctors told the family that metal parts have been inserted into Luke's right hand and it could take around two years for him to recover completely.<br><br>As the attackers relentlessly slashed at his hands, Luke, the eldest of five children, said he thought he was going to die and that he would never see his family again.<br><br>He recalled: 'I prayed to God that it was up to him to decide if it was time for me to die.'<br><br>David said he also feared for his life during the attack.<br><br>After the attackers fled, he opened his eyes to find himself lying in a pool of blood.<br><br>FELT HAND DANGLING<br><br>Said David: 'I could feel my left hand dangling.'<br><br>As he lay on the ground, he felt he was losing consciousness.<br><br>Said David: 'A passer-by then shook me and told me not to sleep and to stay conscious.<br><br>'I thought about my family and told myself to stay awake.'<br><br>He remained conscious until he and his two friends were taken to Singapore General Hospital, where they have undergone several operations.<br><br>With tears in her eyes, Mark's mother, 46, a housewife, said she fainted when she arrived at the hospital with her husband and saw the blood-stained clothes of the eldest of her four children.<br><br>Her husband said their grief gave way to anger when Mark told them that it was an unprovoked attack.<br><br>Said Mark's father: 'It makes me angry to know that he was attacked without having offended anyone.'<br><br>Police spokesman ASP Stanley Norbert said no arrests have been made so far, but police are investigating.<br><br></div>
