            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there! I understand your concern for a proper upbringing of your cousin. However, I like to highlight a few things. What makes you think that with 'cleaner' tv programmes aired, your cousin will grow up into a nice prim and proper lady? Anyway what kind of tv programmes do you expect to be shown? Teletubbies 24hrs? Even cartoons nowadays have elements of violence in them. Sylvester constantly trying all kinds of methods to eat tweety. However, this does not mean that the tv should show all kinds of programmes. There have to be some restrictions somehow.<br>If you are afraid that the tv influences your cousin too much, don't let your cousin watch tv at all. But that again, your cousin can be influenced in school so ban your cousin from going to school. No school? There are all kinds of people in the world, outside the house. Ban your cousin from going outside of the house. No windows for fear your cousin might see the things people do outside. No books. Nothing at all. Put her in a small windowless room and everyday you bring her food and give her lessons on how to do things the right way as a lady. Ridiculous? Of course! My point is, blaming the tv just because your lil cousin learnt how to say stupid is just ridiculous. For all you know, your cousin learn the word when she accidently hears her parents' conversations. Are 3 year olds safe from living with that kind of parents?<br>There is no way you can stop this kind of things from the media especially in today's world. Looking all around you there is internet easily available, almost everyone owning handphones. One can be easily influenced. So what matters is the upbringing of the child by the child's family. The child must be nurtured properly and taught to distinguish the right from the wrong. How can you teach what is right and wrong if you don't identify the right and the wrong?</div>

I'm not really saying it is ALL because of the TVs but she HARDLY read books and the books are, "Mr Small", "Mr Uppity" those kind of books.. if I am not wrong, it's the "Mr Men" books.<br>And she's only THREE years old and the school she goes to teach them "ABC" and "123" and reading. I don't think the books have the word "Stupid" or "Idiot" in them. And she don't go out frequently, due to the fact that her father is pursuing law and her mother is preggers.</i></div>

I remember I mentioned the whole family excluding my mother's side is <i>Nepalese? We CANNOT say any of those words that is just plain bad.

I don't think the books have the word "Stupid" or "Idiot" in them.

Sorry if you misunderstand me but I did not say her parents spout out vulgarities and I know your whole family is nepalese(I don't know what you trying to imply). I think I used the word MAYBE.<br>"I'm not really saying it is ALL because of the TVs..." What do you mean? I thought the question was, "Are the TV shows safe for kids to watch nowadays?"<br>About the school, books and going out, sorry, but they were just my examples and analogies.<br>Like I said I understand your concern. Its bad that a 3 year old can already learn the word 'stupid'. In fact I would think that girl is smart in a way. But nevertheless, just because of that, we can't actually say TV shows are not safe for kids. Maybe some shows are not suitable for certain ages that's all. But thats for the parents to supervise what their kids are watching, not banning the shows altogether. Maybe the question should be 'Are parents supervising their kids well enough?'<br><br></i></div>

Maybe you can continue trying, so whether Maya grows up into a prim and proper lady or a screwed up Ah Lian, you will know that at least you tried to help her.<br><br>Then you will have done your duty as a Sister!<br><br>You can't possibly force Maya to stop speaking unkind words, can you?

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, tv does has an impact on children. But can't totally blame on tv, as it's parents job to guide children through tv, letting know what is it all about, telling them what's right and wrong. Tv til now is still a popular source of entertainment and as far as i can see, Singapore tv programmes and those programmes that are aired in Singapore seems to be ok, it not, very safe.</div>
