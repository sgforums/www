"You know, Maya, came to me this afternoon and said this "You don't love me, you love only Weiling didi." and I said, "No. Who bath you, who tie your hair, who bring you to school? Me right?

She is also a BIG TATTLE-TALE. No offence but seriously. I will only just say, "You don't behave, I will pita you!" (Pita is beat in Nepalese) then you know what will happen? She will run off to my grandma or grandpa and say this, "Weiling didi said she will pita me if I am naughty..." and her voice TRAILS and she start to cry. Then they will scold me.<br>And then that time, I scolded her, she ran off to my grandpa and said, "Weiling didi scolded me because I beat her..." and her voice TRAILS off AGAIN and she start to cry AGAIN.
