              <p>Pata.. Cut TS some slack I'm stating the fact that living in sg
              lifestyle doesn't give you the luxury of being at home most of the
              time. That's y u hire a maid to help out in the house. </p>
              <p>That's y more ppl are doing O.T's n more O.T's. I'm nt sure abt
              TS case budden even normal 8 hrs mon to fri by the time he reaches
              home hes already dead beat. Come back make sure everything in order
              etc catch up with things in the hse then its time for bed. Then

              <p>You said your maid acted like normal even after the incident, how could she claim to be stunned, when she doesn't even show remorse? If possible ask your neighbours (those who were present and saw her f-ed up attitude) to back you up in your complaint to all the sectors.</p>

              <p>i am truly sorry about the loss of your beloved pet, and i do believe that the maid should be held responsible for such a sickening act.</p>
              <p>however, pardon me for saying this, but please, don't associate animals as 'son' or things like that. i'm not inhumane. i am all for the prevention of cruelty towards animals, but it's just horrific to see people refer to their pets as 'son' or 'daughter' or the like. i know how it feels to be greatly attached to a pet for many years. it's a nice thing to have a pet, someone you can talk to, pour your heart out to when you're feeling depressed. knowing well they don't really understand but at least they won't argue.</p>
              <p>but still, i know many are gonna go against me for saying this, it's sickening to see people refer to their pets as if they are kin.</p>
              <p>once again i extend my condolences, and may the long arms of the law serve justice.</p>

              <p>I like to see you train a dog on how to piss or poop in the correct place. I am not saying that it cannot be done. It takes alot of time to train dogs or cats to do so.</p>
              <p>Irresponsible owners are the type who lets his dog poop in public and not removing the waste. The same goes for owners who have dogs but could not control them from attacking people. Same goes for owners who let their pets go around sick or abandoning them when they are not cute like they do when they were puppies or kittens.</p>
              <p>As for the walking the dog part, lets face reality: Owners still need to work and concentrate on family or some other important tasks. As what i read so far, the maid has no qualms in the beginning about walking the dog or taking care of it. When i had a dog, i brought it out for a walk at night or when i go for a jog during weekends. I cant be spending time walking the dog in the day when there is money that needs to be earned.</p>

              <p>I believed TS spent lots of time with his pet too. I do have a pet dog and I usually bring him out for walks twice a day and my sis will brings him out for a 3rd time at times for him to answer to nature calls, but that doesn't means I do not have time for my pet dog as I believed all dog lovers will also play with their pets at home. Just like what Man!x posted, we also need to work and do our own stuff, I believed no one dare to say they spent 24hours a day with their pets or do just one thing they like as everybody has to spend time to do things like housework, play with pets, spend time with family members, school, friends etc.</p>
              <p>I believed the few people posting rude replies are just adding wound to TS for their own pleasure, it clearly shows that they are a selfish lot of people whom view issues non-objectively and have a narrow sight.</p>

              <p>L.lawliett79 has no dog experience but her views are way logical and better than those who posted rude comments. Man!x with dog experience posted logical and reasonable views too, so it doesn't means having no dog experience cannot post objective and sensible views.</p>
              <p>To me the theory of having no quality time needs to get tamagochi sounds like the person posting that only has tamagochi as next of kins, relatives and friends as I do not believed this person spent 24 hours everyday with his next of kins, relatives and friends, otherwise if any of his/her beloved passed away, he/she will have his/her next of kins, relatives or friends blood on hi/her hands and he/she will be condemned eternally. I believed any sensible and objective humans will agreed on that based on the person posting of tamagochi's theory.</p>
