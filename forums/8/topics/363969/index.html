              <p><span>On 29th April 2009, at 10pm Singapore time, My
                  beloved son, Star, (a Siberian husky dog) was brought down by this maid
                  to pee before his sleep but today when returning back to home from the
                  pee, the maid entered the lift and closed the lift door with Star still
                  outside the lift and Star was brutally pulled up and hanged at the top
                  side of the lobby lift door being choked by his collar. The maid did
                  not informed me immediately so that I can go down to the lobby
                  immediately to save him, instead she sat on the 3rd floor (I lived on
                  the 2nd floor)and gave wrong information to the security guard doing
                  his rounds on the 3rd floor by saying Star is under the lift hole
                  instead of hanging at the ground floor, therefore the security guard
                  has to inform the condo management committee to get permission to call
                  the civil defence for the rescue. It was about 20mins before 3rd floor
                  neighbor came and alerted me and I went up to the 3rd floor with the
                  maid shifting the blame to the security guard saying he was the one
                  making the lift went up to the 3rd floor (this maid is cunning, during
                  the afternoon about 4pm, she was complaining to my mom about my dog and
                  wishing him to die soon when my dog never bothered, bark or bite her at
                  all. She knew my dog leashed is those flat nylon retractable type
                  running 3m long, so if she went to the 2nd floor, my dog will not be
                  hanged and if she went to the 4th floor, the leashed will snapped and
                  my dog will not died, so this maid chose to goes up to the 3rd floor).
                  After a while, the security guard went down to wait for the civil
                  defence and found my dog hanging at the ground floor lift door and he
                  informed me quickly, when I rushed down to the lift lobby, Star was
                  dead hanging there :-(
                  <br> <br>She has so many ways to save Star (Pressing the 'Open' button, used
                  her hand to block the lift door sensor, borrowed a pair of scissors
                  from the 3rd floor neighbors to cut the leash, press the 1st floor
                  button for the lift to go down immediately) and yet she did nothing at
                  all.
                  <br> <br>I was saddened to see Star dead hanging there with white foam and
                  blood hanging from his mouth. I hold him and my neighbor unlock the
                  collar and I brought him down immediately but he has no more heart beat
                  already. :-(
                  <br> <br>He was hanged at 10:08pm and dead at about 10:19pm Singapore time
                  (based on the CCTV recording time) and yet the maid still trying to
                  defend herself saying she has nothing to do with it when I bought her
                  to watch the CCTV on the next day. She regarded the CCTV capture on
                  Star struggling for 11mins before passing away as another episode of a
                  TV drama.
                  <br> <br>Initially she used the excuse saying it was the security guard's
                  fault and she was too stunned to do anything but when Star was dead for
                  after an hour, she can returned home turning on the water heater, test
                  the water temperature, have a warm shower, combed her hair and then
                  turn on the airconitioner (I let her have her own room instead of those
                  storeroom, and also allowed her to turn on the aircondition as she has
                  mentioned she can't sleep in hot weather even with fan, and she doesn't
                  closed the room door as she said if closed the door, the airconditioner
                  will gets too cold to sleep) and went to bed, the next morning, she
                  woke up (I did not slept the whole night) like nothing has happened,
                  made her hot coffee, took her breakfast and sit there relaxing. Her
                  duty at my home was to mop the living once in the morning and once at
                  night and hand washed 3 set of baby clothes and the daytime she was
                  sleeping at my mom-in-law's home even though she was supposed to take
                  care of my baby girl, she lied to my mom saying she has too much work
                  at my home so my mom allowed her to sleep. Imagine she took 1.5hours to
                  mop a 300sqft living room in the morning and I have to wait for her to
                  get ready to go to my mom-in-law's place and we got back home at 7+pm a
                  night, so how busy can she gets when my mom-in-law is the one cooking
                  for the maid to eat during weekdays and I am the one cooking for her
                  during weekend.
                  <br> <br>I have regard her as a family member, buying nice clothing for her
                  and her son in Jakarta, buying her favourite Ya Kun kaya toast and
                  coffee every weekend, consulted her what she likes to have for her
                  meals and her favourite is mutton, chicken rice, mee soto and cod fish,
                  I bought those for her
                  too. When she asked for a higher salary as she mentioned she has
                  6yrs of experience in Singapore, I gave her the salary without
                  negotiating and I have even bought those $10 calling cards for her
                  (fully paid by me) to call her family
                  every 1.5-2weeks. I noticed she enjoyed gambling a lot, never failed
                  to bet on 4D, ToTo, lottery etc. When it came to work, she damaged
                  quite a number of household stuff and furniture yet I still did not
                  raised my voice with her at all but yet she murdered my Star. My
                  friends, relatives and colleagues consoled me saying Star blocked a
                  tragedy for my baby girl from this maid but I still cannot accept that
                  he was murdered in this manner. Star is so human like and he even went
                  to lick my baby girl when she falls down while walking and the maid
                  just stand there laughing whenever my girl falls down. Imagine a
                  Siberian husky whom did not get jealous on my baby girl and still
                  protects her like an older brother but yet the maid as a human being
                  cannot match that. He will rushed to the kitchen to get me to tend to
                  my girl when she woke up from her sleep too...
                  <br> <br>I am trying to send in the evidence and statement of the security
                  guard to MOM, hopefully this time round they will protect employers
                  like us.
                  <br> <br>I sincerely hope none of the good employers here will hired her and
                  let future tragedies happened (she may targets young kids and let them
                  injured or drowned in the pool and pretend is a mishap), this post is to cautious potential employers from facing the same mishap.<br> </span></p>

              <p>TehJarVu, I have reported to the MOM, police and AVA, SPCA cannot do anything as advised by them. Police doesn't seem keen and AVA currently investigating, hopefully they will bring justice to Star and also let the maid know this is a law governing country.</p>

              <p>The CCTV video capture is in fast forward mode as the CCTV recorder is faulty. :( It is linked in Youtube.</p>

              <p>Tat's y i hate indo maid~~ Take things for granted n once they do wrong they wun admit their wrongs n give so many bloody excuses and claim that they r right. Luckily we r all still alive although my maid n grandma going to cause my granduncle death sooner or later. Hes coughin like mad still will buy coke like 5 cans can't b bothered to hide it put infrt of him. Being insane as he is he jus take watever is on e table n drank it down or go to e fridge n take e drinks himself.</p>
              <p>When dey bring him down for a stroll cum donno how many cigarettes shes givin him. Then come up already paster my grandma for more ciggis. She gave him say that hes to annoying. That was when he's jus gotten out of hospital due to asthma attack. The funny thing is they keep bringing him go see doc. Sick dun take care gib u see 1m times of doc also no use. Made me luff *Hope he stay longer in hosp or send to mental hospital. At least wun die in the hands of the both of them.  </p>
              <p>Mine was no better frm you. I made xtra pot of chicken soup for maid n her bf coz they dun take pork when i cook pai gu lian ou tang etc that contains pork. Or pizza i order still will share it w em but wat did i have in return..... (Cut long story short) She tells me your not the one that's paying me salary cannot order her to do things. I was like wtf. Doesn't pay to b nice i tell u these ppl should let em @#%!#^^$%^.</p>
              <p>Worst thing is my ma n grandma all side her say its sm matter dun bother my ma abt such a small thing.</p>
              <p>(Em refers to her and her bf/husband*reg in indo*  is staying w us. YES STAYING W US. Coz she told my grandma sobs stories. Hes a malay sg)</p>
              <p>My condolence to your doggie.Its protecting your baby gurl coz it knows that e maid has an evil heart. Nxt time bring ur dog out urself To prevent something like tis frm happening. Keep it in your heart and tell how ur husky protected ur baby when she's young that's e least you could do is pass on his legacy. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/love.png" alt="love.png"></p>
              <p>Another drama for another time.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><span>On 29th April 2009, at 10pm Singapore time, My beloved
                  son, Star, (a Siberian husky dog) was brought down by this maid to
                  pee before his sleep but today when returning back to home from the
                  pee, the maid entered the lift and closed the lift door with Star
                  still outside the lift and Star was brutally pulled up and hanged
                  at the top side of the lobby lift door being choked by his collar.
                  The maid did not informed me immediately so that I can go down to
                  the lobby immediately to save him, instead she sat on the 3rd floor
                  (I lived on the 2nd floor)and gave wrong information to the
                  security guard doing his rounds on the 3rd floor by saying Star is
                  under the lift hole instead of hanging at the ground floor,
                  therefore the security guard has to inform the condo management
                  committee to get permission to call the civil defence for the
                  rescue. It was about 20mins before 3rd floor neighbor came and
                  alerted me and I went up to the 3rd floor with the maid shifting
                  the blame to the security guard saying he was the one making the
                  lift went up to the 3rd floor (this maid is cunning, during the
                  afternoon about 4pm, she was complaining to my mom about my dog and
                  wishing him to die soon when my dog never bothered, bark or bite
                  her at all. She knew my dog leashed is those flat nylon retractable
                  type running 3m long, so if she went to the 2nd floor, my dog will
                  not be hanged and if she went to the 4th floor, the leashed will
                  snapped and my dog will not died, so this maid chose to goes up to
                  the 3rd floor). After a while, the security guard went down to wait
                  for the civil defence and found my dog hanging at the ground floor
                  lift door and he informed me quickly, when I rushed down to the
                  lift lobby, Star was dead hanging there :-(<br> <br> She has so many ways to save Star (Pressing the 'Open' button, used
                  her hand to block the lift door sensor, borrowed a pair of scissors
                  from the 3rd floor neighbors to cut the leash, press the 1st floor
                  button for the lift to go down immediately) and yet she did nothing
                  at all.<br> <br> I was saddened to see Star dead hanging there with white foam and
                  blood hanging from his mouth. I hold him and my neighbor unlock the
                  collar and I brought him down immediately but he has no more heart
                  beat already. :-(<br> <br> He was hanged at 10:08pm and dead at about 10:19pm Singapore time
                  (based on the CCTV recording time) and yet the maid still trying to
                  defend herself saying she has nothing to do with it when I bought
                  her to watch the CCTV on the next day. She regarded the CCTV
                  capture on Star struggling for 11mins before passing away as
                  another episode of a TV drama.<br> <br> Initially she used the excuse saying it was the security guard's
                  fault and she was too stunned to do anything but when Star was dead
                  for after an hour, she can returned home turning on the water
                  heater, test the water temperature, have a warm shower, combed her
                  hair and then turn on the airconitioner (I let her have her own
                  room instead of those storeroom, and also allowed her to turn on
                  the aircondition as she has mentioned she can't sleep in hot
                  weather even with fan, and she doesn't closed the room door as she
                  said if closed the door, the airconditioner will gets too cold to
                  sleep) and went to bed, the next morning, she woke up (I did not
                  slept the whole night) like nothing has happened, made her hot
                  coffee, took her breakfast and sit there relaxing. Her duty at my
                  home was to mop the living once in the morning and once at night
                  and hand washed 3 set of baby clothes and the daytime she was
                  sleeping at my mom-in-law's home even though she was supposed to
                  take care of my baby girl, she lied to my mom saying she has too
                  much work at my home so my mom allowed her to sleep. Imagine she
                  took 1.5hours to mop a 300sqft living room in the morning and I
                  have to wait for her to get ready to go to my mom-in-law's place
                  and we got back home at 7+pm a night, so how busy can she gets when
                  my mom-in-law is the one cooking for the maid to eat during
                  weekdays and I am the one cooking for her during weekend.<br> <br> I have regard her as a family member, buying nice clothing for her
                  and her son in Jakarta, buying her favourite Ya Kun kaya toast and
                  coffee every weekend, consulted her what she likes to have for her
                  meals and her favourite is mutton, chicken rice, mee soto and cod
                  fish, I bought those for her<br> too. When she asked for a higher salary as she mentioned she has
                  6yrs of experience in Singapore, I gave her the salary without
                  negotiating and I have even bought those $10 calling cards for her
                  (fully paid by me) to call her family<br> every 1.5weeks. I noticed she enjoyed gambling a lot, never failed
                  to bet on 4D, ToTo, lottery etc. When it came to work, she damaged
                  quite a number of household stuff and furniture yet I still did not
                  raised my voice with her at all but yet she murdered my Star. My
                  friends, relatives and colleagues consoled me saying Star blocked a
                  tragedy for my baby girl from this maid but I still cannot accept
                  that he was murdered in this manner. Star is so human like and he
                  even went to lick my baby girl when she falls down while walking
                  and the maid just stand there laughing whenever my girl falls down.
                  Imagine a Siberian husky whom did not get jealous on my baby girl
                  and still protects her like an older brother but yet the maid as a
                  human being cannot match that. He will rushed to the kitchen to get
                  me to tend to my girl when she woke up from her sleep too...<br> <br> I am trying to send in the evidence and statement of the security
                  guard to MOM, hopefully this time round they will protect employers
                  like us.<br> <br> I sincerely hope none of the good employers here will hired her and
                  let future tragedies happened (she may targets young kids and let
                  them injured or drowned in the pool and pretend is a mishap), this
                  post is to cautious potential employers from facing the same
                  mishap.<br></span></p>

              <p>I really wish for you to get a good worker, it is tough for you, I can understand how you feel :(</p>
              <p>When I get this maid, she has 6yrs of working experience with one employer in Singapore before and she has to take the lift daily for that 6yrs in Singapore. This puzzled me why she doesn't used her hand to block the lift doors when she has been doing that when I first moved into this new place and I even asked her how come she knew how to block the lift sensors and she said proudly that she has been taking lifts many times. :(</p>

              <p>Thanks. If Star passed away due to old age or illness, I can accept it but he was gone in such a brutal manner. :(</p>
              <p>The youtube clip showed that he was grasping his last breathe by moving his forearms and tail after hanging for few mins :(</p>
