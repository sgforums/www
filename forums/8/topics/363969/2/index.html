              <p>Is there anyway or law to get the maid prosecuted for
                  negligence? Or cruelty to animals?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>A senior guy from AVA mentioned that if this is an accident, cannot be considered cruelty to animal and I have posed a question to him on an article in The Straits Times last week which stated that a pest control company has been fined $1000 for causing a dog death due to negligence and such cases are categorised as composition case but his reply to me was 'I don't know'.</p>
              <p>Let's see how they are going to investigate this case and how they conclude the results, whether whatever the maid said is considered 101% truth or they will analysed properly.</p>
              <p>I do have a letter from the maid whereby she wrote and passed it to the maid agency stating she is offering 2 mths of her salary as compensation for her negligence (She wrote that after leaving my family for about 3 weeks), I hope AVA will not views this letter as she is being pressured to write it as I do not know where is the maid once she left our family. I am saying this as some of the reasonings they gave with regards to this case are not logical like the maid education level as well as the maid may not be able to stop the lift even though I have informed them that this maid used the lift more than anyone in my family added up together as she has to use the lift daily during her previous 6years of working life in Singapore for a family living on the 13th floor of a HDB flat.</p>
              <p>I will wait and see, if I received any response which is not logical and impartial from them, I will escalate this matter to the next higher authority.</p>

              <p>More like she can't b bothered mayb in e darkest corner of her mind wish tat for ur doggie to b dead i guess. Since she have takenÂ  lifts so many times no reason for her to not know how to stop/block e lift or even panick she would have run out wun she. I hope she get punished dearly dog also have a life. I tell u e law it too lenient against maid like her or those foreigner.</p>
              <p>So many went off scoff free. All e reports abt maid abusing etc. Not much punishment onli sent em bak. While to us say wrong thing tio fine if nt tio jail. So unfair....</p>
              <p>If get u should get a 1st time maid. Worked to long already dangerous plus she knows 'her gang' already in sg kinda dangerous who knows wat she might do.</p>

              <p>Yes I agreed with you. In fact those hints I got from the authorities were similar and something like not nice to offend the other countries, so it seems like everything bad is deal with at our expense.</p>
              <p>We are thinking to escalate internally within the country first and if the verdict is not passed impartially, will write to others for help.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless at this point of time, I am still confident about our legal system, hopefully I will not be disappointed in near future.</p>

              <p>Thanks my friend. My wife's friend facing a run away maid issues and got into trouble, has spoken to MOM and her MP but nothing done for her, seems like no justice.</p>
              <p>I will definitely seek your help if I need a petition, probably will start an email petition if the authorities do not give an impartial verdict. I believed the relevant authorities in my wife's home country are more influential than my maid home country, hopefully we do not need to resort to escalate until there to seek justice in this country which may let other countries in the world laughed at the system here.</p>
              <p>We just want this thing to be settled impartially and the maid be punished for what she has done.</p>

              <p>Nope, never at all, even the following day before sending her back to the maid agency, she was expressionless while watching the cctv clip, I wanted to see whether she is repentant or not and she still pushed the blame to the security guard in a harsh tone.</p>

              <p>Next time employ maid, I think it's better we lay out clearly
              their job scope so at least maybe some will turn down the job if
              there are things they don't want to do... I dunno lar, I've never
              been involved in the maid employment process before.</p>

              <p>Yes, we did interviewed her via webcam and phone as well as showing Star's photos to her, she smiled happily over the webcam and said no problem at all. In fact most of the time we are the one taking care of Star only unless we were caught up with work.</p>
              <p>Will not get any maid anymore.....too dangerous.</p>

              <p>We were the ones taking care of Star, even if it was drizzling, we will still walk Star ourselves (Star has his own raincoat).</p>
              <p>The maid only need to change the water dish (most of the times done by me as she pretend to forget), poured out the roast pork rice on Star's dish (usually done by my wife) and also bring him out to pee (lasting 3-5mins) before Star sleeps.</p>

              <p>Thanks Gem, you are good in these laws thingy.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately the Police told me this is not a criminal act so they will just play supporting roles to AVA. I have read throught Cap 224, Section 425 &amp; 428 but AVA guy told me this is not mischief. :(</p>
              <p>Frankly speaking, I have lodged a report on my possessions in my car being stolen while my car was in traffic police compound under their care since year 2003 but until now still no news and the police officer investigating this case already gone.</p>

              <p>Hey, this is odd. The maid could have, and should have, been arrested for sec 428 cap 224 [mischief by killing an animal]. Usually in cases involving animals the Police will investigate, but with inputs from AVA after examining the said animal [alive or otherwise].</p>

              <p>AVA is leading the investigations now. AVA and Police told me this can be an accident too. The maid is smart, she knew by pretending it is an accident and she was too stunned to do anything, nothing much can be done to her. But I do hope our relelvant authorities will proved her wrong this time, but who knows....sigh..... :-(</p>
