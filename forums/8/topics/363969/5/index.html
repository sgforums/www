Don't tell me you are able to handle all emergency and unexpected stuff which shown up suddenly? If you said you can, then you are a liar. simple as that.<br><br>You have yet to tell me too what's the point of following dogs and bangladesh workers around and observing them peeing and making racist remarks on bangladesh workers when you have spare time to do other more meaningful things??</p>

              <p>enuff said?? an "accident"?? i don't think so. anyone who "accidentally" killed an animal/someone wouldn't react so calmly after that incident, and wouldn't NOT do anything to save that animal/someone.</p>
              <p>even when stunned, she should have had some reaction, even screaming is fine, but she didn't.</p>
