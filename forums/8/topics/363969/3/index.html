              <p>Firstly, it is a nice dog. My friends have 2 of those and I know how close you must be to the dog because my friends treat them better than she treats us.</p>
              <p>If the maid does it on purpose, she must be punished just that any person who abuses stray cats, they are punishable by the law. But however the law gives the benefit of the doubt to the accused unless you can prove otherwise. And up till now, what you can provide is that you FEEL that the maid does it on purpose. How do you REALLY KNOW she was not really stunned? Assumptions and accusations made in the moment of anger and grief are not going to help at all, I am afraid.</p>
              <p>Leave it the authorities to investigate. If they say, it is an accident, It is an accident. By telling us you feel otherwise is not going to change things and honestly, we should be fair to the maid too because she doesnt have the privilege to come to Sgforums and tell us her side of the story.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, do take care and I believe your dog has gone to a place where there is no more suffering.</p>

              <p>AVA is leading the investigations now. AVA and Police told me
              this can be an accident too. The maid is smart, she knew by
              pretending it is an accident and she was too stunned to do
              anything, nothing much can be done to her. But I do hope our
              relelvant authorities will proved her wrong this time, but who

              <p>I see... and I am genuinely sorry for the tragic loss of your dog. I hope that you do understand that all possibilities have to be considered in investigations, and that includes a possible accident resulting in your dog's death, even if there might be reasonable grounds for you to believe otherwise.</p>

              <p>That's my observations on her actions immediately after the incident and the next day which made me suspected she was not stunned. I never said 101% that she was not stunned as everyone entitled to analyse it. I did not made accusations (a pretty strong word from you), just sharing what has happened and what she could do during the incident and also how she reacted after the incident. That's all.</p>
              <p>I have even considered this is an accident and no choice but if you see the way she reacted and the way she quoted she was protected by SG law, that's why I hope the law will shown her what is justice.</p>
              <p>We did gave her opportunities to explain what happened after the incident, in front of many people, in front of the maid agency, but she only has one sentence which is the security guard is at fault. Maybe you know why she never want to tell her side of story except saying it is the security guard fault......</p>
              <p>I did mentioned I am leaving it to the authorities to investigate and waiting for outcome.</p>
              <p>Thanks for your kind words, I hope Star did went to a place where there is no more suffering according to you, thank you for that.</p>

              <p>Yes, that's why I hope to find out exactly what happened then by engaging the relevant authorities for investigations. If this is an accident, then this is Star's fate but if it is a mischief act, then no matter how heavy or light the punishment is, still have to let the person know this is a law govern country, the SG law doesn't protect her if she did something wrong. This are 2 things we try to achieve by engaging the relevant authorities.</p>
              <p>It was her reactions and things she did after the incident (warm shower, air-conditioner, hot coffee, breakfast, expressionless on the cctv clip and blaming the security guard  etc) prompted us to get suspicious as not a single apology even it is an accident.</p>

              press open button for the dog to enter the lift with her. How
              come in the cctv, the dog was like located quite some
              distance away from the lift. Shouldn't the dog be at a
              close distance with the maid or at the lift door ?</p>
              <p>but maybe it can an accident... she could be talking on phone or
              not paying any attention.</p>
              <p>My condolence...</p>

              <p>Yes, this is why I do not understand why she never block or press the open button as she has shown off to me that she knew how to block the lift sensors before.</p>
              <p>She doesn't has a mobile phone, likely not paying attention if it is an accident.</p>
              <p>Thanks for your kind words.</p>

              <p>I think its damning evidence on the video that she did it on purpose. She couldnt be that stupid or blind to realise that the dog wasnt in the lift yet or in front of her. Maybe its hard to prove in the court of law, but negligence is DEFINITELY there!</p>
              <p>Perhaps she's a Muslim and do not like dogs because of certain restrictions. She should brought it up. However even God states that man should treat animals humanely cause they are lesser beings, without the same thought process like we humans do.</p>

              <p>This is what I have thought too especially her actions at home after this incident, I wonder how can a person under shocked will be able to turn on water heater, test the water temperature and have a warm shower followed by turning on the air conditioner and sleep? And worst still, not feeling apologetic at all the next day and made herself a cup of hot coffee and have her breakfast whereas me and my wife did not even had our breakfast at all.</p>
              <p>Maybe we treat her too well and always let her have her meals before us and maybe becos of this, she transformed herself as employer instead......</p>
              <p>I do not know why she smiled happily and said no problem when she saw Star's photos and we told her that at times she will need to take care of Star when my wife and me are tied up with work or the baby. We did not set the expectations wrongly as during the interview, 2 staff at the maid agency were present too.</p>

              <p>I am afraid not Daisuke-kun,I said this because Star is a human friendly husky and he loved humans, he can played with young kids and none of the young kids whom played with him were afraid of him, he was simply too kind in nature, there were only two times I saw him being fierce when he was protecting my wife twice from being bitten by a medium size brown stray dog.</p>

              <p>Pata.. Cut TS some slack I'm stating the fact that living in sg lifestyle doesn't give you the luxury of being at home most of the time. That's y u hire a maid to help out in the house. </p>
              <p>That's y more ppl are doing O.T's n more O.T's. I'm nt sure abt TS case budden even normal 8 hrs mon to fri by the time he reaches home hes already dead beat.

              <p>Sad to say nowadays maid practically runs the whole hse. You can nvr guage how a person heart is until its too late.  Its nt everyday TS is able to bring the dog down for a stroll. Its jus so happen on this perticular day that the dog die under the hands of the maid. If there's responsibilities shouldn't it b the handler at the point of time which handle the dog 100%? Jus like those racing horse handler. *abit far off topic*</p>
              <p>No doubt its a shared responsibilities. If TS got bring his dog down for a stroll in e night or on weekends i think hes doing his best already. I'm nt sure how it goes on exactly. Onli TS knows it better.</p>
