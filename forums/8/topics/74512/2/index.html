It's a cheap production?

But ONCE the ghost shows up..? LAUGH until like don't know what or can't even bear to see..?<br><br>So personally, I think sometimes what you can really figure out can scare you more?<br><br>Talking back about 'Blair Witch Project'... I think it was quite a success because....<br><br>1. The ability for it to come up with such a good 'quality' (though some might not agree with me...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">&gt;) even though it's a cheap production...<br><br>2. The failure to produce the ghost / witch's image in a way reflects on the inability of the students to capture it on film.... Which further adds mystery to this project...<br><br>I think the show might suits people who are more of gamers who play PC games and such in 1st person's camera view?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Personally, I do have quite a liking for such kinda show?

Basically, in Ancient China when people died, sometimes their family members want to bury their bodies in their birthplace (Jia Xiang). So they employ some people who actually carry the bodies of these corpses from a place to another. One of these groups actually managed to make a technique to string the corpses together and drag them... without using much strength... and rumours flew...<br><br>Vampire:<br>The medieval vampire was actually a myth created by europeans. There were many cases of rapes in those days and in order to prevent young noblewomen from getting into trouble, a story was weaved. "The vampire is a handsome blood sucking monster who hunts women at night." Well, later, somehow they start to add female vampires to the stories.<br><br>Werewolf:<br>The earlier werewolves were just lunatics, (and lunatics don't shave.. dont cut their hair and nails either) and they attack people by biting and clawing. Later, the common people believed these people were possessed... and start killing them in their sleep... (Ahem.. cruelty to nuts)<br><br>Monsters:<br>Many monsters and beasts were actually stories made to frighten children to keep the children at home when night falls as parents would not be able to find their children and protect them from danger.<br><br>Ghosts:<br>Many apparitions were actually images caused by signals and eye problems.... Well, there were many who argue about this, BUT for Christians who believed there are ghosts.... *ahem* the Bible mentioned nothing of their existence except the Holy Ghost.</div>
