Amazing"<br><br>Honestly, just my opinion, (World Idol is cancelled by the way, no point, making 10 losers out of 11 winners), if Taufik had gone on to World Idol, at least he has some standard and his voice is more versatile and stronger compared to Sly. Can you imagine if SLy had chosen the wrong songs (he suits Chinese songs &amp; rock the best) and sang in World Idol and pitching went wrong when he tries falsettos i.e the Phantom of the Opera song<br><br>Anycase, Taufik prob will release his first album, prob venture into the Malaysian &amp; Indonesian markets, do some cameos in drama serials....whereas Sly may rise faster as he has the chinese rock appeal. The marketing agent just have to promote him to Taiwan....Hong Kong...<br><br>just my 2 cents' worth</div></blockquote>malaysian music industry is more complex with their hordes of stars....taufik wont last long there.....he got more chance in singapore....</div>

I don't even know Douglas exist man.. I'm not being biased, but from a prospective point of view.. Singapore market is very small and limited, u want to survive by singing English and Malay songs, really have to work hard..<br>So Taufik is not bad, i hope he's the exceptional..<br>For Sly, if he improves a bit more and the company packaged him very well, he can really go to the Chinese Market, just Taiwan alone... wow..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a SLY supporter but I have thought Taufik should have won episodes before the final showdown. SLY has not been picking the right songs and improving enough. TAUFIK showed a great deal of character to rise from the ashes and wowed a lot of people for his performance. I dare say that SLY does have the X-factor. There is something special with with singing. His rendition of Bon Jovi's "It's My Life" is ridiculous, I must admit. However, it was chosen by the judges and he had not much choice.</div>

I tink he should be sent to World Idol even though he may not any chance 'getting good grades' in World Idol. He can learn a thing or two in World Idol. Come on, even if we put the BEST s'porean singer, u tink he/she'll make much impact in World Idol? So since we already have our S'pore Idol, might as well put him there. Besides, Taufik IS rather talented (and so is Sly).</div>
