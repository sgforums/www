Amazing"<br><br>Honestly, just my opinion, (World Idol is cancelled by the way, no point, making 10 losers out of 11 winners), if Taufik had gone on to World Idol, at least he has some standard and his voice is more versatile and stronger compared to Sly. Can you imagine if SLy had chosen the wrong songs (he suits Chinese songs &amp; rock the best) and sang in World Idol and pitching went wrong when he tries falsettos i.e the Phantom of the Opera song<br><br>Anycase, Taufik prob will release his first album, prob venture into the Malaysian &amp; Indonesian markets, do some cameos in drama serials....whereas Sly may rise faster as he has the chinese rock appeal. The marketing agent just have to promote him to Taiwan....Hong Kong...<br><br>just my 2 cents' worth</div></blockquote>u think too highly of sly....much too highly. if u can sing, u can be abit ugly, if u can't u must be very good looking. he has neither.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well the norwegian idol kurt nielsen looks like a hobbit but he can really really sing. And it's the voice tt matters, in the end image is bot everything. People would buy a cd if the singer is really good. Sylvester's voice at most is just mediocre.</div>
