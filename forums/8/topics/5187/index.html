            <div class='col-md body'>Drugs....I believe that some people should try them out at least once man...seriously.  We've all heard that they are bad and shit like that, but most people won't really know...onli from what the media and Gov say...<br><br>I have tried out acid, X (more powerful one than they have here...1 pill got me going for 24 hours straight man)...weed(who hasn't tried it...)<br><br>But I have onli tried them...The acid onli once...to me not fantastic...<br><br>X-twice, but fantatic both times...superb!<br><br>Weed, many times but nothing much ah...<br><br>Anyway I stopped already..I onli experiment onli to see myseklf what all the hoo ha was about...Ok ah, feels good, but I dun need them to make me happy or have fun.  Never tried them since and won't want to...As for other people taking them, I think they do it to be cool and be in or after they get addicted to it...I can see how people can become addicted to them...thank god I got very strong will power man..or else I'm junky already...ha ha:-)<br><br>But for repeat users, they really doing themselves a disservice. Especially with glue..it fries brain cells better htan the processed drugs...:-8<br><br>My advice to kids...try it once, maybe twice, then dun try it anymore...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I myself, have tried twice<br><br>Basicly, being a anti-authority person, and seeing that people who take don't act as f*** up like the way the authorities explain it. I thought, I had to try, just to know.<br><br>Anyway, after trying, you will view people like suharto in a different way, you will tell him to try instead of asking why. And obviously people who don't do drugs (I was one before I took right?) always look down on those who do, but really, don't, because you wouldn't understand... It has changed my perspective...<br><br>My advice:<br>if you're the kind of person who's always going "oi, what to do, damn boring, what? play sports? dowan ler... what? read book dowan ler..." then don't take it, as it will take over your life in the sense that it is the only thing u find enjoyable and it will screw up your life, in the sense that you'll become an ass and not do anything productive.<br><br>but if you do carry a clear mind that, there are many more things to do in life, and you're a person who does them, then if you want, there is no harm trying, just make sure u got friends who know the side-effects and how-to around you when you're taking, because it can be dangerous.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to take and I found some dark secrets of the inside of this world.... (IÂ’ve tell some in "Singaporean Drug Dealer?" forum)<br>In the past my thinking is "f*** off to drugs", anti-drugs make me laugh; I had never expect that it would get in my life just like many around here. Actually I didn't really quit it. I'm not addicted but I just don't want to quit. At least I don't take it as often as in the past.... Here I would like to share my experience, let you people understand more about it, you will understand why IÂ’m feeling this after listening...But before reading it, I would like to warn you first, by know it, you may want to try it. So if you can't resist the temptation of curiosity don't read it.<br><br>"Ecstasy", "E", "X", "XTC", "M", "Adam", "bean", "roll" are street names of MDMA. It has the ability to make you feel strong feelings of comfort, empathy, and connection to others. It's in tablet, capsules and powder form but so far, IÂ’ve only seen them in tablets. Its only big danger is impurity. Big time players took 3 or more pills at a time which is quite normal but if it is impure, like PMA which is sold as fake MDMA, 3 is enough to kill. Only 2/100,000 people will die taking due to extreme negative reactions with their bodies, which is rare. Most people who take MDMA died because they don't know how to take it safety. They died of overheating, dehydration, over hydration and lack of salt.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Don't take more than one pill or take it more than once a week.<br>Your body builds a tolerance to MDMA very quickly. If you really feel<br>that you are not getting the effect you are wanting after having fully<br>completed a trip, don't take more next time. Don't underestimate it or get impatient with it. MDMA sometimes has a strange way of making you think that it isn't doing anything to you. This can be especially strong the second time around when you may feel<br>it is not kicking in fast enough or is not as dramatic as the first<br>time. Don't take another pill to compensate just give it some<br>time. It will most likely come through for you in the end. Also<br>remember that every trip will have differences. Don't look for the<br>same thing to happen again and again, because it won't. Just explore what is happening to you right then. Mild physical activity like dancing, or sensory stimulus like good music or beautiful surroundings can help set you off, and will have a better effect than a higher dose usually. Some people are considerably more sensitive to MDMA than others. Be careful if you are using MDMA for the first time, start with small, take half. MDMA generally contains an average of between 75-100mg MDMA. To feel something, you need 30mg. For small and sensitive people, 50-75mg. For normal people, 75-125mg. For large and unsensitive people, 125-175mg. The onset is 20-90 minutes (depending on your stomach content), coming up 5-20 minutes, Peak 2-3 hours, coming down 1-2 hours and hangovers 3-24 hours.<br><br>This is what you will get after taking, extreme mood lift, increased willingness to communicate (can even talk things out), increase in energy (can do more pull-ups), ego softening, feelings of comfort, belonging, closeness to others (like everyone is your friend), feelings of love and empathy, forgiveness (beware, you may feel like confessing to your parents thinking that they will forgive you and your ex then regret later), increased awareness &amp; appreciation of music, increased awareness of senses, sensations bright and intense, urge to hug and kiss people. Good things is erectile disfunction and difficulty reaching orgasm, girls don't have to be afraid to play with guys (But.....). You will feel so good like after running 4.8km, lying on a soft, cold water bed, and stretch, that feeling for 1-3 hours during the peak.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everything you do will seems to be the extreme. If you watch a movie, you will be able to feel the emotions to the extreme. If you do housework, you will be able to do it clean and with a satisfying feeling. If you go to the park (if you are not afraid to be caught), you will feel extreme fresh. Although while playing, it will cause erectile disfunction and difficulty reaching orgasm (guys dick can't stand), some people said that if you took vigra, and have sex, it would be climax through the whole process.<br>Everyone who had tried MDMA will think that they had benefit from it, which is how great the feeling is. Even it's once a lifetime you will think that it is worth it, and you want to encourage people to tried it at least once a lifetime.<br>To prevent dehydration, drink more water. To prevent overheating, take breaks. To prevent over-hydration don't drink to much water. To prevent loss of salt and gastric, eat potatoes chips. To prevent teeth-clench chew a chewing gum. Do not drink alcohol, or mix it with cocaine, Ice (Meth), crack, MAOI. They will kill you!<br><br>Well theses are the good effects, of course there are bad effects too but IÂ’m too tired to type more now. So tired that I don't even know if IÂ’ve repeated things.... if I had, I apologies. If you want to know the bad effect, post it and IÂ’ll tell when IÂ’m free.<br></div>
