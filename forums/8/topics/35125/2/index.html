Since she's made it clear, whether or not it's the truth or she's just lying to herself, it's pretty much case closed for now.<br><br>However, I'm concerned about your emotional safety. If I may assume, I'm sure she enjoys your attention and friendship. However, as she clearly states it, it's only at a platonic level and the best way to be friends with her is to reciprocate the same platonic level. This is something that is extremely hard to do.<br><br>So if I were you, and I speak of my views only and does not necessarily reflect those of others', I would choose to either carry on wooing her because she is and will be the only person worthy of my affection, or I will go cold turkey altogether (pardon the crude description). Maybe I'm weak, or selfish, but I will not settle for a platonic friendship that I know I am not capable of. I know my limits. If you are able to be totally honest with yourself and feelings and reason with yourself such that you can only be good friends together and still feel happy, then you're either worth a kow-tow from me, or you're just a fool.<br><br>Once strong feelings get in the way, logic takes a holiday. The Bahamas sounds good, I hear it say.</div>
