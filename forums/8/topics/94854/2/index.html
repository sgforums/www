            <div class='col-md body'>Recently, I saw an advertisement on television about some nonsense propaganda trying to persuade and influence the public to accept ex-criminals in the society so that they do not end up being social outcasts. It starts out with some mischievous rascal who pisses people off all the time, doing things like throwing stones at frogs or running into traffic, or at least something to that effect. Then, all of a sudden the scene fasts-forward to 20 years later and that asshole is now in jail because he broke the law. At the same moment, at home, his son asks his mother, "mummy, is daddy coming back tomorrow?" with voice full of sorrow and solemnity. Okay, so that means his asshole daddy is going to be released from prison the next day. The advertisement proceeds with the asshole father pretending to regret his past mistake and promise to turn over a new leaf. I was not paying much attention already because it was so meaningless and fake, but I vaguely remembered that the father was starting work as a barber or something (because criminals do not get good jobs). What still resounds in my head now is the caption of the whole campaign: "Help unlock the second prison..."<br><br>Alright, hold it right there. Let us analyse that line again. So we (assuming that you are not a crime offender yourself) are supposed to accept these criminals and see them in the same light as we see any other normal person. What is it we must do again, "help unlock the second prison"? WHAT SECOND PRISON ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT? By second prison, I assume that it means the public's skewed perception of these ex-criminals. It is our discrimination against them which is their abstract "second prison", after them being released from their "primary prison" of course. Oh, they cannot take social rejection. I guess the advertisers forgot something -- there is NO reason for us to make the world a better place for them.<br><br>News flash: People do not go into jail for no reason. If they are behind bars, they must have done something wrong. It is obvious that they have committed a crime and therefore, got their asses sent there. They chose to do something which was against the law on their own will and they were fully aware of the consequences, and now they expect people's sympathy!? To regret their mistake afterwards is another thing. It is immaterial. The main thing to keep in mind is these criminals committed offences voluntarily; nobody forced them to. Then there is the claim that "not all criminals commit crimes voluntarily; some are pressurised to do so, others are unintentional so we should at least be compassionate to these people". Okay, my bad then. So I guess that as long as they involuntarily committed a crime, that makes them innocent, right? They should be allowed to roam free even after killing a person, eh? Please. If they are technically innocent, they should not have gotten into prison in the first place. Let us face it. Voluntary or not, a crime is still a crime. Just because you were not aware of your own wrongdoing, does not mean that you are totally clean. It still does not change the fact that you are a criminal and get this right, CRIMINALS DO NOT DESERVE RESPECT.<br><br>And now the government is brainwashing us with bullsh*t propaganda with the mass media, asking the public not to isolate them for whatever reason. Hell if I know. Exactly what is the campaign aimed at?<br><br>In conjunction of this campaign, the government has carried out the "Yellow Ribbon Project" to help these criminals get back on their feet. The "Yellow Ribbon Project" is inherently nonsense. These criminals are to fold some yellow ribbon into pretty shapes and they are to be sold at 50 cents each to the public. The package reads: "This ribbon is hand-made by prison inmates. All proceeds will go to the Yellow Ribbon Fund." Maybe someone could enlighten me here, because I do not see how paying for these ribbons will "help unlock the second prison". Who in the world would want a stupid and probably diseased ribbon anyway? Adding insult to injury, these ribbons are ugly as hell and are half-assed handicrafts. What pisses me off most is the sheer number of people who go all their way out and purchase these ribbons. WAKE UP, PEOPLE. I do not claim to be a wise consumer but I know when I am being ripped off. What good can these ribbons possibly do us, and why are we perpetually paying these criminals to sit around and do nothing productive?<br><br>Every citizen who works pays taxes and part of these taxes goes to funding these criminal bastards. Yes, all that money just to serve them food, refurbish their cells every now and then and pay for their other miscellaneous expenditures like electricity, water supply, uniforms and toilet paper. They are literally enjoying free accommodation and good hospitality off our hard-earned cash for committing a crime, and they get away with it! Yet the government still continues to waste valuable resources on these parasites just to help and correct them. Where is the pay-off? You think when they come out of jail, they would contribute to the nation's economy and development? More like causing more trouble and wreaking more havoc. They should not be given a second chance because they are beyond help. They are not going to hold high-paying jobs regardless of how much of a qualified candidate they are because they have a crime record. Chances are they are not willing to undertake low-paying jobs because more often than not, they are already pretty aged when they are released from prison. So they end up being jobless, unemployed parasites. Oh yes, I can see how productive is that.<br><br>I am not going to be a biased, one-sided bigot on this issue either. Let us use some basic reasoning. When was the last time a criminal done any good for you or contributed anything beneficial to the society and country? Cannot think of any? Consider the flip side then -- when was the last time you hear about murder, rape, robbery, drugs trafficking or public assault? Almost every day. The people behind these crimes are none other than those bastards. The world in not as peaceful as you think it is. The more you help these idiots, the more rowdy they become and the next day, you wake up to find your car with a shattered windscreen with all your CDs stolen. Not likely? Just wait and see. The bottom line remains -- the last thing these criminals deserve is the approval of the public. They deserve every second of disrespect they get because they have earned it themselves. Besides, it is hard not to feel insecure when you KNOW that you are near a criminal. The government thinks a pathetic, touching advertisement about criminals is going to change everybody's opinion of these criminal assholes. Really, a catchy, rhetorical tag line like "help unlock the second prison" is not going to achieve anything. Stop the propaganda already; everyone can see right through the bullsh*t.<br><br>I would not be so pissed off if those yellow ribbons were folded by senior citizens or the disabled. At least I know I am helping people who are worthy of help. Not sh*t-eaters like prisoners. Help unlock the second prison? Over my dead body, assholes.<br><br>Have thoughts on this?</div>
