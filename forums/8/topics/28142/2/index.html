I told him its not impossible that i'll want to be dating him, so he also told me that he is not entirely uninterested in me either. See; honesty works here. Now we're still very close friends, slowly figuring out how to deal with everything and what we feel towards each other. We don't have "feelings" yet but we're teethering around the edge.<br><br>We didn't hide anything, or lie. Therefore if your girl in question is honest you can be honest with her as well. It helps.</div>

Since she tells you her problems..also shows that she trust you mah. If she dun like you at all..trust you at all..she won't have told you her problems. Maybe she really treated you as friends only. But if you were more patient..more nice to her..maybe slowly she may realise your good points and start to like you leh. Sometimes..love just comes to us so secretly..so slowly..without us realising it. I guess now she avoid you cos she was surprised..taken back..dunno what to do..what to say to you.<br>Of cos..you'll feel awkward and embarrassed..but since you're classmates to her. Then you'll have to try to pretend that nothing happen lor. You're a guy..be more gentleman..take the initative to talk to her. Tell her dun put what you say to heart. You won't force her to like you. And you really hope you two can be friends now if she can't accept you. Then maybe..if in the future..there is still chance to further the relationship from friends to something else..then..you know better..not to rush into things...and try testing the water first. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello PaulSmith, I totally understand how you're feeling. Have been in the same shoes for 1 1/2 years already. And in my case, not only does she reject me, but she comes and tell me about this other guy who's been interested in her for an even longer time than me. Well, this other guy started out as her close friend too. And I just heard the latest from her, she comes and tell me that I'm the first to know that she's probably going to get together with this very guy after so many years. I don't know whether to be devastated or to be honoured that I'm the first person to know......<br><br>Well, just wanna tell you, keep at it... you never know... you might end up the same as that guy I'm talking about... my point is, not everyone will end up like me, so best of luck to you!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am a true believer of pure platonic friendship...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> So whether can be girlfriend or not not important. When she is happy, I don't have to be there, but when she is down and needed someone, I will be the first to be there. I think that is more important than to keep pondering whether should be together or not. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
