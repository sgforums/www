But what right do people have, taking photos of people they DON'T KNOW, and post it, saying that their behaviors stink?<br><br>I remember a few weeks back or so, there was this photo of a family of three sleeping in the MRT, and they took up more space than supposed. There was also this big hoo-ha about how they were wrong etc when it was posted to STOMP.  But one poster was spot-on when he said that who knows what they have been through recently, that probably one of them were hospitalised, and the family is tired from the ordeal or something. In that case, shall we sympathise or shame them? I know its not MORALLY right to take up more spaces than required, but what happens if what the poster say is true? Then shall we sympathise with them? Or continue to shame them?<br><br>I believe the ugly habits of Singaporeans have existed way before this STOMP thing came into existence. Naming and shaming do not work. If so, then things like the Corrective Work Order will have been non-existent shortly after it was set up, because people would have been too shamed to litter for the fear of being caught. But it still exists, proving that there will always be people who do things like this, and no matter what you do, the problem will never be solved.</div>
