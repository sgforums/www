              <p>This happened last year. Till now it still gives me the creep.</p>
              <p>Ok it was a typical saturday night, there was this pasar malam at Jurong East, near the MRT station. it was on the big field, in a tentage.</p>
              <p>As you know, the pasar malam organizer will lay these rectangular wooden boards on the grass patch, as nobody wants to walk on wet muddy grass. Like in the pic below.</p>
              <p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/PasarMalam.JPG/280px-PasarMalam.JPG" alt="" width="280" height="210"></p>
              <p>I was with my parents n sister. As you know, pasar malam sell many irrestitable tasty snacks like taiwan sausage, fried fishballs, kueh tutu, wah koh kueh, keropok lekor, ramly burger etc.</p>
              <p>So my parents, being generous people, bought snacks for ourselves. I was muching on this taiwan sausage pierced on a satay stick. Very yummy. So we were walking n eating, n i was checking out the sight n sounds. Oooh, especially trying to spot hot girls...wow, i see many. Most were in short denim shorts or FBT shorts, kinda dressed casually like most singaporean teen girls.</p>
              <p>Alas, i tripped on the floorboard. If you look carefully at the picture above, these boards are often layed haphazardly. With their edges sticking out as they overlap one another. Some boards are warped too, when you walk over them u have a bouncy feeling on ur feet.</p>
              <p>My slipper somehow got caught in the edge of the wooden board. i lunged forward, but luckily i didn't fall flat to the ground, as i stabled myself with my fit n toned legs. (thanks to regular running n working out in the gym)</p>
              <p>I was munching on the satay sticked taiwan sausage in my mouth at that time. I can't imagine what will happen if i were to trip n fall flat to the ground. the satay stick in my mouth will probably impale my throat n cause me to bleed n die a painful death.</p>
              <p>After i picked myself up, i cursed the floorboards. Damn, why did they have to be so dangerous? From then on, i watched my steps as i walk, instead of always focusing on hot babes around me. And also no more satay stick impaled snacks while walking on pasar malam death traps.</p>
              <p>I am lucky to be alive to narrate this true experience. Have anyone of you ever tripped or almost tripped due to those floorboards?</p>

              <p>i too had a similiar experience but that was more than 10 years ago at a pasar malam in tampines.</p>
              <p>if you are familiar with tampinese, you will know that outside the MRT station, Tampines Mall and Century Square, there is a big patch of grass where many events were held including pasar malam, exhibitions or even events. i remember it was a weekday and the pasar malam had just ended. there were workers keeping the tentage and packing the place up.</p>
              <p>i was going to century square from the MRT and thinking that a "shortcut" through the grass patch with the wooden planks still on the ground would be ideal, i proceed to cut through the workers and head front towards my destination. morever, there were many others like me, cutting through. so i thought, no worries.</p>
              <p>half way through the area, suddenly there's a "boom!" everyone was stunned. i turned around and saw that huge piece of metal just behind me. if i'm not wrong, it's only a mere 1 metre away. a huge piece of metal, i believed almost 100kg that was used to hold the top of the tentage dropped and i could be killed if i was just a few seconds slower. imagine the impact, 100kg of metal dropping at a height of 10 metres... on my head... surely, i won't be able to be here to share my ordeal.</p>

              <p>i too had a similiar experience but that was more than 10 years ago at a pasar malam in tampines.</p>
              <p>if you are familiar with tampinese, you will know that outside the MRT station, Tampines Mall and Century Square, there is a big patch of grass where many events were held including pasar malam, exhibitions or even events. i remember it was a weekday and the pasar malam had just ended. there were workers keeping the tentage and packing the place up.</p>
              <p>i was going to century square from the MRT and thinking that a "shortcut" through the grass patch with the wooden planks still on the ground would be ideal, i proceed to cut through the workers and head front towards my destination. morever, there were many others like me, cutting through. so i thought, no worries.</p>
              <p>half way through the area, suddenly there's a "boom!" everyone was stunned. i turned around and saw that huge piece of metal just behind me. if i'm not wrong, it's only a mere 1 metre away. a huge piece of metal, i believed almost 100kg that was used to hold the top of the tentage dropped and i could be killed if i was just a few seconds slower. imagine the impact, 100kg of metal dropping at a height of 10 metres... on my head... surely, i won't be able to be here to share my ordeal.</p>
