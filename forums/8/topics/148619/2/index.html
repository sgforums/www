            <div class='col-md body'>I'll admit that it all seems a bit crass, but let's look at the reality of the situation.  Speaking broadly, Catholicism (I'm one, by the way) is more likely to be passed down from one generation to another, but denominations that recruit more actively are effectively more diligent in their charter to go forth and spread the Word, are they not?  Let's face it - Jesus Christ these days is in direct competition with Ronald McDonald, Levi Strauss and the latest doe-eyed stars from Hollywood.  Something's got to be done, and I honestly cannot remember the last time I saw a Catholic evangelising.<br><br>Ultimately, if the marketing is an exercise in getting more people into the Churches, and not anything else, I fail to see what the problem is.  As I mentioned earlier, fellows like Schlotfelt are pastors already, which makes the commitment to spreading the Word their primary characteristic - their marketing skills are a bonus.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem isn't with Schlotfelt (as I see it) but with the parties who were trying to hire him (or rather with the specific hiring policy adopted by these parties); I don't deny that this person may be everything he has claimed himself to be, that he has all of the primary characteristics that one would expect should be exhibited by a pastor, and that his 'marketing skills' are, as you have put it, 'a bonus'.<br><br>However, given the nature of the aforesaid hiring policy, it would be difficult to see how a rigorous application of it should be geared towards the hiring of pastors for whom 'marketing skills are a mere bonus', rather than their forte (that is, to the exclusion of other more primary skills).<br><br>The marketing of Christ (if it is to be conducted along the same lines as those of a secular advertising campaign) can certainly be expected to succeed in 'getting people into the Churches'; but my point is that the people who enter 'the Churches' because they are persuaded to do so by such a campaign, are probably going to be less convertible (so to speak) than they would otherwise be; and insofar as they are rendered 'less convertible' in this way, would their entrance into the Churches not be of any benefit to them; on the contrary, such persons would be prime candidates for being the sort of people who are likely to believe themselves regenerate, when they really are not.<br><br>Ben</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I get the sense that you're not making a distinction between marketing and selling, MrBach.  One way of distinguishing marketing from selling is that with selling, you're trying to get someone to buy something, while the idea of marketing is to get someone to buy into an idea.<br><br>Even so, selling in some way, shape or form, is an integral part of marketing.  I'm not saing that getting people into the Churches is the end in itself - it's simply a means to an end.<br><br>Okay, let's examine a secular model.  Supposing that M1 has just launched a new mobile phone plan that cuts your bill by 50%.  Once you've started using the plan, you find that it's the best thing that's ever happened to telephony, and you never look back.<br><br>What if M1 never advertised, though?  Would you have known about the plan, or would you have continued to pay twice as much as necessary through ignorance?<br><br>It comes down to this one simple point - before you get someone to buy in to your idea, you'll need to get their attention first.<br><br>Let's face it, in this day and age we're bombarded with information at an unprecedented level.  Can you imagine Christ today saying to Simon and Andrew, "Follow me and I will make you the fishers of men"?  They'd probably ask him to wait for the ad break.<br><br>The reality of the situation is such that if you do want to get someone's attention these days, you absolutely cannot afford to take a quiet approach because there are so many competing influences screaming at the top of their lungs.<br><br>Vis-a-vis your point about people being convertible, that's not any different from how it's always been.  After all, did everybody turn up to see and hear Jesus Christ for the express purpose of converting?  No - the vast majority of them turned up out of curiosity after hearing about miracles he had performed.<br><br>The miracles themselves were incidental, were they not?  Christ was spreading the word to repent and be saved, and strictly speaking, the miracles did not per se have anything to do with that message, did they?  Instead, they got people's attention so that Jesus could deliver the rest of the message.  Same thing applies here - the marketing's just to get people's attention so that the priests and ministers can deliver the Word.<br><br>Ultimately, not everybody who heard Christ himself was converted, and not everybody who steps into a church will be.  Effectively, it's a numbers game, and the more people you deliver the word to, the more you'll save, and if it takes marketing to get people into a position to hear the Word, so be it.</div>
