I suffer from clinical depression but with the daily medication that I've been taking for the past two years, I am on the road to recovery<br><br>I am still working in a publicly listed company and my performance has been deemed satisfactory.<br><br>In July, I applied for my Home Protection Scheme (the compulsory mortgage insurance for HDB flat) with the CPF but to my horror, it decided not to insure me.<br><br>This is unfair as there are provisions in existing insurance underwriting practices to negotiate a fair outcome for myself and other mental illness patients without jeopardising the benefits of the other insured members of the policy.<br><br>Yet the CPF has chosen not to make any of the provisions available to me.<br><br>According to the pamphlets of the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), 'research has shown that up to <strong>10 per cent of men and 20 per cent of women will suffer from depressive illness during their lifetimes.'</strong><br><br>These unfortunate people could include your friends or family members. If you have been reading the newspapers, you will discover that some popular stars also suffer from a mental condition due to stress or traumatic life experiences. With appropriate regular treatment they are able to lead normal working lives just like me.<br><br>By denying HPS coverage outright, what will happen if I die or suffer total and permanent disability as a result of a motor accident or a major illness such as cancer?<br><br>Because my mortgage insurance has been refused by the CPF, my husband will be unfairly burdened to take up the entire sum of the remaining mortgage, which now adds up to nearly $200,000.<br><br>There is no scientific evidence that mental patients have a statistically significant increased likelihood of accidental death or cancer incidence.<br><br>Moreover, I am not one of the seriously-ill patients residing in a psychiatric hospital on a long-term basis, if this is the stereotyped image that many readers visualise.<br><br>Certainly, my insurance risks are lower than other HDB flatowners who refuse to seek treatment or those who do not disclose their medical condition to the CPF.<br><br>It is therefore merciless to deny a single cent of mortgage insurance for mental patients like me. Such unfair treatment is definitely against our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's call for a more inclusive society.<br><br>The Singapore Association for Mental Health and Action Group for Mental Illness have declared that it is unfair for mental patients to be denied insurance coverage.<br><br>The CPF argues that it has to safeguard the economic interests of the CPF Board and its members. However, there are options available to extend HPS coverage to me without jeopardising the interests of others who are insured in the same pool.<br><br>Some common practices already adopted by most insurance companies for customers with pre-existing medical conditions include the following terms:<br><br>- Reduce the sum assured. For example, instead of 100 per cent cover for the outstanding loan amount, the CPF Board may wish to offer coverage for say, 80 per cent.<br><br>- Include a waiting period. For example, most life insurance policies in Singapore specify that death or permanent disability due to suicide is not covered within the first year after the commencement of policy but after the waiting period, death by suicide is still payable by the life policy.<br><br>- Specify a policy exclusion for the pre-existing condition. However, this clause is usually applicable for hospitalisation or critical illness policies and not applicable for life and permanent disability policies. Since the HPS is only claimable for death and permanent disability, I hope the CPF can follow the prevailing market practices as well.<br><br>- Increase the premium to a reasonable level and acceptable to both parties.<br><br>With so many options available, it makes me wonder why the CPF Board chose the simple yet cruel decision to deny me any coverage for the Home Protection Scheme. It could have applied some of the common industry practices listed above to negotiate a fairer deal for itself and me.<br><br>As a statutory board of the Singapore Government, I strongly urge the CPF Board to exercise its common sense and compassion and reinstate my HPS coverage with immediate effect.<br><br>This is in line with our country's vision for a more inclusive and compassionate society, as well as with current insurance practices.<br><br>Ng Siew Choo (Ms)<br></div>
