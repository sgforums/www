            <div class='col-md body'>To tell the truth, nope, especially since religion is one of the extra-sensitive subjects you can touch on, and there are variety of people with believes of different extremes of the scale. And when it comes to religion, it involves something you strongly believe in in order to be able to handle a discussion. Therefore, it would be difficult to keep a neutral stand. But Bangster, not trying to say that the comments which are slightly hostile are intentional, but try to tone it down a little or else it will turn into another flaming thread, which can get really nasty.<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well yes..  iagree with u two on this subject..<br>relevation.... i agree with u .. religion is a very complex thing with many twist and turns.... i will not deny the fact that many verses in the bible can infact be manipulated and be used against christianity and making the bible look contradicting... but this can be counterd by truely understand the bible inside out so as to perevent these attacks... therefore its difficult to make a statement from a neutral point of view... but at least try to be careful in saying certain things.....<br>and as for colette.. well u are right too...<br>so peace.........<br><br>------------------<br>i am a hardcore Metallic!
