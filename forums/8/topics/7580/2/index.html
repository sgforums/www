            <div class='col-md body'>How shall we define free thinking ??? Since a free thinker dun embrace any religon, can we say he/she worships their self ??? well I tink not ... It ain't always the case dat a free thinker is one bcoz he chose to be one. Family or society plays a big part as well.<br><br>I believe no matter wat ever your religion might be, when you die ... a proper burial is essential. Juz bcoz u dun haf God in your heart doesn't take away your right to a decent burial. A true blue free thinker might be satisfied wif a " simple " burial but dat doesn't mean his/her family or friends can't initiate sumthing better eh ...<br><br>It wld be a misunderstanding to say dat free thinkers are scientific or modern. Its not as if free thinkers are scientologists you know. I wun categorise it as a religion but its still a choice made and I tink it deserves as much respect as one wld gif to other beliefs ...<br><br>As i said before ... Free of spiritual commitment ... Lack of spiritual enlightenment. I chose it ... so there ;p<br><br>On a parting note ... wat religion do you embrace poopoomoon ???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't know how this thread turned from religious to racial, but I see absolutely nothing wrong with our present president. The first four of our presidents represented four different nationalities already, so I guess it is a cycle to make sure that all races are well-represented in this multi-racial society.<br>Regarding your comment on the displeasure of ministers, would it be possible to state your sources??? Because I would think that ministers would act more professionally than that, and if they can't practise one of the main reason why Singapore is still relatively peaceful at present, I don't see why they should remain on top. Remember, the ability of a person to achieve something has nothing to do with his religion or race.<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by moose:</div><div class="quote_body">In Indonesia,when the racial riots broke out,the police were no where to be seen (i am sure you know how 'efficient' the police are in indonesia)whereas in Singapore,if something similar broke out,our police will be on top of the situation in no time and stop this incident from spreading   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div></blockquote>Well the answer is very simple, Singapore is such a small country.... The most you take is 1hr to reach from the west to the east.. But in Indonesia, it could even take days to reach.... that's the reason.... You can't praise the Singapore Police force for that.. it's just an advantage for them... If lets say there is an outbreak of violence in Singapore, Do you think the police and the govt could resist it.... ahahhaahhha<br><br></div>
