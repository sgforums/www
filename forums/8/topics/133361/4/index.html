            <div class='col-md body'>Well thanks to Mr philip no brainer speech !!! Can see why he don't like guy scholars, for look at our lady Zhenzhi who without doing any thinking, happily and too eager to rush to support a higher ranking person - Mr Philip.  Maybe a little too eager and aggressive to rush to support without thinking !!! Maybe some NS will do her good to train her to use her brain first before being too eager and agrressive to charge without thinking clearly her enemy is.<br><br>As to Mr Philip and to her, I only have this to say. So what guys complain about NS !!! These are folks that give 2 &amp; 1/2 year of their live, taking risks. Look at it this way, in their prime and middle of their study they have to drop everything to go to army. After that they go back to school and come out to work, what they find ? the ladies of their same age have already out for 2 &amp; 1/2 eariler then them, by not they are their boss or upper. Yep and there those idiots like Zhenzhi who look down on them for the 2 &amp; 1/2 year sarcifice, how do you think a guy scholar would feel ?<br><br>Basically maybe all Zhenzhi should go and do just 3 mth of BMT, think she need to know about army life before she can even comments on it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When i 1st read the newspaper article, i wanted to scold ****. However, evryone is entitled to his or her opinions. there is certainly not a need to involve the media into it n there should be a freedom of speech.......<br><br>i agree with storywolf tt we haf the right to complain. firstly, complain don't injure or kill anibodi. Also, there are galz hu complain n also guyz 2 do tt. Although i am not realli pro-army, but i believe guyz should serve the nation n protect the country. Of course, we can express our displeasure as sometimes we are being treated unfairly or for some other reasons.<br><br>Imagine dis scene.... after studying, a guy have to enlist into the army immediately n earn a measly $350-$450 a month. A gal, hu completed studies at the same time, can work office hours and earn a lot more, sometimes even up to $1000 whereas the guy have to be trap in the camp for 24 hours without leisure. Sometimes the guyz have to suffer humiliation n all dis stuff.<br>Moreover, galz get to study in university earlier n get to earn 2 yrs earlier of income, n establish her career. The guy at the same age might be under a gal with the same age as given lesser oppotunities at the current time. Also many breakups happen when the guy is in the army. Some gals juz find a better, elder n more mature guy in the university, n breaks up with the current boyfriend. Guyz also have to worry abt going DB which can cost them an university place if they screw up. Don't we haf the rite to complain juz a little bit??<br><br>Since galz are pursuing equality this century, y dont they make iy compulsory for galz to join BMT for 3 months, receiving same treatment as the guyz? In the spanish civil war, galz also participated and i also salute them. this include gal officer cadets... Not that i m suggesting they should join the BMT, but if they cannot understand us and criticized us, i believe this measure shld be implemented. i believe both gender should understand each other. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OK, cut that biitch some lack, guys. She's young and maybe she didn't know to be careful about saying things to the press. You know how some innocent remarks can be blown out of proportion. Same thing with that other scholar who said something about Indians on his blog. Maybe he thought that it's a private comment and let down his guard. The thing is that you have to be careful that your words will reach unintended audience.<br><br>I just hope that these scholars think carefully about what they say in public space, ST or internet, as they are the so-called "elites" and should be held to higher standards of behaviour and speech.<br><br></div>
