            <div class='col-md body'>She's a full graduate now rite...?<br><br><img src="http://www.a-star.edu.sg/astar/attach/textlet/2937a36dcfiC/zhenzhi_0.JPG"><br><br>Chng Zhenzhi was amongst A*STAR's first batch of National Science Scholars, awarded the BS-PhD scholarship in 2001. One of the top students in her cohort, Zhenzhi completed her Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) with a high GPA of 3.996/ 4.0. She was conferred her degree this year with Latin Honors of Summa Cum Laude (awarded to top 3% of graduating class) and was placed on the UIUC Bronze Tablet - the highest recognition accorded for undergraduate excellence.<br><br>Upon graduation, Zhenzhi opted to embark on a one-year attachment at the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB). She feels that the one-year attachment will provide her with greater research exposure and better grounding for her subsequent PhD work.<br><br>Zhenzhi will be able to take time off to visit the various US laboratories during her one year of attachment, to source for the best laboratory for her PhD. "I want to be sure that I make the best possible decision for my PhD research. Having ample time for exploration of the various laboratories  and being able to consult my research mentors and colleagues at IMCB definitely helps."<br><br>Zhenzhi describes her work at IMCB as both intriguing and exciting. "My lab work in IMCB focuses on stem cell research and tissue engineering. My team hopes that our hard work will one day translate into a novel method for tissue repair. It's not easy, but we will never give up because we believe in contributing to society through our knowledge in science."<br><br>Asked about the team that she is working with, Zhenzhi shares," I feel really fortunate to be able to work with top stem cell experts like Dr Victor Nurcombe and Dr Simon Cool. No amount of readings or lectures can give you as much thrill as the experience gained from one year in the lab!"<br><br>We wish Zhenzhi an enriching attachment at IMCB!<br><br>-quoted from A*Star Corporate Site.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hey, I'm not a male-basher!</strong><br>-A*Star scholarship holder Chng Zhenzhi's letter:<br><br>"I would like to clarify some of my statements, because of misconceptions arising from the article.<br><br>One forum posting I have seen said: 'By saying that Singaporean males start to complain about the most minute things after serving NS, she implies that NS turns Singaporean males into wimps.'<br><br>I was implying no such thing! I respect national servicemen and believe their experiences and sacrifices ought to be recognised and appreciated. The issue at hand is not national servicemen voicing their grievances, but the unjustified and hurtful remarks made about our scholarship system.<br><br>In the telephone conversation I had with Mr Chua, I was asked to comment on guys who whine, and answered his questions in the context of 'whiny male counterparts' I have come into contact with.<br><br>I said 'they are fine until they enter national service', in response to a question about whether I find Singapore men whiny. My point was that the only occasions I noticed whining was when they were talking about their national service experienced. When asked what they complained about, I said 'minute things' as I did not wish to expatiate on what they had shared.<br><br>I did not imply that every male scholar I know has whined about national service. Nor did I say it was unacceptable for national servicemen to voice their opinions or displeasure.<br><br>When asked if male scholars are easily bullied by female scholars, I said I did not have any example to justify such a statement. I pointed out that most female scholars I know are Type-As, but there seems to be a mix of character types among male scholars. I stated explicitly and repeatedly that I did not wish to generalise.<br><br>I would like to restate my point that, as scholars, we are privileged to be given the opportunity for an overseas education, and must fulfil our responsibilities back home and serve in our respective fields. We are not entitled to such privileges, and passeing demeaning remarks will not benefit the system.<br><br>I am sorry to have upset so many of my fellow citizens over an issue that is close to the hearts of all Singapore men. I am referring to national service. I accept responsibility where I had not made my points clearly enough to Mr Chua. I was misquoted in the article or quoted out of context.<br><br>The presentation of the article did me additional injustice - I'm sure unintentionally - by highlighting a truncated or composite quote under an unnecessarily large photograph of me.<br><br>To all my fellow scholars (male) and all other men in Singapore, I assure you guys: Hey, I'm not a male-basher! I like men! In fact, I am grateful to have supportive male friends, and a loving boyfriend, without whom I would not have been able to withstand the barrage of reactions following The Sunday Times article."<br><br>Editor's Note: Ms Chng was quoted accurately by our reporter, and an A*Star official said as much in a conversation with the reporter after the remarks were published.<br><br>-quoted directly from The Sunday Times Pg 12, May 22 2005.</div>
