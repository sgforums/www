            <div class='col-md body'>I think sequels should be done by the same director or some other who is in the same calibre who did the originals...look at the Alien series......Alien 3 and 4 were flops..james Camerron made an excellenth follow up Aliens...It worked cause the first 2 were done by reputed diectors Ridley Scott and Camerron....3 was by a new David Fincher but it could have been a good movie if the studio didnt intervene too much and spoiling the whole thing...BTW FIncher later went on to make the excellent SEVEN....The only last one which was pathetic was Resurrection....it had too much of a comical feel...But it was also helmed by a reputed French director Jeunet<br><br>As for he Die Hard series, i think all of them were hits with the first and last done by John Mactiernana, the director of Predator....Die hard 2 was done by Renny Harlin which also somewhat a thrilling movie for its action sequences...</div>
