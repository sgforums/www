First described by Ed Balducci, this levitation is often the easiest to do because it is an impromptu trick, hence it does not require any gimmicks or preparation. This makes it great for street magic and various forms of 'close audience' tricks.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Trick temporarily removed.

LOL<br><br>Read again, i said [b]Most</strong> of ...blah blah revealed...<br><br>And what has all this got to do with ego when i'm just saying you are posting something that can be easily found on net. Am i hurting your ego? Now it really makes me wonder why the start of this "magic" thread. Are you trying to prove that you know a lot and since i happened to be the guy whom you think is spoiling your plan, you are asking me to prove 'something' like you?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> [/b]</blockquote>Alright, I'm not one to participate on online quarrels, so I'm going to apologise for a misunderstanding here.<br><br>Truth is, I didn't cut and paste anything, I typed everything out, so it's quite a lot of effort. When I saw your post, it seemed to be undermining my effort to let people know about magic. The Internet works in distorted ways so I couldn't identify your helpful tone, and I got angry at nothing.<br><br>I'm sorry, we're all not trying to prove anything, just to inform. You were trying to inform the readers just as I was trying to inform others. I apologise for my misguided attempt to insult you.<br><br>ps: there is no sarcasm above. i mean what i say<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> peace!</div>

The tricks that I reveal are considered widespread already. That's why you see so many of the tricks I revealed on YouTube etc.<br><br>But that doesn't mean it will not hurt the industry. Hence, when someone asks me to take them down, I will.<br><br>There are many moral issues about revealing such secrets, and there's a huge debate over it. I'm not doing this to show off, if you seriously believe I am then I will stop. Rather, watching the Masked Magician revealing famous tricks influenced me to reveal more commonly known tricks for the purpose of garnering interest in magic. That's it.<br><br>I don't understand why the argument against me doing reveals is that I want to show off. Goodness, it's a lot of effort to type these things word for word and I'll be glad to stop if someone asks me to for professional reasons.<br><br>I, however, will continue posting reveals if the protests are not about securing their own ricebowl, but about my intentions.<br><br>ps: the link you provided is interesting, but I have not seen the reveal to that. what I know about that trick is as good as what you know.</div>

As explained above, it is a post-production trick. The one I posted is the true Balducci.</div>
