The tricks that I reveal are considered widespread already. That's why you see so many of the tricks I revealed on YouTube etc.<br><br>But that doesn't mean it will not hurt the industry. Hence, when someone asks me to take them down, I will.<br><br>There are many moral issues about revealing such secrets, and there's a huge debate over it. I'm not doing this to show off, if you seriously believe I am then I will stop. Rather, watching the Masked Magician revealing famous tricks influenced me to reveal more commonly known tricks for the purpose of garnering interest in magic. That's it.<br><br>I don't understand why the argument against me doing reveals is that I want to show off. Goodness, it's a lot of effort to type these things word for word and I'll be glad to stop if someone asks me to for professional reasons.<br><br>I, however, will continue posting reveals if the protests are not about securing their own ricebowl, but about my intentions.<br><br>ps: the link you provided is interesting, but I have not seen the reveal to that. what I know about that trick is as good as what you know.</div></blockquote>hmm..tks for explaining <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>it's indeed those tricks revealed are mostly simple tricks, and yes, if some1 object, u sld take it down..<br><br>anyway, i'm not using magic as a business itself, just a hobbist...<br>btw, that link of takayama trick takes too much sleight to do so, and i could not do two of the sleight he done..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>but i guess even if you gt how he did it, dun reveal it here...<br>that is pure sleight, and i 100% believe that even if you show it here, NOONE will practise more than 30 mins, and the only thing they will do is give up..<br><br>when i teaches a person "pass" before, he learnt for 5 mins, and gave up...<br>takayama's sleight with that cigette wld take more than a couple of weeks to master it..</div>
