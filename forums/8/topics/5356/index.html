            <div class='col-md body'>If you are good at analysing people, I don't have to say anything. It's up to you. Do you believe in love over the net? I know my gf through IRC. I gave her my number over the net but she never called me. It was only after the 2nd chat with her abt 3 weeks later then she called me. But she hate HP static sound, so she want to hung up the phone. Then never hear from her again. 1 month later, I saw her in IRC again. So we have a chat and this time, she called me again. We have a long chat.<br><br>Soon we are calling up one and another daily but she faced great pressures from her family. Her parents dun like people from the net, esp guys serving NS. Dunno why got this kind of psychology. But we still continue to talk. After a few months, I ask her to be my gf and she hesitate but finally agreed after my persistent asking. I never meet up with her till Dec(first talk with her in April).<br><br>After we meet, she still remain my gf. I'm fat and ugly, so very happy to have her by my side. We are together for almost a year already from the day we met. Along the way, there is lotsa quarrels and argument, esp the pressure she faced from the family. Her parents still dunno she's attached! Haven't find the right time to tell them.<br><br>So it's up to you. But somehow, don't you still feel a little bit creepy? If I am in your case, I will feel a bit creepy. Suddenly got all these things from someone you dun really know that well. But if you feel he's the one for you, the GO FOR IT!!! Like the chinese saying I said before earlier in other posting, "Fate brings 2 together from distane else they won't even know each other even if they are standing next to each other"!<br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But I'm a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hehe..thanks for sharing ur story..Bish..One thing is that though it may sound creepy....that he is giving things but I already told him not to send anything already...though he still call me from SG...as far as I am...he is a very nice guy..too nice to someone he dun know...Imagine...when he see me online at 4am canada tiem...he will call to see if I am alright or got someone bully me or not...even he is sick he will wake up to talk to me early in the wee hrs in SG morning..cos of the time diff...I told him with his calibre..he can get any nice girl in SG...and there are girls asking him out as well...I do like him as a freind or maybe more....but still as a future psychologist..I am quite skeptical where this is concern...but in the meantime...I dun want such a good guy to go into waste...I dun think I will make a good gf..cos I am a heartbreaker(told him b4)...<br>As for u..I think it is better to let her parents know....for approval..cos ultimately..it is the blessings of the parents that determine how far u really can go...Best of Luck to u and me.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm, Rinoa,<br><br>I would have to say that I am personally freaking out for u...:-)  I find it very odd, and it could be sincere...but he isn't asking for any kind of committment?  besides best friends?  Indo-Chinese?  Meaning Indonesian chinese?<br><br>I have to say...since a lot of my friends are Indonesian Chinese...if they are in Singapore and can afford to buy u things and a house some more...at age 26? was it?  ....The guy has got money before he even started working...Believe me, u don't make a lot of money as an engineer here....What all of $2500 a month...not very much for a professional technical guy...So he must be quite rich...yeah, i think that we already summised that.<br><br>Just to let you know that the majority of these rich Indonesian/Chinese guys are playboys.  I'm not joking, just stating a fact here.  And they really don't have any compunction to buy u a house or wherever...They are usually very loose with their money...because they have loads of it in the first place....(I know 3 Indonesian guys here studying ...can spend almost 50,000$ a month....on what I don't know)...<br><br>If he was really serious, I would have thought that maybe he ask u to be his GF or something like that, but it sounds moer like he wants to keep u as a mistress...Does it sound too far-fetched?<br><br>I'm just giving u scenarios here so don't take offence ok?<br><br>Of course for people like us, we would get flattered immensely by all this monetary attention and personal concern from another guy, but let's just say that to him, it's probably pocket money that he would otherwise have use on a new car for this month...you know what I'm saying?<br><br>So until u can get a positive committment from him, don't fall for the things he's done for you.<br><br>It could be true, it could not be, but it sounds like a fairy tale...and in life, fairy tales don't happen or don't last....but ultimately u know him better than all of us so choose not by what he has done or said, but by how u feel...if it's creppy, then listen to that voice...It won't fail you.<br><br>And it seems rather impulsive on his part, which means that there is a very high chance of him ducking out as fast as he came in...<br><br>keep that in mind when u make any decisions...and this is an important decision mind you...as u already know, it's not a trivial thing.<br><br>oooh....shivering.....freaky....be careful...be very careful...u are 1000's of miles from here, if anything goes bad, he can just up and dissappear....<br><br>Hope it's not too cynical for u, but u can never be sure over the net.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks fire....I know what u mean...I will try to be careful...yes he is a indonesian chinese..how rich..I am not sure...but as far as he say...he wished for the best..but if I find a guy who I like and could provide better happiness..he will still be glad for me...Actually recently I got worried for my best freind cos...it is like she seems to be sick...and her white blood cells are not working well...I was so worried for her..her doc says if the lymph node does not decrease in swell..it might spell trouble..I was so worried...Ii told that guy if anything happens to her..I will fly back to SG...at once...and I dun want to live too..(cos I am really depressed..and my best friend is like my real sis)..he said if anything happen to me...he will fly to canada...to make sure he is by my side...I felt touched then...it is not that no guys have treat me that nice but never a guy I have not methas treat me that well...If he is a so called playboy...I think SG is more convenient..rather than spending his sleep and time over someone so far...I try to come out with all the excuses that he might be a playboy..or somewhat..but all his actions are so constant and valid...so make me feels bad...still I dunno how too find out how true he is..I can only feel........based on my instinct...for sure...i know...after several times of intergoration of my payschology skills...he does not seem to be lying...but i might be wrong...so..I will keep on observing...<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So far, I had quite a few romances from the net, but non of them quite work out the way I wish it to be. After all these, I feel kinda silly in committing so much into it, such as making long distance calls while I was studying oversea, and sending gifts back to Singapore.<br><br>My comment would be to find someone real, and things in the virtual world always seems so perfect and wonderful (that's what machine are suppose to function, and it seems to work quite well in this area). When you come face to face with the real world, usually it isn't the same. Welcome to the sad real world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>You know what, I got a signature which sounds the same as what you reply to me.. that is 'To love someone need not be possession of the person, it is knowing that the person is happy that is the most important', it sounds kinda silly and impractical, but you can say that I am just trying to console myself for all the failures so far.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your reply, Rinoa:<br><br>I live and work in the Lower Mainland area.  Both SFU and UBC are fine schools.  SFU is where I graduated.  What do I think?  School is school.  They are all the same to me; meaning, I don't compare which school (UBC or SFU) is better.  I went to SFU 'cos it is closer to where I live.<br><br>I am not good at giving advice, so, can't you any further advice about your question.<br><br>Good luck in your studying and hope that your prosepective bf is really as good in real life as you mentioned earlier.<br><br>Godd luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Renoa, I support ur idea in meeting up with him first b4 making any rash decisions. As an aspiring psychologist, i'm sure ur aware that non-verbal communication tells more about the person than verbal rite? so at the mean time, feel completely at ease to befriend him over the net and don't let any of "those feelings" come in between u and him until u've both met and u know more about him than u do now.</div>
