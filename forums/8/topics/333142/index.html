              <p>frankly speaking, if i had a neighbour with a barking dog, i'd be equally irritated. thank fuck they've always had cats.</p>
              <p>imho, it's the duty of every dog owner to run their pets well. if i were you, i'd send the dog for training, and then berate my neighbour for being rude.</p>
              <p>it's possible for your dog to behave when strangers pass by. and react only in the presence of eminent threat. but it's up to the owner to bridge this gap. so that all species can live in peace, dogs, asses and donkeys plus humans.</p>
              <p>it's a crappy situation but there is no need for anyone to turn hostile.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's not right for you to brush off by claiming that it's the nature of a dog to bark...it disturbs the peace....i can feel the stress of your neighbour having to contend with a barking dog each time he passes by to enter his unit...damn irritating...</div>

              <p><br>Next time hor...........make sure you scold him left and right from north to south within your own premises.</p>
              <p>I know it's a cowardly act, but since you not wise enough to let it go and look elsewhere or even walk away, then you can do this to satisfy yourself and sink lower than your neighbour.</p>
              <p>Just make sure you don't come here and act damn proud about it after you've done it. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
