            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry guys, I don't really know which forum might be appropriate to post this but here goes... hope you like my story <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Comments are most welcome!<br><br>If you guys don't mind, I will continue posting more stories <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>*************************************************************<br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>A Love Story</strong></span><br><br>When I was studying in Melbourne several years ago, I helped out my uncle and auntie at their provision shop selling Asian foodstuffs and sauces. Business was brisk as the location of the shop was near a popular haunt among Asians. As such, we made good money and were able to afford a reasonably sized house.<br><br>Among the regular customers was this pretty young girl which I came to know as Kate. She was of Chinese-Vietnamese descent and arrived in Melbourne several years ago when her parents left Vietnam in search of a better life. Kate was about 20 years old and I found out later that she was a student in one of the colleges around the vicinity. She would come once in a couple of days to buy groceries for her parents, sometimes accompanied by her mother. In no time I was swooned over by her. My heart would break whenever she left the store after shopping as I knew it would be another few days before I see her again.<br><br>One day, Kate came to the store and hurriedly stocked up the things she needed to get. I was looking forward to talking to her but sensed her hurry and speeded up the cash register instead. Alas! She forgot to bring her purse and was crestfallen when she discovered it.<br><br>Â“Its okayÂ”, I told her assuredly. Â“You can pay me again the next time you come again.Â”<br><br>Her face lit up. Â“Really? IÂ’m so sorryÂ… I thought I had my purse with me and IÂ’m in a rush for time. IÂ’m so sorry.Â”<br><br>Â“Â”ItÂ’s really okay. You owe me a coffee though.Â” I laughed.<br><br>We became good friends after that incident. Our relationship improved and we started going out for coffee, movies, shopping and walks. I found Kate to be a very nice girl, very warm towards people and kind hearted. She never had a bad word for anybody and always kept her promises. She would encourage me whenever I did not do well for tests, or played a bad game in my university rugby matches. As she was not proficient in English, I would spend Saturdays coaching her in the language and would afterwards test her through instant messaging software such as ICQ or MSN. We would spend many hours laughing at the things we typed.<br><br>Naturally, many guys sought after her and I felt worried for I am neither rich nor not the best student in class, etc. Because of this inferior complex, I never told her about my feelings as I feared rejection, having tasted the pain of being turned away previously.<br><br>One day, as we took a walk in a park, she asked me, Â“RichardÂ… what do you think of me?Â”<br><br>I told her I think very highly of her, and that I think she is a very nice girl, very filial to parents and very kind hearted. I added that I appreciate our friendship and, with a tremble, told her that I wish I could spend everyday with her.<br><br>Â“I am glad to hear thatÂ”, she said with a smile.<br><br>The exams came and I spent whole days on end mugging, wanting to show Kate that her encouragement could lead me to heights of academic success. On the night before my last paper, Kate told me over the phone that she had a surprise for me and looked forward to seeing me in the provision shop, on the condition that I did well for my paper. We laughed at our little joke.<br><br>The next day, I breezed through the last exam paper having been buoyed by the prospect of meeting Kate and spending my holidays with her. Also, I have decided to tell her about my feelings. After the paper, I cycled furiously back to the shop.<br><br>Â“Waiting for Kate?Â” my uncle winked at me.<br><br>Â“ErÂ… ya Uncle. Has she come yet?Â” I answered sheepishly while panting.<br><br>Â“See how anxious you are! I thought you couldnÂ’t wait to help me with the shop! Now I know.Â” my uncle laughed, his belly shaking.<br><br>I waited, and waited. Hours passed, and there was no sign of her.<br><br>The phone rang and my uncle picked it up. His face fell and grew grim as the conversation went on. He replaced the phone back on the table and turned to face me.<br><br>Â“There is something that I need to tell you, Rich.Â”<br><br>Â“Is it Kate? Is she late?Â”<br><br>Â“KateÂ… will not be coming. She met with an accidentÂ…. UmmÂ…Â…Â”<br><br>My uncle placed his hand on my shoulder.<br><br>Â“She was killed on the spot.Â”<br><br>I couldn't believe what he said. My heart broke into a million pieces and tears flooded my eyes and clouded my vision. Why is God so unfair to us? Why did He not give us a chance to be together? Why?<br><br>I couldnÂ’t really remember what happened next; all I fleetingly remember was attending KateÂ’s funeral and seeing her beautiful angelic face with her eyes closed lying in the coffin. I placed a rose on her hands and smiled at her, telling her to rest well and not be worried about anything anymore. As my tears rolled down my cheeks, I could detect a faint smile on that angelic face.<br><br>In the weeks that came and flew by, I fell into the depths of despondency. I would drink till I got myself drunk and spend whole days thinking of Kate. I had no heart for anything else and stopped going helping out at the shop. I would visit the places we went to together in the past. Memories would come flooding back and I would break down in tears. Despite my uncle and auntieÂ’s efforts, they could never rouse me back into the light hearted happy-go-lucky person that I was before.<br><br>I cried myself to sleep every night, a bottle of whisky by my side most nights. I couldnÂ’t get Kate out of my mind, and would fall asleep mumbling her name. It was on one of such nights that I fell asleep, the bottle slipping out of my hand and spilling its alcoholic contents over the floor.<br><br>The night grew colder and I roused from my sleep. In my disheveled state, I caught my own reflection in the mirror and laughed at my pitiful self. What would Kate think of me if she saw me like this? I did not care anymore, for she is no longer by my side.<br><br>Something moved out of the shadows. I lifted my head, and my eyes met those of KateÂ’s. My heart melted. She looked as beautiful as ever, albeit paler. I reached out my hand towards herÂ…<br><br>Â“KateÂ… I really missed youÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“You got to pull yourself together, RichardÂ” Her voice drifted across in faint plumes, seemingly from a far distant place.<br><br>Â“KateÂ… whyÂ…Â” I broke down again.<br><br>Â“Things happen for a reason. You got to move on; you got to lead a new life.Â”<br><br>Â“KateÂ…Â”<br><br>Â“Whatever happens in future, I want you to know that I love you. Though you have never told me the same, I can feel the love you have for me. That is all I need.Â”<br><br>Â“KateÂ… I love youÂ… I love you more than I ever thought I couldÂ…Â” I sobbed<br><br>She smiled, looking paler than ever. Â“Your love, RichardÂ… I will cherish it forever. I cannot be around anymore, so you got to take careÂ… Goodbye.Â”<br><br>As the smile lingered on her, she slowly faded away. I put out my hand and grabbed only thin air. Had it been a dream? I pinched myself and winced; it was not a dream at all.<br><br>As tears rolled down my cheek, I whispered my last goodbyes to Kate, the love of my life.<br>[/b]</div>
