            <div class='col-md body'>LESSON 1<br><br>A junior manager, a senior manager and their boss are on their way to a meeting. On their way through a park, they come across a wonder lamp.They rub the lamp and a ghost appears.<br><br>The ghost says, "Normally, one is granted three wishes but as you are three, I will allow one wish each"<br><br>So the eager senior manager shouted, "I want the first wish. I want to be in the Bahamas, on a fast boat and have no worries." Pfufffff, and he was gone.<br><br>Now the junior manager could not keep quiet and shouted "I want to be In Florida with beautiful girls, plenty of food and c0cktails." Pfufffff, and he Was also gone.<br><br>The boss calmly said, "I want these two idiots back in the office after lunch at 12.35pm."<br><br>*MORAL OF THE STORY IS: " ALWAYS ALLOW THE BOSSES TO SPEAK FIRST"*<br><br>LESSON 2<br><br>Standing in front of a shredder with a piece of paper in his hand.<br><br>"Listen," said the CEO, "this is a very sensitive and important document,and my secretary has left. Can you make this thing work?"<br><br>"Certainly," said the young executive.<br><br>He turned the machine on, inserted the paper, and pressed the start button.<br><br>"Excellent, excellent!" said the CEO as his paper disappeared inside the shredder machine. "I just need one copy."<br><br>*LESSON II - NEVER, NEVER ASSUME THAT YOUR BOSS KNOWS EVERYTHING.*<br><br>LESSON 3<br><br>The organs of the body were having a meeting, trying to decide who was In charge. Each organ took a turn to speak up:<br><br>Brain......... I should be in charge because I run all body functions. Blood........ I should be in charge because I circulate oxygen for the brain. Stomach... I should be in charge because I process food to the brain. Legs......... I should be in charge because I take the brain where it Wants to go. Eyes......... I should be in charge because I let the brain see where it's going. Asshole.....I should be in charge because I get rid of your waste.<br><br>All the other parts laughed so hard and this made the asshole very mad. To prove his point, the asshole immediately slammed tightly closed and Stayed that way for 6 days, refusing to rid the body of any waste whatsoever.<br><br>Day 1 - Brain got a terrible headache and cried out for relief Day 2 - Stomach got bloated and began to ache terribly Day 3 - Legs got cramps and became unstable Day 4 - Eyes became watery and vision became blurred Day 5 - Blood became toxic and poisoned the body Day 6 -The other organs agreed to let the asshole be in charge.<br><br>*MORAL OF THE STORY: NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, OR HOW IMPORTANT YOU THINK  YOU ARE, YOU WILL FIND THAT IT IS ALWAYS THE ASSHOLE THAT IS IN CHARGE.*</div>
