            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah Lagaan was cool..but watch closely it also tries to follow hollywood with a  storyline like that but wth indian overtones...song and ance seqences..hmm...well lagaan's music is composed by AR Rahman for which he has won numerous awards for this film...its beacasue t is coposed mainily of folkish rhythms..rahman has done many folkish music before before but guess he is best known for modern dance and funky beats</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The great thing about the above 4 movies is that it takes the traditional indian movie storyline..dresses it up like a blade or matrix lone man  complex with some ehtnic indian touches like the real life polticial and social issues which plagues the India .Nayak was a little bit unique when the movie starts off as a reporter interviewing a minister and then the 2nd half picks up a lot more action<br><br>The  movie NAYAK and CITITZEN has the same indian movie fight scenes anywhere else but unique matrix/blade like action and stunts but still very indian..For your in it seems these movies were popular in Japan and showing in many theatres there..<br><br><img src="http://www.galatta.com/entertainment/Hindi/nayak/images/pic3.jpg"><br><br></div>
