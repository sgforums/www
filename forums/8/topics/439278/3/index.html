              <p>I'm actually starting to believe that some of these "terrorist" are actually government created to push an agenda. Trying to make "terrorist" into a household name so people would believe to a certain government's words coz everyone don't want to be a terrorist victim.</p>
              <p>Look up USS Liberty and USS Cole how a certain country try to incite war between 2 other countries... Only difference is these 2 events are military targets at sea where it didn't receive much public attention. However, 911 was a public target and 1 year later, there was a war with Iraq trying to find Osama.</p>
              <p>8 years later when they "found" Osama, they immediately disposed the body at sea "in accordance to Islamic traditions". Since when burial at sea is an Islamic tradition?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think JI's purpose is to spread fear into Asia so they could get Asian support, but once they got Australian support, the JI idea was scrapped and the hired terrorist are just left without a purpose. Now JI is maintained by hiring the poor and uneducated and funded through kidnappings but still have no purpose...</p>

              <p>Some, which some? The shoe bomber, the underwear bomber, trying
              to bring down a plane load of travellers. These are government
              created to cause chaos to world travel. To create jobs,
              perhaps.</p>
              <p>Osama was given a burial "in accordance with Islamic tradition
              for sea burial". Muslims were also seafarers, remember. Please get
              your perspective right.</p>
              <p>JI got Australian support? That is new to me, considering that
              the majority of tourist killed in the Bali bombing by the JI were
              Australians.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat who has plans to crash a plane into Changi Airport

              <p>it can be any of these countries.</p>
              <p>but waking to the fact that terrorist is created by goverment  can get pretty disturbing</p>

              <p>I'm actually starting to believe that some of these "terrorist"
              are actually government created to push an agenda. Trying to make
              "terrorist" into a household name so people would believe to a
              certain government's words coz everyone don't want to be a
              terrorist victim.</p>
              <p>Look up USS Liberty and USS Cole how a certain country try to
              incite war between 2 other countries... Only difference is these 2
              events are military targets at sea where it didn't receive much
              public attention. However, 911 was a public target and 1 year
              later, there was a war with Iraq trying to find Osama.</p>
              <p>8 years later when they "found" Osama, they immediately disposed
              the body at sea "in accordance to Islamic traditions". Since when
              burial at sea is an Islamic tradition?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think JI's purpose is to spread fear into Asia so they could
              get Asian support, but once they got Australian support, the JI
              idea was scrapped and the hired terrorist are just left without a
              purpose. Now JI is maintained by hiring the poor and uneducated and
              funded through kidnappings but still have no purpose...</p>
