            <div class='col-md body'>Aiya You people complain so much about opp. sexes, Don't always pick at peoples bad point. Thinks of yourself first. Are you that perfect. U got no flaws and bad habit? If u can't stand certain things. Don't look lor. Eyes are always the main reason that got u into trouble. Learn to compromise and tolerate. Lastly, In the world no one is perfect. The only perfect people u will find, is one with good heart and kind.</div>

They cut in on you, expect you to give way to them and always need to be treated like kings and queens. They think they are more important than you.<br><br>* I dislike people (men or women) who look down on other people.<br>eg: People once they find out where you work or your position will treat you like dirt if they realise you work for some unknown company in some unknown post. People who find out that you earn $50 more claim you should pay for every meal cause they feel justified to do so. People who tell you that the road sweeper or hawker is low class.<br><br>* I dislike whiny people who complain as if the world owes them a living and blame others and situations for their issues.<br>eg: men who claims they find local girls lousy and they say china women wonderful etc and blame local girls for being who they are when its clear their personal character leaves little to be desired except to a money digger from China. Then later find China girl cheated them and then they CPCB again.<br><br>* I dislike people who show the world their stupidity with their mindless talk ie Bush and some others around forums.<br>eg: Just watch Michael Moore show F98deg or go read his book and you'll know what is call moron. Oxford should consider a special edition and put Bush picture beside the word stupid and then they can stop explaining the word. Anyways, just look around at certain posts. On all the quotient levels such as iq,eq and whatever "q" .... its a laugh but I take it as a laugh and console .....<br><br>* People whose got a wrong sense of morality and people who don't stand up and correct those people who do wrong/bad things and allow others to kick them around like dirt but only dare to complain.<br>eg: Ever here this line: "Oh those Chink women are so poor things that they "have" to come here to get they kids into our great education systems. (its their choice and our ed system is not as good as China's) so we should pity them if they are "force" to prostitude themselves and have affairs with our husbands because they are forced to do so and cannot afford our standard of living. So they are not wrong to make our men pay for their living and have mistresses all over because they can satisfy our men sexually." Fu.ck Wrong sense of Morality.
