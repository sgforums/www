Although most 'emo' posers love to act depress and some think siltting is cool, I dun really blame them, I blame it on MTV in infusing them with this fake 'emo' subculture.

On one hand, you have the 'emo kids', who do it for the sake of doing it - following the trend there's been set in place. On the other, you have the depressed ones who don't speak up because they don't dare to. Both sides cut, cry, maybe listen to sad songs, but there's a difference.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And btw, I think the emo should never be a trend, in the first place its only describing a person who is controlled more by their emotions and are technically more dramatic than others over matters of the heart. I mean, who cares about them anyway? Why should everyone care? Slap them if they're doing it to show off, and comfort those who do it because they're experiencing surmounting pain inside.

He is taking it too far that I agree.<br><br>There are two kinds of emo in the world. There's one like Paul Twohill who is only into the fashion and culture, like music dressing and all, but they dont cut themselves or feel depressed. They can infact be very cheeky and very normal, they just look and dress like one.<br><br>Then there are those who are really emo, as in deep down, they got alot of emotional wounds. They dont even dress emo, they look normal like you and me but they have alot of depressing emotionals issues.<br><br>So the real emo kid should be someone who is the mixture of both above. But they are rare. I mean when you are really sad and feel like dying, you will bother to dress up as emo meh?<br><br>I used to have alot of emotionals conflicts within myself. Like dont have alot of friends and all, so I was being emo without knowing it. It was only in secondary 5 that this skinhead I know told me to be emo.<br><br>Then I read up on it and realised that such a culture actually exist.<br><br>But now I'm ok. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But earlier, I was into the goth culture without knowing it. I like all the dark dark stuffs like werewolves and Dracula. When playing games, I always choose death and fire instead of light or ice.<br><br>Again, it was only until I check what "gothic" means in the dictionary, that I finally know that such a culture exist. </div></blockquote>In short people who follow the fashion aspect of it is called 'fashioncore' by scene kids.<br><br>Actually there are not only 2 types of emo but four types.<br><br>There is the 2 types you have mentioned<br><br>Then there is the true emos, who follow the real emo scene of the 80s-90s and they look far from the 'emo' nowadays.<br><br>And there is the 'emo' poseur scene you see nowadays.<br><br>But now almost all those emos that you see on the streets are either from the fashioncore scene or those emo posuers.</div>
