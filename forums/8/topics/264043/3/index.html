            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by OneWithTheForce:</div><div class="quote_body">So Dawn "plastic surgery" Ng has been discussing NS for the fairer sex.  I couldnt be bothered reading what Barbie wrote, but I do have my views about it.<br><br>And my view is this.<br><br>NS should be compulsory for females as well as males. They should be limited to non combatant roles, and should serve the same length of time as the males.<br><br>Why?<br><br>1. It solves the Govt's concern about declining population and lack of people for the Armed Forces. All the males who currently serve in clerical positions can be shifted to ones where they shoot and kick ass instead. The number of soldiers will instantly double.<br><br>2. It also solves declining birthrates too. More guys and girls will meet and mingle  and more couples will form. Hubba hubba <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>3. Singaporean women are quite confidant and educated. They believe they are equal or better than men and have no qualms saying so. Let them prove it.<br><br>I have no doubt many people will be against this, including:<br><br>1. Parents. Armed forces is guy's stuff, not for dainty little delicate ladies, right?<br><br>2. The girls. Despite all the bravado and talk of equality, the girl's I've discussed this with are actually quite scared of the thought of actually having to do it. They're quite happy getting on with life, be it work or study, and macking with guys a couple of years older than themselves.<br><br>3. The guys. Many guys who take the easy way out pretending to be big military men, but who are really pen pushers, will protest if they have to get off their butts and train like everyone else.<br><br>What does anyone else think?<br><br>Are there any chicks here who actually have the guts to propose NS for girls?</div></blockquote>wat for make girl go NS..<br>but after their BMT throw all of them to be clerk.<br>driver.. medic... etc??<br>those non combant vocation??</div>
