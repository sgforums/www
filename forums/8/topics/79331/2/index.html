Don't simply say something that sound's very HUMANE and full of MORAL, as if by saying so makes you feel that you are a kind soul is it? Every inch of land you are living in now (yes including your HDB flat) was the habitat of animals ok? Humans survive by expanding their territory into the wild (including forest). Don't blame the rich (golf course) that they are evil and destroy environment. The shopping complexes, football fields, mrt stations that "poor" people use, do you think they were built on dessert land? Even dessert land is also the habitat of animals.<br><br><strong>To those who said "why not just leave the poor wild boar alone?":</strong><br>Wild boars always live in packs. If you ever see a lone wild boar, it means it was not welcomed in its own pack and left to be alone. Lone wild boars are the MOST dangerous ones and very potentially harmful to humans. Imagine if there's a lone wild boar at your local MRT station, where your family go everyday. Do you want to take the risk and say "leave it alone"?<br><br>Let's say that capturing the pig alive and transporting it to a suitable place costs S$5000. Would you be willing to pay for 1% of that expense which is S$50? How about 2%, 3%<br><br>Haha! So the lesson is, it is easier to talk about morality, behind the protection of internet, than to actually do something.<br>Haha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br></div>
