            <div class='col-md body'>Den do you guys consider Ruben Studdard from American Idol (Season 2) to have the package and looks? Nah... I don't think so, personally I think the so-call idols out there ought to have more than just looks, glamour and the "x-factor"; they should possess voice quality and stage charisma.<br><br>And also, we are looking at the singapore's market... we can't deny that the people here <span style="font-style: italic;">idolise </span>idols who they think are cool. Of course, this doesn't mean that the 3 aren't doing well.  Each has got their own unique way of portraying their songs during the respective hits (although some songs chosen does not seemed suitable for them)...<br><br>And these guys and girls, might have a long way to go despite the fact that they aren't the ultimate Singapore Idol (remember the case of Clay Aitken)... I would say all have done well...<br><br>Cheers<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Idol...depends on how u define idol.<br><br>Olinda can sing well but she is too boring. Not much improvement. Perhaps she is too gd from the start. No X factor either.<br>Taufik is the one with the biggest improvement and can sing a wide variety of songs. Plus not bad looking.<br>Sylvester has the X factor......singing so-so but gd enough to be in the top 3.<br><br>If i am the record company producer, i will groom Sly. Can break into the Taiwan market. Come to think of it, lotz of idol in Taiwan cant sing as well. Eye candy only.</div>
