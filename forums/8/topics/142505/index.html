            <div class='col-md body'>Performance artist Mark McGowan, 37, has rolled along the streets of London to promote kindness to cleaners and used his nose to push a monkey nut to Downing Street to highlight the financial plight of students.<br><br><img src="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y156/crazy239/markmcgowan203.jpg"><br><br>"There is a strong link between the word exhibiting and exhibitionist.<br><br>A lot of people do stuff for attention but usually end up in hospital because they have some sort of mental disorder.<br><br>But being an artist, you are taking part in society's culture.<br><br>I grew up on the infamous North Peckham Estate in south London.<br><br>But I never really had a problem with that estate or council estates in general.<br><br>They are really cool places for kids growing up. I had loads of friends.<br><br>I painted for about 10 years before I did a lot menial work.<br><br>Then I got my degree in Fine Art. I turned to performance art because I found it a much more accessible medium to deliver what I was trying to express.<br><br>One of the things being brought up in the poorer parts of London is that you get lots of people coming in doing community projects which is a complete load of rubbish, because no-one is interested in them at all.<br><br>What they are interested in is football, DJ-ing and music.<br><br>That's where they see their role models because the art world is so middle class so there are no role models in art.<br><br>The way to engage them in art is to bring it into the street, which is what I'm doing - not by putting it in the White Cube or the National Gallery.<br><br>Most people from Peckham are not going to go there - there's no-one walking around the National Gallery or the White Cube with a string vest on.<br><br>Most of my work is for the common man. I rolled through the streets because I was a cleaner and I was protesting about treatment of cleaners.<br><br>I pushed a monkey nut to Downing Street because I wanted to say that people need grants to get an education, especially those from poorer areas.<br><br>It took me two weeks and it hurt but going through Peckham, Camberwell and the Walworth Road I took it to the people - even though it was ridiculous and must have been a really funny sight.<br><br>People ask me when does it stop becoming art and start to become a protest?<br><br>But I say there is no distinction. It has the possibility of becoming anything and everything but it is always about bringing it back to local people.<br><br>I don't want people to sit in front of the TV complaining about local issues.<br><br>I want to say to them that there are other ways of expressing yourself. It would be really nice to see more activities on the streets.<br><br>I don't know if there will be more of this sort of performance art on the streets - I'm not sure I've inspired people that much - but I would like to see more artists on the streets - not in the White Cube."</div>
