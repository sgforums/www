            <div class='col-md body'>When MM Lee said on TV that your vote cannot be traced to you and there's no way they can find out what you vote..... he is wrong.  The Election Department Singapore stated clearly that the ballot papers are numbered and can be traced to the individual voter.<br><br>The fact is the tracing can only be carried out under court order, and so far there was no such order as far as I know.  That means no body had been traced to who they had voted in the past.  This also means there was no report / complaint of fraud in the past, that require the tracing to be carried out.<br><br>Hence, do not be afraid to cast your vote.<br></div>

The link between the ballot paper number and the electoral register through the counterfoil does facilitate tracing from a ballot paper to a voter's identity on the register. <span style="color: red;">However, ballot papers can be examined only under strict conditions, and there are safeguards that make it extremely difficult to find out how any particular voter voted</span></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">After the count, all ballot papers and their counterfoils have to be sealed in the Supreme Court vault for 6 months, after which all the ballot papers and other election documents are destroyed. During those 6 months, these documents can only be retrieved by <span style="color: red;">court order</span>. The court will issue such an order only if it is satisfied that a vote has been fraudulently cast and the result of the election may be affected as a result.</span><br><br>If you don't trust the court, I dun understand why are you  still living in this country.<br></div></blockquote>Seriously, how can u be sure that tickets can't be retrived secretly. u nvr noe..<br>6 mths is a lot of time 4 hanky panky.
