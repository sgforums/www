The content of Whether if it is TRUE or FALSE that my past post are naive or not has no correlation with someone been a Christian or not as I pointed.... You didn't seems to been talking sensibily. and I wasn't yet mocking you. You seems to say my arguement is weak when you wasn't even talking stating your stand than just pointing mindlessly at my past threads. But for sure you seems to be so confident you could win in any debates...  I doubt there is anything to debate over here.<br><br>Its purely about the perception of people towards something. Simply said. If even this simple thing can be debated. Obviously this person had profound hate for Christianity or rather the person that stated the notion that even the simple notion could trigger a debate. That's is why the perjudice comes about.<br><br>Anyway yea maybe its a very ill logical statement here... but there is quite a number had this ill logical perception that's what I'm talking about.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When people gives the comments like ...<br><br>"The church people are all hypocrites"<br><br>"What you Christian like that one" Etc etc<br><br>Wasn't them having a higher than normal moral expectation from Christians? Yea it is true that Christians should have some morals "Christians morals" that is above others in our lifestyle. But people expected it be be like perfect 10/10 which is not logical. Humans are still humans. They saids that wah you all christian are all like that one like someone here stated... So was that a overstatement?<br><br>Also People like to post a different sets of characteristic from other religion onto Christians whom these are not Christian values.<br><br>And for the last time... I wonder what does me posting some simple trying to be funny threads do with my personal characters? How bias this comments is. If all attention seeker are to be burn in hell, then gurmit singh, michelle chia, or even most of the Christian and catholic ministers should be send to the gallow. They are seeking too much attention. How utter rubbish. Only a perjudice perception could induce someone to link these totally unrelated characteristic with his notion. It shows how inmature or emotional it could be when people look at a certain even based on an totally unrelated personality traits of the person. Alas if Law would work this way, the world will be in trouble.<br><br></div>
