The Catholics have to pay money for what ever they did wrong while the Protestant gets away scot-free.

            <div class='col-md body'>I took so much effort to answer your question here:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AndrewPKYap:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: darkblue;">According to mainstream Christianity (some churches will tell you Christianity is a silver bullet, indicate that you believe once and you go to heaven whether you like it or not... hahaha, there is one very big one in Suntec, with very long queues, and you can learn what they preach in their website... they even tell you that you can become prosperous if you attend... hahaha)<br><br>But mainstream Christianity tells you that you must "repent" AND "believe/accept"; not just indicate you believe and "heaven here I come... and money will chase after me..."<br><br>Christianity says that God has come up with a set of law, rules and regulations for humans to follow and you go to hell (like you go to prison if you break Singapore's laws).<br><br>According to Christianity, the so called "laws of God" are impossible to keep and so when God came out with the His Laws, he already knew that you will be going to hell...<br><br>So you might ask... why come out with the LAWS in the first place? What if I do not want to be under God's laws? (Like, I am a Singaporean, I do not need to follow American laws).<br><br>So they tell you that God cannot don't come out with the LAWS because he is a JUST God...<br><br>And they tell you that you cannot choose not to be under God's LAWS because God created you and so you have to follow God's laws. Like you are your father's son and if you want to live in his house, you must follow his house rules.<br><br>Because God is a JUST GOD, he must send you to hell... but, He (according to Christians) is also a LOVING GOD and as long as you "repent" for breaking God's laws and accept the punishment (that Jesus took on your behalf) you receive a "get out of hell, free" card.<br><br>If you do not believe in the existence of GOD<br><br>and if you believe in GOD but you do not believe that GOD is exactly as the Christians say<br><br>and you do not think that Jesus is super-natural ...<br><br>and that God created hell to send people that break HIS LAWS...<br><br>If you do not believe all that, the Christian story is like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, nice.<br><br>You can also ask, "Who ask GOD to create me knowing that HE will be coming up with LAWS I cannot keep and HE will be sending me to HELL?"<br><br>if you ask this type of questions it gets complicated... because it is about "beliefs" and not logic...<br><br>Christians also have other cards up their sleeves and that is...<br><br>All Christian are "SAINTS"<br>All Christians are "SMART"<br>and they want to make Christians out of all "Singaporeans so that they become smart prosperous saints"... as you can see real or not, many people want.</span></div></blockquote>and you ask the same question again here:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by rue:</div><div class="quote_body">Why ppl say not christian then sure go to hell.</div></blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
