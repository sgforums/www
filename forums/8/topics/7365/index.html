There are even kids age of 19 hacking into major financial company sites,<br>I have noticed that in States their Porn-sites are restricted from teenagers by using Credit cards.<br><br>Back at Home, there is a way that the parents can restrict the children from entering the porn - sites.........<br>There is even an software available onine to download and you can restrict the accessibilty to restricted sites and porn sites......<br><br>The govmt should renew the policies towards internet access.. They should come up with a age criteria for the entry into the pron-sites.. I suggest maybe at the age of 21 then access to the internet should be permitted...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the internet uses the computer, which makes it like anyother mass media receiver, radio, tv most importantly.<br><br>all proponents of mass media consists of tv, radio, phonecalls, newspapers, magazines etc.<br><br>each of us have a different attitude towards these agents of mass media. we develop different tastes, preferences etc, until it grows into habit.<br><br>for internet to be regulated, it should be treated just like anyother media agent, things that carry condensed information etc, mail, email, post, goods, radio broadcasts, acceptable cinema shows etc, acceptable publications etc, it is easy to regulate it, once we are familiar with its potential, and not scared of it.<br><br>getting the family caretaker to regulate internet use,is just like any other parent telling what music, shows, books that her child should read; all caretakers have different attitudes, the way to look at it is: the internet is just like any other public transport being offered to a citizen. it should be regulated just like any other industry is. it should not be special.<br><br>finally, after understanding all those things, the hype can be safely understood, and fears can be ignored.<br><br>Bravo! Promote Regulation!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the user will have to exercise their own discretion on whether they should go surf porn or not.<br><br>If you're afraid that young people go to porn sites, then the parents should learn more about using the Internet. There are softwares out there that'll allow some control - NetNanny for instance.<br><br>Anyway, I do not really support the idea of restricted access to the Internet. And you cannot really restrict access to porn sites, coz that is up to the porn sites webmasters to have some kind of age verification before letting the user in, so the government can't really do much.<br><br>Anyway, the government can only do so much. At the end of the day, the user decides whether to get there or not. And I would point out that although the local ISP can prevent access to these porn sites, there are other ways u can access illegal sites. I won't tell you the method, but for those who knows, I think no need to tell also, for it's not really a nice thing to do.<br><br>So, at the end of the day, making the user aware that surfing porn is non-constructive is more important than putting up stop signs here and there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We must prevent anything from taking over our lives because we value our health.<br><br>"Anything" includes consumption of anykind, food, liquor, porno, drugs, etc.<br><br>It is in the interest of a government to have everyone healthy.<br><br>Does personal freedom gives me the right to be unhealthy? I am afraid that in the end, it counts to who is responsible of taking care of you later in life.<br><br>Do we value our posterity, health? The govt does, but each of us have our habits.<br><br>Habits that are threatening to our well being is always being considered by whom???<br><br>We carry on our lives because we value it very much, if certain conditions appear to form bad habits, these individuals need help.<br>friends and family members must look out for each other.<br><br>For that to be effective, we must be open with our lives, what we do, where we go and observe certain rules. In rare circumstances, we must intervene with a rough touch.<br><br>Anybody know what does the NRIC number of a person born in this year resemble? 00123456D for eg? is it?</div>
