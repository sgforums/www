            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Toilet's Social Practices in Singapore</strong><br>From:Gazy<br><br>Today I went to RedHill MRT Station's public toilet after visiting my client. I did not use the cubicle, I used the "public drainage" system, where every man will stick out their respective .... errr... tool to relieve himself.<br><br>Then this middle aged man was looking at me at that private region while I was urinating next to him. When I was finished with my business, I went to the basin to wash my hands (yes, with soup, fifth bull). The middle aged man then diverted his attention to his own private region and stood there for a long long time. Like as if he was thinking of something.<br><br>The experience to me was really scary. Despite I have been involved in these "staring" events for a long time.<br><br>This is just one of the events that usually take place in a normal public toilet visit. Other general socio-habitual activities in the toilets are equally interesting, which I am going to enumerate now for the benefit of female readers. Female readers do not know what take place behind the gents' doors and this will be good stuff for you.<br><br>1) I do not know about other guys, but I always try to distance myself from other guys in the public drainage system.<br><br>2) There are some guys proudly showing off their tools. For me, I always make sure it is away from any guy's line of vision.<br><br>3) When I was in ACJC, one stupid guy actually thought it was fun to spray all his urine to his neighbours. Damn.<br><br>4) The toilet is also a place to celebrate birthdays for guys. When I was in ACJC, I was stripped naked twice in the male toilet. And those perverts used markers to draw pictures on my sexy belly.<br><br>5) The toilet is also a reading room. During NS, I always brought along a book to the camp and hid inside the toilet to read.<br><br>6) The toilet is also a conference room. Important business meetings are held inside toilets - During NS, I was the middleman to some guy selling jeans to some guy in my camp.<br><br>7) Last but not least, of course toilets are places to smoke secretly! In places where you cannot smoke. The smell of cigarretes combined with the "natural" smell creates great enjoyment for smokers!<br><br>Guy's socialization in the toilets is probably obvious stuff to guys, but not to the other half of our population, I hope people will not find this thread obscene. But worry not, we are thinking of doing the same thing for the female toilets. Probably some females can act as our consultants and tell us what happens in the female toilets.<br></div>
