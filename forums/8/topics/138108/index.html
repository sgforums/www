            <div class='col-md body'>By Mark O'Brien (Not a real name)<br><br>When I did my taxes this year I found out that I spent over $14,000 on<br>DATES last year. Most of that was spent on dinner and drinks in<br>Manhattan. Now don't get me wrong, I had some very good times, some<br>great sex, and some good conversations. Hell, I even made a good<br>friend along the way, but mainly I came away from the date feeling<br>extremely disappointed and with a lighter wallet. Date by date it's<br>not THAT much money but it all adds up fast!<br><br>In the past I had a habit of always grabbing the check and paying<br>whether my date was hot or not. Whether we clicked or not. Basically I<br>felt ashamed to let her pay. I also kept an interesting statistic and<br>even I was surprised that only 5% of my dates even offered to pay -<br>yes, you see that right - 5%! One girl in the entire year offered to<br>pay for the entire check. A very nice gesture. But, of course I paid<br>and doubt she was sincere. In light of all this evidence I knew I had<br>to change some things. So, this year...<br><br>I DECIDED TO NEVER PAY FOR A FIRST DATE AGAIN.<br><br>How did I do this? First, I adopted the mindset that a girl should<br>naturally assume she's paying for herself. Now this wasn't easy at<br>first but I quickly got used to it.<br><br>Then when going into the bar/restaurant/lounge etc. I would hand the<br>server a credit card and ask them to open tabs for us. HEY! Did you<br>catch that? I said "TABS". Yah, don't worry at least 95% of the girls<br>I meet miss that one, too. Just to make sure I usually confirm that<br>the server has understood me too. I do this when the date rudely<br>answers her cell phone or is in the bathroom (probably using her cell<br>phone).<br><br>Guys, you know the MasterCard "priceless" series of commercials? Well,<br>let me tell you, you won't understand the meaning of "priceless" until<br>you see one of these girls handed their own check for 3 $20 martinis<br>and overpriced food (that they would probably never buy on their own).<br>It's also very relaxing to encourage the girl to eat and drink up<br>because even at $20 a pop for exotic gooey blender drinks I could not<br>care less how many of them she has - because SHE'S PAYING.<br><br>Oddly enough, when she realizes that there are individual bills there<br>will a few prolonged moments of discomfort. But don't panic. Something<br>that took me by surprise is how many girls suddenly have to "go to an<br>ATM". I can't quite figure out if it's because their cc's are maxed<br>out on shoe purchases or that they are trying to guilt me into paying.<br>Well, probably a combination of both, but I'm remorseless after doing<br>this for nearly 3 months now. Which brings me to my date last night...<br>OMG!<br><br>Of course, the classy nice Irish pub I suggested wasn't good enough<br>for her. Nah. She needed to to go somewhere more trendy. Ok, no<br>problem. W?<br>Hudson? Meatpacking District? SoHo? Where are we going? So, she picks<br>a midtown hotel bar. Nice place. Little stuffy. Drinks, not bad and<br>Macadamia nuts on the lounge tables (complimentary), nice! Of course,<br>I went through my usual routine, handed the server a credit card asked<br>her if we can start tabs she said, "sure" and took the card while her<br>cell phone rang. She apologized, (she had to get it). So I moved into<br>confirmation mode. Our waitress even missed the 'tabs' part but she<br>adjusted on the fly and told me no problem. Boy, let me tell you - the<br>girl I was with could really throw down the drinks. She was drinking<br>scotch that was older than the hotel we were in. Of course I<br>encouraged her the whole way. She was like, wow they have Johnny<br>Walker BLUE label! I was like, "You ever try it?" She's like...<br>"Nooooooo!!!" I'm like, "Go on... just get some". She's like, "<br>Are you sure?". I'm like, "Look, if you want it, just get it!" So she<br>ordered one, then another, and finally one more... Wow, she was<br>probably more than a little drunk. I stuck to my Stoli and a splash of<br>Cran.<br><br>When the BILL(S) came, she sobered up fast. I caught a glimpse of<br>hers, 5 drinks plus a little finger food for $319.00! She looked<br>shocked and sick to her stomach when she saw 2 bills. Guess she<br>thought I was buying. Think again. (The old me would a soaked up the<br>bill but steared her away from the Blue) I had 4 drinks, no food and a<br>great buzz. Pricey Stoli, but overall still a good value (I ate a ton<br>of free macadamias and almonds) $36.00. Damn I thought, that BLUE<br>label will get you every time. Of course she did more than the<br>traditional fumble through her purse. Her face was beat red and she<br>was speechless. She left the bill on the table and excused herself for<br>the restroom. I had already paid and was sucking on some ice. The<br>waitress was looking concerned. I told her, "Look". Sure enough, my<br>date was heading out toward the front door. I slowly grabbed my coat<br>as the waitress ran after her. Then security or a bellman grabbed her<br>at the door and a small shouting match ensued.<br><br>Can you imagine, she was trying to leave - without paying!<br><br>Well, I didn't stick around to see what happened. All I saw was the<br>poor waitress standing just inside the front door with a small<br>cocktail tray. she did look concerned but not panicked. A doorman and<br>bellman had the girl by the arm outside and was semi-forcing her back<br>inside. She wasn't getting away from this bill. I paid my bill. I had<br>my receipt. But I couldn't help wondering why she ordered three Johnny<br>Walker Blues. Doesn't she know that **** is expensive? Then I wondered<br>if they had to arrest her while I had another drink at my local Irish<br>pub.<br><br>I haven't heard from her again. Too bad, she was pretty cute, too.</div>
