            <div class='col-md body'>Throughout my life stemming from my travels, i have become a global citizen, with a few exceptions that i realise now. Ever since i was a very young lad, i have been brought up with a worldly view, very secular. I played with Indo kids, chinese kids, white, black, african, sri lankan etc etc all sorts of people, i never judged or spoke differently to different people, unless ofcourse i spoke to them in their own native tongue.<br><br>This sort of secular growing up lasted until now, but I don't mean i am racist now heh, i am just reflecting some stuff. I have noticed from the way people here speak to me, e.g. Teachers, teens or people I meet (mostly friends of friends). They speak to me in a way which highlights my differences in appearance (especially) and culture, while when they speak to each other, they do so more nicely or in another sort of way. This makes me feel, on a kind of losing end, to be spoken to "specially" in a different way from everyone else... i have always been brought up to respect everyone and treat everyone equally.<br><br>Yes I know this is a meritocratic society and all, but all that is on paper, it doesn't take into account characters and prejudices of people in socialisation.<br><br>In other words, it is other people, NOT ME or my Upbringing, that makes me feel the racial divide from people. I feel sorry for such people, but moslty I feel sorry for myself, for not being more local or like them when i came into this world. Which makes my recent birthday a day of regret for my birth.</div>

I have my share of friends around the globe, some you don't see often, others as colleagues and a number of very wonderful people. Surely we are all different in some aspects and similar in others, celebrate your uniqueness and embrace the likeness. Be not caustic about the cards you were dealt but play it well, choose life and its' marvels. Happy Belated Birthday.</div>
