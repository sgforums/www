            <div class='col-md body'>She expects me to give her the attention a bf would give... sometimes i feel like Aladdin's magic lamp... I can only do that much as a friend. It may sound selfish, but when someone i really really like finally appears before me, there is no way i can still give her all my time and attention. And i've told her that... Its not like she fancies me either. I don't see why i'm obliged to be her genie forever and ever. When her new beau comes along, she would forget all about me again anyway. Just so happens that this time, i made the first move...<br><br>And i HAVE met someone that i rather spend time with. Someone who listens and understands what i'm saying... (i think...). Even if its 99% online time together. Even if we don't talk that much. But knowing that we're both online and that i can talk to her anytime a topic comes up... it feels good. Plus i've also reconciled myself with my faith... i want to move on...<br><br>Can i be selfish just once? Am i really being selfish?</div>
