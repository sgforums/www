              <p>i will never jump into marriage for the sole purpose of getting a subsidy. there are more important things to worry abt than that. u gonna be staying with the spouse in that house anyway. make sure its the right man/woman to share the home with. you wouldn't want the home to turn into a warzone. after all, we all want to live a happy life. . . think more than just dollars and cents. there are some things that money cant buy and those are the things we should go out and obtain. . .</p>
              <p>so ya. . . take it easy :)</p>
