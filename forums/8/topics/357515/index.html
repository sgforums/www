              <p>I dont remember my first time i got physical. I remember I fought a lot in primary school tho. The reason was there where these 2 groups, called Gabbers (hardcore (a music style) listeners) and Skaters (obviously they where into skating). I was a Gabber and we where only with 3 in our whole school. And the skaters where with 8 or 9 persons. So we got into group fights of 8 vs 3 (not really fair is it?).</p>
              <p>The reasons we fought where stupid also, the skaters hated us (the gabbers) and vica versa. Just because we where gabbers and they where skaters.</p>
              <p>The worst fight i've got into with them was when they came at me with 4 of them. I went straight towards the leader of the group and gave him a knee to his head. Best tactic ever cause after the knee to the head they all ran in fear. Next day I had to go to the schools office and I was affraid of being kicked out of school for a while. Less did I know the teachers knew the skaters where the ones who dared me and the gabbers to fight them all the time. So I got only a warning of being too agressive while fighting. The guy had a nice nose for a while tho :D. After that they tried to beat me with all eight of them, they circled me so i could not escape so i did my best and gave some nice dmg towards some of them, sadly i failed against eight but luckily a teacher came by and the fight ended pretty fast.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A year later or so we all became friends.</p>
