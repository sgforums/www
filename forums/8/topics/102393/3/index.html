In the acticle published in page 6 of LianHe Wanbao 11/11/2004, he cited that something was amiss in the psychological behaviour of Huang Na's mother, Mdm Huang Shuying, and her step-father, a certain Mr Zheng.<br><br>The expert's view was that Mdm Huang appeared aloof and was unusually quiet for a mother who claimed to have lost her beloved daughter in a murder case. He noted that it was baffling, not only to himself but to members of the community-at-large ( possibly including psychological experts at Woodbridge Hospital and NUS ), that Mr Zheng, being a stepfather to a daughter he had hardly any contact with, could behave in such a manner - wailing loudly and crying uncontrollably during the funeral procession.<br><br>The article carrying Prof. Lee's view is suggestive and appears to point towards a plausible scenario that Huang Na was silenced by her mother and stepfather, thereby making Malaysian Mr Took Leng How as a scapegoat. Prof Lee himself had the opinion that the case left numerous questions that have not been answered............<br><br>Part 2 to be continue.</div></blockquote>Lol the police and court based on eidvences ! So far the suspect have even manage to review the location of the corspe.<br><br>And yours is based on what ? Some so call Prof who was not even near any crime scene ? If he is baffled by the behaviour, why no 2 person is alike, so what they behaviour different from us, possible the culure different.<br><br>I serious think NTU should review this Prof capabilities, maybe it is not the parent that we should be focusing on, but this so call Prof, who skill and knowledge may be in very serious in need of question.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello all,<br><br>dunno if the news were reliable ( source from those kapo aunties who followed Huang Shuying day and nite for the pass few days ). These are the conversations:<br><br>'She told me that huang Na's father actually went back on his words about the 'pek gim' that he initially promised to donate 50% to charity. In the end, he donated the soft toys ( many were hello kitty from Macdonald ) to charity homes instead and kept all the money, which was reported to be at least half a million SG dollars. ( my family also strike 7333, so they did went to the wake to donate few hundred dollars but I sweared I did not strike  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  ).<br><br>Reporters asked him why he didn't keep his promise, he said he need to buy LAND ( so Tiong Kok Siah ) in China. And also he said he got heart problem, thats why need to go back to China...Reporters were bewildered and told him that he can have a check in local hospitals, from that moment, he became frustrated and declined the interview...<br><br>Actually this 2 parents.........had only want to make 7 day funeral procession then go back China......but was persuaded to make it 49 days instead....<br><br>I just feel that she doesn't want to go to the court-hearing......</div>
