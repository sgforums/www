Having "settled" Huang Na's case, the public should "direct" more attention to other more pressing matters such as to search for OTHER missing kids or help other people. HN's case is now with the police. Instead of us laying around to just see what unravels after, we should focus our attention to other unfortunate people who still requires our help.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>2). Agreed with Ah Ma on point 2.<br><br>3). Possible but most probably unlikely. Just my hunch.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>4). Nah, what wrong with mum going on an overseas trip. Might be just a short trip to "visit" the step dad or some relatives or business trips. It might not be A LONG trip. I believe many singaporean kids have their parents go on business trips while they remain in sg for school rite?<br><br>7). Last part on stepdad, yup.

But has any media mentioned what kind of business is that?  Everyone assumes that he is one of those "drive mercedes" kind of men.  So being a wife of this believed-to-be-multi-million-businessman, she is not supposed to work.  If she works, something is wrong with her.  Duh!<br>Do you know that even a person doing MLM is a businessman?  Even a provision shop owner is a businessman.  Why not?  It is also business what.  Technically, all these are businessman.<br>Ok lah.  Given that you are right.  Mr Zheng is a millionaire, a businessman that runs a few factories and a few hotels in China. Mdm Huang does not need to work.  But what is wrong with her working?  She is a study mommy here.  If she doesn't work, what is she supposed to do everyday?  Stay at home, do nothing and wait for daughter to come home?<br>Anything wrong with her working to kill time?  Anything wrong with her working to reduce her husband's burden?  Anything wrong with her working to make a bit more money so as to buy nicer shoes, dresses for daughter?<br><br>Let me go through the old messages again and see what has been pointed out as "being suspicious".  Be right back...</div>

Each interrogation could take hours after hours.<br><br>We all know that it is always the family members who have more reasons and more access to kill the victim.  If Prof DunnoWho and any of us could think of that, do you think the police (with tonnes of experience in this area) have not thought of that???

            <div class='col-md body'>About Took owing money &amp; be the scapegoat to pay off his debt....<br><br>What kind of debt that can be so huge that he makes this kind of sacrify????<br>Let Sg court hang him and leave his wife, child and parents???<br>If you're talking about a few millions, ok lah.  But how the hell will he owe so much money????  From credit card bills??<br><br>Even though we say that it's not easy to be rich, it is also not easy to owe so much money (I'm talking abt a few millions!!!).  If you say he bought shares and lost money, I don't think he could do that.  Even I can't do that.   If you say he gambled, lost money, and borrowed money from Ah Long, you think it's so easy to borrow millions of dollars from Ah Long?<br><br>Let's say Took is not millions of dollars in debt.  Only a few hundred K.  If you think anybody will give up his life, family, future etc to clear a debt of $10,000 or $100,000, will you do that???  Personally I won't.  At the most, I declare bankruptcy.  Same for Took.  Besides, his family owns a small little business.  Worst case, he could go back to Penang.  And one day, he might even take over the business.  Took is not highly educated, but he's not retarded.  He knows murder means death sentence here.  Why would he surrender to clear a small little debt of $10k or $100K??  (As mentioned, he is capable of owing anything more than that).</div>

There may be other people who do that, but we don't know.<br><br>5. Ah Hao may have been paid to dispose of the body.

They are big enough (youngest being 13 or 14) and likely they run away rather than being kidnapped.<br><br>Point no. 2 - What is Abu something torture?  How does it go?<br><br>Point no. 3 - Do we know each and every hill in Singapore?  No.  The no. of hills could be more than what we can name right now.  Btw, how do we know they didn't search that hill?  They couldn't find, doesn't mean they didn't search.  It's quite tedious.<br><br>Point no. 4 -   Possible.<br><br>Point no. 5 - Not possible.  See my earlier post.<br><br>Point no. 6 - Don't think so.  See my earlier post.<br><br>Point no. 7 - Yesh, correct.<br><br>Point no. 8 - No comments.  To me, he's outside the picture.</div>
