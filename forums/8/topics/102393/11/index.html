Stepdad says they are 'sick' of queries on donations, past crimes<br>By Tanya Fong<br><br>AS THE three-day religious rites for murdered eight-year-old Huang Na began yesterday, her mother and stepfather revealed that they were considering leaving Singapore soon.<br><br>Questions over past crimes, the amount of money they have collected in donations from well-wishers and even how many insurance policies they bought for their daughter have taken their toll on the couple.<br><br>Speaking to The Straits Times last night, the girl's stepfather, Mr Zheng Wenhai, 28, said in Mandarin that the family had originally planned to stay for the trial of Took Leng How, 22, who has been charged with Huang Na's murder.<br><br>But the constant questioning has all but changed their minds.<br><br>Said Mr Zheng: 'We have not decided when to go back to China yet.<br><br>'We would like to stay for the murder trial, but we are already being questioned about how much goodwill money we collected from Huang Na's funeral and how much insurance we bought for her and how much we will benefit now that she's dead.<br><br>'We are sick and tired of being questioned.'<br><br>Mr Zheng was jailed for 2 1/2 years for being an accomplice in a robbery.<br><br>Police are also looking into whether the girl's mother, Madam Huang Shuying, 27, had committed immigration offences.<br><br>The toll on the couple was clearly visible yesterday.<br><br>When approached by the media, Madam Huang declined to speak and shooed reporters away from the Taoist temple at Yan Kit Road in Tanjong Pagar, where the religious rites were taking place.<br><br>At one point, an exasperated Mr Zheng said the accusations were aimed at driving the couple to suicide.<br><br>He asked: 'What has our past got to do with anything?<br><br>'I came here to be with my wife and to bury our daughter. She died so terribly and we are still grieving.<br><br>'And we still have a one-year-old son back in China. If Singaporeans really sympathise with us, please let us grieve in peace.'<br><br>Yesterday's rites took place without the massive public turnout that accompanied Huang Na's funeral three weeks ago.<br><br>Thousands of people, including foreigners, had attended the funeral.<br><br>By contrast, only Mr Zheng, Madam Huang, a few close friends and six Taoist monks attended the temple rites yesterday.<br><br>The monks led the procession, chanted mantras and made offerings at a special shrine set up for the girl in the temple.<br><br>Huang Na's ashes were placed in the glass-encased shrine, together with her favourite Hello Kitty toys and paraphernalia.<br><br>Said Mr Zheng: 'Her ashes will be kept at the temple until we return to China.'<br><br>The couple, meanwhile, have left their friend's home in the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre and will be staying at the temple until they decide to leave.<br><br>The Straits Times understands that they are free to go at any time, but have been advised to stay for the trial, as Madam Huang is a prosecution witness.<br><br>Yesterday, Madam Huang was again called to the Criminal Investigation Department to help police with preparations for the murder trial.<br><br>When contacted, police said she was called to help with investigations.<br><img src="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-11-25/25sin.jpg">NO MASSIVE TURNOUT: In contrast to Huang Na's funeral, which was attended by thousands, the religious rites were a quiet event, with just Madam Huang, Mr Zheng and a few close friends in attendance. The couple, who are thinking of leaving Singapore soon, have requested that people leave them to grieve in peace. -- PHOTO: SHIN MIN</div>

But she has given her age as 27.<br><br>Last night, when contacted by The Straits Times, her husband, Mr Zheng Wenhai, speaking on her behalf, denied the allegations.<br><br>He declined to elaborate, saying they are busy preparing for three-day prayers to be held at a Yan Kit Road temple where Huang Na ashes are kept. The prayers start today.<br><br>Huang Na's badly decomposed body was found almost three weeks after her mother's widely publicised hunt for the missing girl led dozens to join in the search.<br><br>The ICA spokesman said repeat immigration offenders and those who have committed serious offences may be banned for a longer period of time, even permanently. -- K.C.
