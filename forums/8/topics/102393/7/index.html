It's stupid that the media made so much news on it resulting in the great amount of donation, and then in the end asked them to declare the amount. Donate liao now ask ppl to give back. LMAO ~ Damn xia suay.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>But then there's one point many ppl overlook: there was a promise of donating a portion of the pek kim to the needy.

If u think it this way, then Huang Na's parents have gone back on their words and that can be a reason to demand a declaration isn't it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Honeybunz:</div><div class="quote_body">I think is (guessing only ah)...<br>put the phone book on the criminal's chest and hit the phone book till he confesses.  </div></blockquote>Many people only think of harsh physical injuries. There are definitely more ways to torture a person, not only by physical abuse. Some torture are meant to stress out a person and work on the weakness of his mind.<br><br>Not letting a person drink (a common practise, i believe), no/little food, depriving a person of sleep (abrupt waking up of the person when he juz fell asleep), prolonged shining of bright lights into his eyes, pulling of hair, insulting or degrading a person's dignity, cold 'shower', etc... many of these will not result in a physical injury, but can u say that these are not means of torture?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I keep thinking through the actions<br>of various parties in the Huang Na<br>murder case. I find many gaps and<br>suspicious actions on the part<br>of the parents which I can't get out<br>of my head.<br><br>I've been watching the actions of her mom.<br>Thinking throughout all the incidents. The more<br>I think the more suspicious I get.<br><br>1. The child was said to be left alone when the mother went<br>back to china. How can a mother leave a child alone in a strange<br>country? Can you imagine yourself doing that.<br><br>2. Early in the search, I remember reading that the mom was searching at "Bukit Timah Hill, Mount Faber Hill". I find it too much of a coincidence she was searching the hills before the body was discovered.<br><br>3. The dream that reveal the body's location...this was timed when Took was arrested. Another coincidence?<br><br>4. The mom&amp;dad went round to thank the people before the child was buried. Too proper. Too systematic. Any mom would have been exhausted by the tragedy and this would never cross her mind and people would understand she needs rest.<br><br>5. The letters to the dead written during the funeral to Huang Na. Examine the contents.<br><br>6. How the donations were handled. If they were genuine in thanking the people why were they so eager to keep the money....think about this.<br><br>7. The step father was reluctant to step into Singapore until Took got arrested for the murder...then he changed his mind. Why? Think<br>hard. Why he went round to thank the people for searching for the child but did not want to come to Singapore to take part in the search until Took was arrested. You think hard about this point and its just gets more suspicious<br><br>I think it is cruel to suspect the parents if they are innocent but their actions simply invite too much suspicion. My guts and my instincts watching people and observing people over the years tells me there is something fishy.<br></div>
