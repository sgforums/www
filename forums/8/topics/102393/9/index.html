Granted, u can say that they are getting better sales in return, whatever, it is still due to their efforts that their case gets so publicized, resulting in many volunteers helping out to look for the missing kids, many people donated pek kim, and of coz also stressed the authorities to speed up on their work so as to be able to answer to the public.<br><br>If u're saying that they don't owe the public anything, are they compensating the time and efforts put in by the volunteers when they are looking for their kid? Of coz the volunteers didn't expect any return, but that doesn't mean the parents don't owe them anything - they owe them a BIGGG favor.<br><br>As for those who donated, the parents owe them an explanation why the promise to donate part of the pek kim was not carried out.

If we cannot be with our lawyers during the interrogation, how would the person be able to tell what should be answered, and what shouldn't be? Remember that in such cases, whatever the defendant says or does can be used against him in court. The defendant answering the questions in a straightforward manner might not be able to see the consequences involved.<br><br>In this case, Took obviously has been helping in investigations, while he has been denied the rights to speak to his lawyer in private. Is this what is going on in Singapore all along? Is this the 'standard' legal procedure worldwide?<br><br></div>

Granted, u can say that they are getting better sales in return, whatever, it is still due to their efforts that their case gets so publicized, resulting in many volunteers helping out to look for the missing kids, many people donated pek kim, and of coz also stressed the authorities to speed up on their work so as to be able to answer to the public.<br><br>If u're saying that they don't owe the public anything, are they compensating the time and efforts put in by the volunteers when they are looking for their kid? Of coz the volunteers didn't expect any return, but that doesn't mean the parents don't owe them anything - they owe them a BIGGG favor.<br><br>As for those who donated, the parents owe them an explanation why the promise to donate part of the pek kim was not carried out. In terms of monetary gain, the parents DO OWE these people the $$ now.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Being grateful = announcing how much they have?<br>Didn't they thank everyone openly?<br><br>This is very different from NKF or Cancer Foundation appealing for funds.  They has never expressed nor implied that they needed anybody's donation.  Pek Kim is given voluntarily by people, just like the way ang pao is given by the elders to us.  We don't see our elders telling us to show our gratitude by announcing how much we collect.<br><br>Yes, the donors have done great to the parents.  The parents can choose to thank them in some other ways (in this case, they can thank every donor once again openly like the one reported in the newspapers) instead of annoucing how much they have.<br><br>The media chose to make such a huge coverage over this piece of news so as to gain sales (they don't do it for nothing.  The media are business people and it's a practical world).   So, there is nothing that the family owes the media.<br><br>If we talk about owing the volunteers a big favour &amp; question whether or how the helped family is compensating the volunteers, then they won't be called volunteers anymore.  They will be known as salaried workers or some other terms you may think of, but volunteers.<br><br>There is only ONE reason why the parents should reveal : To satisfy everybody's curiosity (in layman's term : kaypoh).<br><br>One question for all : Those people who think the parents should reveal the pek kim amount  -- Did they in anyway contribute to finding of the child, or donate the pek kim????  I think NOT.</div>
