            <div class='col-md body'>My conclusion:<br><br>1. Huang Na was killed due to some other reasons.<br><br>2. The whole murder was plotted.<br><br>3. The step father looks suspicious. He turned up only when Took was arrested. Why didn't he rush down to help search?<br><br>4. In the beginning reporters asked if the mom contacted the dad, she said,"She does not want the dad to worry". That was 2 weeks after the child went missing. The statement is not logical. Does it make sense to keep this type of things from the father?!<br><br>5. TOOK is likely the scape goat, being at the wrong place at the wrong time and knowing the wrong people.. fallen into the SG Police trap of "surrender yourself if you have done nothing wrong"..<br><br>6. TOOK may have a small role in the plot, and even if he is not guilty of the murder, it is going to be an offence to leave singapore w/o proper travel documents, and possibly disobeying police order.<br><br>7. The CID should check Huang Na's mom &amp; stepfathers passport and check their location before &amp; after the murder.<br><br>But if they (the parents) can forged their passports to enter Singapore illegally numerous times, they can also forged their locations (cutoms stamp).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just read the papers.. Huang ShuYing n Hubby said that they wun reveal the amount cos the Pek Kim is sacred and it belongs to Huang Na, so cannot donate out or reveal amt, cos if not will be disrespectful to huang na..<br><br>Then why in the first place wan to say will donate to charity??!?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Can't help but feel that it may be a plot to make the public donate more...<br><br>Also.. last time the papers got show Huang ShuYing going around searching for Huang Na (when the body not found yet)..

There is no reason for him to cooperate with the SPF if he has something to hide. Had he really killed Huang na, he is welcome to do a Mike McCrea &amp; take up residence in the Swan Valley while the diplomats squabble it out. In the meantime, I'll tutor him in English. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
