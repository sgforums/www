A reminder of ur previous post - </blockquote>What you mean by change idea?  You mean I change my mind, izzit?<br>What has thanking people got to do with owing anybody anything?<br>You can help me carry things and I say "Thank you".  But that doesn't mean I owe you anything.<br><br>Maybe I didn't put it clear.  They didn't owe the public anything = they are in no obligation in fulfilling the public's curiosity or demand in knowing the amount of money.<br><br><blockquote>As for why the parents owe the media, volunteers and people who donated the pek kim, I have already spelt out very clearly in my previous post. </blockquote>This I agree is a mistake on the parents' side <strong>(If it can be proven that they did promise that)</strong>.  If they really said that, they must have said it on impulse.  Morally, it is wrong to say something to the media but do another thing.  But still, legally, they still reserve the right not to fulfill that.<br>But still we cannot say they are ungrateful or anything.  We can only say that they "che da pao" (in layman's term), when they claimed they would donate money.<br><br><blockquote> think u didn't read my post well. Yes, they were VOLUNTEERs who would not expect any returns or benefits, but the parents still owe the volunteers a BIG FAVOR. You know what is "ren2 qing2 zhai4"? They would be ungrateful if they think otherwise. If u still think nothing of it, and u can't understand what I'm talking about, it juz goes to show that u're the ungrateful sort. </blockquote>Ok, so you mean to return the ren qing, they must announce how much they have?  Does that mean thanking the volunteer which they did is not enough?  In the first place, the volunteers did not even complain that the parents did not "compensate" them for their time &amp; effort.  They are not the one who demand to know the pek kim amount by saying "Hey, we helped you.  You should show your gratitude by letting us know how much  you have".  It is those who did not contribute anything (no help, no money contributed) who demanded that.  Strange, huh?<br><br>btw, favour means a kind action that you do for someone.  In this case, care to elaborate what you mean by big favour and how you think the parents show return the favour?<br><br><blockquote>some people might argue that they gave the pek kim thinking that the parents would donate part of it to charity! </blockquote>But has any of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>donors</strong></span> argued on this?<br><br><blockquote>why do you think so many people are angry about this? It's not because they kay po, it's because of the COMBINATION all these issues that happen that caused people to suspect their honesty.</blockquote>Kaypoh people are usually angry over issues that are none of their concern.   In this case, none "angry" people are the volunteers or donors.<br><br><blockquote>So much that the greed can overcome a person's conscience.</blockquote>What conscience?  He didn't do anything wrong.  Neither did he use "dirty" method to get those money.  But of course, if anybody could prove that the parents pretended to cry in front of the media to win our sympahty and get people to contribute the pek kim, then you are right to say that they have betrayed their conscience.<br><br><blockquote>it juz goes to show that u're the ungrateful sort</blockquote>Hey, this is uncalled for.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

It was a misunderstanding, they said.<br><br>'We only said that we would donate the gifts and food, which we have already done,' Mr Zheng told Lianhe Wanbao.</span><br><br>He also refuted rumours that they had received up to $100,000 in bai jin.<br><br>Mr Zheng also denied receiving close to $10,000 from a Mr Tan who had a windfall of $130,000, as reported earlier.<br><br>He said they received donations from about 1,000 people. The largest sum was $4,000, from someone from their hometown. The smallest was $4.<br><br>'There were also people who donated $10, $20, $50, $200, $500. The least was $4. Most of the sums were small,' he said.<br><br>Madam Huang told Shin Min Daily that according to tradition, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the bai jin is meant for the deceased, and revealing or donating the amount is disrespectful to the dead.</strong></span><br><br>She added that the public may not understand the difference between donations and bai jin.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">'If they intended the money to go to charity, why didn't they donate the money directly instead of giving it to us as bai jin for Huang Na?'</span><br><br>Despite the intrusive questions, the grieving parents stand by their belief that Singaporeans are 'good-hearted'.<br><br>And they don't blame those who turned up at their daughter's wake and funeral in the hope of making a quick buck by looking for numbers to buy in the next 4D draw.<br><br>Mr Zheng said: 'Buying lottery is part of Singapore's culture.<br><br>'I respect that, and I don't blame anyone for wanting to capitalise on my daughter's death to win a little money.'<br><br>He is grateful that thousands of people turned up at the wake and funeral to send his daughter off.<br><br>Never mind some people's obsession with touching her hearse in the hope of rubbing off some of the 'money luck'.<br><br>Malaysian Took Leng How, 22, has been charged with Huang Na's murder. He has been remanded in a prison hospital for psychiatric examination.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>honeybunz &gt; You are one very confused person. I shall attempt to clarify myself one last time. I have said it many times before that these are <span class="large"><strong>two separate</strong></span> issues. You keep insisting to relate these two issues together, and you are the one who keep repeating that gratitude is somehow related to bligation to reveal pek kim amount. I am saying that we should treat these as separate issues. So what are the two issues we're talking about??<br><br>1st issue - Whether the parents owe the media, volunteers, pek kim donors and the general public anything.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">--------- Drawing this line to help u understand what is meant by separate issues ------</span><br><br>2nd <strong>AND SEPARATE</strong> issue - Whether the parents are obligated to reveal the total amount of pek kim they have collected.<br><br>While I must agree these issues are closely-linked, I prefer to see them separately. Never have I once said that gratitude means anything else, yet u keep repeating and insisting that it does.<br><br>I have already given my opinions for these two <strong>separate</strong> issues, no need to repeat myself again. Just want to say that the actions of the parents (esp the step-father) causes many people to doubt his "honesty". The step-father repeatedly trying his best to escape from interviews even to the extent of turning off his HP during an live-tv interview, his mention of having a heart-problem yet refusing to let our local doctors help him, and now his denial of the promise to donate $$ to charity etc etc... are signs that his "honesty" can be questioned.<br><br>P.S &gt; Regarding gratitude (1st issue)<br><blockquote>Originally posted by Honeybunz:<br>What has thanking people got to do with owing anybody anything?<br>You can help me carry things and I say "Thank you". But that doesn't mean I owe you anything.<br><br>Hey, this is uncalled for.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </blockquote>Quote (and I repeat) from my previous post:<br>"but the parents still owe the volunteers a BIG FAVOR. <strong>You know what is "ren2 qing2 zhai4"</strong>? They would be ungrateful if they think otherwise. <strong>If u still think nothing of it, and u can't understand what I'm talking about, it juz goes to show that u're the ungrateful sort.</strong>"<br><br>Obviously your idea of "owing" someone gratitude is different from mine.<br></div>

Sebagai seorang cina yang PERNAH tinggal di malaysia, saya cuma ada 1 alasan baik kenapa saya harus meniggalkan negara itu, iaitu kaum cina TIDAK dianggap sebagai rakyat yang SAMA tahap seperti kaum melayu, mereka sering dianggap sebagai "pendatang" dan perkataan ini pernah dikatakan oleh ahli UMNO.<br><br>In English,<br><br>Mr Intrakota, i am very proud of u for having such caring thought over our malaysian chinese man.

( is this call justice, fairness, human rights? ur quran teaches u to treat other races unfairly? ). We are often called "immigrants" , and these word has once said by member of UMNO.

I luv msia, and that was past. I hate the government then since they never treat us like a normal citizen. Look at all the quota of university entry...do u think this is a fair education? Who wans to spend money to go outside so expensive to study? is becoz the government limit the chinese? Am i right?</div>

Is it fair to call a chinese who born in malayisa pendatang? Then they have to buck up themselves if they are backwards. How cant they press down the chinese and give them so much priority?
