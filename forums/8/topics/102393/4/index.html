            <div class='col-md body'>I've been wondering about this ... during the period when Huang Na was missing, the media highlighted a growing group of people who were going about distributing pix of Huang Na and afew other missing people. If the child had been alive then, wouldn't all this publicity have sped up her impending doom?<br><br>A huge search for a missing person out of the media's eye might have been a whole lot more effective than something that's so in-your-face. If she and whoever had been holding her had been locked up in some isolated place, the chances of a tip-off and getting her back alive might have been a whole lot higher since the search might have escape the kidnappers' notice, right?  Even a sleeping dinosaur would have been awakened by all that hoo-haa.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>All I could think of when I saw the number of people going around with stacks of papers in their hands over the TV was ... they're not going to find the poor kid alive  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

Technically, from large numbers of death cases reported worldwide that had been examined by psychologist and other experts, it is almost certainly an unquestioned fact ( and an antipicated behaviour ) that the natural parents of a child who died either from an accident or subjected to an act of murder would have sobbed uncontrollably, and wailed loudly - to the point of even fainting on-site.

In a possible murder case, where the murderer is the person crying foul, the murderer may be tempted to court the media and amass sympathy from the general public to jeopardize court proceedings and verdicts/judgements. Anyone who has taken a course on human  behaviour and pyschology coupled with background in the mass comm. industry could easily identify the stark similarities of such classic case with the one on hand - that Mdm Huang Shuying had deliberately courted the attention of the media, with journalists and reporters being made use of ( technically classified as "tools" of the murderer ).<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div></blockquote><img src="http://us.movies1.yimg.com/movies.yahoo.com/images/hv/photo/movie_pix/twentieth_century_fox/star_wars/_group_photos/anthony_daniels4.jpg"></div>
