            <div class='col-md body'>I tend to agree with Maya on her views. I won't mind if my g/f says that but granted that she can do it as well. Probably the reason why guys and girls do such things is a deep sense of insecurity. If they even disallow going out as a gp (of mix guys and girls) then it is too exterme,i think. Anyone knows of any gd ways to ally their sense of insecurity?<br>Sometimes I find it ironic that pple propose in such cases that it is better to break off cos they cannot tahan such a restrictive lifestyle. My question for such replies is that "Don't you know that yr partner is so possesive b4 u get attached?" If yes, then should think of a soln and not propose a break. If no, then it is a different case altogether.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Trust is an important thing in an relationship! Like Cluon puts it, when insecurity then you impose such rules on your gers. But of coz I don't expect her to go out with another guy all the time. I will feel a little uncomfortable too but once in a while is okay. You have to put in the trust in a relationship else.......<br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But I'm a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Must give and take.<br><br>Trust is built up over time also, but you don't own your boy/girlfriend, so you should respect their decision to go out with their pals. You'd want them to respect your decision when you want to hang out with your pals.<br><br>Don't be over-posessive.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think this problem with posessive spouses /bf/gf  is due to some childhood negelect combined with insecurities about ones own esteem and sence of well being.<br>The fear of being negelected is one of teh most basic and primal fears of humans. Think about it, the first time in ur life that u ever feel fear and total negelect is when ur a baby.As a baby at some point of time parents must leave the child alone, so the child cries and cries and cries but no one comes, at this very point the emotion of fear is so strong that the child is really being traumatised and thus the fear of no one comming to look after u/ the fear of being negelected is burned into ur brain.<br>The second point is that of self esteem. If a human does not see his/her true worth/beauty they will feel insecure to the point of paranioa that everyone is against them. Now in the case where the gf/bf is not allowed to mix with the opposite sex as delegated by the partner,this actual dominance and illogical demand is really unnecessary, as usually in any realationship there will be at least some element of trust.So if ur partner has totally no trust in u and anyone else for that matter, there is a high chance that ur partner somewhere along the line has had a HUGE shattering betaryal of trust( usually derived from some childhood traumatic physical or sexual abuse).<br>Do not misuderstand ur partners demand ,but try and transcend the actual event (being the cannot go out with friends /opposite sex) look beyond it and try to see the reality behind teh situation which is that person who is making these unrully demands is really jsut a really frightened person who needs help.<br><br>(ps iamdamn bored)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Relationships - of all kinds - are like sand held in your hand. Held loosely,with an open hand, the sand remains where it is. The minute you close your hand and sqeeuze tightly to hold on, the sand trickles through your fingers. You may hold on to some of it, but most will be spilled. A relationship is like that. Held loosely, with respect and freedom for the other person, it is likely to remain intact.

So if ur partner has a personality problem chances are u will most have one 2 which is why u would find ur partner attractive in the 1st place. OR either that or u have a very compliant personality because basically u dont know how to say NO to ppl.
