I only discovered it when I was looking through the bills. I was negligent here for not checking early, no dispute that it's my fault.<br><br>I am not disputing abt a late payment fee, but rather, the amount of it. Perhaps a nominal fee of ard $5 will be more appropriate for a deterrent/warning.<br><br>Imagine for a poor family who can't pay for 4 times, the penalty fee will be abt the same as the tv license fee! That's a heavy burden. They only allow 2 weeks for you to pay before another late payment fee is charged.</div>
