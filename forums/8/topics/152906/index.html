            <div class='col-md body'>Our gahment are smart ppl. They know where their country flaws are and they try their very best to plug the flaw. So you see new water, land reclaim etc project going on.<br><br>As to our Northern neighbor, they also have their own set of problem. They may have land and water but they are facing a slow growth cuz of their too pro local policy which means ppl there see no need to progress too fast forward. Water some state wanna sell to us cheap but due to geography they need to pass by some of their brother land so dispute arise. Must they pay money to their own brother in order to get the water to us ?<br><br>Note within their country, brother and brother fight also leh. Ever went to their various brother state to see how they fare? It is a good learning experience  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Do you think SG is capable of fending off these countries or keep our borders if these people decide they don't like sg? Its the same, its just how you choose to see it.<br><br>However, if you do not agree with the views. Its your views that local party is wonderful. Feel free to think that. I am not stopping you. For me, I'm just stating my points.</blockquote>wah lao the smart one speaks again. malaysians are the greatest la okay? but we have to see both side, since our govt cannot manage malaysia better than the malaysians, can the malaysians manage us then? see we must see both side just like you said. to each its own, but it's albeit clear whom is a lil bit more successful.<br><br>anyhow, we never say not being uneducated is low-life, but since you admitted the general population of malaysians are uneducated, how do you expect them to compete in this ever-changing fluid world? it's like saying "who say don't have F-16s means they cannot fight", but in reality hehe no way right?<br><br>why singapore lend money to them? i don't know leh, but instead of viewing it in such a cynical way, why not think that we singaporeans very generous like to help other people in need?<br><br>and then right, if our current recession is a small skirmish, i cannot bear to see what is a battle. not to say a war, not to say a world war.<br><br>you're entitled to your own views i'm entitled to mine. instead of harping on the govt's supposed flaws, i would have liked to see you in Malaysia or Indonesia during the 97 asian currency crisis. you don't fight the enemy by believing that they're all-lousy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Affairs of other countries are best manage by their own constituition as they are in a better position to know what policies are good for its people. </strong><br><br>That is assume it is for all races and religions in the country rite? However we can see from some other countries some of their policies seem to favour certain race and religion. In this aspect I think our gahmen has done the most fairest treatment of all as compared to them.
