            <div class='col-md body'>Get to know a gal recently and get her HP number. Have been calling her and sms her but conversation has always been short cos she also say she was busy at the moment. But normally she do chat and reply to my SMS.<br>However, last few weeks, attempt to call her, but somehow nobody pick the call. Even sms her to ask her how she is doing, but still no reply from her. So uneasy till SMS her that if she dun want me to call, then at least sms me back to inform me. Then IMMEDIATELY she sms me say she was busy at the moment....<br><br>Like to ask all gals out there<br>1) is she just being polite to reply my sms, and just dun know how to reject me? Probably after a few weeks, she may think it is best not to SMS me back, which may be what she is doing now... BUT again, won't she took the opportunity to SMS me back not to call again when I ask her?? IF yes, why still SMS me to say she is busy, which puzzles me (is she really busy??)<br>How would you gals reject a guy who keep calling and SMS you, but you have no interest in him? Say busy?? Dun pick the call or reply SMS AT ALL???<br>Guess all guys here would be interested to know too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To all guys here :<br>2) If you are in my situation, would you keep calling and sms till she reply? I mean, how many of you are ALWAYS eager to know the reason why a gal gives you cool and hot. Who know she was REAL busy, and won't you be kicking your own butt if you make the wrong guess that she was not interested in you??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ever since I got attached about, oooh... , 3 yrs ago, I stopped pondering such universal puzzles.<br><br>I used to ponder them day and night, turning them over and over in my mind; sometimes I even got a headache. My friends and I, we would discuss it over coffee, between lectures, while lying on the rocks at Punggol, staring at the stars and drinking beer.<br><br>What is the perfect girl? How do you know if you're in love? How do you know if she's interested? When is it the right time to make a move? What's the best line to approach a girl with? Does Jennifer Aniston have a nice ass? Y'know, the usual questions.<br><br>Well, I can tell you the definitive answer... We don't know... and we may never know.<br><br>Besides... I now have new problems to ponder...<br><br>What did she mean by that? Is she angry? Does yes mean no? Does no mean yes? WHY is she angry?

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm..<br><br>ok..i don't really know what that girl is thinking..but in my opinion i think you still stands a chance  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Why did i say that?<br><br>Becos..if she is not interested in you, she will jolly well continue to ignore you when you sms her that you will stop calling and sms her. Maybe she is really busy and tot that she can return your sms/calls when she is free...<br><br>however..<br><br>There may also be a chance that she only treats you as a friend...cos..if i am her...if the guy i like called me or sms me...i would be very excited and no matter how busy i am..i will try my best to return his every call/sms..<br><br>Conclusion...<br><br>Don't place too much hope on her...cos i think the chances of her treating you as a friend is higher..<br><br>That is only my opinion ..hopefully i am wrong..Good luck to you!!<br><br>------------------<br>I don't know how you do what you do, i'm so in love with you, it just keeps getting better, i wanna spend the rest of my life, with you by my side, forever and ever.

            <div class='col-md body'>Last month I saw my ex-schoolmate "R" when I got up to leave the library. I had something on to attend urgently so we talked very little with each other.<br>Then my friend paged me that R wanted my pager number. I let him have mine coz I tot he got something important to talk to me.But his pager messages indicated his interest in him.Of course I was not interested in him.Hence I paged him that I was busy at that moment(I do not want to hurt him but at the same time do not want to mislead him into thinking we can be more than friends in the future)everytime he asked me out.<br><br>Hence I think HardRock should not contact her anymore.Just my opinions.No hard feelings,HardRock?<br><br>[This message has been edited by butterflyer (edited 10 October 2000).]</div>
