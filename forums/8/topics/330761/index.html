                  to book a holiday, the fella recommended me MAS travel insurance coz i book flight
                  with malaysia
                  airlines. He started telling me s@#t about baggage lost or get kidnap or cooked
                  while partying with the tribe people there haha. so to shut him up i bought it
                  la..so cheap oni. One thing let to another we ended up going to lunch and
                  discussing about ghost stories, bizarre practices and all.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Do you all have any ‘nice’
                  stories to tell when travelling to some place or anything at your work place or
                  whatever?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Let me start first:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Last year i went backpacking
                  in rural Cambodia
                  and in the late evening at a kampong-paddy field type place place the streets
                  were damn dark n deserted. I asked a random (reluctant to get down from his
                  bicycle) guy in the streets and he told me there were vampires (like brad pitt
                  type) and mummies walking around there at night. I was<span>  </span>thinking ‘WTF on your lights and they wont
                  dare come out la!’ But no wonder right..i think the locals din tell me so that
                  i get eaten and the creatures wont disturb them tat night. Believe it or not
                  that night i paid S$150 to stay at one of the local’s living room. Crappy
                  pallet and all. And they din even have the courtesy to serve me breakfast the
                  next day! </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I personally love ghost
                  stories coz it’s the bomb. I love to scare myself s^%tless. Come tell tell!
                  Local story better still!</span></p>

              <p>I've never talked about this before, but I really need the boards
              advice on what could be a crucial decision. I’ve suspected for some
              time now that my wife has been cheating on me.<br> <br> The usual signs… Phone rings but if I answer, the caller hangs up.<br> My wife has been going out with the girls a lot recently although when
              I ask their names she always says, “Just some friends from work, you
              don’t know them.”<br> <br> I always stay awake to look out for her taxi coming home, but she
              always walks down the drive. Although I can hear a car driving off, as
              if she has gotten out of the car round the corner. Why? Maybe she
              wasn’t in a taxi?<br> <br> I once picked her cell phone up just to see what time it was and she
              went berserk and screamed that I should never touch her phone again and
              why was I checking up on her.<br> <br> Anyway, I have never approached the subject with my wife I think deep
              down I just didn’t want to know the truth, but last night she went out
              again and I decided to really check on her.<br> <br> I decided I was going to park my motorcycle next to the garage and then
              hide behind it so I could get a good view of the whole street when she
              came home. It was at that moment, crouching behind my bike , that I
              noticed that the valve covers on my engine seemed to be leaking a
              little oil.<br> <br> Is this something I can fix myself or should I take it back to the dealer?</p>

Maybe she wasn’t in a taxi?<br><br>I once picked her cell phone up just to see what time it was and she went berserk and screamed that I should never touch her phone again and why was I checking up on her.<br><br>Anyway, I have never approached the subject with my wife I think deep down I just didn’t want to know the truth, but last night she went out again and I decided to really check on her.<br><br>I decided I was going to park my motorcycle next to the garage and then hide behind it so I could get a good view of the whole street when she came home. It was at that moment, crouching behind my bike , that I noticed that the valve covers on my engine seemed to be leaking a little oil.<br><br>Is this something I can fix myself or should I take it back to the dealer?</p>
