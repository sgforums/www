As long as I'm happy and I get paid good money.<br><br>O my god!? Why?<br><br>Okay. Fine. They said, "Go ahead".<br><br>Fine... So go ahead... I shall that. Maybe.<br><br>But Singaporean guys. Are Stingy. Stinky. Sucky.<br><br>Poor... And unwillingly. I probably have to find a rich foreign boyfriend. Of my age, then maybe i could afford all that shopping again.<br><br>I still remembered , One of my roomie cum buddy. He paid for all my shoppings and stuff. Fun we had. And he was only 3yrs older.<br><br>Every shopping trip we wld chalk up thousands of dollars, like nobodies business. But now that he is gone. So are my other roomies.It boring.<br><br>No both crazy shopping sprees. Even my "singaporean" best friend, is restricting me.<br><br>"Kate, you are spending too much! Stop it" , she always says.<br><br>So how could $150, nevermind, I would say, $XXX a week from any sugardad be enough to tide me thru ?<br><br>$150, is not even enough for health checkups....<br><br>Darr....<br><br>Maybe, a foreign quirky boyfriend is fun....<br><br>Maddox? Kathy ? U guys sure its alright for sis to do such stuff?<br><br>They know I had sex b4. Kathy walked in on me b4.<br><br>She thinks I'm dumb.<br><br>Nvm, that fact.<br><br>Its either a rich sugar dad. Or a foreign boyfriend.<br><br>Lets see which cross my path 1st.<br><br></div>

You are simply shallow.<br><br>I quote from her blog:<br>--------------<br>What Am I? Exactly?<br><br>I lost my virginity at 14. How? I was raped? Did I tell anyone? No. Did I have Sex again? Yes, I did. With someone I loved? No. How many times? No idea. How many Guys? 2.<br><br>I always thought I would never practice pre-marital sex. Stay a virgin till the day I got married. I wouldn't want my future husband to think any less of me, would I? Would he? I want to marry into a Good family. A Good Guy. And have beautiful and lovely children. Is that what I want? Or what the society wants of me?<br><br>But at least till this day, IÂ’m still preaching about this. To stay a virgin. IÂ’m still in denial that IÂ’m one.<br><br>I remembered my mum telling me once, "Kids born to non-virgin mothers are stupid." I believed. Did she say that to scare me? Prevent me from having sex? Or is that true?<br><br>I was raped, by a foreign student lodging at my house. A friend. On a single mattress. While his sister was just sleeping in the same room at that point of time. Did my screams not wake her up? Or was she too afraid of her brother? Okay, fine. I deserved it right? I was making out with him. Clothes were on. We were just kissing. He took it too far. Was a Miscommunication?<br>-------<br>End quote.<br><br></div>

Somehow, she has became disillusioned. A person such as this should be sympathized. You are simply shallow.<br><br>I quote from her blog:<br>--------------<br>What Am I? Exactly?<br><br>I lost my virginity at 14. How? I was raped? Did I tell anyone? No. Did I have Sex again? Yes, I did. With someone I loved? No. How many times? No idea. How many Guys? 2.<br><br>I always thought I would never practice pre-marital sex. Stay a virgin till the day I got married. I wouldn't want my future husband to think any less of me, would I? Would he? I want to marry into a Good family. A Good Guy. And have beautiful and lovely children. Is that what I want? Or what the society wants of me?<br><br>But at least till this day, IÂ’m still preaching about this. To stay a virgin. IÂ’m still in denial that IÂ’m one.<br><br>I remembered my mum telling me once, "Kids born to non-virgin mothers are stupid." I believed. Did she say that to scare me? Prevent me from having sex? Or is that true?<br><br>I was raped, by a foreign student lodging at my house. A friend. On a single mattress. While his sister was just sleeping in the same room at that point of time. Did my screams not wake her up? Or was she too afraid of her brother? Okay, fine. I deserved it right? I was making out with him. Clothes were on. We were just kissing. He took it too far. Was a Miscommunication?<br>-------<br>End quote.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
