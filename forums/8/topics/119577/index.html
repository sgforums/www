            <div class='col-md body'>They haf a very big nite bazaar @ Suan Lom. Patpong for chiong stuff only i tink. Coz their prices is out to slaughter the tourists. Remember to bargain. Roadside stalls can hantum less 60%. MBK aso can.<br>Ma boon krong (MBK) is something like our far east plaza. There's Siam Square &amp; the Discovery Centre for their local designer labels. Tink m)phosis has a shop there too. Erm.. go bangkok muz go chiong lingerie..hehe. Zen &amp; Isetan @ the World Trade Centre r the 2 departmental stores dat houses brands like Triumph, Wacoal.. gd price! Do remember to try on coz their thai gals r actually quite small. Service is good so no nid paiseh.. Try all u like &amp; BUY MORE.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Btw Levis is cheaper there too.<br>1 more thing, if u like pizzas, EAT @ pizza hut!

            <div class='col-md body'>Foxwalk....depends on what you want to buy....<br><br>Pratunam Market (mear Baiyoke sky hotel) is good for cheap and good fashionable ladies wear. .. However its a wholesale area so they usually require you to buy a minimum of 3-6pcs to get their wholesale prices. If you are going with girlfriends it would be ideal as you gals could combine your purchases...<br><br>For "cheong" goods, I recommend MBK...there are a row of shops at the basement selling...try the second one on the left hand side from the direction of the escalators....they have a wide selection (all hidden, you have to ask...if you have model number would be better)...you also have to really bargain hard....but they are fair and do give good discounts...I buy from them very regularly...their product quality is also very good...<br><br>anything else you need to know? feel free to ask..I go there every month so its like my second home liao..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
