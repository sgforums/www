I've thought of buying a 5-Rms HDB flat and intend to sell it off in a 5~7yrs time and switch/"downgrade" to 4-Rms and maybe could get abit of money from the sale of the 5-Rms flat to use for other purposes...but then heard from my friend said something that we can't just "downgrade" like that becoz last time got alot of ppl did that n garment has post a restriction on that...not too sure if it's applicable to HDB or private properties,i.e. condos'</div>

I think can use cpf to pay the 10% downpayment? (sorry can't recall) Also need to pay cash as commission to the agent, if you have to.<br><br>Q2. Can split cpf among the joint/common tenants in any proportion you wish, as long as the you have sufficient amount every month (need to show pay slip).<br><br>Q3. If you're referring to the increase of the 10% downpayment, it means each year, the downpayment will increase to 12%, then 14% and so on...they want to curb frivolous buying or buying a flat that's beyond their means, e.g. by people who don't have much cash.<br><br>Q4. You can get HDB loan as long as you have not enjoyed the privilege for 2 times already. First timer can get loan from HDB...a better deal in the long run.<br><br>That's as far as I know from a yr or so ago...<br><br></div>
