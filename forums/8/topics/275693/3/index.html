It's for the very reason why i push myself so hard at the gym everyday, so that i can stand up for myself when the time comes.<br><br>I can of course choose the easy way out, and just walk away/get help, but then wouldn't all my trainings go to waste?</div>

Off Spray? Improvised Flamethrower?<br><br>Honestly, i think you haven't seen the power of pepper sprays. A good can of pepper spray can stop a bear in its track. And by good, it shouldn't have to cost more than 20USD.<br><br>Pepper spray will incapacitate a person in a split second. Baygon or whatever nonsense can only serve to temporarily blind a person if lucky. Note, blind only, it means that can still try an shoot you if he has a gun or swing a knife at you. With a good dose of pepper spray, he will be convulsing on the ground for a good 20 min. Enough time for you to run or kill him.</div>
