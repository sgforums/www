            <div class='col-md body'>Most people have mixed views about pre-marital sex. They think that it's okay to go ahead as long as you love that guy/gal. But you must be prepared to take whatever that's coming your way and shoulder all responsibility.<br><br>Personally, that's my view of pre-marital sex too. Just to relate an incident...<br><br>I've met this gal when I was in Sec 3. She was really wonderful - pretty, etc, etc. Everything that a guy could ask for in a gal. The only catch that she had a stead. I didn't make much move to woo her. But tried to show my care and concern to her. She got the signals and reminded me that she had a stead. Pretty depressed, I got on with my life - minus a friend (loved her very much).<br><br>Anyway, I heard from a buddy that she got pregnant and married her stead (sort of like a underground wedding). She looked much older than her 20 years old now and that's what my buddy described her as.<br><br>I don't know what had happened to her now. But really hope that her current hubby really loves her and NOT her body.<br><br>Sigh...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>honestly, i wld personally prefer losing my virginity to a non-virgin. yup, there, i've said it. i guess it's the thought of having 2 utterly inexp idiots desperately bumbling ard in the dark on the one night tt you've waited for all your life tt puts me off. if the rumours are correct, the first time definitely hurts more. having a experienced guy puts me at ease; at least i know i'm in gd hands? i know alot of girls wld obj to this, and guys: does this make me a slut? but i guess it goes both ways, girls arent THAT dif from males as you guys thk......<br><br>btw, i honestly thk tt sgreans are NOT as conservative and straitlaced as they're usually portrayed to be but rather, tt they just nv openly expose all their dirty lil secrets.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It still irks me that when males are aggressively sexual, are good in bed, and enjoy sex, they are studs, or at the worst, casanovas... but when females express the same joy in sex, they are sluts.<br><br>It's not that I support feminism, or that I want to seem sensitive to womens' needs... it just goes contrary to my sense of fairplay.<br><br>Yes yes, I know, life isn't fair, but we really shouldn't go out of the way to make it even MORE unfair, you know.<br><br>Anyway, to re-iterate my point, I think sex is something to be enjoyed, cherished even, for the intimacy it brings to a relationship. BUT, remember that in a truly loving relationship, responsibility is a strong keyword, sex or no sex.<br><br>Blatant promiscuity is not something I would condemn, but I would most certainly expect more of myself, and my partner.<br><br>------------------<br>Cya,<br>Praetor<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's a two-way thing here, as mentioned earlier...both partners would wish for their other partner to have some experience in order to guide them through the wedding night.<br><br>I seriously doubt that couples really "explore" each other because then it would be too time-consuming and both parties will not know the meaning of foreplay anyway.<br><br>Nope...it does not mean a girl is a slut if she wants a husband with some experience. Most girls would like to feel totally safe and comfortable in the hands of the one they love (which may explain the fetish of bondage).....and they are totally willing to give themselves to their husband.<br><br>Problem is: Most "pure" women don't know what to expect for sex (esp on wedding night). I once read this article in a Help column in a magazine that said that this woman actually LAUGHED at her husband's organ on their wedding night because it "looked so ugly". Needless to say, her husband was offended and hurt and obviously the marriage was already strained right from the first day.<br><br>It would be beneficial to the girl to do some reading up about sex because frankly the female is in a better position to enjoy sex than a man. It has always been said that males experience orgasm quickly but only for a brief period, whereas women experience it after much foreplay but theirs is more intense and satisfying. Moreover, woman can enjoy multiple orgasms within a specific window of time, while males have a definite "refractory" period during which thet are unable to "shoot". Just facts of life so don't get disgusted by what I say  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I strongly believe that all woman should try to get to know their bodies better...this way it would enhance their eventual sexual enjoyment with their husband, instead of treating sex as a purely physical act to get babies... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheers !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, it certainly doesn't mean that if both parties in a r/s were to remain virgins til said time, there was no other physical activity involved! That would be naive and almost impossible to imagine. So, both man and woman would already know what to expect and the wedding night would merely be a continuance of where they left of during courtship.<br><br>And, how could anyone not know what foreplay is?? Foreplay is not merely meant to turn each other on but because one wants to kiss, cuddle with, nibble...whatever with the person he/she loves.<br><br>I believe no one here still lives in the early part of the stone ages where foreplay means NOT ejaculating prematurely.<br><br>p/s where is the couple rushing off to on their wedding nite that they'd find foreplay too time-consuming?<br><br>[This message has been edited by honey (edited 30 October 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow! At least I still learn that there are still people that would prefer to keep their virginity till their first night! That's good! I thought that our society is going the other way, and that most people would rather choose to "loose" it as soon as they got a steady ...<br><br>I seriously think that virginity is not the significant key to a success in a relationship or a marriage. No one can say that because he/she is a virgin, their marriage is gonna last, forever.  Guess virginity is their own respect for themselves to be able to prove to his/her partners he/she did not have any sex before the first night.<br><br>May all of you who wish to get a virgin, good luck. And to those who wish otherwise, enjoy!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Juz go wif feelings??  What about commitment and responsibilities?  Having sex is not juz about pleasure..see wat happened to the gals who fell prey to the temporarily-testerone-surged-guys...I'm sure when they had sex, they din think of the consequences and as a result of their moment of folly, an innocent life is taken.<br><br>What many people have to understand that, sex comes with responsibility...before you do anything, think of the consequence and whether you can bear the consequence.  Of course, gals are at a disadvantage here.<br><br>I certainly think that it is not wrong for gals to derive a sense of pleasure from the sexual act as much as guys.  And gals who enjoy sex should not be labelled sluts...sluts are women who seduce and enjoy sex with some other women's husbands or boyfriends.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As mentioned just a few post above this one...what happens if u r the unlucky girl who marries a guy who cares nothing about the girls needs.  Most inexperienced and a lot of experienced guys will never know what to do unless the women tells them exactly what to do to make her feel "nice".  just a fact.  If u never had the chance to try and experiment, u might never know to what extent this part of ur relationship with ur wife/husband can get to.  and usually, people who have never done it before marriage find it harder and more of a taboo to not talk about it..so it's all unvocalised so noone knows what each other wants...:-)<br><br>Marriage is very much about sex.  It is a very important factor in it and determines to a great degree, how happy and well-adjusted u are in the relationship with ur spouse.  Not always true, but I'd like to think that it is in general very true.  It is a primal urge that needs to be satisfied and fullfilled.  By almost everyone...geek, dork, nerd, jock, chemists...etc...Unless u see sex as sin or that it's only done for reproductions sake, then this applies to everyone.  Altho some have gone on happily without it, many marriages canniot withstand this.  if they are left so unsatisfied everytime, why not just be a nun.  Less hassle than being married...Just a quick way of saying it...<br><br>Mutual pleasuring will ultimately make the couple more open with each other, more communicative, bring them closer, add spice to their lives, ..let's just face it, if ur not satisfied sexually in a marriage, u will always be frustrated and this will affect the relationhip of not just ur spouse, but family also....trust that it's true.<br><br>Everyone here, me included, would like to make it that sex should always be second or third on the list of importance in a relationship, ...but in actuality, it should be put on par with the actual love and relationship aspect as well.  It's about being able to enjoy one another when ur sick and tired of talking chijme things like this..:-)  ha ha.  It's can be a release for all kinds of tension and pain, and sorrow... In a happy relationship, after sex/love theere will always be a moment of silence followed by a quiet heart -to-heart conversation about inner feelings and revelations that otherwise wouldn't be said.  It does bring the souls closer in a relationship.....<br><br>...so there u have it.  If u get stuck with a guy who doesn't care or a girl or doesn't care about your needs in this department, ur screwed...literally..and a bad screw at that.:-)<br><br>Ever see twelve stories?  Jack Neo's China wife is the typical money minded stereotypical China woman who only marry Singa. guys for money.  Jack is always trying to have sex with her...At first he looks like a pervert uncle, added to the fact that he's always trying...:-) until u hear the wife say,"What u wnat?!!! I let u have it last month.!!!Why u want so many times for? Someting along that line....His was a sad and very lonely marriage....and for guys to know, women can use their sexuality as a tool to get u to do what u want.  No doubt most of us here has been used before by some sexy females.....Am I right guys?  :-)  heh he...<br><br>Here's hoping u get the right person...yet another thing to add to the already high demands for the right person...:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I might be flamed for this but after reading some entries in the unending discussions about virginity, some- some, not all- of the pro-virgin camp seem like very uptight, self-righteous people who don't know how to have fun. In one thread, somebody even made allusions that non virgins are as heinous and non-trustworthy as child molesters and murderers. This is how stupid and intolerant it gets. It's the same with people I talk to in real life. It's all based on my impression of course and I may be wrong. It could also be because the sample I've encountered is not representative.<br><br>If this is how people who believe in virginity is like, I don't want a virgin for a partner. I don't have anything against virginity or whatever. Personally, I don't really care whether my partner is a virgin or not because I believe in building the relationship for the future, not for the past. I just think it's important to have a partner with a healthy mentality.<br><br>P.S: I'm not referring to people in this thread.<br><br>[This message has been edited by bleue (edited 27 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well ppl Let me be frank in here. I tried my best to skip but I coudn't stand it anymore. Just bare with my me if I had a different opinion.<br>Here it goes<br>I was married at the age of 26. At that time Both My wife and me were still Virgins. Well maybe I sound a bit wierd, But its the fact. We treasured our chaste till our first night. Just a reminder we dated for 4 yrs before marriage - During this time, we slept together, we bathed together. Everything we did exept for "MAKING LOVE"<br>we didn't want to explore the feeling for it, as we wanted it to be something new to begin with.<br>Back to the Post, As someone commented on that having sex should be done then and there... well Having sex and making Love are two different things. You can have sex with anyone you like. Anyway its yr life, yr body. You can do anything u want. But the feeling of making love is different... You can even last for more than 5-6hrs doing it.<br>it's because u are sharing your Deep inside Feelings with your Loved-ones</div>
