            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm....<br><br>Pre-Marital Sex eh..<br><br>I have always ponder upon that question when i get alone or get horny.After my next BD i would be generally 26. And a men at 26 cant really help himself getting all horny esp when my galfren of 2 1/2 years is around.Heh.<br><br>But truthfully , I always wanted to *ahem* have sex with her.<br><br>But she doesnt' couple of reasons I guess.<br><br>(1) She 's a Christian *yeah am i m not ...going to hell!!weeee<br>(2) She 's still young * 19 years old ..consider just RIPE for some men*<br>(3) I respect and love her<br><br>I try not to pressure her into anything we would regret but I am contented to wait for our marriage.<br><br>because I am too ,unsure that if she gave her 1st time to me , would I be obliged to marry her? Would I have a change of heart?<br>I guess no one could answer all this questions to me.<br><br>But One word advice to all guys who really and truely love your girls. Respect her decision. If she doesnt want it ,let her be , and your have less to worry abt when you are not with her too.<br><br>Keep all urges to yourself , I know its not easy , Trust me, it's not easy.

            <div class='col-md body'>I would say that virginity seems to be more highly valued in women than in men, though I feel this is a very sexist point of view.<br><br>Firstly, it assumes that it's all right for males to "sow their oats" and so it's ok for men to be non-virgins. Secondly, it assumes that men are more horny and therefore not being a virgin probably doesn't matter much. The woman in society also has an image of "purity" to uphold and this is also connected with the idea of women virgins being more highly respected than male ones.<br><br>Singapore may seem conservative, but believe me probably a lot of teen and early 20's couples have sex in private. Being in a University myself, it is not too uncommon to hear of such incidents happening, as the availability of hostel rooms gives such couples even more privacy to carry out their primal desires.<br><br>Furthermore, there is an attitude of experimentation for most youths these days, which leads eventually to try out sex for curiousity.<br><br>I won't trivialise the matter and say that all girls are cheap when they give their bodies to their bf before marriage. The reasons are complex but in general the reason is that the guy can sweet talk her/convince her that he will marry her. Girls are more emotionally involved in a relationship and so would be willing to give their heart, soul and even body to her guy, with the notion that he would be THE GUY for her.<br><br>Sadly, most of the time it's the male hormones rising up to claim dominance (like what robinfan has said).....suffice to say that the female is seldom the horny one when it comes to relationships.<br><br>A possible explanation is because guys have external sexual organs while girls have internal ones ? Feel free to speculate....<br><br>Ok....now for my personal views.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I value virginity in a guy as much as I do in a girl, and hope to keep it all the way till marriage.<br>Of course as a guy the urges do come and quite frequently, but I guess it's a matter of self-control.<br><br>At the worse, follow Hmmmmm's advice !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Cheers everyone !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I think some girls would prefer guys with experience, that I agree with Pink.<br><br>IMHO, girls liked to be lead, not all the time though, but generally they wanted to.<br><br>And girls know that the first time would be painful (I guess for majority, I knew some that don't feel pain the first time), so they would like to have someone with experience to make that pain into enjoyment.<br><br>Moreover, to remain a virgin until marriage still proved to be a sympton of "pure" in (at least) body.<br><br>My choice is, I would not mind having pre-maritial sex, like most of the guys out there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay here's my ruppiah's worth:<br><br>I dunno but there's this really weird sense of betrayal that comes from that thought. I mean its life having your wife sleeping around with other men. It seems a little off, once you think of it that way.<br><br>Personally, just to share an experience, I went after this gal (I waited for her for almost 5 years) who was made use of by her ex-bf, to the extent that he got her pregant and made her have an abortion. I thought hard and deep about going after her. Finally I came to the conclusion that though most males would prefer to marry a virgin, it didn't really matter at the end of the day as long as I loved her.<br><br>So I professed my feelings and then *poof* she was gone. Last I heard she married a guy she met in a druken stupor at a local pub. Go figure.<br><br>But back to the topic, as long as you can live with it why not? I mean when a female gives her virginity to a male, I guess in her mind, she would probably be thinking that he would be the guy that she was going to marry anyway.<br><br>The idea of losing one's virginty for a male may be tempting and exciting at first, but then the next morning when you wake up....the first thing that will come to your mind is "What have I done?"<br><br>[This message has been edited by DangerGuy (edited 28 October 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I couldn't help but to come and put my overvalued 2 ringgits into the fray...<br><br>I follow enigma there.  I would prefer to have a non-virgin wife/girlfriend.<br><br>1. They're sexier.<br>2. they know how to use that sexines to allure u.<br>3. They know what to do.<br>4. Les shy.<br>5. Know what they want and how much they're willing to give.<br>6. would most likely be more vocal about sex and more comfortable with the whhole idea of it.<br>7. Had time to experiment so she knows what it's like to be with other guy....Thus there's less of a chance that she will start to wonder how other guys meat sticks are like.  believe me, they will consider.<br>8. Personal preference.  I like the more slutty types...if they're smart and charming enough.<br><br>I think that it has nothing to do with Asian value or any values whether people have more pre-marital sex than before.  Abstinece isn't just a quality of Asians.  The West had the exact same expectations ...in the past...It's just that the WEst has advanced a lot faster than asian societies.  All things change. If u look at human evolution, u'll see a pattern.  AS our minds become more open and accepting to new ideas, our bodies will follow.<br><br>"The body cannot exist without the mind"<br>- The matrix<br><br>AS society advances, peoples perceptions of ideas change, and so will "values".  If we still stuck to tradition Asian values, then women should still have their feet bound.  Ouch...and women should still be in the kitchen cooking for men...and men should be the only bread-earner.  And many more.  Once one value changes, so too must the rest, and it has nothing to do with the west corroding anything.<br><br>For those who've read my newer postings(last night), u'll notice that I put a quote at the bottom.<br><br>"No army can withstand an idea whose time has come."...<br><br>"...and no virgin vagina can withstand a guy who looks like Ricky Martin.."  (just a little insentive joke there..he heh)<br><br>Our minds are opening because of the west, not because of their corroding it.  If it wsn't inside of us already, we wouldn't be doing it anyway.<br><br>Also, about a year and a hlaf ago.  I read and commented strongly on a story a guy posted up about a date he had with a girl.  He had met this really pretty girl and they had chemistry.  They decided to go out for dinner so they did.  He said that they were getting along superbly and everything was perfect.  He was happy and she was too and they had a wonderful time....then as she excuse herself to go to the toilet, her purse fell and out fell all her make-up and stuff.  But the thing that blewthe guy away was that there was a couple of unopened condoms inside her purse that had fallen out also.<br><br>She slowly put it back into her purse as if it "didn't mean anything", as he said...:-p<br><br>After that, he couldn't see himself with her anymore.  He was haunted by it and considered not ever going out with her again becasue he thought she was loose and shit like that.<br><br>There was more, but that's the gist of it. He was a local guy.  I tore the guy to pieces on the message board because of his views.<br><br>Just because she was carrying around condoms, he automatically judged her to be a slut and whore, loose woman, unworthy of his love or any "decent" guy.<br><br>It was so sexist and small minded of him.  here he meets this really pretty girl that he gets along with perfectly, but becasue of some condoms.  What do u guys think of that.<br><br>I think that most of you guys here who've never had such good fortune would probably want to kick his ass.  I know I did.<br><br>It's his view, but he belongs in the 15th century, not now.<br><br>I hate feminists,( because they care nothing about women's rights), but women are entitled to everything a man is entitled to do.  They are our equals and should be thought of as such.  More to say, but I think this post is too long already.<br><br>It doesn't matter whether a woman is a virgin or not.  Virginity is over-rated and the whole idea of virginity isn't our own personal ideas(tho it is to some people), they were "given to us by our parents who got it from their parents.  There is no virtue in it.<br><br>"Virginity is the idea that women are useless and not of worth...it states that her vagina is her only worthy treasure."<br><br>It was an idea that, no doubt, was imagined up by men who made women feel as if they were worthless.  Then after, these women would use their virginity as the only tool they thought they had to gain concessions from men (as a tool for men to get married to them).<br><br>Unless the woman believes that she should remain a virgin, we men and other virgin women shouldn't judge "looser" women by their lifestyles.<br><br>The virginity issue is one of the most hypocritical issues ever brought into being by humans.  Basically it used to be a man's issue and not a women's one.  AS u can see, once u give anyone a choice, they will choose to do rather than not do.<br><br>As for u single virgin guys out there, It's great if u believe in being a virgin, but can u really honestly say that if u were soemhow in bed with a really pretty ah lian(heh heh:-)), who kept stroking u left and right, u wouldn't go for gold?  i doubt any of u would try and stop  her if she decided to jump on top and take command(ride 'em cowboy!!!!).  I'm sure there would be a few half-hearted, "no, no, please ah lian ah!  Cannot ah! no lah,..no ah!  feel so good ah! oh, DON'T STOP!"....<br><br>U will never know until it happens.  So cherish it if u find it important because if some girl who likes virgins comes along (and happens to be hella pretty), u won't stand a chance!!! :-)<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 28 October 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A slightly explicit piece of writing from firewire. But I guess what he has said summarizes my view, so I shall not repeat what has already been said.<br><br>Sexual experience aside, I believe that non-virgins are a better mate. Being more worldly and less idealistic in their views. Of course, I'm not saying that just because you had sex you are mature or knowledgable, but I guess for SOME it's a sign of their character and views.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok.....so let's get honest about this shall we ?<br><br>I agree with Firewire that a girl with "experience" is gonna be better in bed on the first wedding night. She would probably know how to enjoy sex and not be so frigid and think it's taboo and etc....<br><br>I guess sometimes I have wished for such a girl to have a little knowledge and experience too, and still yet somehow remain a virgin (It's an OXYMORON !).....but it's the truth and I'll admit it for the sake of this discussion.<br><br>I mean...I've seen friends (girls) who seem so clueless about sex that you're actually worried for them. Can they ever learn how to enjoy sex as a natural act between a married couple ? Or would it take months of persuasion and worse, counselling maybe, to even get her to open her legs ? This may sound a little extreme but some girls are really THAT sheltered in this modern age.<br><br>Of course society's perception of girl's "purity" has added to all this preconceived notions and habits, such that girls build up a wall around themselves and refuse to let a guy in (Literally !).... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Well....unlike Firewire I dislike the so-called "slutty" ones. I'd prefer a girl who is nice, sweet and still knows what she wants from a guy. She should still know how to enjoy herself as a woman and feel like a woman. I would definitely respect her for that...as long as doesn't confess to sleeping around.<br><br>Firewire has more western values I should say, so let me be the unannounced Eastern voice to share my opinions. Frankly, the West is a little TOO liberal in their associations with sex. True enough, virginity is not as sacred as proclaimed but still, losing it early in life is nothing to be proud of.<br><br>I guess I may end up being labelled as a conservative guy who does not belong to this period, but heck it.....I don't see anything wrong with wishing to remain a virgin and hoping my wife would be too.<br><br>As for Firewire's story about the guy who rejected the girl.....sadly I guess I probably would too. I couldn't stand the thought of her going for possible one-night-stands and carrying condoms in her purse "just in case". (OK Firewire you can bombard me just as you did the other guy !)<br><br>the fact is that there are still guys who would do that ! Even if she is pretty, sexy and we can get along so what ? She doesn't have to be cheap....after all there are so many other girls out there too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>As for the pretty Ah Lian seduction scenario,  as guys we should all know that we would be 99.99 % unable to resist having sex there and then. It's just nature's way of helping the human population to reproduce ! I don't deny that I would be snared by her and lust for her and etc....so there !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But the point I want to make is: Why get yourself in such a situation where you can be "trapped" in the first place ? Seems totally unnecessary isn't it....unless out of curiousity the guy actually allowed it to happen, then it's more his fault and not the girl's. I for one would avoid all such possible situations because a friend used to pose such a question to me and I could not say "No I won't have sex with her" and the reason was (lame though it sounds) "I am a MAN !"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>By the way, do girls attach a higher "value" to guys who are virgins, or do they view them  in a different light (more, less respect ??)....please contribute your views girls !<br><br>Thanks for taking the time to read this...take care everyone !<br><br>Cheers !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey MusicWhiz,<br><br>I thought u wasn't goin' to post so long essays again?  hah hah:-)  Just like me, u couldn't help it.  Our fingers don't type, we machine gun...bratttattattat.:-)<br><br>No I won't bombard u. And although I have very strong western views, I also have an equal amount of stregnth in my asian views, if not mroe so.  I'm very open and it allows me to accept a great many things and situations, but it doesn't mean that I would go to such extents myself.:-)  In fact, if u get to know me well enough, u'll find that I'm more asian than a lot of Singaporeans seem to be now-a-days...and my openess in thinking isn't really openness at all, but just a reluctance to make judgements in situations, character, etc...TO some people, i'm very closed minded and with others, I'm very accepting...It depends on how they decide to interact with me...:-)  Wahh...ZEN....:-)<br><br>Hope that explains a bit about my thinking.<br><br>the condom in the purse thing doesn't mean that she's a one-night-stander.  Maybe she just wanted to be prepareed should anything happen.  I mean, at the least, she's still smart and considerate enough to bring protection for herself, and if she has any diseases, to protect u from her as well.  :-)<br><br>About the situation that the guy can end up in....Let's say u live by urself and ur good gal friends called u up and had major fights with her family and needed someplace to hole up for a few days(or just insert another reason that she would need to stay with u).  Let's say that she feels most somfortable with u.  Would u turn her down.  Evn if u knew she was a nimpho, I don;t think that u would turn her down, especially if she was dripping tears...(ha ha, their secret weapon..no force on a man can withstand this).<br><br>This happened to me in Singapore.  at first i gave her my bed and i slept on the floor, but after two nights and several swollen limbs later, I told her I couldn't tahun anymore so we slept on the same bed (a single).  Lucky for me nothing happened.  If she even started to rub me(anywhere), I would be able to tahun this less than the floor.<br><br>My point is that sometimes u can't escape the situation...I mean, could u turn down a good friends?  :-)<br><br>Just trying to let u know that sometimes, u don't choose the situation, the situation finds u...<br><br>..and If it happens one day(I see u smiling already), I want u to remember my post here and say to urself as ur extracting urslef from her JPG aroma-ed embrace in the morning, "Damn that firewire guy, he was right!!!"<br><br>Ha ha ha :-)  Just joking there.<br><br>for ur info, from the way I talk, u would think that i'm the type who'se conquered many one-nighters before...Nope.  like I said, i aint been so lucky. Never had one before...Just never...felt correct.  Never been to Geyang either.  My younger brother got me to accompny him there to do his 'deed' once.  Even offered to pay for mine.  Flatly rejected. Just never felt right y'know.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When I started this topic, I meant losing one's virginity a girlfriend, a girl you picked up, etc... BUT not to prostitutes. I find the idea of paying to satisfy one's carnal pleasures extremely disgusting and revolting.<br><br>Well, Firewire has made a few points. If a close female friend of mine needed a place to stay I would be more than willing to share my place with her. If she makes any moves or advances... well... it depends really... and I quote "whether it feels right" Sometimes it feels uncomfortable toying with the notion of making out with a close friend who is troubled by "fill in whatever you want". It's almost as if I'm taking advantage of the situation.<br><br>The morale behind the story is:<br>Don't, if you feel it's not right,<br>Wear a condom if you really must!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Firewire and Musicwhiz,<br><br>Although this may be boring but please bar with me for a while.<br><br>There are counselling sessions teaching girls to protect themselves againts rapist. They are suppose to stay calm, seek for help when possible, run to some bright place instead of dark, blar blar blar. And if all those things still doesn't work, at least ask the rapist to use a comdom to keep her safe. So where does this comdom comes from? From the rapist? I don't think so. Therefore it is definitely logical for a pretty and attractive girl to bring along comdoms in their bags.<br><br>That may be part of the reason. Of course she could be preparing herself just in case she runs into a nice-guy-of-her-lifetime ...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once again, I feel like I'm poking my nose in where I don't belong :Ãž<br>But what the heck.....<br><br>Yes, I do believe that sex should only be committed within the marriage and all those who can't wait.....thou shall burn for thy lustful actions eternally.......just kidding.....<br><br>That is not to say that I am wilfully imposing my own beliefs upon my more sexually driven counterparts, however passionate they are, I just feel that virginity is something sacred and should only be shared with the one you are definite about spending your life with. That goes for the guys as well:Ãž Does this make me sound like one helluva frigid bitch? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Heh...maybe but it's a belief I subscribe to. Perhaps a lil too vehemently. I remember a time when a guy I used to go out with would go around telling all his male friends that it was a waste of time dating me as they could never "get me". I was terribly hurt and embarressed as hell....but somehow the age factor just makes you come to terms with such things.....<br><br>And in case anyone were to think that I value virginity above all other values and qualities, that's just not true. I am just particularly passionate aboutthe topic of remaining "chaste" til one's wedding day and may inevitably place too much emphasis on the imprtance of it.....sorry if it pisses anyone of.....it really wasn't my intent. I also hope that nobody misunderstands my stand and interpret it to be that one's person is measured by one's status as a vigin or non.<br>That's a load of bull....hehhe......arrgh....<br>" methinks the lady doth protest too bloody much"<br><br>On to somethin else then....<br><br>Experience....hmmm......why can't experience be garnered during the course of the marriage itself, why should only the ones that one collected in his/her carefree singlehood days carry more weight or significance? Why? Is it because experience culled from years of different sexual activity with different partners allows you to lord it over your marriage partner and thus you're able to "teach" him/her the ropes ( if the subject's a rookie) or enjoy the whole sexual act so much more?<br><br>I guess the F word's all but taken out of sex...hey, whaddya think I meant?! Geez...<br>Where did Fun go when all talk of sex and it's much raved about before-hand experience?<br>When two married newbies get together and the love between them overwhelms all else, it's gonna be so much fun fer them. They are allowed to discover each other's body and secret pleasure places without ever the question of jealousy spoiling the moments for them. Then again, not everyone feels this way and that's good, cos we'd be all mechanical beings that get brained-washed daily cos of all that bs propaganda shit on tv....gee, i'm bitter....now now...dun go telling me that all I need is a lil sex to light me up ......<br><br>And yes, on another note, most sexual beliefs are fundamentally based on guidelines set by certain religions and not largely on cultural and ethnical background.<br><br>[This message has been edited by honey (edited 28 October 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah, I agree that Singaporeans are not that conservative actually. A lot of things do happen beneath the conservative image portrayed.  I dunno about all of you but I certainly do not see sex the way some of you see it to be.  It seemed that sex is mainly a physical thing only.<br>Sex (actually i prefer the word, making love) is not only physical. It is the union of 2 bodies based only on love. It is not something you share with anyone but with the man or woman you professed your eternal love. Yah, old-fashioned, it might sound. if guys are just looking for pleasure, i think prostitutes would be a better choice. Do not take the innocence of a pure woman.<br>And i am shocked with some of the comments posted indicating their preference for non-virgins.  i am not one who sees sex as a taboo issue but i certainly think the beauty of sex itself is discovery. Why do you need an experienced love-maker as a wife? Sex is not an experience to be shared with anyone that comes along.<br>And for myself, I will definitely not lose my virginity to anyone except for my future husband.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Finally, views from girls themselves...<br><br>I don't begrudge you for feeling that chastity is something most sacred and you would want to reserve it for your future husband.<br><br>When I mentioned that I prefer my mate to be a noon-virgin, it wasn't just for the sake of having a more experienced partner, who knows the ropes. But rather I look at it as, the mentality, character and personality of the girl. I'm not saying that all virgins are conservative and old-fashioned. Rather, they have different views, eptitude and passion for things in life.<br><br>As for what these are I shall leave it to you to decide, since everyone has differing views on this matter. To me, and what these values/views/passions/etc.. I percieve a non-virgin would have are what I'm looking for in a wife/partner/soul-mate/etc.. whatever else you wanna term it. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean lustful views, carnal passions and loose values.. just something that is unique... if I were to list any it would start of a barrage of arguments and couter-arguments, so I shall leave it as that.<br><br>For those who wish to remain chaste till their wedding, I respect that and hope you will cherish that special moment on your wedding night. : )<br><br>cheerio!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lots of views expressed on this particular topic, but it's still hard to get a handle on whether Singapore is "conservative" or "liberal", eh?<br><br>I personally would fit more on the liberal camp, I think.<br><br>Virginity and chastity is all fine and good, but judging someone's (esp a woman's) value based on whether they are virgin or not seems like a throwback to medieval days, when lords had "Droit de Siegneur". Women had a raw deal back then, and thankfully nasty things like feet-binding and infibulation are on the decline.<br><br>This artificial importance placed on a person's virginity is just a vestige of the time when women were subjugated to men. (Or, as some would argue, more subjugated compared to now. *chuckle*)<br><br>You can argue that keeping one's chastity is a mark of commitment and devotion, but there are other, more applicable, ways of showing that. It would be enough for me, that my significant other gave me encouragement, supported me, and stuck by me, through life's ups and downs. Her virginity would not help in any of these tasks.<br><br>Sex is something intimate that should be enjoyed by a couple if they feel it will enhance their relationship, whether they are married or not.<br><br>Well, that's my 2 ringgits-worth. I hope it's money well-spent. *grin*<br><br>------------------<br>Cya,<br>Praetor<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally I think it is alright for pre-marital sex. Cox if you don't try it before getting married.. do you think your partner should be suitable (i mean whether can he/she satisfy you). Some guys are the type who is only concern about having their own orgasm and forgotten the need of the female part. So if you were to married a guy like dat.. and only realises it when you marry to him. Isn't it a bit too late to regret.<br>Personally me and my husband we both had sex with each other before we got married and now we are having a great time together.</div>
