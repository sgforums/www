            <div class='col-md body'><strong>It seems that an article was written to Sister 2 Sister magazine by a Caucasian woman who requested a response from black men. Read on...This letter was written in response to an article in the Sister 2 Sister Magazine(January 2000 issue). </strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Dear Jamie:<br>I'm sorry but I would like to challenge some of your Black male readers. I am a White female who is engaged to a Black male-good-looking, educated and loving. I just don't understand a lot of Black female's attitudes about our relationship. My man decided he wanted me because the pickings amongst<br>Black women were slim to none. As he said they were either too fat, too loud, too mean, too argumentative, too needy, too materialistic or carrying too much excess baggage. Before I became<br>engaged, whenever I went out I was constantly approached by Black men, willing to wine and dine me and give me the world. If Black women are so up in arms about us being with their men why don't they look at themselves and make some changes. I am tired of the dirty looks I get and snide remarks when we're out in public. I would like to hear from some Black men about why we are so  appealing and coveted by them. Bryant Gumbel just left his<br>wife of 26 years for one of us. Charles Barkley, Scottie Pippen, the model Tyson Beckford, Montell Williams, Quincy Jones, James Earl Jones, Harry Belafonte, Sydney Poitier, Kofi Anan, Cuba Gooding Jr., Don Cornelius, Berry Gordy, Billy Blanks, Larry<br>Fishburne, Wesley Snipes...I could go on and on. But, right now, I'm a little angry and that is why I wrote this so hurriedly. Don't be mad with us White women because so many of your men want us. Get your acts<br>together and learn from us and we may lead to you<br>treat your men better. If I'm wrong, Black men, let me know.  Disgusted White Girl, Somewhere in VA. </strong></span><br><br><strong><span style="color: darkred;">Response:<br>Dear Jamie:<br>I would like to respond to the letter written by A Disgusted White Girl. Let me start by saying that I am a 28-year black man. I graduated from one of the most prestigious universities in Atlanta, Georgia with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Business Management. I have a good job at a major corporation and have recently purchased a house. So, I consider  myself to be among the ranks of successful black men.<br>I will not use my precious time to slander white people. I just want to set the record straight of why black men date white women. Back in the day, one of the biggest reasons why black men dated white women were because they were considered easy. The black girls in my neighborhood were raised in the church. They were very strict about when they lost their virginity and who they lost it to. Because of our impatience to wait, brothers would look for someone who would give it up easy without too much hassle. So, they turned to white girls. Nowadays, in my opinion, a lot of brothers date white women because they are docile and easy to control. Because of some black men's insecurities, fears, and overall weaknesses, they have become intimidated by the strength of our black women. We are afraid that our<br>women will be more successful than us, make more money than us, drive nicer cars and own bigger houses. Because of this fear, many black men look for a more docile  women, someone we can control. I have talked to numerous black men and they continuously comment on how easy it is to control and walk over their white women. I just want to set the record straight. I want A Disgusted White Girl to know that not all successful black men date white women. Brothers like Ahmad Rashad, Denzel Washington, Morris Chestnut, Will Smith, Blair Underwood, Samuel Jackson, Babyface, and Chris Rock all married strong black women. And, to flip the script, there are numerous white men, in and out of the spotlight, who openly or secretly desire black women over white women. Ted Danson, Robert DeNiro, Jon B., and David Bowie to name a few. I just don't want A Disgusted White Girl to be misinformed. Stop thinking that because your are white that you are some type of goddess. Remember, when black Egyptian Queens like Hatsepshut and Nitorcris were ruling Dynasties and armies of men in Egypt, you were over in the caves of Europe eating raw meat and beating each other over the heads with clubs. Read your history. It was the black woman that taught you how to cook and season your food. It was the black woman that taught you how to raise your children. It was the black women who were breast feeding and raising your babies during slavery. It is the black woman that had to endure watching their fathers, husbands, and children beaten, killed, and thrown in jail. Black women were born with two strikes against them: being black and being a woman. And, through all this, Still They Rise! It is because of the black woman's strength, elegance, power, love, and beauty that I could never date anyone except my black Queen. It is not just the outer beauty that captivates and draws me to them. It is the fact that they come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and shades that I love them. Their inner beauty is what I find most appealing about black women. Their strong spirit, loving, and nurturing souls, their integrity, their ability to overcome great obstacles, their willingness to stand for what they believe in, and their determination to succeed and reach their highest potential while enduring great pain and suffering is why I have fallen in love with black women. I honestly believe that your anger is geared more towards jealously and envy than snotty looks. If this were not so, then why do you continously go to tanning salons to darken your skin? If you are so proud to be white, then why don't you just be happy with your pale skin? Why do you continue to inject your lips, hips, and breasts wtih unnatural and dangerous substances so you can look fuller and more voluptuous? I think that your anger is really a result of you wanting to have what the black woman has.<br><br>BOTTOM LINE: If I were looking for a docile woman. Someone I can walk over and control, I would give you a call. But, unfortunately, I am looking for a Virtuous Woman. Someone that can be a good wife and mother to my children. Someone who can be my best friend and understands my struggles. I am looking for a soul mate. I am looking for a sister and; unfortunately you do not and CANNOT fit the bill. I guess you are just S.O.L. No offense taken, none given.<br><br>Signed,<br>Black Royalty</span></strong></div>
