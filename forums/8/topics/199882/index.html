Read up ur company's policy on termination of service / medical leave privilleage, especially ur letter of appointment to see any clause to that.<br><br>Since u have taken MC on Monday, no harm taking 1 on thursday, the most she treat u 'coffee' or send u to human resource office for free 'coffee' break.

            <div class='col-md body'>just go la... they can't sack you due to medical reasons.<br><br>You have a few options<br>1) If your interview is in the afternoon, go in the morning and act really sick. Tell ur manager you need to go to the doctor. Go already, get mc then tell ur boss doc ask you go back rest.<br>2) Just take full day mc lo. If they ask u(Which i doubt, at the most they will tell u to take care of your own health nia), just say mc can't come to work. If anything happens, insurance will not cover 1. Then ask ur boss she wanna bear responsibility if anything happens when u come work with mC?</div>

I saw the position of mine on Jobsdb dated on 14 July 2006.<br>Maybe you people can find such company where by it will tell you the description of duties from IT, secretarial, travel booking and etc...<br>But it's only they didn't indicate the supporting areas are who and numbers of staffs we need to support.  another hoax in cheating.<br>Overall there is no bonus nor 13 mth bonus / AWS / Increments.<br>Whereby during interview if we asked about bonus etc.. they will tell us that all these will be discuss further when we are selected.
