            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes to love a person, is not to bind him/her to yourself.  Set both of you free ... take a break ... if he comes back to you ... he will be yours forever.  However if he decided to leave you ... he isn't meant to be yours in the first place.<br><br>Take a break now... think through the whole relationship.  What causes the distrust and insecurity that you have.  After the break, have a heart to heart talk with him.  If things still ends up this way, accept the fact.  If the underlying problems are not solved, no matter what you do, you will still end up in this situation now.<br><br>In any relationship, communication is very important.  Without proper communication, misunderstandings will bound to occur and will strain the relationship.</div>

Many a times after the break - one side will feel that they had enough of the relation already, which signal to the period when people move on with their life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This wanting to be together - needs that break to calulate the factors behind of continuing - not just the FEELING only. Time is your only hope because after working 10 hours in the day - when you get back home, the only thing that will refresh you thoroughly is a good rest, not watching TV or whatever, which will make you more fatigue. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
