            <div class='col-md body'>Corporate Lesson #1:<br><br>A man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower. The doorbell rings.  The wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs.  When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next-door neighbor.  Before she says a word, Bob says, "I'll give you $800 to drop that towel." After thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob.  After a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 and leaves.<br>The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. When she<br>gets to the bathroom, her husband asks, "Who was that?" "It was Bob,<br>the next door neighbor," she replies. "Great!" the husband says, "did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?"<br><br>Moral of the story: If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Corporate Lesson #2:<br><br>A priest offered a lift to a nun.  She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her habit apart to reveal a shapely leg. The priest nearly had an accident.  After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand onto her thigh. The nun said, "Father, remember Psalm 129?" The priest removed his hand.  But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her thigh again.  The nun once again said, "Father, please remember Psalm 129!" The priest apologized. "Sorry sister but the flesh is weak."  Arriving at the convent, the nun went on her way.  On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up Psalm 129.<br>It said, "Go forth and seek further up, you will find glory."<br><br>Moral of the story: If you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Corporate Lesson #3:<br><br>A sales rep, an administration clerk, and their manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp.  They rub it and a Genie comes out.<br>The Genie says, "I normally grant three wishes, but as there are three of you, I'll give each of you just one wish." "Me first! Me first!" says the admin clerk.  "I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world."   Poof! She's gone.  "Me next! Me next!" says the sales rep.  "I want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an<br>endless supply of Pina Coladas and the love of my life by my side."  Poof! He's gone.  "OK, you're up," the Genie says to the manager.  The manager says, "I<br>want those two back in the office after lunch."<br><br>Moral of the story: Always let your boss have the first say.<br></div>

The crow answered:"Sure, why not?"  So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.  A fox jumped on the rabbit and ate it.<br><br>Moral of the story: To be sitting and doing nothing all day, you must be sitting very high up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Corporate Lesson #5:<br><br>A turkey was chatting with a bull. "I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree" sighed the turkey, "but I haven't got the energy."  "Well, why don't you nibble on my droppings?" replied the bull.   "They're packed with nutrients." The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree.  The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch.  Finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. Soon, he was spotted by a farmer who shot the turkey out of the tree.<br><br>Moral of the story: Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there.<br><br>THREE WISHES................<br><br>A woman was out golfing one day when she hit the ball into the woods.<br>She went into the woods to look for it and found a frog in a trap.<br>The frog said to her, "If you release me from this trap, I will grant you<br>three wishes."  The woman freed the frog, and the frog said, "Thank you, but I failed to mention that there was a condition to your wishes. Whatever you<br>wish for, your husband will get times ten!" The woman said, "That's okay."<br>For her first wish, she wanted to be the most beautiful woman in the<br>world. The frog warned her, "You do realized that this wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis whom women will look to?" The woman replied, "That's okay, because I will be the most beautiful woman and he will have eyes only for me."  So, KAZAM-she's the most beautiful woman in the world! For her second wish, she wanted to be the richest woman in the world. The frog said, "That will make your husband the richest man in the world and he will be ten times richer than you." The woman said, "That's okay, because what's mine is his and what's his is mine."<br>So, KAZAM-she's the richest woman in the world!  The frog then inquired about her third wish, and she answered, "I'd like a mild heart attack."<br><br>Moral of the story: Women are clever. Don't mess with them.<br><br>Attention female readers: This is the end of the<br>joke for you. Stop here and continue feeling good.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Male readers: Please scroll<br>down...........................<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;The man had a heart attack ten times milder than his<br>wife!!!<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Moral of the story: Women are really dumb but think<br>they're really<br>smart.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Let them continue to think that way and just enjoy<br>the show<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;PS: If you are a woman and are still reading this,<br>it only goes to show that you women never listen!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Little Georgie watched his daddy's car pass by the school playground and<br>go into the woods. Curious, he followed the car and saw Daddy and Aunt<br>&gt;&gt;Jane in a passionate embrace.  Little Georgie found this so exciting that he could not contain himself as he ran home and started to tell his mother, "Mommy, I was at the playground and I saw Daddy's car go into the woods with Aunt Jane. I went back to look and he was giving Aunt Jane a big kiss, then he helped her take off her shirt. Then Aunt Jane helped Daddy take his pants off, then Aunt Jane........"<br><br>At this point Mommy cut him off and said, "Georgie, this is such an interesting story, suppose you save the rest of it for supper time. I want to see the look on Daddy's face when you tell it tonight."<br><br>At the dinner table, Mommy asked little Georgie to tell his story.  Georgie started his story, "I was at the playground and I saw Daddy's car go into the woods with Aunt Jane. I went back to look and he was giving Aunt Jane a big kiss, then he helped her take off her shirt. Then Aunt Jane helped Daddy take his pants off, then Aunt Jane and Daddy started doing the same thing that Mommy and Uncle Bill used to do when Daddy was in the Army."<br><br>Moral: Sometimes you need to listen to the whole story before you interrupt.</div>
