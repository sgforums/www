            <div class='col-md body'>Revealations:<br>You sound like when you say, fignt, you mean take initiative, rather than fight to reclaim someone you lost.<br><br>I agree that its no point to fight or pester your intended target if the other party is not interested. I guess different people have different thresholds for giving up, so willing to hang on a bit longer.<br><br>Personally, I would rather wait for someone who comes along, and shows a bit of interest. Then engage in combat after that.<br><br>As for a subtle way of letting someone you already know realize that you like her, I think you have to guage that person first. If both of you are good at dropping hints and taking them, then no one would have to say outright. Personally, my ability to pick up hints is a bit better than a block of timber, so if I had the chance, I would rather say it out straight, making it clear that I'm doing it out of my own decision and that there is no pressure. As many have said, see what happens after that. Let me just say that not every friendship is that resiliant to this type of change, so perhaps there is merit to hinting after all.</div>
