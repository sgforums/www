            <div class='col-md body'>After looking at the singles thread, and inspired but someone's outlook on love, I came up with this, on whether we should wait for love, or fight for love, i.e. to take the passive or active stance towards love. I know of this guy, who wouldn't even profess his love for this girl in fear of embarassing her and making it awkward, but fate isn't so kind as to just put that someone on your lap, so I believe in fighting for it, what do you all think?? How do you all pursue love?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Scarlett,<br>A guy or a gal would br flattered if someone tell them they like him/her. But being flattered is one thing and being in a relationship is another.<br><br>As for whether to fight for the person I like. I will, and I had done it, without fearing any consequences. It's not difficult to fancy someone, but to actually like someone for who they are is not easy. If I can accept her for who is she.. I will go all the way, to know and to understand her.<br><br>Just thought of this theory..<br>Treat that someone as a lover and an enemy.<br>Lover whom you can shower your care and concern for.<br>Enemy when you need to understand the person.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Revelations,<br><br>When I was younger, I believed that I should fight for my love. Even if the gal say no, I would persist until one day I know that it's time to give up, and move on with my life. As I grew older, after experiencing two beautiful yet heartbreaking love lives, I realized that there is no fight for love at all..<br><br>It does not matter how hard you fight, because if you do not possess the x-factor which women wanted, you can never make it work, because a r/s needs two hands to clap. So, what about waiting for love? I don't know whether it would also good to wait for love.<br><br>I would specify it in a very simple example : suppose I like this gal, but I know that she is not interested in me as a bf, but as a friend, and the circumstances at this time do not permit it, I would not fight at all. My reasons are very simple :<br><br>(a)If you like (or love) someone, u have to let her go, give her the space for her to do what she wants.<br><br>(b)Perhaps, if insistence on love would lead to the destruction of friendship.<br><br>I can tell her what I feel, and also tell her that I would not make any further advancements, and just be a good friend. If something would happen in the future, then let it happen. If there is nothing in the end, I would wish her well and hope that she would find that person she love.<br><br>I think ultimately it is not what I desire which is important, being sensitive to her needs and understanding to things around would help. So, my answer is : let nature takes it course...<br><br>Yours,<br>The Prodigal<br>-------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I can see that there are some who take a passive stand, while others take an active stand to this.<br><br>To those taking the passive stand, like Bush, Sparkle, FireIce, Littleman, Prodigal, Audlenelee, I guess you are all the type who well, believe in letting fate take its course. Well, fate works for some, like Littleman said, let that magic happen, but how often are people really able to experience that fairy-tale like feeling of love that way?? I don't discount that it will never happen, but is it often that this happens? And what if it doesn't happen? Swinging singles for the rest of your lives? Isn't love worth fighting for?<br><br>For the active ones, who prefer to do something about it, like Kitty-Kat, Archer, Atti, KTE, Scarlett, Luf, Samantha, millenium, and even me and maybe Paul, well, fighting for your happiness is good, but some of u mentioned things like the other party should be honoured etc., it might be a coincidence or are all those comments made by the ladies? hahaha. Some say that well, if the other party is interested, why not? The question to this would be how would u know that the other party is interested without actually "testing water"? Well, when I am interested in a girl, it would often be easier if I didn't know her that well to start with, but for someone I know, considerations like if confessing my liking to her will change our future relationships flood my mind, so don't u all encounter such problem? And what would be the most subtle way of making the message known to the other party?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would not use the word "fight". Rather I believe that it is good to make it known to the other party yr feelings and see how it leads to. There are a number of us who are so blur and shy that we are unaware that there is that potentially special someone nearby quietly observing and not making a move. By taking the first step to tell the other party of our liking could be viewed as an attempt to let both parties be aware of the situation. I agree that it is pointless to fight if the other party has absolutely no interest in developing a relationship with you. However the minimum is to tell him/her and let see how everything develops naturally after that. Afterall it could be that he/she is interested in you, but just waiting for you (esp guys) to make the first move.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm....LittleMan, many don't believe the magic because it has not happened, and more often than not......that is a rare phenomenon, how many can boast of a Cinderella scenario, or a Love2000 scenario, i.e. the magic you see on TV.......<br>And well Light, it is good to let the other party know, and it would be good to let the other party know too. I've got this experience whereby I let the other party know what I am feeling, and it ended up that everytime she's around me, she feels awkward, and then I feel awkward, then the atmosphere changes......things like that, so is making that move really a good idea?<br></div>
