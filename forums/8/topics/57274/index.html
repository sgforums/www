            <div class='col-md body'>by Gizzard Guts<br><br>Following Prime Minister Goh's speech on openly using homosexuals in the civil service, the Singapore Armed Forces have shown their support with three crack military units - <strong>SCAT</strong>, <strong>RIM</strong> and <strong>FAG</strong>- purely made up of homosexuals.<br><br>Personnel will sport the coveted new Rainbow Beret after undergoing 69 days of Field Recon Undercover Intensive Training (or FRUIT for short).<br><br>Course Commander LTC Dragga Queen had this to say,"We are very proud to have such outstanding trainees who stood tall and proud throughout the gruelling training especially for the converts from our Naval Forces. After 69 days of long, hard and intensive training, the men have really shown a high level of competency and cohesion which can only be brought about by brotherly love."<br><br>Special Corps (Anti-Terrorists), or SCAT, will be an elite unit specializing in FIBUA (fighting in built up areas), and comparable to the SOF, said Maj Fak Yew Deep, who heads the new unit. "Our finely-honed troops will penetrate deep into the rear of terrorists ranks and strike fear into the most hardened of them. Together with our sister, I mean brother, squads, we can provide a safe and secure Singapore for everyone. We are glad that PM Goh has given us this chance to stretch our potential to the utmost. IÂ’m sure the way we perform our job will blow everyone away."<br><br>RIM, or Retaliatory Interrogative Module, will feature a 'softer' approach to cross-examining suspects. Maj Pah Chiew Cheng, CO of this unit, is confident that the newer stance will work: "We should update ourselves into the twenty-first century. Men should love men, and not inflict excessive pain unto each other. Our hallmark training is to be gentle and approachable, to give friendly and love-based suasion to the suspects, whom we shall regard as clients to be serviced, rather than detainees to be interrogated. Our initial trials have brought our 'clients' to their knees and made the most recalcitrant of them weep."<br><br>The last of the three will be used in the front line. Field Attrition Group, will be used as field support troops for first-wave units like the Commandos and Scouts. This unit recognizes the needs for the front liners to have their rears watched. Cpt Lau Ho Moh, commanding officer, said, "When our vanguards are out there, we shall make sure they will be able to fight their fiercest. We shall be the pokers stoking their fire from behind."<br><br>Meanwhile, MINDEF also announced that the SAF Music &amp; Drama Company would be wound down, as many key personnel Â“were being redeployed to certain unnamed specialist units.Â”<br><br>wahahahahahahaha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
