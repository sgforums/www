            <div class='col-md body'><br>A Little Girl's Kisses<br><br>The story goes that some time ago, a man punished his 3-year-old daughter for wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became infuriated when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree. Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, "This is for you, Daddy." He was embarrassed by his earlier overreaction, but his anger flared again when he found out that the box was empty.<br><br>He yelled at her, "Don't you know that when you give someone a present, there's supposed to be something inside it?" The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and said, "Oh, Daddy, it is not empty. I blew kisses into the box. All for you, daddy." The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl, and he begged for her forgiveness.<br><br>It is told that the man kept that gold box by his bed for years and whenever he was discouraged, he would take out the imaginary kisses and remember the love of the child who had put it there. In a very real sense, each of us as humans have been given a gold container filled with unconditional love and kisses from our  children, friends, family or God. There is no more precious possession anyone could hold.<br><br>A GLASS OF MILK<br><br>One day, a poor boy who was selling goods from door to door to pay his  way through school, found he had only one thin dime left,<br>and he was hungry.<br><br>He decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door.<br>Instead of a meal he  asked for a drink of water. She thought he looked hungry so brought him a large glass of milk.<br><br>He drank it slowly, and then asked, "How much do I owe you?"<br>"You don't owe me anything," she replied."Mother has taught us never to accept pay for a kindness."  He said..... "Then I thank<br>you from my heart." As Howard Kelly left that house, he not only felt stronger physically, but his faith in God and man was strong also.<br>He had been ready to give up and quit.<br><br>Year's later that young woman became critically ill. The local doctors were baffled. They finally sent her to the big city,<br>where they called in specialists to study her rare disease. Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation. When he<br>heard the name of the town she came from, a strange light filled his eyes.<br><br>Immediately he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room. Dressed in his doctor's gown he went in to see her. He<br>recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation room determined to do his best to save her life. From that day he gave special attention to the case.<br><br>After a long struggle, the battle was won.  Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval.<br>He looked at it, then wrote something on the edge and the bill was sent to her room. She feared to open it, for she was sure it<br>would  take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally she looked, and something caught her attention on the side of the bill.<br>She read these words..... "Paid in full with one glass of milk"<br><br>(Signed)<br>Dr.  Howard Kelly.<br><br>A Special Story<br><br>Like any good mother, when Karen found out that another baby was on the way, she did what she could to help her<br>3-year-old son. Michael, prepare for a new sibling. They found out that the new baby was going be a girl, and day<br>after day, night after night, Michael sang to his sister in Mommy's tummy. He was building a bond of love with his<br>little sister before he even met her.<br>The pregnancy progressed normally for Karen. In time, the labor pains came. Soon it was every five minutes, every<br>three, every minute. But serious complications arose during delivery and Karen found herself in hours of labor. Would a<br>C-section be required?<br><br>Finally, after a long struggle, Michael's little sister was born. But she was in very serious condition. With a siren<br>howling in the night, the ambulance rushed the infant to the neonatal intensive care unit at St.Mary's Hospital,<br>Knoxville, Tennessee.  The days inched by. The little girl got worse. The pediatrician had to tell the parents there<br>is very little hope. Be prepared for the worst. Karen and her husband contacted a local cemetery about a burial plot.<br><br>They had fixed up a special room in their house for their new baby but now they found themselves having to plan for a<br>funeral. Michael, however, kept begging his parents to let him see his sister. I want to sing to her, he kept saying.<br><br>Week two in intensive care looked as if a funeral would come before the week was over. Michael kept nagging about<br>singing to his sister, but kids are never allowed in Intensive Care.<br><br>Karen decided to take Michael whether they liked it or not. If he didn't see his sister right then, he may never see<br>her alive. She dressed him in an oversized scrub suit and marched him into ICU.  He looked like a walking laundry<br>basket. The head nurse recognized him as a child and bellowed, "Get that kid out of here now. No children are<br>allowed."<br><br>The mother rose up strong in Karen, and the usually mild-mannered lady glared steel-eyed right into the head<br>nurse's face, her lips a firm line.  "He is not leaving until he sings to his sister" she stated. Then Karen towed<br>Michael to his sister's bedside. He gazed at the tiny infant losing the battle to live. After a moment, he began<br>to sing.<br><br>In the pure-hearted voice of a 3-year-old, Michael sang: Â“<br>You are my sunshine,my only sunshine, you make me happy<br>when skies are gray."<br><br>Instantly the baby girl seemed to respond. The pulse rate began to calm down and become steady. "Keep on singing,<br>Michael," encouraged Karen with tears in her eyes. "You never know, dear, how much I love you, please don't take my<br>sunshine away."  As Michael sang to his sister, the baby's ragged, strained breathing became as smooth as a kitten's<br>purr.  "Keep on singing, sweetheart."  "The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping, I dreamed I held you in my arms".<br>Michael's little sister began to relax as rest, healing rest to sweep over her. "Keep on singing, Michael." Tears<br>had now conquered the face of the bossy head nurse. Karen glowed. "You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. Please<br>don't take my sunshine away..."<br><br>The next, day...the very next day...the little girl was well enough to go home.<br><br>Woman's Day Magazine called it The Miracle of a Brother's Song. The medical staff just called it a miracle. Karen<br>called it a miracle of God's love.<br>NEVER GIVE UP ON THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE.  LOVE IS SO<br>INCREDIBLY POWERFUL. Life is good. Have a Wonderful Day!<br><br></div>
