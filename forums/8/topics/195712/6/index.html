This can be further counted under<br>1) voluntary causing hurt<br>2) outrage of modesty<br>3) threatening behaviour<br>4) criminal intimidation<br>5) organised illegal activity with due reason to cause harm or injury (SSB?Might have to prove that the girls are in a group for the reason of organised criminal and violent acts)<br><br>There could be more, but I'm not a law graduate.Perhaps those who are more knowledgeable could add on to this list of potential charges. A crime has been committed, and it should not be up to the parents to decide if they should press charges. This is not a case of civil liability.</div>
