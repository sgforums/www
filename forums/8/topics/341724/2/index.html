              <p>In restaurant, you can get a table at around 600 but most places would you to have at least 15 tables. And you need to count in the wine and hard liquor price as well. So to be safe, for banquet you need to budget around 20k.</p>
              <p>Wedding band will cost around 1k, proposal ring around 1 to 2k if you get it now during sale season. Studio photoshoot can be done in Malaysia if you want it cheap, for around SGD 3k you can get quite a good deal. Then make up and photographer on the day itself will cost around 1k.</p>
              <p>So altogether, minus the honeymoon which you can do later when you have more money, you will need around 30k just for a wedding. Better start saving now.</p>

              <p>If I could do it again.</p>
              <p>I will still opt for a cheongsum, hair &amp; make up &amp; nice high heels and receive the bouquet of flowers &amp; the gold ring at the solemisation ceremony.</p>
              <p>If a spouse choose to host a lunch, its just gravy for me.</p>
              <p>There is also break out rooms at the ROM itself such that you can seat the parents on chairs and kneel down to them to receive their blessing.  Then finish the signing of the marriage.</p>

              <p><br>LOL, yes, my mother is not happy that I never hold a banquet for her.  I was just gossiping with my sister and she tells me my mother felt that I should hold a banquet, so I wont 'lose out' with my ex hub.</p>
              <p>My mother never tells me that.  So come to think of it, i guess its true.  Parents always want their kids to have banquets for their wedding.</p>
              <p>But making life difficult part will go away, usually with the birth of a grandchild.</p>
              <p>Though.....that holding banquet thing is, I think we Singaporean spoilt our parents by paying for our own wedding, thats why they demand things of us instead of helping us kids.</p>

              <p><br> LOL, yes, my mother is not happy that I never hold a banquet for
              her.  I was just gossiping with my sister and she tells me my
              mother felt that I should hold a banquet, so I wont 'lose out' with
              my ex hub.</p>
              <p>My mother never tells me that.  So come to think of it, i
              guess its true.  Parents always want their kids to have
              banquets for their wedding.</p>
              <p>But making life difficult part will go away, usually with the
              birth of a grandchild.</p>
              <p>Though.....that holding banquet thing is, I think we Singaporean
              spoilt our parents by paying for our own wedding, thats why they
              demand things of us instead of helping us kids.</p>

              <p>They love you so much and wish for your best.</p>
              <p>So if you dont hold a wedding even to their satisfaction........i think thats about the basic crap about demanding that from the kids.</p>
