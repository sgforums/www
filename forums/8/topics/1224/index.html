            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa:<br><br>Well, it might seem that I am unfeeling to such incidents, but trust me, I have seen alot more such incidents than you have <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, no offence. I am a police officer, yes, and I myself have apprehended such offenders before even off duty. Just the other day I was going out with Eck, I was late because I just happen to meet one on the bus I am travelling on and I apprehened him there and then even though I am off duty, Eck can vouch for me on that. It was not the first I have met, and again trust me, most of the time the offenders are those that seems to be the most unlikely persons.<br><br>Well, I applaude you for the courage to go ahead and ask the girl if the guy is her bf or not, but I would not say that it is wise. For if the situation turns out true that the person involved is the bf rather then a molester, it would not turn out too well for both them and you, both parties would then be rather awkward, them feeling that their actions were being monitored, and you feeling like you have infringe on their privacy.<br><br>As to the difference between a touch and a molest, it all depends party involved. Acoording to the law(I am sorry I have to bring this in as I know it would not be fair) an outrage of modesty could be anything from a intent touch of the skin to the stripping of a woman. The key thing being whether the woman is willign and if she feels uncomfortable with the incident. Strickly speaking, even if I were to talk dirty to woman, and to show obsence hand signs at them, it would be an outrage of modesty too, as long as the woman is to feel uncomfortable with my actions. Such is the defination of the law. But yes, we are not alking about the law here, but we are discussing the moral obligations of a fellow citizen. And yes, this would be a different topic altogether but understand this first. The woman herself might not be feeling uncomfortable with the incident and thus even if the guy were to grab her breasts and give her a grin, she might just laff it off, so would this be still considered an offence? No for if there is no complainant there would not be a case for the police force, even if <strong>you</strong> are to insist that it is an outrage of modesty. So what moral obligations are there then? None? Most probably so. For you can't insist that it is a molest when the woman herself says no.<br><br>As to victims who are too afraid to speak up and shout, there are many. I am not saying that we should just let them be, if we are to know of any such incidents, we should urge them to bring the culprits to justice, such should be the way. But we should not blurt it all out in public as that would not be a sensitive way to handle matters. The victim herself might not want to create "public awareness" due to some reasons we do not know. And it wouldn ot be wise to do so for her in this case then. It may be so due to embarassment or fright, but would shouting out loud not lead them to more of such feelings? Being delicate and sensitive in a sexual offence is of the upmost importance. If we are not careful with it and add more complications to it, what is the use of apprehending the suspect if the victim herself is to suffer from permanent truama? The suspect will get his jail term and then carry on with his life, he might change for the better or he may not, but the victim's live would have changed forever. What I am saying would most probably be not agreed upon by the police force, as what the force would want to do would most probably be to bring such people to justice, I dun blame them, it is their job. But the are many angles to a problem, and if we do not see all of it, it will lead to further complications.<br><br>What you say you would do, makes sense too, for that would be the fastest way to apprehen the suspect. But then if the victim is you, you would have most probably shouted out loud in the crowd and would not have needed that push. But if the girl in the first place is already frighten(like the above incident) would it had help if you are to ask her? She would most probably be too shock to answer you before the suspect melt into the crowd. Of course it would not be definite, she might have shouted or alerted her friend if you are to prompt her to, but which would be more probable?<br><br>I am not denying your sense of justice, for it is in me too, but rather I am saying that before we do anything rash and let our emotions run us, lets take a step back and look at the situation before deciding the best action to take. That would be wise.I always believe that courage is like a charging chariot without a driver if it does not comes with wisdom.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I am glad to know that we have people like you around, for your sense of justice is commedable, and keep it up, all you need now I feel would be a little more insight and you will be there.<br><br>And yes, I too hope to hear Rachel's stand, for I do not want to judge her as to whether she did right r wrong with just that one post that does not says much.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> but then again I was never at the scene, so who am I to judge?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Trust me, if I were to be there, I would not care of the gal will hate me for helping her or not, cos I have done my part. I don't want a girl's modesty to be ruined just becos I am afraid to feel awkward in the midst...but seriously, if ever a gal come to me and tell me about her initial fear of me getting molested if I have a bf, I would very much appreciate it but if she really hit the nail and managed to nab the molestor, I would thank her for eternity...How would I blame her because she is trying to help me out of being humiliated in totol slience...I want to get that molestor convicted and go scot-free!<br>And there are not alot of police officers in the midst when thigns like this happen...<br><br>SO why dun we take a poll from all the females here to see if they want to be helped or leave in distress if u are concerned of the extreme awkwardness we the female species can endure...if u are game enough...<br><br>------------------<br>We have no right to ask when sorrow comes, "Why did this happen to me?" unless we ask the same question for every moment of happiness that comes our way.</div>

All that I did was to judge the situation, and once I have deem that the lady in question have truly been outrage on her modesty and that she is too frighten to speak up, I followed the suspect to somewhere private. After which I showed my ID and ask him some questions, and screen his ID. He was founf to have previously commited 2 charges of outrage of modesty. Then I just caught him by the arm, and ask him to follow me. I approach the lady who was still in a bit of shock, and brought the 2 of them to a corner and question the lady if anything really happen. She mutter that she was touch and caressed on her buttocks, and when she turned around she saw him standing behind. Without hesitation I arrested the man, and call the police. Thus case close without a big hoo ha, andwithout embrassing the lady in public.<br><br>Maybe that you are going to argue that I am able to do that with my capacity as a policeman. But please do know that you too can do it as a fellow citizen, though you would not have the authority to ask for his ID and screen him, you could still have approach the man, and requested that he clarify his act with you in front of the lady, in private of course. After you have acertain his stand, you can of course call for the police or to let him go. This too would allow the lady to escape the attention the public is going to shower on her. But if the suspect tries to run upon your approach then I suppose you would not need to clear your doubts anymore would you? Thus all you need is to call for the police, while trying to arrest the suspect yourself if you can, or just try to follow him. The lady in question would not be the center of attraction then as she could be question later by the police seperately. This way she too escape being the "limelight". I might not be totally right, but these are what I have tried before and I know can work.<br><br>I am not having an arguement with you on whether we should help the girl or not, but rather I am discussing the different way of helping her, which would help her most. Or simply in simple words I am trying to formulate a win win situation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my friend got molested before and from what i understand, most victims will be shocked and at a loss for what to do immediately after the molest.<br><br>it requires lots of presence of mind to get over the shock and scream in the first place.<br><br>anyway oakley, upon reading yr post, i was tempted to make the same reply as Suzi too. din notice the file part though. u must understand that there's this really stupid mentality in the streets that most guys (some even think all....) in all white uniforms are Rafflesians, whether from RI or RJC. moreover, the SJI badge sure looks like the Raffles crest from afar. this is something which irritates a lot of Rafflesians.<br><br>back to the topic. the most embarassing thing i've ever seen in the streets is about a guy one nite on Mohammad Sultan Rd. It was about 2 am and this joker on the streets was whistling at some girls on the other side. He began to cross the street in a swaggering manner, then slipped and fell right on his butt. Oh man....what a crashing sound. The best thing was that he landed so hard that he was stunned and couldn't move and needed his pals to carry him off the road. ha..ha...the girls were sure damn impressed with him....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think what Rinoa is trying to get at is to have a society that is civil enough to react to such situations and not just let it happen with staring eyes, and shrug it off with "Oh well, lucky it's not me."<br><br>As pointed out by Callan, there are many ways to react and it can be done discreetly for the sake of the victim. But the problem is still there, would everyone who witnessed it lend a helping hand? Much more take a step back to access the situation?<br><br>It's not uncommon to read in the newspapers of bystanders who stood and watch while a crime is being committed. It's depressing when they sometimes reply "Oh I thought someone called the police already." or "It's none of my business." etc ....<br><br>They may be warranted in not reacting to protect themselves, but surely there must be some ways to help without endangering themselves? The question is, would everyone be even be bothered to do that?<br><br>It would be ideal if molesters won't only have to run away from the victim or police(who may not be present) but a whole horde of civic minded people who either witnessed the crime or heard and are appalled by it. Maybe then will all the would-be molesters think doubly hard before snaring another victim.<br><br>Whether or not the victim should feel more shameful than angry is another thing altogether.<br><br>I've yet to encounter any such situations. Now I don't know whether that's a good thing or not.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aperentis<br>Thanks for 'supporting' my views and what I am saying to Callan as well is that by exposing the molestor does not mean that u have to make a big obvious commotion. Be discreet and be with forceful stance. That is what I am trying to say...And if I know that me alone can't apprehend that guy, I will try to find a guy preferably hopefully he is civic-mindedness enough to give me a hand...to actually find out what is going on...(Hey!Did I ever said I am going to create a big commotion?)<br><br>You say to help the gal tactfully? Yes, I get what you mean. Butremember, as a gal when I am going to see this happening right before my eyes, the next immediate response is not to think how I should go about doing it....I JUST DO IT...go up and stare at that guy hard...and ask the gal if she knew this guy. I would not be thinking on how to handle the situation 'tactfully' as you might have put it...and I am no police officer who have the authority to pull him to one side to integorrate him...as also a damsel myself, I could only simply do what I can do at that point of time...it is the innate response...<br><br>I hope you get my view...and why dun you suggest to the police force to create more public awareness in lieu of this since you are a police officer...thanks alot...I, on the behalf of the female species, salute you...<br><br>------------------<br>We have no right to ask when sorrow comes, "Why did this happen to me?" unless we ask the same question for every moment of happiness that comes our way.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 12 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that it is extremely difficult to react in any other "tactful" way if you are not a police officer, or for that fact, if you are not a man. Callan, do you think a gal can go to a private place with a molester and then ask him questions??? I don't think so man. He may hurt her just to keep her quiet or something. Basically, no gal in her right mind would do that. I think that in the situation that only Rachel saw the gal being molested, it is only right that she screamed "MOLEST!!!" or maybe told a guy next to her(this is prob wat Callan would suggest). I am sure there are guys all around watching the New Face 99' show, And not ALL of them are molesters(I hope!!!). If she had told a guy standing mext to her about the molester's actions he would prob have to take action and it only takes one person to act before more will join in to apprehend the culprit.<br><br>If it were a guy that saw it all, it would be easier to confront the molester and ask him questions. But if the molester looked big and would pose a formidable threat were he to retaliate in any way, I would ask along some other guys too. Hopefully, they would not be chicken and come along.<br><br>I think that molesters are disgusting and should be taken care of severely. Almost half of the girls that I know have been molested at one time in their lives. And most of the time it is still too traumatic an episode for them to even think about it rationally. I pains me greatly to see them like that. Men like that should be brought to justice as quickly as possible. Dun give them face...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>------------------<br>Let him that move the world, first move himself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe I should not post this after all, cos it seemed that i am at fault...<br>Well, when these things happens, all gals esp me the shy type would not take any actions, esp when there are so many ppl...<br>At first, i thought that boy was her bf, but after stroking her butt, that guy 'ran' away and slowly disappeared into the crowd, well i really am in a lost too and that girl was just there, letting him do what ever he wanted for around only3 secs(a fast one, i supposed) and that girl &amp; friend quickly squeezed her way out of the crowd and told her friend about it.<br><br>well just like that lor.</div>

My my, I wonder how would u feel if ur sister or mother or gf get molested....then you will say.." You should learn how to protect yourself and don't expect ppl to help u..!" Gosh..!It is not like she is being promiscious that landed her in the plight...and she is the victim and you showed no compassion in it...<br><br>SO next time, if ur gal frens got molested and tells u about it...and if u are dare to repeat the same sentence to them...tell me if u will get a trashing from them...<br><br>Lastly,it seems to me most ppl from overseas are more likely to help ppl in distress than the locals I realised...after much observation..is it the culture..or otherwise?<br><br>------------------<br>We have no right to ask when sorrow comes, "Why did this happen to me?" unless we ask the same question for every moment of happiness that comes our way.</div>
