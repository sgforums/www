She said no..she knew the way.<br><br>This incident really puts me off..I mean why nobody helped her...because they feel embarassed becos everyone is looking ??<br><br>Incident number 2<br>I was in the morning bus going to Shenton Way where all the working class ppl was sitting comfortably in their seats...I was one of the fortunate ones to get a seat..When the bus stopped at WTC...I saw an old man carrying lotsa stuffs...staggering to find a seat (obviously all the seats are taken) and from that very moment, I have alreadt noticed him and I was sitting near the exit of the bus...and I was waiting for someone nearer the validator to offer a seat to him..How naive I was...!No one stood up,,,and I stood up immediately to offer my seat and he smiled and said thank you...<br><br>I was really disgusted at how we so called 'highly educated ppl' do not even know what courteosy is about...and we have to come up with "Courteosy Campaigns' to remind us to be polite, courteous and gracious to our surroundings...We need to have queue lines on the MRT grounds to make sure or remind us to stay in line...and we need to ban chewing gum becos we dunno how to dispose them well...How ridiculous!And we are supposed to be elites?<br><br>There are still lots of examples that I can quote..but I will just stop here to hear you views,,<br><br>------------------<br>We have no right to ask when sorrow comes, "Why did this happen to me?" unless we ask the same question for every moment of happiness that comes our way.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 13 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes, yes, yes, these kinna thing always happen in sg....i remember our PM GOH said this in the public: we have been trying to be civilised compared to the developed countries, but see how pple react in the hello kitty incident...we sure got a long way to go....<br>so who is to be blame for our act??? is it ourselves or the govt...remember, in oversea, u can get unemployment benefits, pension, lotsa natural resources...but see what we have in sg, nothing, just human knowledge...if we want to succeed, chances are that we beat others in competition...slowly, we feel we cannot lose out (kiasu), and be selfish...only react if we can something good out of it....<br>pple who got a chance to study overseas, like me and Rinoa, will find a big contrast and maybe some cultural shock...but what can we do??? change it?? perhaps, but will take a long and painful time...best way to get out of it is to MIGRATE and don't come back to singapore!!! can u do that???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I'm back again.....<br><br>I would like to say something....yes, it is true such things happen when they happen....but like what alex said, if gals can just take steps to protect themselves....I know that Rinoa is going to blow if I say this, but.....maybe what happened to my gf will put all girls into the picture....<br><br>She was going home late one night...very dark...two Indians following her...she DIDN'T know!!!!! Luckily she reached the lighted lift lobby with people already there, then the two assholes stopped and turned and walked off...tell me if there is no intent!!!! And it was only then that she realized that she was followed...sheesh!!!!<br>She called and told me, and when I asked her why issit that she realized so late, she said she was tired!!!! Tell me, are gals so pitifully unaware of their surroundings that people can follow them for almost 50 metres without detection??!! Thank goodness she was alright....<br><br>We argued...her unhappiness was that she tot I blamed her for being followed, that she was asking for it, but no!!! Actually, I was more kan jiong about the fact that she didn't detect the two guys...I would have know the minute somebody is behind me, regardless of how far!!! This is the kind of situation awareness that I would like every girl to develop, to know their immediate surroundings and if anything happens, be ready for it...and I guess Callan already has and been practising, and with tact too....<br>Another incident...Me and her with her mother, coming back from hawker centre after dinner, one guy behind...mother walked very fast, putting distance between us and him. I would be actually trying to slow down and let him overtake, so that I CAN KEEP AN EYE ON HIM, NOT HIM ON ME!!!! Or I will immediately turn around and walk back...<br><br>So I guess I have three points here...<br>1) situation awareness. What I think Alex is trying to say...<br>2) Smart and effective moves. What Callan is saying...<br>3) Self defence. Not TKD, but know how to take steps to protect yourself.<br><br>Another thing. I guess overseas, people are much more outspoken...more gracious...I agree with that, and I really hope that our society can become like one of those...It will too, with people like us...I am also one of those that give up my seat...Right now, it's the culture, I guess....<br><br>One question before I go, to pose to the gals in this forum....<br>Do you know how to defend yourself when a man has already grabbed you and proceeding to rape you???<br>I have gone through this question with my gf and one of her friends...I would like to hear from the girls now....please.......<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Rinoa,<br><br>Here's my reply to your post :<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rinoa Heartilly:</div><div class="quote_body">I was in a very crowded feeder bus going home and as I was trying to get down from the bus and..I realised that the crowd is not moving which is quaint becos that stop is where most ppl will alight...but the crowd is simply not moving...guess what?...I need to get down the bus, so I squeezed thru the crowd and saw a blind gal trying to get down the bus but no one absolutely NO ONE tries to life a finger to help her...I immediately went down and helped her out of the bus...and even wanted to bring her home...I saw her before..she is living in my estate but she just smiled and said she wants to go to the NTUC...and I said."Do you need me to bring u there?" She said no..she knew the way.<br></div></blockquote>I agree with you about the "crowd-refuses-to-move" thingy. This is very common in Singapore. The "crowd-refuses-to-move-to-the-back-of-the-bus" is also another ugly sight. And yes, sometimes i simply dun understand why people just can't make way for other to move and need the bus driver to shout at them like they are little kids.<br><br>But frankly speaking, the condition is getting better now. Really. Especially in the younger generations. If you dun believe, try taking bus 151 to NUS. It is terribly crowded in the morning and in the evening but people do make way when you want to alight.<br><br>Sometimes we are slow in alighting and bus closes its door and start to move. But there are people who see this and press the bell for us. I really appreciate that.<br><br>I once saw a ger struggling on bus 151 cos it was too crowded. She was kind of giddy (maybe lack of air). The people around her saw her and many stood up to offer their seats to her. After that, they even offer her water and keep on asking if she is okay blah blah blah.<br><br>There are many incidents I can tell you about but i will make this post extremely long.<br><br>I believe it is the older generation that is still so inconsiderate (with reference to the examples you mentioned in your post). But we can't blame them. It is their mindset and it takes generations to change the mindset of people. It takes 17 (or 19 for guys) years to produce a graduate and we are only 35 years old.<br><br>The economy of Singapore has far outgrown our development as a civic-minded people. In terms of technology and economy, we often compare ourselves to the western societies which are mostly developed countries. But when it comes to civic-mindedness, we can't do that. In fact, if we compare our level of civic-mindedness to our neighbouring countries like M'sia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines (a ger was raped on the bus and NOBODY cares) and Myanmar. We are much much better.<br><br>Do you get what i mean ? I understand that you are now in Canada, a very developed country and you can tell the great differences between singapore and canada in terms of civic-mindedness. But is this comparison fair ? Similarly, we should not compare ourselves to the English and Americans when it comes to social attitudes. Our nation is only 35 years old. The pre-war babies (your grand parents and perhaps your parents) are still alive and kicking. You don't expect a 50-years-old man to change his mindset, do you ? It is difficult.<br><br>If you compare our social attitudes to China, I can assure you how good we are. Let me share some incidents I encountered in China :<br><br>a.  People rush to board the bus, *pulling* those in front behind them. If you think Singaporeans are bad enuff, go look at the Chinese.<br><br>b.  On the train, people throw EVERYTHING SINGLE RUBBISH out of the window. This resulted in the so-called "White Pollution". Pollution due to the non-biogradable styrofoam boxes. And i guess you know that spitting is a sport in China.<br><br>c.  A tall, dark and strong man wanted to beat up an old lady and throw her grandson out of the train window (while it is moving)because they were unwilling to spare some space for him to sit.<br><br>I understand that you are a psychology student in Canada. Are you interested in a career on social service ? I have been serving for National Counsel of Social Service (NCSS) for few years alredi. And the best way to integrate the handicapped (the blind ger on the bus you met) is not to help them but let them fend for themselves. I don't know what kind of situation it was on the bus then but if she was not having problem getting off the bus (just need more time), i would suggest you let her do it herself. And i would not suggest you bringing her home either. Are you showing pity on her ? I believe this is not what she needs. In fact the public sympathy becomes a great pressure for her which may result in difficulty for her to learn to fend for herself and live normally just like any other person. I hope you get what i mean. So next time when you see a handicap, do not approach him/her unless he/she is really having problems (even normal people encounter problems at times).<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>This incident really puts me off..I mean why nobody helped her...because they feel embarassed becos everyone is looking ??<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>yes, i do agree that singapore are more "passive" and are quite paisei to lend a helping hand. But it is getting better. Recall what it is like 20 years ago and look at what it is today.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I was waiting for someone nearer the validator to offer a seat to him..How naive I was...!No one stood up,,,and I stood up immediately to offer my seat and he smiled and said thank you...<br></strong></blockquote>if someone else gave up his seat for him instead of you. Perhaps that person will complain why nobody is willing to give up their seats too. And he will also think why an undergraduate like you are not giving up your seat for him. Sometimes, we give up our seat, sometimes, someone else will.<br><br>You think someone near the validator should give up his/her seat. But how can you be sure that the person seating near the validator think the same way ? Maybe that person think other seats were more suitable for him. There are all kinds of people in this world, you can't read their minds.<br><br>My point is, when it comes to helping others on the street, we should do it not because nobody elses is helping, but doing it because you think there is a need to. And after doing it, we should not blame others for not doing the same thing as you. If we can achieve this kind of attitude, i think we have really gone a long way.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I was really disgusted at how we so called 'highly educated ppl' do not even know what courteosy is about...and we have to come up with "Courteosy Campaigns' to remind us to be polite, courteous and gracious to our surroundings...<br></strong></blockquote>what's wrong with the campaigns ? We are taught to be courteous/polite etc when we are in school. But education may not be effective in all. So we need these campaigns. And these campaigns are still PART of education ! And it serves more to educate those older people who are not highly educated and those people who do not receive much education or education has failed on them.<br><br>If you think we should do away with these campaigns, are you saying that we should forgo all moral educations in schools as well ? I think the 2 work hand-in-hand.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>We need to have queue lines on the MRT grounds to make sure or remind us to stay in line...and we need to ban chewing gum becos we dunno how to dispose them well...How ridiculous!And we are supposed to be elites?<br></strong></blockquote>if the general public does not understand how to queue up properly etc for MRT or to dispose the chewing gum appropriately, what we should do is not to complain and ask Heaven why they act this way and way can't they be more civilised ? Instead, we should educate them and that's what we are doing.<br><br>The chewing gum problem does not belong to Singapore alone. In the UK, you see people throwing chewing gums all around too. Just take a look at the roads. Full of white patches due to chewing gums. The only difference is, we choose to do something about it while the other countries think they should not.<br><br>Rinoa, i am not objecting to your every single view. I am just presenting the other side of the coin to you so we can look that the issues more objectively and fairly.<br><br>Hope to hear from you soon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think an occupational hazard of being female is that you get molested quite often, especially in crowded places. i have been molested a number of times, all i can say is damn suay, but usually i let it go because i am not sure if the touch was accidental or not. however, i am quite lucky in that the creeps usually only managed either to brush my hand, arm or occasionally my butt because before they can Â“bump intoÂ” or Â“brush againstÂ” me, i usually Â‘siamÂ’ them first, but sometimes just not quick enough. then i curse: damn suay man! phui! Phui! PHUI! normally i give them dirty looks, many times i want to confront them because it really pissed me off to be taken advantage of but aiyo, at barely 5ft and a lightweight, i am not suicidal either.<br><br>maybe 2 to 3 years ago, i was on my way home around 9 plus in the night, took the bus no. 167 from the bus-stop opposite Takashimaya, the bus was really crowded, naturally my antenna was up. there was this young girl and a young boy in front of me, we were near the entrance of the bus. i didnÂ’t particularly pay attention to them, saw the young boy looking at me a few times (not that i am pretty but he was sussing me out to see if i was an easy target), dirty looks work, he darenÂ’t look at me after a couple of those. then i noticed his hand was always Â“accidentallyÂ” brushing against the butt of the young girl. i thought that they were a couple, so i went on with my own business. but the girl started fidgeting and started encroaching onto my personal space (okay, whatever thatÂ’s left of it in a crowded bus). wow, small boy got bolder and bolder, fleeting touches became lingering caresses on the butt, finally my brain woke up that maybe they were not even friends, so i observed him intently from Royal Hotel to Thomson Medical Centre. finally i asked the girl first, if she knows the boy and she said no and  she was really frightened out of her wits. most probably because the perpetuator was a young boy of no more than 18 and a short one at that, no taller than 1.65m (didnÂ’t really have to look up to him when i spoke to him), i dared to confront him. he denied everything and a shouting match ensued between me and him, i told him that it is because i do not want to ruin his future that i am not reporting him and advised that little twerp to get his hormones in control. wah! Â“er ren xian gao zhuanÂ” he became abusive, i rechecked with the girl again if she knew him and asked her if she wanted to make a report, she said she doesnÂ’t know him but kept quiet on the reporting issue. maybe the young chap wised up and finally kept his mouth shut, by now he kept a respectable distance from us. i cannot remember who got off the bus first but the girl and me both got off at the bus-stop near MacRitchie (is that how it is spelt?) Reservoir. she thanked me and i consoled her and advised her that if she is ever molested again, she shouldnÂ’t suffer in silence, all she has to do is ask the driver or other passengers for help. her age? 21 and yet she is frightened of a mere boy no older than 18, a small built one at that. the most amazing thing is that the other adults who saw the incident kept quiet, even when i was arguing with that little twerp, we were like invisible to them. yes, i felt good that i helped someone that day because i would like someone to help me if i am ever molested by a horrible creep. and because i am also tired of keeping quiet every time an idiot out there molests me or flashes me and the fear that i have when they do that to me. <strong>phui!</strong> some men are really sick.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just my personal views:<br><br>First of all, I don't agree that a civil minded person should shout "molest!" on the grounds that it is better to suffer the embrassment of being wrong than to let the person get away. Well, I do not know anyone who was molested before, but I do understand that for some people, the embrassment and shame is worst than the fact of being molested!<br><br>Next, with regards to being a civil society, I don't understand how it can relate to the government. If the country is competitive and kaisu, it is due to the people's attitudes and not due to the country. The government has never told us to not give up our seats or to not move behind on buses. Thus, I feel that the point would be to direct the unhappiness at those uncivil people, rather than blame everything on the govt.<br><br></div>

But after these years i have begun to understand that people will only have time for "morals" and "ethics" when all other aspects of their lives are more or less fulfilled. I may get lots of posts coming in protesting about what i have just said but i still have to bring it up.<br><br>If you can't even fill your empty stamoch, will you talk about morals ? Will you talk about ethics ? Will you think of helping others ? Do you think a courtesy campaign will work in Africa, for example, when people are starving and dying ? I am using very extreme example here i know, i just want to bring that nessage across.<br><br>Of course, Singaporeans are never in a lack of food or shelter. Maybe that was our grandparents' needs. Our needs have changed but they are still just as important as bread was to our grand parents. And Singaporeans are so engaged in pursuing their needs that they have no time to do something good and meaningful. For example, it is so difficult to get volunteers in Singapore. And many volunteers do social works to either "kill time" or "widen social circumference". It is ugly. And they appear during school holidays and disappear after that (we call them Ghost cos they are like the Ghosts during the Hungry Ghost Festival) Why is this so ? Cos when they are schooling, they have "better things to do". They only volunteer when "they are free". You see ? People will help only when other aspects of their lives are fulfilled.<br><br>My point is, as long as Singaporeans are engaged in the rat race for fame and money, the 5Cs, etc, they will not be as civic-minded as we want them to be. I sincerely hope that the Arts scene in Singapore can take off soon cos i believe only Arts can make people gracious and compassionate. Only Arts can educate the soul of people, which, i think, cannot be achieved by logic argument. Unfortunately, we still have a long way to go. But <strong>we should judge our success by how much we have progressed over these years instead of what we have currently achieved.</strong><br></div><div class="quote_body"> <blockquote><br>I live in SG like you do, breathe the same air, eat the same kind of food...but I stand at the minority...<br></blockquote></div></blockquote>you are not alone.<br><br>[quote]<strong><br>age...If the society can't cultivate good pillars...WE can!<br></strong><br><br>yes ! that's the way.

Rinoa, by the time you get married and give birth to your children and they grow up .... it's alreadi another generation. My parents never really taught me anything about caring for the society blah blah blah, all they wish is me to grow up healthily and be good. It is OUR generation which is going to instill civic-mindedness in our children (i hope !) and i believe you can count how long this is going to take.<br><br>Rinoa, glad to know that you have such great ambition as to create social awareness in people despite knowing that your voice is small. But believe me, nobody's voice is small if he chooses to shout. All the best for your future.</div>

A country is run by the government. The government in a way will determine the attitude of the society. For example, our government brings in the competition and forces us to compete (with foreign talents and opening up our market to the world).<br><br>I am not blaming the government of course but I would like to highlight that the government DO affect the way people think (and hence act) by creating an environment which we all live in.<br><br>But the responsibility does not lie fully with the government. We as a nation must work it out but the government does play a very important role.<br><br>We can see a pattern in most countries. We need to satisfy the people's physical requirements before we look into educating their souls. Singapore has achieved economic stability and we can all say that most of us do live in luxury now. So now is the time we should look into educating our souls, look at how we can make our society a gracious one through education and by promoting the Arts. But please bear in mind that we have just started. Give ourselves more time, alright ?</div>
