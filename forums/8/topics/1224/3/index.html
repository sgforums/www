            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Belittled,<br>I must disagree with you. Has the govt not tried to cultivate a better society by having courtesy campaigns, trying to stir up interests in the arts? I feel that all there is no way the govt can really cultivate anything cause there are many ways to do one thing, and while some would agree to cultivating the arts as a good way, other would feel it is a very fake way.<br><br>Anyway, I am not one to agree that Singapore is a ugly society. I just feel that more ugly incidents are reported, and so everyone sees the ugly side more. Like someone mentioned earlier, people who do good seldom come forward and shout from the rooftops, "I did a very good thing today!".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Turtle:</div><div class="quote_body">I feel that all there is no way the govt can really cultivate </div></blockquote>Dear Turtle,<br><br>I will like to remind you that education in Singapore is planned by the Ministry of Education, which is of course, the Government. It plans what is to be learned and what not to be learned. What is to be in the syllabus and what not to be in the syllabus. What is important and what is not important. And we all know what kind of influence Education has over every one of us. As a result, our youngsters are all being shaped by the government. So I think we should not underestimate the influence the government has on us.<br><br>Another example will be in the case of Japan. Where the Ministry of Education refuses to go into the details of WWII, or claimed by some, to distort the history. This has a very great impact on Japan's new generation. Their thinkings, believes etc will all be different from their parents' generation (at least in the views of WWII) which will ultimately result in the differences in ideologies and lifestyle. And once again, this is shaped by the Government.<br><br>One last example will be the UK, a country where social welfare is "well taken care of". This resulted in the so-called "underground economy" where people draw benefits from the government by claiming that they are jobless but at the same time, work secretly. In Singapore, our Government does not provide us with such benefits and we are left to fend for ourselves. In other words, our Government has created an environment which we have to depend on ourselves and fight for what we want and to be independent. As a result, the Government again, shaped the mentality of the people.<br><br>------------------<br>"Life is about making choices.

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm not too sure, but personally, rinoa seems to come off as little self-righteous, perhaps due to that incident with your sis? i understand why you might feel so strongly about this issue, but do understand that it isn't fair to impose your views, and standards on others, who may not share the same experience, or the same interpretation of that experience. not all of us have been molested, or know of a close one who's been through such a traumatic experience and yours does give you a richer view of things. however, it doesnt imply that yours is naturally right.<br><br>getting molested is never a pleasant experience, unlike what some porno novels will like to tell you. however, much of your ill-feelings also stem from the public's reaction to such an incident and your supposed "loss of face". it may be very easy to be morally upright, and to stand up for what you believe, but what if what you perceived to be fact isn't true? as callan stated, there is no clearcut definition of what exactly constitutes 'molest' and it largely depends on the person involved(or 'victim').<br><br>many a times, the victim herself is unsure of it. was it just a casual brushing of his hand against you? or was it intentional? most of us would often stop to take a moment and consider, before screaming molest. furthermore, there's also the shock that comes with it. she may be too overwhelmed by the whole incident that she's unable to react for a moment or two.<br><br>when we do witness such cases, we should think twice before making a decision. if it's a clear case and the victim obviously feels the same way, go ahead and do what YOU thk is right. however, if it was extremely vague, and you cant be sure, i would advise you to err on the side of caution. especially if the victim herself isnt sure. if you confrted them both upfront, the poor girl may still be in shock, and hasnt made up her mind yet. if she's the timid type, and she wasnt very certain to begin with, she may deny that she was molested, for fear of making the matter too big. wouldnt that be worse? perhaps if you really ARE certain that a crime has taken place, you can gently approach the 'victim' and ask if you could be of any assistance. self-righteously stomping up to the couple and demanding to know if she has been molested might result in an extremely ugly situation if you're wrong.<br><br>the issue here isn't about helping others, but rather, about when to do it and why. do it because you want to, it's as simple as that. you can question others for being so cold and uncaring, but do not compare your actions with theirs. for example, a doctor who goes out of his way to treat lepers who have been exiled, would definitely be commended, but can you condemn another fellow medical practitioner simply because he chooses not to take the risk? this eg is largely exaggerated, but i thk it puts my point accross. you can be upset at them for not helping, but you cannot expect them to do something simply because you did so to. the only reason why people should help is because they want to, not because of the repercussions of not doing so, not because they want to lord it over others. what requires changing is not simply the behaviour of us "ugly singaporeans" but our entire mindset.<br><br>-----------------<br>i would like to state (before any misunderstandings occure <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">) that i'm not siding anyone, nor am i intentionally hitting out at any particular person either. i see both sides of the story and understand how both parties feel, and why they feel that way. this is simply my point of view regarding this particular issue, any rebuttals/opposition are welcome as long as they're stated politely, and you elabobrate. yes, gdbookmarks/jackchen/whateveryou'recallingyourselfnowadays, that means you're to shut up.<br><br>[This message has been edited by xue (edited 14 April 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by xue (edited 14 April 2000).]</div>
