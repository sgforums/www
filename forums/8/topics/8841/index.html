            <div class='col-md body'>sometimes I dun understand why your fren takes paper qualifications that seriously..pardon me sayin does he wans a wife that can earn big bucks too after they got married?? your fren jus made a risk..cos by choosing only a girl who has not less then a degree qualification, he is diminishing his hopes of finding a gf. and u oso said that he is not good looking the hopes r even more diminishing..<br><br>so I suggest to your fren that if he wans to find a partner, do lower his standards in the paper qualifications department or else he will surely regret in the long run..eheheheh   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> FnU   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>------------------<br>Thank you for loving me baby<br>You'll always be the one who drives me crazy<br>I think this is a gift from God to have you here..<br>Thank you for loving me baby<br>I'll treasure all your love and all the things we share..<br>And I wanna tell you, how much I love you.....<br><br>[This message has been edited by FATnUGLY (edited 29 August 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>His rationale for finding a degree holder is because he feels that degree holders are able to be more on par when holding a conversation about politics,social issues etc etc and also generally able to converse well.I think it's crap as how well a person is verse in social issues depends on how widely read he is,not what paper qualification he holds,ahaha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Makan begins with a drool, grows with a chomp, ends with a burp.When you were born, you were hungry and everyone around you was full.

A lot of things are interdependant. You say love and paper qualifications are 2 diff things, but to me its the same, would you be happy if both you and your love one got to worry about money matters all the time? How can you be sure that true love can last as long as forever? The reasons why parents wants their daughters to find a man with good qualification is obvious, they love their daughters and hope that their daughters can find someone who can take care of them, our parents knows more than us, i have seen my parents quarreled many times over money matters. Good paper qualifications of cos can't ensure that you will have a good life, but its better than not having one.<br><br></div>

In this way, i can look up to him. I have a friend whose bf is a poly grad, he is ignorant about alot of things, he didn't even know the Effiel Tower is in Paris. After 4 years of relationship, they broke up as my friend left him for another U grad. I feel sad for that guy, but i wouldn't say my friend is wrong, cos if i were her, i would have did the same thing.<br><br>I want to ask you guys, if you truely love your gf, wouldn't you want her to have a better life?
