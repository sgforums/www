            <div class='col-md body'>An 80 year old couple were having problems<br>remembering things, so they decided to go to<br>their doctor to get checked out to make sure<br>nothing was wrong with them. When they arrived<br>at the doctor's, they explained to the doctor about<br>the problems they were having with their memory.<br>After checking the couple out, the doctor tells<br>them that they were physically okay but might want<br>to start writing things down and make notes to<br>help them remember things.The couple thanked<br>the doctor and left.Later that night while watching<br>TV, the old man got up from his chair and his wife<br>asks, "Where are you going?" He replies, "To the<br>kitchen."She asks, "Will you get me a bowl of ice<br>cream?" He replies, "Sure." She then asks<br>him, "Don't you think you should write it down so<br>you can remember it?" He says, "No, I can<br>remember that." She then says, "Well I also would<br>like some strawberries on top. You had better<br>write that down cause I know you'll forget that." He<br>says, "I can remember that, you want a bowl of ice<br>cream with strawberries." She replies, "Well I also<br>would like whip cream on top. I know you will<br>forget that so you better write it down." With<br>irritation in his voice, he says, "I don't need to<br>write that down I can remember that." He then<br>fumes into the kitchen. After about 20 minutes he<br>returns from the kitchen and hands her a plate of<br>bacon and eggs. She stares at the plate for a<br>moment and says, "You forgot my toast."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Morris thought he was dead, when in reality he<br>was very much alive. His delusion became such a<br>problem that his family finally paid for him to see a<br>psychiatrist. The psychiatrist spent many<br>laborious sessions trying to convince the man he<br>was still alive. Nothing seemed to work. Finally the<br>doctor tried one last approach. He took out his<br>medical books and proceeded to show the<br>patient that dead men don't bleed. After hours of<br>tedious study, Morris seemed convinced that<br>dead men don't bleed. "Do you now agree that<br>dead men don't bleed?" the doctor asked. "Yes, I<br>do," replied Morris. "Very well, then," the doctor<br>said. He took out a pin and pricked<br>Morris' finger. Out came a trickle of blood. The<br>doctor asked, "What does that tell you?" "Oh my<br>goodness!" Morris exclaimed, as he stared<br>incredulously at his finger... "The book lied, dead men DO<br>bleed!!"<br><br></div>

The father, surprised,<br>answers, "Well, son, there are three kinds of<br>bre@sts. In her twenties, a woman's bre@sts are<br>like melons,round and Firm. In her thirties to<br>forties, they are like pears, still nice but Hanging a<br>bit. After fifty, they are like<br>onions." "Onions?" "Yes, see them and they make<br>you cry."

The mother, surprised,<br>smiles, and looks at her husband and<br>answers, "Well, dear, a man goes through three<br>phases. In a man's twenties, his penis is like an<br>oak, mighty and hard. In his thirties and forties, it<br>is like a birch, flexible but reliable. After his fifties,<br>it is like a Christmas tree." "A Christmas<br>tree?"

"Why Daddy?" asked a<br>confused Little Johnny. "Well, son" he<br>explained, "Your mother and I are no longer in<br>love." Now more confused, Little Johnny<br>asked, "What does being in love mean?" "Let me<br>give you an example, son. Love is when a<br>husband rushes home from a long day at work to<br>embrace and kiss his wife at the door. Your mom<br>and I have lost that love." "But Daddy, I see<br>Mommy getting excited lots of times right when<br>you come home, so she must still be in love with<br>you." "I don't understand, son. When has your<br>mother recently been excited when I arrive home<br>from work?" "Well, sometimes when Mommy is<br>still in bed with uncle Bill, your brother, and you pull<br>into the driveway, she shouts at the top of her<br>lungs, 'My husband's home!

She went to<br>the front door of the first house and asked the<br>owner if he had any jobs for her to do. "Well, you<br>can paint my porch. How much will you charge?"<br>The blonde said, "How about 50 dollars?" The<br>man agreed and told her that the paint and<br>ladders that she might need were in the garage.<br>The man's wife, inside the house, heard the<br>conversation and said to her husband, "Does she<br>realize that the porch goes all the way around the<br>house?

"Yes," the blonde answered, "and I had<br>paint left over, so I gave it two coats. "Impressed,<br>the man reached in his pocket for the $50.

            <div class='col-md body'>Recently Isaac Newton, the Father of physics<br>made a visit to earth to watch a movie. He<br>watched a few Tamil movies and his head started<br>spinning. He was convinced that all his logic and<br>laws in physics were just a huge pile of junk and<br>apologized for everything he had done.<br><br>In a movie starring Rajanikant, Newton was<br>confused to such an extent that he went paranoid.<br>Here are a few scenes from the movie he saw:<br><br>1) Rajanikant has a Brain Tumor which, according<br>to the doctors can't be cured and his death is<br>imminent. In one of the fights, our great Rajanikant<br>is shot in the head. To everybody's surprise, the<br>bullet passes through his ears taking away the<br>tumor along with it and he is cured.<br>Long Live Rajanikant!!<br><br>2) In one of the movies, Rajanikant is confronted<br>with 3 gangsters. Rajanikant has a gun but<br>unfortunately only one bullet. Guess what he<br>does.......He holds a knife in his hand and throws<br>at the middle gangster..&amp; shoots the bullet<br>towards the knife. The knife cuts the bullet into 2<br>pieces and kills both the gangsters on each side<br>of the middle gangster &amp; the knife kills the middle<br>one.<br><br>3) Rajanikant is chased by a gangster. Rajanikant<br>has a revolver but he got no bullets in it. Guess<br>what he does. Nah not even in your remotest<br>imaginations. He waits for the gangster to shoot.<br>As soon as the gangster shoots, Rajanikant<br>opens the bullet compartment of his revolver and<br>catches the bullet. Then, he closes the bullet<br>compartment and fires his gun. Bang... And the<br>gangster dies.... This was too much for the Great<br>Newton to take, he was completely shaken and he<br>decided to go back.<br><br>But he was seing a movie after a long time and it<br>was his last movie, and so he decided to watch till<br>the end. The next hour of the movie goes ok<br>and Newton is feeling happy that all in the world<br>hasn't changed. Oops, not so fast. The Climax<br>finally arrives. Rajanikant gets to know that the<br>villain is on the other side of a very high wall. So<br>high that Rajanikanth can't jump even if he tries<br>like one of those superman techniques that<br>heroes normally use. Rajanikant has to<br>desperately kill the villain because it's the climax.<br>Newton is smiling since it is virtually impossible).<br>Rajanikant suddenly pulls two guns from his<br>pocket (Probably a backup). He throws one gun in<br>the air and when the gun has reached the height<br>of the wall, he shoots at the trigger of the first gun<br>in air, with his second gun. The first gun fires off<br>and the villain is dead.<br><br>Newton commits Suicide in the theatre...</div>

If you cannot keep<br>your<br>eyes or hands off of my daughter's body, I will<br>remove them.<br><br>Rule Three:<br><br>I am aware that it is considered fashionable for<br>boys of your age to wear their trousers so<br>loosely<br>that they appear to be falling off their hips.<br>Please<br>don't take this as an insult, but you and all of<br>your<br>friends are complete idiots.<br><br>Still, I want to be fair and open minded about<br>this<br>issue, so I propose this compromise: You may<br>come to the door with your underwear showing<br>and your pants ten sizes to big, and I will not<br>object. However, in order to ensure that your<br>clothes do not, in fact come off during the<br>course<br>of you date with my daughter, I will take my<br>electric<br>nail gun and fasten your trousers securely in<br>place<br>to your waist.<br><br>Rule Four:<br><br>I'm sure you've been told that in today's world,<br>sex<br>without utilizing a "Barrier method" of some<br>kind<br>can kill you. Let me elaborate, when it comes<br>to<br>sex, I am the barrier, and I will kill you.<br><br>Rule Five:<br><br>It is usually understood that in order for us to<br>get to<br>know each other, we should talk about World<br>Cup,<br>Politics, and other issues of the day. Please do<br>not do this. The only information I require from<br>you<br>is an indication of when you expect to have my<br>daughter safely back at my house, and the only<br>word I need from you on this subject is: "early"<br><br>Rule Six:<br><br>I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with<br>many opportunities to date other girls. This is<br>fine<br>with me as long as it is okay with my daughter.<br>Otherwise, once you have gone out with my<br>little<br>girl, you will continue to date no one but her<br>until<br>she is finished with you. If you make her cry, I<br>will<br>make you cry.<br>Rule Seven:<br><br>As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my<br>daughter to appear, and more than an hour<br>goes<br>by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to be on<br>time for the movie, you should not be dating.<br>My<br>daughter is putting on her makeup, a process<br>than<br>can take longer than painting the Golden Gate<br>Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why<br>don't<br>you do something useful, like changing the oil<br>in<br>my car ?<br><br>Rule Eight:<br><br>The following places are not appropriate for a<br>date with my daughter:<br>1. Places where there are beds, sofas, or<br>anything softer than a wooden stool.<br>2. Places where there is darkness. Places<br>where<br>there is dancing, holding hands, or happiness.<br>3. Places where the ambient temperature is<br>warm<br>enough to introduce my daughter to wear<br>shorts,<br>tank tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything other<br>than<br>overalls, a sweater, and a goose down parka --<br>zipped up to her throat.<br>4. Movies with a strong romantic or sexual<br>theme<br>are to be avoided; movies which features chain<br>saws are okay. 5. Hockey games are okay.<br>6. Old folks homes are better.<br><br>Rule Nine:<br><br>Do not lie to me. I may appear to be a<br>potbellied,<br>balding, middle-aged, dimwitted has-been. But<br>on<br>issues relating to my daughter, I am the all-<br>knowing, merciless God of your universe. If I<br>ask<br>you where you are going and with whom, you<br>have<br>one chance to tell me the truth, the whole truth<br>and<br>nothing but the truth. I have a shotgun, a<br>shovel,<br>and five acres behind the house. Do not trifle<br>with<br>me.<br><br>Rule Ten:<br><br>Be afraid. Be very afraid. It takes very little for<br>me<br>to mistake the sound of your car in the<br>driveway<br>for a chopper coming in over a rice paddy near<br>Hanoi. When my Agent Orange starts acting<br>up,<br>the voices in my head frequently tell me to<br>clean<br>the guns as I wait for you to bring my daughter<br>home. As soon as you pull into the driveways<br>you<br>should exit the car with both hands in plain<br>sight.<br>Speak the perimeter password, announce in a<br>clear voice that you have brought my daughter<br>home safely and early, then return to your car --<br>there is no need for you to come inside.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Kenashi:</div><div class="quote_body">Recently Isaac Newton, the Father of physics<br>made a visit to earth to watch a movie. He<br>watched a few Tamil movies and his head started<br>spinning. He was convinced that all his logic and<br>laws in physics were just a huge pile of junk and<br>apologized for everything he had done.<br><br>In a movie starring Rajanikant, Newton was<br>confused to such an extent that he went paranoid.<br>Here are a few scenes from the movie he saw:<br><br>1) Rajanikant has a Brain Tumor which, according<br>to the doctors can't be cured and his death is<br>imminent. In one of the fights, our great Rajanikant<br>is shot in the head. To everybody's surprise, the<br>bullet passes through his ears taking away the<br>tumor along with it and he is cured.<br>Long Live Rajanikant!!<br><br>2) In one of the movies, Rajanikant is confronted<br>with 3 gangsters. Rajanikant has a gun but<br>unfortunately only one bullet. Guess what he<br>does.......He holds a knife in his hand and throws<br>at the middle gangster..&amp; shoots the bullet<br>towards the knife. The knife cuts the bullet into 2<br>pieces and kills both the gangsters on each side<br>of the middle gangster &amp; the knife kills the middle<br>one.<br><br>3) Rajanikant is chased by a gangster. Rajanikant<br>has a revolver but he got no bullets in it. Guess<br>what he does. Nah not even in your remotest<br>imaginations. He waits for the gangster to shoot.<br>As soon as the gangster shoots, Rajanikant<br>opens the bullet compartment of his revolver and<br>catches the bullet. Then, he closes the bullet<br>compartment and fires his gun. Bang... And the<br>gangster dies.... This was too much for the Great<br>Newton to take, he was completely shaken and he<br>decided to go back.<br><br>But he was seing a movie after a long time and it<br>was his last movie, and so he decided to watch till<br>the end. The next hour of the movie goes ok<br>and Newton is feeling happy that all in the world<br>hasn't changed. Oops, not so fast. The Climax<br>finally arrives. Rajanikant gets to know that the<br>villain is on the other side of a very high wall. So<br>high that Rajanikanth can't jump even if he tries<br>like one of those superman techniques that<br>heroes normally use. Rajanikant has to<br>desperately kill the villain because it's the climax.<br>Newton is smiling since it is virtually impossible).<br>Rajanikant suddenly pulls two guns from his<br>pocket (Probably a backup). He throws one gun in<br>the air and when the gun has reached the height<br>of the wall, he shoots at the trigger of the first gun<br>in air, with his second gun. The first gun fires off<br>and the villain is dead.<br><br>Newton commits Suicide in the theatre...</div></blockquote>all that have nothing to do with newton what.</div>
