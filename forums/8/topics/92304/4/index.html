He said he has a diabetes problem and he needs to see a  doctor but its too expensive. I asked him how much. He said 2000 baht per trip and he would need probably 20 trips? When I heard that, "I said"God forgive me...." because 40000 bahts is only roughly $2000. I mean in singapore if $2000 can treat diabetes, everyone will have NO diabetes. in Singapore, $2000 to treat such a big deasese is CHEAP!

I support charities too. Everytime they have some flag selling or volunteering thing at work. I'm always putting my hands up.<br>I donate to charities that I know are genuine. None of these where 99% are admin fees, and the poor kid gets something like $10. Some people do not believe in spending on objects. Cars etc..they are smart enough to spend on a property or shares that will earn them money. It's probably just a phase that i'm going through. At this point of time I am able to do this, so i do it. What else do you do when you don't have kids, mortgage or parents to support? In future.. probably can't even look at Gucci anymore.<br><br></div>

For me, because i have a grandmother. I feel sick in the gut when people abandon their parents to beg in singapore. That is what i feel upset about when we do not have a welfare system in singapore. I feel sick.. really sick. I want to cry.. i used to work in a cafe and when it's close, we used to throw out all the food/pastries. I refused to do it when i finish work. I would collect it and take two big bags of stuff home. Sometimes we'll walk around and give them to the old people begging on the streets. I'm wary of young beggers, sympathetic.. but yet.. most of the times they are obviously chuffed and stoned on some shit. Especially if they get abusive on the trams.<br><br>Worse is the people who stab old homeless people. Just leave the poor guy alone. Sigh.. Another time.. i saw a bunch of CHINESE.. Yes chinese guys ganging up on a mentally challenged guy outside 7-11. All these people just walked past. They looked like they were going to beat him up. This aussie told the mentally challenged guy to go, "look man, just leave. C'mon just go." Why the hell do they need to pick on less fortunate people.<br><br></div>
