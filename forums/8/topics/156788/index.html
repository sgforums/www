            <div class='col-md body'>Oct 10, 2005<br>KL wants 100,000 foreign students<br>Malaysia in race for education dollar as competition heats up in region<br><br>By Leslie Lau<br>Malaysia Correspondent<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR - MALAYSIA is stepping up its drive to woo more foreign students to the country as the race for the education dollar heats up.<br><br>With an eye on competition from Singapore, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Badawi announced last week an ambitious target of attracting 100,000 foreign students by 2010.<br><br>Government officials have also announced new measures even as they acknowledged the failure to achieve an earlier target of attracting 50,000 foreign students by this year.<br><br>There are 40,000 foreign students in Malaysia - 32,000 undergraduates and 8,000 in secondary and primary schools.<br><br>The government said last week that it will allow 38 private colleges to continue offering 'joint degrees' with foreign partners, and plans to attract more universities to set up branch campuses here.<br><br>Officials said the government would also consider applications from nearly 500 private colleges which want to offer these 'joint degree' programmes that can be completed fully in Malaysia.<br><br>Many private colleges here offer degree programmes that require students to complete the final one or two years at the foreign partner university, usually in the United States, Britain or Australia.<br><br>These new moves are among a host of measures being introduced as part of an ongoing review of higher education in Malaysia.<br><br>'We want Malaysia to be a regional centre of excellence for higher education, but we have failed to reach our targets. More needs to be done to attract foreign students, especially with competition from Singapore,' a Higher Education Ministry official told The Straits Times yesterday.<br><br>He said Malaysia wanted to make it easier for foreign students to complete their studies while maintaining high standards, and to make it cheaper for Malaysians too.<br><br>The official, who declined to be named, said attracting reputable foreign universities to set up branch campuses in Malaysia remains a major part of the government's strategy.<br><br>'If more established universities set up base here, it will make Malaysia attractive as a destination,' he said.<br><br>Higher Education Minister Datuk Shafie Salleh said last week that many foreign students found it tedious to apply for visas when transferring their studies from Malaysia to another country.<br><br>'If more private colleges are allowed to fully conduct their courses here, the number of international students can be increased,' he said.<br><br>The Straits Times understands that Prime Minister Abdullah has directed a comprehensive study of the education industry, and an independent body has already made some recommendations to the government.<br><br>The push to allow private colleges to fully conduct courses here is one recommendation.<br><br>Education officials are also likely to be sent overseas to woo more foreign universities to set up base here.<br><br>Recently, the University of Nottingham Malaysian Campus, built at a cost of RM120 million (S$54 million) on a 41ha site, was officially opened. It can take in more than 5,000 undergraduates.<br><br>Australia's Monash University was the first foreign institution allowed into Malaysia. It set up its branch campus about 10 years ago.<br><br>Other notable names like Curtin University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are also in the midst of setting up programmes in Malaysia.<br><br>Prime Minister Abdullah had said that the government recognised education as a major industry and would implement policies to complement private education.</div>
