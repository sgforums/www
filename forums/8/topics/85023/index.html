            <div class='col-md body'>What I'm saying is that not all mothers-in-law are horrible. Some can be very helpful if u can learn to get along with them. Since she is marrying an only child, chances of living with in-laws very great. Not all parents allow their kid to live out. If the girl cannot get get along with his mother, then better reconsider her decision to marry the guy. Marrying a rich man is not easy if u don't come from similar background.</div>
