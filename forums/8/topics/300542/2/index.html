No longer the softer metals like pure gold.<br>If the wedding band is the one that gets most worn, isn't it better to make THAT one more nicer than the engagement ring ?<br>And since the wedding band is the one that is more significant since it is the one that symbolize forever union, isn't it more sensible to spend more money on the band than the engagement ring ?<br><br>If you ask any girl which would they prefer to wear everyday, they'd choose the nicer ring.<br>I don't know about New York, but where I live, they wear the Engagement ring  AND the Wedding band together. Everyday.<br><br>In Singapore, we are partly western and partly Asian.<br>The traditions and practices has evolved over time to suit the needs of modern Singaporean.<br>During my mother's time, there's only ONE ring.<br>The proposal/betrothal is done with offers of gifts to her family.<br><br>There are 4 pieces of gold and wedding dowry involve. The tradition is very different from Westerners.<br><br>My Asian friend had a hard time getting her American husband to accept the idea of a dowry as it seems like the family was selling their daughter to him.

Some few days before ROM. My friend was one , they argue at ROM and broke off that day.<br><br>Then mine didn't materialize also lah.<br>In fact, a lot of couples only really start to think about the life time commitment after the engagement.<br><br>So, as a girl, ofcors we want nice engagement rings lah.<br><br>But, like my case, even when I offer to return the engagement ring, he says also meaningless, because he wouldn't be giving it to another girl later.<br><br>I told him to sell it off and get something nice for himself, he also says the most he can get back is half of the value it was retailed.<br><br>So you see, next time, I'd rather my man get me a simple Engagement ring, then I go choose  a nice wedding band.<br><br></div>
