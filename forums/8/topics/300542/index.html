Some things which you would need to take note:<br>- groom's family usually give a 'dowry' of gifts. Ensure that this is discussed first between your gf and her parents, then formally either through those 'aunties' OR what I did was just to have both families dinner together  and finalise what items to buy and etc.<br>- before the customary, I had an event called the 'guo da li' which is basically groom's family delivers the gifts to my place which include all the cakes which you need when u give invites to your relatives.<br>- depending on HOW traditional and what expectations both sides have, gifts will include:<br>- some dried plant thing to be exchanged to pomegranate leaves<br>- suckling pig OR pig trotter's cans<br>- liquor to be exchanged with some sweet drinks<br>- oranges<br>- 4 dian jin: 4 piece of gold usually earrings, necklace, pendant<br>- angpows: which the groom gives, and the bride's family will take a portion and return the rest<br>- another angpow specifically for bride's mom<br><br>a lot lah.. u tok to those chinatown aunties they tell u everything.<br><br>4.
