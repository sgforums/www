              <p>I have come across some woman who are allergic to sharing meals and very particular about germs, for example my best friend's wife. Recently we went outing dinner, a gang of friends, then as being courteous, I distributed all the cups, chop sticks and plates to everybody as they were on my side. But my best friend's wife, she took back all the chop stick, porcelain spoon and plates and took her own instead. She didn't want to share the dishes with us, so she called her own separate meal instead.</p>
              <p>I didn't want to take notice of her behaviour but I say I have come across some women who behave like this, if I react, I think I would be in for some flaming from her. So I decided not to be sensitive and just enjoy the dinner and company of friends.</p>
              <p>So I am asking y'all, if you have come across any of your best friend's gf or wife who behave like this? They like don't want to eat out of the plates you give them because they are very sensitive about germs. In western culture, probably some ang moh would be offended but I suppose for us Asians, we tolerate this because we come across a lot of woman like this. As for men, I think I can generally say, they don't mind sharing from the same plate....not so particular about germs.</p>

              <p><br>But dinner at chinese restaurant, my best friend's wife don't want to share the common dishes on the turntable, instead she call her dish, so she ate separately from us. Also it is common tradition, if you sit near the teapot and the saucer plates, bowls, chopsticks, teacups and spoons, to distribute to everybody around the table. But she returned all the cutlery I place for her, and she instead took it for herself. Wonder why this strange behaviour. Would you take this as an offence? Its like saying your hands are dirty with germs and your saliva not clean. I didn't bother at first because I didn't want to get sensitive at my best friend's wife, you know women lar, you don't want to step on their toes, hell hath no fury.</p>

For example, when ordering chicken rice with a few friends.... we always go solo.. instead of getting chopped and ripped off by unscrupulous hawkers who charge us more.... by giving us the backside and the other parts that we do not eat. And its more hygenic to eat solo... why not?<br><br>Actually when eating at home, my mum separates the food out for us... LOL.... Only my dad likes the sharing habit... so after we have separated all our food... he takes from the 3 plates of dishes.... by sharing it with himself.</p></div>

              <p>Aiyoyo, headache lar because very hard to get my best friend out lar, his wife stick to him like glue. At least His wife can communicate a bit lar, sometime I can strike a joke or two with her. But I like to go nature hiking with my friends but she doesn't like the hot sun so my best friend always so he not free to come out. And then she doesn't talk much with my other friend's wife and gfs. So my problem is trying to integrate us as a group of outing friends because our wives and gf's don';t talk much to each other.</p>

              <p>OCD? What is that? Maybe she got Hepatitis. But funny lar, I am not generalising but a lot of ladies are like that.</p>
              <p>But got one time my cousin came back from Japan, contracted Hepatitis, then in CNY, we all ate at the round table, she go and use her chopstick on the shared dishes, her saliva all over the food. Luckily I didn't get Hepatitis.</p>
