            <div class='col-md body'>Just watched the Super Sunday, where Peng Jia Hui went on the show to search for her mother. Someone who abandoned her when she was only 5 years old (after her father's death). Someone she has not seen for 21 years. So sad.......<br>I wonder what can possibly occur to cause her to abandon her family? I myself really dun know what I wud do in such a case. Someone who has neglected a mother's role for 21 years. Will I still look for her? Will I forgive her? I dun know.....<br>Will you?<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

After all, have been living w/o her for 21 years ...... she has abandoned the family, and that's a fact.<br><br>Still, maybe will just be curious to know how she look like and if she still alive .....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>UBA,<br><br>well i gotto agree that its a very cruel thing to do ........ too bad the show never tell us what's the reason that could force a mother to give up on her own children and carry out such a cruel act. Guess it will be interesting to know, and only then can we decided if she should be forgiven.</div>
