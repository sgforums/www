            <div class='col-md body'>Due to most research, most adolescents have more attempted suicides more than the actual ones. If he really love her gf very much, and he thinks that she is the world to him, the only thing is to talk to his gf instead. Why is the gf ignoring him? Becos he is not as attractive as before or she has no love for him anymore...<br><br>And since they are still together, it is no use just to see the world pass by and keep seeing depressed. Suicidal is just a mental thought in his case and most likely if his gf leaves him, he might want to commit suicide. But love is not about sympathy, it has to be mutual. NO point holding to something that wants to break away from u...<br><br>If ur fren is sensible enuff, he should divert his attention to things that are more worthwhile, like his frens and career... Relationships are part and parcel of life and it is not an absolute...There is so much more to life...<br><br>Talk to the gf first and see how it goes..and if he is still in that "suicidal" state, ask him to talk to me!</div>

This can become a full-blown crisis if u dun attempt to stop it now.<br><br>My advice is for him to seek psychiatric help. It is a case for the professionals. Dun think that it is only a minor BGR affair coz it can really be dangerous if he starts doing something drastic.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sounds so familiar. One of my good friends was really sucidal a year back and kept calling me up at ungodly hours for long chats, even though he was in London at that time. Even now, when the phone rings at a 3am, I'll think it's him. He's OK now. Some things I've learnt:<br><br>1) Don't let him feel sorry for himself. I divert him by using sarcasm to make him laugh.<br><br>2) Make him think positively. Tell him that it wouldn't help to keep dwelling on suicide and negative things. Sometimes, I also try to goad my friend to channel his energies productively.<br><br>3) I told my friend in no uncertain terms how selfish suicide is. I told him I would be very angry with him if he did it and I would never forgive him. Then I spoillt it all by getting so upset that I cried. I hope he doesn't remember this *hee*<br><br>4) Just be there to listen. They need someone to vent their feelings to. It doesn't sound like much, but it really helps.<br><br>5) Let him know that whatever he does (except suicide), you will be there to support him.<br><br>6) Last trick: I kept reminding my friend of the optimistic, cocky person that he was, and all the stupid, idiotic things we did in school. I wanted him to rememer how fun life was, how fun it could be.<br><br>Hope all these help.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 17-12-1999).]</div>

His somewhat complicated background is a serious factor for consideration.<br><br>Don't try give advice to such people; you most probably will not understand what they are actually thinking and trying to impose your ideas on them will actually turn them off. Instead, continue to listen to him and try to force him to speak out his inner thoughts and fears. Once he releases those hidden thoughts, the suicidal thoughts will be greatly reduced.<br>After you get to know his problems roughly, try to give him the different way of looking at the problems, and when making him look at the problems from multiple angles, try to make him solve the problem himself.<br>Remember, let him do it himself and not tell him what to do, how to do unless he asks for your opinions.<br><br>Talking to his girlfriend might help to gain more infomation on his problems, it's an avenue that's worth seeking, but how you're going to go about doing it, I'm not so sure, but I guess it's worth a try.<br><br>In fact, I think his girlfriend would be the best person to help him. But if there's problems between the two of them, it would be difficult.<br><br>If he takes you for a beanie bag, do return it to him.<br><br>Btw, are you interested in him?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ocean:<br>I agree that for some, imposition of ideas will turn them off but I think I dont have to worry about that for my friend. I highly dont think he listens to what I say. But to be honest, I'm confused as to what he is going through; not the relationship part but the mentally insane part. I try my best to understand and maybe it's cuz I cannot see the whole picture and thus I cant do much to help him.<br><br>I cant go talk to the gf cuz I have simply no idea where to find her.<br><br>About being a beanie bag, I thought that it might make him more solitary because he then thinks that no one would be there for me BUT i gave it thought juz now and realising his nature, it might actually succeed in lifting his spirits and take his mind away from all these. Although it seems juz a temporary phrase. Is it?<br><br>Interested?!?!?! I cant help but smile when I read that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> No lah, I'm not interested in him.. hahahaha..<br><br>NoOne: Alamak! U've juz single-handedly increased the burden in my heart.. sigh!! But thanks, I shall remember that when I'm that close to scolding him or something..<br><br>pacman: I shall suggest this to him but dun know if he'll take this up though..</div>
