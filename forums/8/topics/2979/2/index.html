As for the mentally insane part, I can't say much about him 'cos I don't him. But what he's thinking is revealed in his speech, but the thing is can you decode it? What you don't understand, you should clarify with him; bug him to say it out.<br><br>The beanie part. I disagree with you; at least you should let him know that although you didn't retaliate at him for "throwing" those "punches", but you should make him guilty by letting know it hurts and if he treats you as a friend, he should learn to control himself, be brave and stand up again.<br><br>How old is he btw?</div>

U can call it rebound if u like but its really helping her get over things.<br><br>I'm not telling your fren to go out with anyone on the rebound or commit suicide...but sometimes it really take something very drastic to wake someone up.<br><br>I dunno if wat i said helps but i hope your fren recovers soon from his heartache.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think in terms of intervention, you can only do so much without becoming too imposing or getting in too deep. Sometimes you have to just maintain what you are doing and let time do the rest. Of course if your friend is talking about suicide then you definitely need professional help ASAP.<br><br>Otherwise, perhaps just staying put would be more appropriate for the time being?</div>

But if you feel your friend is getting out of control, please please get professional help.<br><br>I empathise about the part about being a beanie bag. I went through it too.

            <div class='col-md body'>juls:<br>"Shall we die?" Seems to me that he's saying something to catch your attention.<br>Guys usually have a higher success rate in suicide 'cos they are firmer in their decision, and they when they do it, they make sure they finish it off.<br>Your friend is depressed and I think he acknowledges it and expresses it by talking about death topics. Of course, prolonged depression might eventually lead to suicide, but sometimes it's better for him to try and hit a pit before pulling him out.(so that he wouldn't attempt to reach the pit again)<br><br>I still know very little about him to advise, but do hope you people can make him speak when you meet him. Quantity is not what matters, quality is. The closer the group of friends that's meeting him, the better it is.<br><br>[This message has been edited by ocean (edited 21-12-1999).]</div>

In Australia, there are Suicide Hotlines (Australia has the highest rate of youth suicide) which are manned by volunteers trained in this area. Then there are also psych wards in hospitals. They have sort of crisis teams that go out to people in need, but I'm not sure if they attend to potential suicide cases. If not too urgent, there are psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers etc.<br><br>But thats in Australia. I'm guessing in Singapore, with our good health system, there should be public access services such as a hotline for young people. Otherwise, a GP should know what services are available and point in the right direction. Thats one of their duties. The problem would be that of cost of the services. Can you guys afford it? Another is the stigma attached. No many people would want to see those people because they might be seen as crazy.<br><br></div>
