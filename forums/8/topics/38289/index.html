            <div class='col-md body'>yeah it's a feeling of deja vu. i get it too.. but quite rarely. once a year perhaps? i really couldn't put a timing on the frequency.<br><br>some say it's a dream i had b4, so in other words dreams may tell the future? but i never remember my dreams, but it could be in my sub-conscious.<br><br>anyhow, don't worree too much about it, or him, i dun think it makes him crazy or anything.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've heard of a scientific explanation for deja vu. It's something like your brains received the message before your eyes actually see your situation. something like this, sorry cos really can't remember in detail. Any1 knows more abt the scientific explanation ?</div>
