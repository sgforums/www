Apparently an abbreviation for 'Meets Mahatma Gandhi,' the filmmakers have issued the following warning for the movie:<br><br><strong> Caution, this movie may contain non-violence.</strong><br><br>Technically not a sequel, the second Munnabhai movie will bring back favorite characters, but in a completely different situation, rather than continuing series. Everyone's favorite professional poser is back in trouble, having been arrested. Munna decides to defend himself in his court trial and sets off for law school. Gracy Singh returns as Dr. Suman Asthana, aka Chinki. Also reprising his role as Munna's sidekick, Circuit, is the very comedically gifted Arshad Warsi. Shah Rukh Khan will also appear, in an undisclosed special appearance, and Munna's love interest will be played by "Parineeta" favorite, Vidya Balan.<br><br>The rights to produce the English version of "Munnabhai MBBS" were purchased by Fox, and are presently negotiating with director Mira Nair and actor Chris Tucker to star, as reported by EGO Bollywood Pulse.</div>

It is a classic story of a right man in a wrong place. A world very different in the one he lives in.The misfit muscles his way into a medical college to prove a point- He might just cure you. And he does. Without resorting to tired-and-tested gimmicks.

All parties ignore his plea for ticket because of his long history-sheet. But when he sends 10 "petis"(of 1000-rupee notes, of course) The ticket is sent to his den pronto.<br><br>His followers"Vote diya to lootenge, nahin diya to kootenge".Most voters think that getting robbed is better than getting murdered and back him whole-heartedly.<br>Only a petite girl( our very own Sonali..!!), our heroine, campaigns against him. So Munna goes to her public meeting and hugs and kisses her before everyone.So " Sonali" bowled over by this macho man and accepts him as her darling. That takes care of the romance angle.<br>Munna wins by 15 lakh votes in a constituency with 10 lakh votes.The CEC wants to protest but his father is fond of playing carrom with Munna's men..!!<br>Munna makes his maiden speech in Parliament and uses such red-hot words  so live telecast has to be stopped.<br><br>The rest of the story shows if managed to win the votes of the people</span></div>

Although the possibility of 'Munnabhai' becoming a Hollywood film has been talked about for sometime now, the film's writer and producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra was reported to have clinched deal with Fox. Chopra himself was noncommittal saying talks were going on.
