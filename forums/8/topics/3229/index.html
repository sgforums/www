            <div class='col-md body'>I have to admit that I view fortune telling with a degree of scepticism.<br><br>I feel that the degree of truth and accuracy in the readings is proportional to the amount of faith you have in it. Believing in a prediction that fortells you will become rich will give you confidence when engaging in business. This would go a long way in fufilling that prophecy. Believing in a prediction that says otherwise would have the reverse effect.<br><br>I mean this is how I feel fortune telling works. It plays on the mind and sub consciounsly translates to reality. If I were to predict that you would become rich and all you do is sit on your stool in front of your house and wait for that to happen, then chances are the event will not materialize at all, except maby by fluke chances (say, a bank checque of $10m addressed to nobody happens to flutter with the wind to your stool)! Ultimately your action is the mechanism that drives the event, not the prediction.<br><br>That is why you may notice fortune telling is often conveyed in a vague and general form. The reason being there is no means for it to be specific. But I may be wrong here, since my only knowledge is ristricted to my casual study of the Tarot Cards. Perhaps better informed people can enlighten me further.<br><br>The future is not for any of us to know, we shape it from our actions today. I believe certain things like life and death are pre-destined, but for other aspects of life, I'm sure that our destiny is pretty much in our own hands.<br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br><br>[This message has been edited by Bravehart (edited 21 February 2000).]</div>

I used it a lot of time to impress people, especailly girls of course.*LOL* It is pretty simple once you get the hang of it. All you need is an analytical mind and some logic. Most poeple have it but are lazy to use it.<br><br>e.g. I see a lady who has a wedding ring on her finger, so when I read her palms I will say that she is married. If I know that she is not married, or unlikely, I would say that she is engaged. Or a student who wears gold ring and jewellery, I can then say that her family is quite well to do. If she has a nice tanned figure, then I can presume that she have an active lifestyle, so I can say that she is a sporty woman. e.t.c....<br><br>Well, it is just a matter of logic I suppose, but you marvel at how many people fall for it. As for me, when I was young my aunt brought me to a fortune teller who says that I am born intelligent and will bring frotune to my family. *laffs* So far, I dun see any truth in that yet. *LOL*<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, I must say that things like fortune telling, while will not affect your life 100%, will(I believe) still affect you to a certain extent.<br><br>There is an old chinese saying "Yi1 Ming4, Er4 Yun4, San1 Feng1 Shui3", meaning the first thing that counts is your life(when you're born), second is Luck, and third is Feng Shui(do you call it geomancy?).<br><br>I remember my chinese teacher in secondary school once told us something, i.e. Feng Shui is a science that even the westerners cannot comprehend. If you look at it, many westerners actually believe in Feng Shui and engage the masters to arrange their office layout, etc.<br><br>Don't try to say that Fortune Telling is different from Feng Shui, cos they're inter-linked. Your life(when you're born) will actually affect how the feng shui masters arrange your home layout, etc.<br><br>Even though I dun really care about using feng shui to make my life better, I certainly do believe it is something that is very real.<br><br>Things like Jin1(Gold), Mu4(Wood), Shui3(water), Huo3(Fire), Tu3(dunno does it mean Land or soil) are actually closely linked to our daily life, and cannot written off by human's ignorance. Sorry to use this word, but we are really ignorance not to know things that are so closely linked to our life.<br><br>Windjammer, you said you've been taught some black magic, care to elaborate further how were you taught, and in which type of black magic? Really interested to hear your story.<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming? Like asif I care.....<br><br></div>
