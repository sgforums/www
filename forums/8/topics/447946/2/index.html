              <p>Ahh, that one is tough to explain. Basically, Singapore is too vulnerable to foreign intervention. This can be the case in both economics and society. SG is not independant from the outside world, unlike the only two successful Asian countries IMHO ; Japan and South Korea. Singaporeans are too globalized to build a unique nation. This doesn't have to be a bad thing. Uniqueness is a bonus after all. Just my 2 cents. </p>

              <p>I never said Singaporeans spend 15 hours a day working. I was implying that people from Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan DO. Not Singapore. At least, not EVERYONE in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the main reason why the Ang Mohs are suffering from financial crisis is their flawed sense of racial security, society and lack of commitment in work ethics. They don't work more than 10 hours a day, stay at home and play too much video games/ watch TV. Just my observations. The consequences are quite obvious today, of course. Too late for them now, Europe is half- dead and America is going to soon, in economic terms of course.</p>
              <p>Except Germany. Those guys are the only ones who got it right. </p>

              <p><em>"Longer term, the report said that China's Yuan could take on an ever-increasing role in the international monetary system. This could help resolve massive imbalances that have Beijing holding the largest stock of foreign exchange reserves while the country also serves as the world's largest exporter. Changes undertaken by Chinese officials to modernize their country's financial systems “are beginning to have an effect in laying the foundation for the Yuan taking on a more important global role.”</em></p>
              <p>The Yuan is not fully convertible at the moment - take a period of time for currency trading infrastructures - institutions, regulations and legislations going thru the rigor and falling into place. </p>
              <p>If the Yuan is fully convertible - will be subjected to currency attack and speculation. China doesn't has hard reserved as a security-of-last-resort. US has. Despite all the woos and naysayers and despite US mismanagement of its economy, north America has the world largest deposit of oil - and it real size and deposit has not been fully determined yet.</p>
              <p>Nothing is certain of the future now. But it is really hard to imagine the Yuan as a future reserved currency. Also, not India's currency where the only 'real' asset is its billion size human.</p>

              <p>You are somewhat right.</p>
              <p>However, the saying that the Ang Mohs are SMARTER than Asians is not true. Western- educated Asians who grow up in Europe and America are JUST as smart, if not smarter than the white people. The same goes for the other races.</p>
              <p>The problem is our Asian culture and society. Asian culture and society is flawed in many aspects. Us Asians seldom take the initiave to innovate. However, we make up in other areas, such as hard work and dedication, as you mentioned above.</p>
              <p>Anyway, my point is that this isn't a racial thing. It's a social and cultural one. There is no superior race, only superior culture and society. In that context, Western culture and society is superior to Asian culture and society in certain aspects, but inferior in others, and vice- versa. </p>
