            <div class='col-md body'>Oh TS, don't forget you are in school because your parents want you to be in, not say teach you bad, no backbone, but if your DM guai lan you can simply say "Sir/Mdm, I do not even allow my parents to cut my hair. What more you? If you wish to proceed further, I respectfully suggest that you call up my Mom/Dad at this  and if they give the go ahead, you may do it." But of course, make sure your parents supportive lah.<br><br>Btw, TS...in case you have trouble with getting to school late and your DM/OM confiscate your I/C to ensure you go for detention class right, you can simply tell him that in National Registration Act, Chapter 201, Section 2, Part C that: Any person who without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, knowingly obtains or is in possession of or makes use of a forged identity card or an identity card other than his own;  shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to both.<br><br>That will certainly shake them up alittle.</div>

Was notorious for making those guai lan teachers like the DM paiseh infront of other students in a civil manner which she can't do anything about. There's a saying...Hate the game, not the player. So instead of getting pissed off with her, exploit the flaws of the system and use them to your advantage. Every loophole is a place for you to dive in and emerge.</div>
