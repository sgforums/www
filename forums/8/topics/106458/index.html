            <div class='col-md body'>She sits at the window watching the fog as it rolls over the landscape. Her thoughts are as thick as the air. Always, always it seems, it is him she is thinking of.<br>Her mind wanders aimlessly over the past few months. She pulls lint balls mindlessly from the sofa cushion and then stretches her legs out before her. His eyes. Oh his eyes that have such a sparkle and a gleam. She smiles.<br>Even in the lonely moments when he is not present she feels him. It's as if he is a part of her and she takes comfort in knowing that he will soon be home. In her arms, with in her sight and she will know the sound of his laughter, the feel of his touch that makes her skin tingle, the warmth of his embrace and the firey passion of his kisses as they settle down for the night. Again, she smiles.<br>It wasn't very long ago when she was trying to imagine life without him. Events had kept them apart. She had gone about her days wearing a mask to disguise her true feelings of loss and despair. Nothing made sense to her in those hours and minutes without him. Try as she might she could not forget about him. She felt him in the air, saw him in the blue of the sky, heard him in every song that played on the radio, cried through each love story that spoke of what might have been. Understanding eluded her as the feeling of something missing could not be fulfilled with in her.<br>Until one day there came a knock at her door and when she opened it he was standing there looking for all the world like a man coming home. In that moment she knew what had been missing. She knew with a sudden clarity that this was her destiny. This man with whom her heart had claimed months before was what was missing! It mattered not where he had been for he was here now and she knew it was fate that had brought him to her door.<br>They talked for several hours that day. He was still the most handsome man she had ever seen and when he was ready to leave he took her face in to his hands and placed the softest kiss upon her lips. It became the beginning of what was meant to be and as her mind replayed the moment he became hers she heard the soft crunching of his tires in the gravel drive. The sound of his truck door opening and then closing. Soon his key would turn in the lock and with in moments his face would appear in the door. She was awash with anticipation as she sighed a deep sigh of contentment and pure joy!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Love,<br>you must be careful with what you say. Do you realize that I live on your every word? Do you not know that your quietest whisper can force a monsoon upon my heart? You mustnÂ’t tell me these things, misleading my heart with the faintest of sighs. Do you know that your presence aches me? Your lips, an undeniable treasure which you flaunt with such malice. Be careful what you say to me; be careful of the glances you pass, tossing away like tissue paper. Love, you must tip toe when you are near me, as each foot step crosses my soul.<br><br>Desire has left me with a broken back. Desire has left me nothing in your terrible sun. If you told me to never lie to you ever (even about the smallest thing), I would never lie to you ever (even about the smallest thing). If you told me to adore you, IÂ’d never turn my back upon you at night before slumber. Not because you told me to keep vigil, but because I was eagerly waiting for you to ask. Love sleeping as a silent third between the two of us.<br><br>You must understand the gravity of how I feel. How IÂ’m torn apart at the idea of you. How I wish my body and soul were mine, and not yours. How I wish I never met you. Not because of anything born of ill will, but for what can never be. How my greatest passion is simply ignored, the winter of a soul that simply doesnÂ’t know (or care). Or in layspeak, not enough.<br><br>Love, I wish we never met. I wish to reclaim some dignity, as opposed to simply throwing myself at you. Carried by a hopeless heart that fuels this wicked dance. A heart that believes love can bring life to anything. A heart that stabs me every time I think about you. A heart that abandons all rational to live in some dream-film where happily ever after happens, even though it never does in this flat lined reality. A heart that kicks me in the ass for trying, or caring, or damn near anything. A heart I want no part of.<br><br>Here's a big middle finger for the idea of love. Cheers.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dearest Beloved...<br>Here I am from Rome writing you and wish you<br>were here . Words that I write would be so<br>beautiful if you could hear them and I could see<br>your beautiful blue ocean eyes. I could see the<br>enchanting smile on your lips.<br>I threw so many coins in the wish fountain to<br>just to remember you as you were .<br>It hurts me so much that unintentionally I said<br>something or did something that now I feel<br>myself so far exiled from your love ..How can I<br>write my heart from my blood when you are not<br>even there .<br>Tell me mon cher how can I make the World to<br>rotate back to our beautiful years when you and<br>me were just us , far from the cruel bitter days<br>of today when I long for you but donÂ’t know if<br>there is someone who can even read my pain<br>feel my tears or hear my love.<br>I am walking in the beautiful streets of Rome<br>and looking at the street cafe remembering<br>when you were with me and we had the time<br>stalled in eternity. Your smile was like a million<br>stars in the sky your touch was warmest night<br>in the coldest winter of Siberia. Your Kiss was<br>the best cognac in Georgia the Caucasian bliss.<br>I still wish if I could see you and never let you<br>go. Is there anything priceless then your hold.<br>Is there any other way to let you know that<br>every breath I have still carries your glow. I feel<br>your shadows beside me but my bedside is<br>always empty as if Roses are gone from the<br>garden , butterflies cry in your passion. Why I<br>feel I am dead in this millions city of hope.<br>I visited Vatican and thought I will feel Him<br>there His presence but I didnÂ’t feel you. your<br>touch. My heart is barren ..my blood is cold..<br>I remember when we walked in Venice you said<br>there will be a day when you will be in my heart<br>for ever to remember. As if we were walking in<br>the clouds ... I miss those days ...<br>Another Sun goes to the ocean but I donÂ’t feel<br>any warmth in my soul .. my dreams are just<br>like a desert .<br>Tomorrow when I go to Florence I will see if the<br>vineyard still has the tree where we engraved<br>our names. I will try to find our spirit if its still<br>there..<br>with all my love...<br></div>
