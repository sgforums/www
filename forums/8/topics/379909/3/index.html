              <p>Teleportation requires to get ALL the information need to reconstruct a person from material particles (atoms) so the that some machine at far away corner of the universe can make a duplicate of the person.  But hte information is so massive (in disc stacking one by one would cover a distance from here to the centre of the Galaxy - according th what I read in SCIAM) that it will take very^2 long time to be transmitted all the bits and bytes.  Also, information needs a carrying medium, ie matter. so here we hit the speed bump again.</p>
              <p>Anyway this little rock in the what we call solar system is big enough for most of us to spend the life time sighseeing; and the solo star we see everyday above in the sky is reliable enough to last at least until our great......grand children.  So unless we hominoid do something stupid, we are quite okay here and now.</p>

              <p>the thing is that they always see it as space/time. which means space n time are intertwined. so by the simple act of moving through an amount of space, you are time travelling. i know it's confusing. let's take an fictitious example.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1st Jan 1229, 10 AM: You're in Singapore, the only form of transport is by your own two feet (walking). It takes you 5 days to trek from Pasir Ris to Joo Koon and you reach Joo Koon on 6th Jan 1229, 10 AM. While at Joo Koon, you see that a several animals are dead and decomposing on the ground. They've probably been dead for about 4 to 5 days. You have no idea why they died.</p>
              <p>Now add some technology like roads and cars and etc and we repeat the scenario.</p>
              <p>1st Jan 1229, 10 AM: You're in Singapore, and you have a direct expressway to Joo Koon. You drive there, taking 1 hour. Upon reaching there at 11AM, you see healthy living animals eating grass. At 11:30 AM, a natural disaster occurs in the form of an unstable underground natural gas source exploding and shooting up, poisoning all the animals. You rush back to Pasir Ris and reach there at 12:30 PM, informing the village that the animals are going to die and everyone chiongs to Joo Koon in ferraris by 1:30 PM and you save the animals because you technically time travelled.</p>
              <p>Now we go further, the theory is such that what happens if you go EVEN faster? faster than light? Some scientists basically think that you'd reach Joo Koon before 10 AM, before you even depart. o.0</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Now on a larger scale, light from the Sun takes 8 mins to reach the Earth. If the Sun disappeared RIGHT NOW, you'd only find out 8 mins later. Assuming the Sun is Joo Koon and Earth is Pasir Ris, if you could travel faster than light or teleport (time taken=zero), you would be able to go to the Sun, see it disappear, and come back to Earth and tell everybody: OMG I just saw the future, the Sun is going to disappear! and 8 mins later, the Sun really disappears. Technically also considered time travelling. Therefore, Space/Time is intertwined. omg i write so long.</p>

              <p>hmm, the LHC probably has a higher chance of creating a black
              hole than travelling through time.</p>
              <p>although BOTH possibilities are rather remote.</p>
              <p>anyway, did anyone watch the universe on history channel /
              history hd channel?</p>
              <p>there is a scientist who claims he created a time machine, but
              the limitations so far is that he can only transport one photon (i
              think) of light, and although he claims it can go backwards in
              time, it can only go back to the time when the machine was first
              switched on. so if u switch the machine on at 1pm today and leave
              it on until tomorrow, u can go back in time to yesterday (or at
              least that one photon of light can).</p>
              <p>I'm skeptical about his claims but it does sound plausible after
              he explains how he does it.</p>
              <p>regardless, teleportation is about moving through space in
              time=zero, so yes, teleportation is time travelling.</p>
              <p>i do hope LHC provides some great answers to all our stupid
              questions...</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>FYI. the black hole created by the LHC will be so minute in energy, that it'll disappear in about the same time that it forms. (less than a second)- and it hardly has any energy to light a bulb.</p>
              <p>No. If you study on physics, you'll know that at a quantum level, physicists propose the idea of parallel worlds. and recently the superstring/string theory further explains this. bout how we live in multiverse, have 11 dimensions, and about the effects of time travel.</p>
              <p>*Btw, a time machine requires the energy of a supernova. which is really impossible i think for the next century +.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No.. LHC wont really provide an answer towards time travel/teleportation.</p>
              <p>Its main purpose is to further explore subatomic particles smaller than quarks and leptons, and to extend the table of the standard model of matter.(and also in hope of understanding the fundamental particles of the birth of the universe).</p>

              <p>and there is such a thing as PARALLEL universes. so if you were

              <p>it wont be the LKY of your universe, although they are both of

              <p>this time travel and black hole very interesting concept but most of it is so cheem i cannot understand.</p>
              <p>i always wonder what happens if we go into black hole.....will be be stuck in nothingness forever or will be warped to some dimension? also, i think parallel universes / alternate realities do exist, just that it's beyond us.</p>

              <p>Proven in math is not the same as it is physically real.  Maths is an idealised construct to study the physical world. Proven only means that it is consistent with the existing theory. </p><p>An example is that maths has proved that it is possible to divide a sphere in to two with each half exactly equal to the original sphere, ie, double the mass of the sphere. But we all know it is impossible physically.</p>
