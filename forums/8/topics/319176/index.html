              <p>Peeps crazy on internet shopping (international), I think  you would have already heard but for those uninitiated, here's a shot....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://blog.statcounter.com/?p=88">http://blog.statcounter.com/?p=88</a></p>
              <p>Excerpt from Statcounter's blog:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>The Issue</strong><br>We are having ongoing, critical problems with 
              Paypal.</p>
              <p>In view of the complete lack of assistance from Paypal in this regard, we 
              have decided that we have no option but to inform <strong>you</strong>, our 
              members, about the facts of the situation. This will allow you to make an 
              informed decision about whether to use (or whether to continue to use) Paypal.</p>
              <p>Please note that these problems may arise <em>not only </em>in relation to 
              payments made to StatCounter but in relation to ANY Paypal payments that you 
              make. We hope that this post will equip you with the information necessary to 
              make sure that YOU do not become another victim of this ongoing Paypal saga.</p>
              <p><strong>The Problems</strong><br>On 15 May Paypal performed a site update - 
              <a href="http://www.paypaldeveloper.com/pdn/blog/article?blog.id=mts_updates&amp;message.id=205#M205">this 
              is confirmed by Paypal here</a>.</p>
              <p>After this date numerous problems were reported across the globe:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>The Paypal Handling Cart feature completely broke down - <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>see update below</em></span> </li>
              <li>Cross border payments could not be made as the drop down country list did 
              not work - <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>see update below</em></span> </li>
              <li>Customers have been flooded with hundreds of duplicate subscription emails 
              from Paypal - <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>see update below</em></span> </li>
              <li>Payments from Paypal are no longer associated with the relevant 
              subscriptions - <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>see update below</em></span> </li>
              <li>Some customers have been and are being <strong>DOUBLE BILLED</strong> by 
              Paypal </li>
              <li>Merchants have not been receiving instant payment notifications or failure 
              notifications </li>
              <li>Merchants/customers are unable to cancel subscriptions - <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>see update below</em></span> </li>
              </ul>
              <p>The main problem that we have with Paypal is NOT the list of issues above - 
              we all know that errors happen - <strong>we are absolutely furious at the 
              complete lack of acknowledgement or assistance from Paypal </strong>in relation 
              to these matters.</p>
              <p>At StatCounter we have tried phoning, emailing, posting on the Paypal forums… 
              Many of our contacts are ignored, but even when we do get an answer all we are 
              told is that <em>“Upon review of your account, unfortunately we do not have a 
              time frame for a resolution to your issue we are currently actively 
              investigating your issue with subscriptions.”</em> You can see our posts in the 
              Paypal forums <a href="http://www.paypaldeveloper.com/pdn/board/message?board.id=prouk&amp;message.id=1372#M1372">here </a>and <a href="http://www.paypaldeveloper.com/pdn/board/message?board.id=prouk&amp;message.id=1375#M1375">here</a>.</p>
              <p>It appears that all of these problems are the result of the update made by 
              Paypal on 15 May. Typically, any software upgrades can be “rolled back” if they 
              are found to be flawed. Paypal’s inability (unwillingness?) to do this does not 
              bode well.</p>
              <p><strong>What does this mean for me as a StatCounter Paypal 
              Subscriber?</strong><br>Unfortunately, we will be unable to issue invoices to 
              many of our customers who pay us via Paypal until such time as the above issues 
              are resolved. This is because the “payment file” provided by Paypal and from 
              which invoices are generated is incomplete.</p>
              <p>There is also a danger that you may be <strong>“double billed”</strong>. 
              Please make sure to check your Paypal account to see if this happens. Although 
              we would be delighted to sort out any double billing for you, in the current 
              climate of confusion we are unsure whether WE are actually receiving the 
              erroneously charged amounts. This means that WE are not currently able to refund 
              any of these overpayments to you. We strongly believe that since this is a 
              Paypal error, Paypal should rectify the situation - and leave us to focus again 
              on our members rather than cleaning up a mess of Paypal’s making. Please do 
              report any double billing to us and we will take action to report each case 
              directly to Paypal.</p>
              <p><strong>Other StatCounter Upgrade Options</strong><br>Please note that you 
              can also make subscription payments to StatCounter using your credit card 
              directly, by cheque or by electonic transfer to our bank.</p>
              <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>Folks - we sincerely regret any problems you 
              are experiencing and assure you that we are doing our best to get all of these 
              issues resolved for you. We strive to offer a high level of customer service and 
              pride ourselves on being responsive to the needs and suggestions of our members. 
              To have our hands “tied” in this way as a result of Paypal’s inaction is 
              frustrating to say the least.</p>
              <p>These problems with Paypal have already cost us thousands of dollars. We 
              continue to expend large amounts of time and resources on these issues - 
              resources which we would much prefer to concentrate on improving the service we 
              provide to you. We would be very grateful for your patience at this time as we 
              wait for Paypal to resolve these issues.</p>
              <p>We would also ask you to be patient with any of our fellow internet merchants 
              experiencing difficulties with Paypal at this time.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>P/S: I must say I used Paypal only once or twice and it went ok. It was about just a few months before the fiasco happened. I do frequent international online shopping and have opted for other more reliable payment methods.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good Luck!</p>
