            <div class='col-md body'>I totally pity you after reading your post. There's just too many laws by the so called "Gentlemen" whom I believe are gay (pun intended) who actually belief that the Woman's Charter is a right for all women. Some sluts just bloody abuse the whole thing and there's not a single thing which can be done. Women wanna be on par with men, wanna be respected. But if you wanna be given the equal opportunities as men, can you stand up to the sexual harrasment and so on which is so present in the male working world? I mean hell, we guys can curse each other and scream obscenities, humilate each other by degrading each other's private parts and still drop the whole subject in a heartbeat without an apology.<br><br>That's why, personally I feel that one day...women will rule the world. Due to the " gentlemen" whom are so hen-pecked by the women in their lives. To me, if you wanna be heard, earn your rights to. You wanna be respected, earn it. Don't just  do it because you know that there's regulation out there protecting you. I seriously hope that you will sue her till she's totally dry and has to spend the rest of her slutty life spreading her legs as a prostitute man.</div>
