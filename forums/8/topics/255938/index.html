            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone... I'm damn furious as I write this.. I swear I'll get to the bottom of this and find the culprit!!!<br><br>This was what happened:<br><br>On 21st of May, Monday, I took a cab at around 0845hrs at Yishun St 11. I flagged down a Trans Cab and the taxi driver stopped and lowered his window. He asked me where I'm going and I said "Serangoon Ave 2".<br><br>He then looked very reluctant and after a few seconds of thinking finally grudgingly said "Oklah oklah...". So I got in. I didn't manage to take note of the taxi number or the driver's name. Then, a few hundred metres down the road at Yishun Ring Road, I told him "Boss, can you stop here for a while? I need to withdraw money from the ATM at Cheers there" and I pointed to him across the road to an ATM that was beside a Cheers store at block 110. It was no more than about 30metres away.<br><br>He agreed and I left my things in the cab, which include some clothing, my digicam, a handphone which was less than a week old, some keys and other stuff. So I rushed over to the ATM and withdrew the money. It all took LESS than a minute but when I turned around, THE ROAD WAS EMPTY!! At first I was shocked and thought he had driven further up to wait for me but the road was REALLY EMPTY!! He had just driven off with ALL MY BELONGINGS!!!<br><br>Imagine my shock and anger!! I immediately called Trans Cab to try to track down the taxi but I remembered that being relatively new, Trans Cab vehicles probably wouldn't be fitted with gps. I made a police report and they are now investigating the matter.. I even called Trans Cab and asked them to broadcast. But which thief would respond and say he took the things??<br><br>Even if he didn't know that there were my things in the back seat, he still SHOULDN'T HAVE DRIVEN OFF!! I lost a lot of important information and contacts in my phone not to mention my photos.. my memories in the digicam!!<br><br>I swear I will track him down. The Police have assigned an IO to the case and I am going to cooperate fully. I will also let this be widely known through the media and will officially complain to TransCab and the LTA. If I am unable to track down my belongings and bring the accursed driver to justice, I swear I better get compensation!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
