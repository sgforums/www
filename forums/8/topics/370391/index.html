              I grad with an Advanced Diploma in Mass Communication from a private school. 
              
              I am eligible for the part-time undergrad courses in UniSIM under the 40% govt. subsidy. 
              
              I would like to pursue a part-time Bachelor's Degree in Human Resource. I am considering that. 
              Cost: Approx. 18k (aft 40% govt subsidy)
              
              On the other hand, I may wanna go to SMa's Murdoch Uni to take a double major - BA in Human Resource with minor in BA in Journalism. 
              Cost: Approx. 26k
              
              I was advised UniSIM degrees are only recognized in Spore and not in other countries. Also, if I'm gonna take my SIM degree and apply for Master's Degree in a foreign uni, they may reject me because they don't recognize it. 
              
              Moreover, if I were to compete in a job application in HR in Spore with someone who has an overseas-accredited (degrees from foreign uni), I will lose out, be it govt. sector or pte. sector. 
              
              I'm at the cross-roads, in a dilemma with these 2 options. Which one should I take?

              hmmm.. facilities doesn't really bother me. 
              
              the subsidy is something which attracts me. another thing is its 'apparent' reputation as Spore's 4th Uni, albeit being private. 
              
              But... 
              
              1. I just wanna know abt the recognition in terms of applying for jobs - in spore (govt. and pte. sector) and in overseas.

              <p>Harvard and Stanford are private world class universities in a short span of time in the US. most preferred private than public uni in US, as the private uni has their own autonomy than the public to plan their curriculum and the way they run their programmes. another factor that the public  uni tend to cater to the masses or population, as compared to the elite and the rich opting for private. this does not apply to singapore though. </p>
              <p>even though it is private and only existed for a few years as compared to murdoch, one is on campus and the other is off campus aka distance learning. facilities such as classroom, library, admin office are important considerations to consider as well.</p>

              <p><br>I think the word ''recognised" is a misnomer here. <br><br>Even NUS degree can also not be "recognised" by MOE. For example, if you study Architecture, it is not rec by MOE. Logical, mah. What Archi got to do with teaching.<br><br>I think MOE will not discriminate one, base on which Uni he graduate but base on the things he study, having relevance to the teaching careers.<br><br>I also think you as a person in totality - your other archievement, skill , experience, drive etc will will determin their choice of hiring.   </p>
