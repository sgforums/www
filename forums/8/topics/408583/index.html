              <p>Actually I am in the same situation as you. <br><br>Have been unemployed for two months ever since graduation, with a SIM GE Degree.<br>But you might have missed out a point, the job market still isnt that good. <br><br>I have heard that graduates from SMU, NTU and NUS also take approximately 6-9 months to find a job these days... <br><br>If you have looked through Saturday's RECRUIT section, you would have noticed most jobs are GLCs or Civil Service that is doing the hiring. Actually, I have tried applying some of the jobs.... send like 30-40 resumes to both private and civil service... but only got one interview... which I suppose I didnt get into the job .... no reply from them ever since.... <br><br>Fret not, you have an equal chance.... just like any Singaporean graduate. <br><br>FYI, one of my friends told me that a local graduate has known PRC graduates from the local universities offering free trial work for 1 -3 months.... probably the asking salary to get into the job market for graduates now is FREE LABOUR for 1 - 3 months.</p>

              <p><br>You're wrong. The Government did not create this distortion in our social and mental behaviour.</p>
              <p>The fact that not all Singaporeans are displaying such poor social and mental behaviour is a good evidence that family background and upbringing are responsible for instilling this social and mental distortion in most affected Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>However, I agree that it is extremely easy to shift the blame towards the government because Singaporeans are just not ready to look at themselves and accept any form of faults, errors, wrong-doings as their own credit. Singaporeans are only ready to claim success as their own achievement but not their own failures. This is the current weak mindset of the Singaporean society.</p>
              <p>To prove me wrong, go and calculate how many Singaporeans are able to accept and claim failures as swiftly as they are to claim success as their own? You may use only the people you have known or came across to judge whether my comments were right or wrong.</p>
              <p>Truly we are living in a population of weak individuals. </p>

              <p><br>You're wrong. The Government did not create this distortion in our social and mental behaviour.</p>
              <p>The fact that not all Singaporeans are displaying such poor social and mental behaviour is a good evidence that family background and upbringing are responsible for instilling this social and mental distortion in most affected Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>However, I agree that it is extremely easy to shift the blame towards the government because Singaporeans are just not ready to look at themselves and accept any form of faults, errors, wrong-doings as their own credit. Singaporeans are only ready to claim success as their own achievement but not their own failures. This is the current weak mindset of the Singaporean society.</p>
              <p>To prove me wrong, go and calculate how many Singaporeans are able to accept and claim failures as swiftly as they are to claim success as their own? You may use only the people you have known or came across to judge whether my comments were right or wrong.</p>
