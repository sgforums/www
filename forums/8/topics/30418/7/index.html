It really makes me sick in the gut to see how men can really lower themselves to such low levels.  No one was telling them to be a patriot nor to go some Third World country to do a 'cleaning' job.  Geez...<br><br>Y'know, when I went Down Under for my studies, I remember this one Dickus Headus who was telling me how proud and glad he was to have escaped NS, how much he hated it and how sad he felt for those who couldn't share his so-called freedom.  After telling him what I did in the army and after a few 'oooohs' and 'aaaahs', he asked me what I was doing in Australia.  Being really dissed at him, I told him straight in the face that I was sent there by the government to look for people like him.  My job was to bring him back tied like a pig, screaming if I have to, but bring him back.  You should have seen how pale his face became 'cause I would have really done it if the job was on.<br><br>So back to people like hateNS and Dickus Headus in my anedote, my ol' man passed this quote to me in my wee days.  It's good to die for your country, it's better to have a country to die for.  Now, no one is asking you to go jump in the lake for no Tom's Dick who's Harry.  You are a citizen so do your part.

Of course, let's not forget the countless hours under the sun nor the weight of the person we had to carry on our shoulders and running God knows how many miles.<br><br>What I learnt from serving NS was being able to appreciate the simple things in life.  Someone mentioned about NS having low pay.  But I'd have to say I appreciated the fact that I was being given something rather than nothing.  The poor living conditions in the field made me appreciate my bed at home or in the barracks.  The poor food I was given both in the cookhouse and the field made me appreciate the fine food I get as a civilian.  What I remember most was how that little piece of chocolate was such a treat.<br><br>Today, after having gone through all that, I know that if things don't work out, I can easily switch to the times when simple food was fine dining.  When a canvas sheet is adequate as a roof over my head.  Mate, the list goes on and on.<br><br>NS is just like university today if you asked me.  For most of us, it's not what you learnt in uni that matters these days.  It's the tools that you manage to gain that matters.  Of course, what you study does matter what job you will get, but what about general degrees such as history and politics?  People who did those courses have gained researching tools, methods of analysis, argument and writing skills.  Aren't those skills found in Engineering and Medicine as well?  It's the same with NS.  It prepares you to be a tough civilian able to take on the world.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

I don't like to be commanded and tortured. I don't like the tough training also. Can't take it. How to escape? I dun mind being a clerk but how to? I don't have any health problems.</div></blockquote>Hiya hateNS,<br><br>First you mentioned the above.  Then you mentioned in your lastest posting about not knowing what NS is like.  Sheesh...<br><br>I'll bet my boots that though yo hate being commanded, you'll probably jump at the chance of commanding, right?  Don't we all?  And who likes being tortured?  Hmmm...  You make the armed forces sound like some POW camp.  Tough training?  Hell, even when you go out to work, it's tough so why the double standard.  and even if you became a freakin' clerk during your time in NS, do you think you won't be going through what you said you hate?<br><br>Here's food for thought, mate.  When you ome out of NS, and after getting your degree, your employer WILL be asking what you did in the army.  And believe me, he'll ask you why you were posted there.  NS is an indicator to employers your attitude to working in a team, your ability to handle situations, and even your coolness under stress.  From your very first posting, to me, you definitely don't work well in a team, have a poor attitude, won't take instructions well, and won't go far.  Would you like that impression to continue?  Look beyond that nose of yours, mate.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh come on. Every guy in Sgp felt that way when he's about to enter NS. Don't chicken out. No one wants to be commanded or tortured. Believe me I know what's torture. I've been through the POW training.<br><br>Though I do grouch about it and still feel that NS was a waste of my time, I do firmly believe that it is also a test of character. Anyone who escapes from NS in my opinion is a loser. And if I'm an employee some day, I'll definitely not employ anyone who has not done NS. The tougher the training that you got in NS, the more disciplined and mature you are.<br><br>Besides, there are perks to NS. My friend who was a ship cleaner for NS recently went sailing to Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Shanghai.<br><br>If you still really don't want to server NS, there's a legal way. You just need to pay $10k deposit and say that you're furthering your studies. The money will be confiscated if you do not show up for NS</div>
