            <div class='col-md body'>Happen to know a gal and got her contact number. Has been calling her almost once a week. However, the converstion is always short because, occasionally, she told me she was busy at the moment, when ask whether I catch her at a convenient time.<br>Me even once didn't call her for 3 weeks, send an SMS to say that I would not bother her anymore. Then she replied she would be free next few weeks.<br>Maybe she really busy, but if interested to chat with me, dun think she would reveal that, unless she is playing hard to get or just shy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Sometimes, when she said busy, me so siang until ask her, whether I can REALLY call her next time. Then she said can, and she is REALLY busy at the moment!!<br>Guys got these experience or not? Gals got play this type of thing to guys or not, even you like the guy??<br><br>1) What should you do when the gal is actually shy?<br>2) If worst come to worst, instead of guessing what the gal's mind is, would any guy boldly ask the gal what is in her mind. Would it piss her off and make matter worse?? Feel like asking her whether she really wants me to call her. Really dun mind if she say NO, at least i know what i will do next  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>3)One thing, how many guys here would EVENTUALLY stop asking a gal out when she said she is busy on that particular day (say 3 un-successful attemps)??<br><br>Actually, me believe she was busy.. Check her out by calling her and found that she was really not in for the whole day. Can even tell me what she is busy at  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>.................</div>

You aren't the only one in this kind of situation.<br>There's this girl studying overseas who comes back to Spore infrequently.<br>In the past 3 years I've seen her 3 times, - each time 1 yr apart (talk about delayed gratification).<br>Everytime I arrange to meet with her she calls up shortly before appointed time to say she has to leave early, family stuff etc...<br>One time she quite flatly refused to see me. Thought it was time to call it quits.<br>Then this year I get a mail and she asks if I want to meet up. Of course I say yes.<br>But then she pulls the "I have to leave early" stunt again ! What the heck...it wuz her idea to meet right ?<br>Girls are absolutely confusing. Sometimes you just don't know what is going on.<br>Anyway she left yesterday so I guess I will have to wait 1 more year to further unravel the mystery of what is going on in that girl's head... arrgh<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if it's of any help, from my point of view, if a guy calls me and i'm always not free or busy, he can save his time and call other gals liao. i'm simply not interested, not even being a friend, much less a boyfriend. that said, it does not necessary means that if a gal is willing to chat with you for hours on the phone that she's interested in you as a boyfriend, it could be for the simple reason that she enjoys your company. duh! i'm very talkative in real life, some of you must have figured that out from the length of my posts.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
