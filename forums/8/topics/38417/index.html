MOST rich guys at 21 are because they have rich parents. a guy having rich parents does not mean a well-off future for himself.<br><br>and the icing on this cake is when u said guys are more superficial since they only look for a pretty face and good figure. i guess guys do when they are looking for an ornament by their side. you would be surprised wat a man looks for in a wife, rather than an ornament. care to GUESS what a REAL man would look for in a wife?<br><br>let me mention briefly about this "criteria" thing. u know, this "list" that pple make up to define their perfect partner. it's defined by the logical brain, "my perfect guy would be able to support me sufficiently, be humourous, sensitive, caring, loving, etc etc" but don't we all agree LOVE is an emotion that comes from the heart, and is, by large, undefined? how then, can the brain define wat the heart wants?<br><br>i guess it really depends on the age (or rather maturity level) of a person. at 18, yeah i'd like to have heaps of money from my parents to buy the world for my gf, while she just has to look pretty and let my frens swoon at the sight of her.<br><br>i don't believe a REAL man would be thinking that way when he's 30, do u? if a man at 30 treats u that way (buys you everything, but treats u like an ornament), would u marry him?<br><br>i'm sorree if this post is a little scattered, i got distracted SO MANY times while writing this..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
