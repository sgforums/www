            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a sensitive guy. Not the kind who's sensitive to my girlfriend's needs. But the uglier kind, being sensitive about what ppl say or do. Not so much that I feel hurt or something, but rather, taking things very seriously. Taking every little details to heart.<br><br>Not all guys are like that.....I've heard that it's usually gals then like that.<br><br>It's not good for a guy to be like that, I think. I scared become weirdo. And frens will go,"Wah piang, how come you think until like that? Like that also bother...."<br><br>So, guys and gals, whether you are like me or not, any solution how to get out of this annoying and destructive behaviour?</div>

When you find that you are going to be too sensitive, focus on doing other things to distract yourself...<br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take. If you<br>think  something will make you happy, go for it. Remember that we pass this way only  once.<br>Bottomline :<br>Time don't wait.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hymen:<br><br>taken from Conversations with God Book 2<br><br><blockquote><br>You are not angry when you don't get what you want, because your wanting it was simply a preference, not a necessity. You therefore have no fear associated with the possibility of not getting it. Hence, no anger.<br><br>You are not angry when u see others doing what you don't want them to do, because you don't need them to do or not do any particular thing. Hence, no anger.<br><br>You are not angry when someone is unkind, because you have no need for them to be kind. You have no anger when someone is unloving because you have no need for them to love you. You have no anger when someone is cruel, or hurtful, or seeks to damage you, for you have no need for them to behave any other way, and you are clear that you cannot be damaged.<br><br>You do not even have anger should someone seek to take your life, because you do not fear death.<br><br>When fear is taken from you, all else can be taken from you and you will not be angry.<br>You know inwardly, intuitively, that everything you've created can be created again, or-more importantly-that doesn't matter.<br><br>When you find Inner Peace, neither the presence nor the absence of any person, place or thing, condition, circumstance, or situation can be the Creator of you state of mind or the cause of your experience of being.<br><br>This does not mean that you reject all things of the body. Far from it. You experience being fully in your body and the delight of that, as you never have before.<br><br>Yet your involvement with things of the body will be voluntary, not mandatory. You will experience bodily sensations because you choose to, not because you are required to in order to feel happy or to justify sadness.<br>This one simple change-seeking and finding peace within-could, were it undertaken by everyone, end all wars, eliminate conflict, prevent injustice, and bring the world to everlasting peace.<br><br>There is no other formulae necessary, or possible. World peace is a personal thing! What is needed is not a change of circumstances, but a change of consciousness.<br></blockquote></div>

Can you convince me?<br></blockquote>erm, I try my best to explain.<br><br>The author was saying by not having expectations, and to be in the moment of whatever u are doing.<br><br>U dun get angry because u dun expect someone to do things or not do things. U change ur consciousness to a much higher level.<br><br>Erm, I'm pretty bad at explaining things here, but because I read from the start, I sort of get the flow what the author is trying to say. u try reading it once more.<br><br>[This message has been edited by chch (edited 21 January 2001).]</div>
