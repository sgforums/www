              <p>English is the language of England alone. That means all other
              native English speakers today who are of non English ancestry are
              speaking a "foreign language" . In the United Kingdom, Scotland,
              Wales, Cornwall and Northern Ireland all have their own "ancestor
              languages" but now are almost all dead. They all speak English.</p>
              <p>Lets look at America, an English speaking country.
              According to their govt census in 2000, only 8.7% have English
              ancestry. So basically over 90% of their country are non English
              and are speaking a "foreign language" that their ancestors did not

              <p>Going by the "ancestor language" argument German Americans (15%)
              should speak German, Irish(10.8%) should speak Irish etc.</p>

              <p>Have they all betrayed their roots then? This applies to ALL
              English speaking countries today. About 90% of all

              <p>Yes you are right</p>
              <p>I can even supply more examples from the following countries and expound on them if I have the time:</p>
              <p>India</p>

              <p>If,  Chinese immigrants originally spoke Chinese dialects

              <p>Due to governmental policies, English became the dominant

              <p>English is the ancestral language of England alone. That
              means all other native English speakers today who are of non
              English ancestry are speaking a "foreign language" . In the United
              Kingdom, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall and Northern Ireland all have
              their own "ancestor languages" but now are almost all dead. They
              all speak English.</p>
              <p>In fact, scotland, wales etc were all colonised by England many
              centuries ago as well, that is why they speak English today.</p>
              <p>Lets look at America, an English speaking country.
              According to their govt census in 2000, only 8.7% have English
              ancestry. So basically over 90% of their country are non English
              and are speaking a "foreign language" that their ancestors did not
              speak.</p>
              <p>Going by the "ancestor language" argument German Americans (15%)
              should speak German, Irish(10.8%) should speak Irish etc.</p>

              <p>Have they all betrayed their roots then? This applies to ALL
              English speaking countries today. About 90% of all
              native English speakers today are speaking a different
              language from their ancestors. This is a fact.</p>
              <p>We haven't got round to the second language English speakers
              yet.</p>

              <p>Well, Mandarin is the working language, or main language, in
              China since the era of Qin. It was the language used to unite
              China.</p>
              <p>Of all dialects, that would be the best choice since Chinese
              immigrants can come from any part of China.</p>

              <p>In the era of Qin, there was more than one dialect in the area of Qin.  Qin dynasty's reputation is only to unite the written characters.</p>
              <p>No doubt there was standard language in China all along, but it was never standardized and it is never always the Northern Dialect</p>
              <p>For your info, there was no Mandarin as Official Language in China only until Communist Era.   Mandarin itself is based on the Beijing vernacular dialect which was only elevated to the status of National Language by the government.</p>

              <p>Utimately its just a language for communication. Reason for dialect cause its user lesser, or the government wanted to create a common language among us and the world therefore english (politics involved) . But beware Ts, the day when i dominate the world is the day i will make you speak TTFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU. That is the day when you start to QQ about english and start to asslick about TTFUUUUUUUUUUUUUU.</p>

              <p>I understand your viewpoint, but it's not linked to why the
              refusal to speak Mandarin.</p>
              <p>Using the same argument, speaking English is also "error prone"
              / "can be manipulated".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My main point is still against TS's subtle hint on Mandarin as a
              language of lower IQ, and that English is the way to go, if you
              realised.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
              <p>That still mean it's still the national language, which would explain its choice as logical. It also explains the written characters learned here. As for the other dialects, there isn't any law barring others from speaking it too.</p>

              <p><br>Ha ha you can call me whatever you want. I am no more "Banana" than President Obama (of African Kenyan ancestry), or the 90% of Americans with no English ancestry or the leaders of Singapore, many of whom cannot speak Mandarin well.</p>
              <p>I was educated in English and working in Singapore, I haven't written a word of Chinese for over a decade after leaving school. I speak with a Singaporean accent. In fact, I don't really enjoy Chinese culture much, which is why I tend to lean towards speaking English.</p>
              <p>I pity those who lack self esteem and feel so insecure about using English that they find whatever means to justify their ignorance from deliberately speaking Singlish to muffling their voice etc despite them being educated in English.</p>
              <p>You will be wiping my tables while I will be shaking my legs sitting in my chair. And you can bleach yourself since you like it so much ha ha, I am happy with who I am.</p>

              <p><br>America is leading by a mile. Its economy is 15 trillion. China in number 2 is only 5 trillion I think.</p>
              <p>You throw in the economies of 55 English speaking countries, and of course Singapore, you will see the utility of English.</p>
              <p>Plus all the EU countries and even ASEAN uses English.</p>
              <p>Even in China, the Chinese are paying 20000 yuan just to take part time English courses from Singaporeans and British alike.</p>
              <p>A perfect Beijing accented Chinese fresh grad in Shanghai makes 1500-2000 yuan.</p>
              <p>A Singapore/British fresh grad who chooses to teach English in one of many English schools in Shanghai makes 7000-10000 yuan. In fact, they prefer you not to speak Mandarin at all so their students wont be tempted to use Mandarin with you.</p>
              <p>Mandarin only spoken in 3 countries in the world - Singapore, Taiwan and China.</p>
              <p>And as you can see, even in Taiwan and China, people who are fluent in English easily earn more, muc more.</p>
