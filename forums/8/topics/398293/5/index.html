              <p>But let me ask you....will learning Mandarin kill you? Will it
              render you incapable of speaking another language? Then why not?
              Why not take up a language that would most probably help you in
              future? It's not like Mandarin is a ancient/long forgotten language
              that would not be useful in these times. SO I ask again? Why
              not?</p>
              <p>And I would rather not drag politics into this btw....if not
              this would be a never ending debate.</p>

              <p>Also because he thinks that just being proficient in 1 language is enough...well we'll see...when China really rises up and pwns us all....we'll know who will be wiping tables...</p>
              <p>I'm not just saying this for Mandarin...learning more than one language is practical, common sense and can help you in life...only an idiot with no foresight would think that one language is enough.</p>

              <p><br>Click clock click clock..what is that across my bridge?</p>
              <p>China rises up to USA/EU/JAP or even Taiwan standard of living? Read my other thread "I don't understand the rise of China" here. <a href="/forums/8/topics/398285">http://sgforums.com/forums/8/topics/398285</a></p>
              <p>Not in this lifetime even with the BEST CASE SCENARIO. China will have a big ecnonomy simply because it has 1/4 of the world's people but its GDP per capita will remain very low (African level) for next few decades and its people will be dirt poor still. It is just a pipe dream you are living, in your own world, dreaming up scenarios.</p>
              <p>Even if China becomes the biggest economy in earliest 3 decades time (best case scenario again), it will never overtake the economies of all english speaking countries, hence, the utility of English will still be much higher than Mandarin. The economy of English speaking countries will ALWAYS be AT LEAST 100times that of Mandarin speaking ones.</p>
              <p>Just as it is possible that China will rise, it is also VERY possible China will fall even lower. Another "tian an men" or "great leap forward". Another mass riot, (there are thousands in china yearly) or famine or just political strife since its political system is so unstable.</p>
              <p>Anyway, China has nothing to do with Singapore. Singapore will still remain an English society. You can't speak English? No good jobs, no education, no nothing for you.</p>
              <p>Being proficient in more than one language is good but not neccessary. And why Mandarin? Why not Spanish or Japanese? Japan is the third largest economy and has a lot of yummy technology to learn. Spanish is a useful language that many countries speak.</p>
              <p>I am "elitist" yes. Dont be jealous because you are a loser. You make no sense, Go back under your shell.</p>

              <p>I haven;t met a Malay or Indian friend who can speak fluent Chinese though I have heard of a few around.</p>
              <p>Why do they need to speak Chinese when Singapore is a predominantly English society?</p>
              <p>Out of 7 Singaporean presidents, probably only 2 speak Mandarin. President Nathan, Benjamin Sheares, Yusof Ishak, Devan Nair etc all dont speak Mandarin. Out of 3 prime ministers, 1 does not speak mandarin at all. Two speaks mandarin but very haltingly.</p>
              <p>If you can;t speak English that is your problem. You lose clients. You can't go to school to get an education. You can't work in civil sector. You cant even read the laws of your own country or understand your own government. You are illiterate.</p>
              <p>PS: I never understood why the lowlifes (normally sub o levels kind) call Singaporeans who speak their country's own language Banana. Singaporeans are educated in English from kindergarten to University, wouldn't it be a natural thing to speak English as your native language?</p>
              <p>I think these people have self esteem problems over their illiteracy in English or identity crisis some some sort.</p>
              <p>I don't mind "banana", at least it sounds better than "illiterate low wage worker" or "chinese helicopter".</p>

              <p><br>Click clock click clock..what is that across my bridge?</p>
              <p>China rises up to USA/EU/JAP or even Taiwan standard of living? Read my other thread "I don't understand the rise of China" here. <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/8/topics/398285">http://sgforums.com/forums/8/topics/398285</a></p>
              <p>Not in this lifetime even with the BEST CASE SCENARIO. China will have a big ecnonomy simply because it has 1/4 of the world's people but its GDP per capita will remain very low (African level) for next few decades and its people will be dirt poor still. It is just a pipe dream you are living, in your own world, dreaming up scenarios.</p>
              <p>Even if China becomes the biggest economy in earliest 3 decades time (best case scenario again), it will never overtake the economies of all english speaking countries, hence, the utility of English will still be much higher than Mandarin.</p>
              <p>Just as it is possible that China will rise, it is also VERY possible China will fall even lower. Another "tian an men" or "great leap forward". Another mass riot, (there are thousands in china yearly) or famine or just political strife since its political system is so unstable.</p>
              <p>Anyway, China has nothing to do with Singapore. Singapore will still remain an English society. You can't speak English? No good jobs, no education, no nothing for you.</p>
              <p>Being proficient in more than one language is good but not neccessary. And why Mandarin? Why not Spanish or Japanese? Japan is the third largest economy and has a lot of yummy technology to learn. Spanish is a useful language that many countries speak.</p>
              <p>I am "elitist" yes. Dont be jealous because you are a loser. You make no sense, Go back under your shell.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I haven;t met a Malay or Indian friend who can speak fluent Chinese though I have heard of a few around.</p>
              <p>Why do they need to speak Chinese when Singapore is a predominantly English society?</p>
              <p>Out of 7 Singaporean presidents, probably only 2 speak Mandarin. President Nathan, Benjamin Sheares, Yusof Ishak, Devan Nair etc all dont speak Mandarin. Out of 3 prime ministers, 1 does not speak mandarin at all. Two speaks mandarin but very haltingly.</p>
              <p>If you can;t speak English that is your problem. You lose clients. You can't go to school to get an education. You can't work in civil sector. You cant even read the laws of your own country or understand your own government. You are illiterate.</p>
              <p>PS: I never understood why the lowlifes (normally sub o levels kind) call Singaporeans who speak their country's own language Banana. Singaporeans are educated in English from kindergarten to University, wouldn't it be a natural thing to speak English as your native language?</p>
              <p>I think these people have self esteem problems over their illiteracy in English or identity crisis some some sort.</p>
              <p>I don't mind "banana", at least it sounds better than "illiterate low wage worker" or "chinese helicopter".</p>

              <p>You need more work on your spelling you elitist bastard.</p>
              <p>No wonder you are so against the idea of mastering more than 1 language. Your brains are obviously too weak to even master 1.</p>
              <p>Like I've said before, only an IDIOT would admit to being an elitist asshole. Good luck to you. I hope your life will amount to more than just cleaning toilets.</p>

              <p>Well, TS is comfortable with who he is and what he thinks of things, let him be. Perhaps one day he might feel inadequate because he can only converse in english.</p>
              <p>For me, im comfortable with both mandarin and english, especially in Singapore where many people are bilingual. Sometimes you just naturally speak english to one and mandarin to another. I think its disadvantageous that a person may only converse in only one language, be it in a social environment or working environment.</p>

              <p>you can go on and say,  why not learn 3 language, 4, 5, 6?   it could be possible a person who knows 6 languages could still not be able to communicate with someone else,  no doubt the possibility is greatly reduced</p>

              <p>U sure tt TS is challenging this because of politics?</p>
              <p>I know of some people would would reject Mandarin completely

              <p>And if this is really a political thing...den he shld go to
              speakers' corner instead. However, I highly doubt so. Like he said,

              <p><br>Click clock click clock..what is that across my bridge?</p>
              <p>China rises up to USA/EU/JAP or even Taiwan standard of living? Read my other thread "I don't understand the rise of China" here. <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/8/topics/398285">http://sgforums.com/forums/8/topics/398285</a></p>
              <p>Not in this lifetime even with the BEST CASE SCENARIO. China will have a big ecnonomy simply because it has 1/4 of the world's people but its GDP per capita will remain very low (African level) for next few decades and its people will be dirt poor still. It is just a pipe dream you are living, in your own world, dreaming up scenarios.</p>
              <p>Even if China becomes the biggest economy in earliest 3 decades time (best case scenario again), it will never overtake the economies of all english speaking countries, hence, the utility of English will still be much higher than Mandarin. The economy of English speaking countries will ALWAYS be AT LEAST 100times that of Mandarin speaking ones.</p>
              <p>Just as it is possible that China will rise, it is also VERY possible China will fall even lower. Another "tian an men" or "great leap forward". Another mass riot, (there are thousands in china yearly) or famine or just political strife since its political system is so unstable.</p>
              <p>Anyway, China has nothing to do with Singapore. Singapore will still remain an English society. You can't speak English? No good jobs, no education, no nothing for you.</p>
              <p>Being proficient in more than one language is good but not neccessary. And why Mandarin? Why not Spanish or Japanese? Japan is the third largest economy and has a lot of yummy technology to learn. Spanish is a useful language that many countries speak.</p>
              <p>I am "elitist" yes. Dont be jealous because you are a loser. You make no sense, Go back under your shell.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I haven;t met a Malay or Indian friend who can speak fluent Chinese though I have heard of a few around.</p>
              <p>Why do they need to speak Chinese when Singapore is a predominantly English society?</p>
              <p>Out of 7 Singaporean presidents, probably only 2 speak Mandarin. President Nathan, Benjamin Sheares, Yusof Ishak, Devan Nair etc all dont speak Mandarin. Out of 3 prime ministers, 1 does not speak mandarin at all. Two speaks mandarin but very haltingly.</p>
              <p>If you can;t speak English that is your problem. You lose clients. You can't go to school to get an education. You can't work in civil sector. You cant even read the laws of your own country or understand your own government. You are illiterate.</p>
              <p>PS: I never understood why the lowlifes (normally sub o levels kind) call Singaporeans who speak their country's own language Banana. Singaporeans are educated in English from kindergarten to University, wouldn't it be a natural thing to speak English as your native language?</p>
              <p>I think these people have self esteem problems over their illiteracy in English or identity crisis some some sort.</p>
              <p>I don't mind "banana", at least it sounds better than "illiterate low wage worker" or "chinese helicopter".</p>

              <p>You have forgotten that in your earlier post to my question , you have shown that you cannot read or even understand English<br>by your reply.</p>
              <p>Your IQ score got 50 or not huh ?</p>
              <p>You are still trying to claim that you are superior to others because you can only speak English and you are very proud of it.</p>
              <p>By the way, I can speak fluent English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien, Teochew, Khek and some Malay, Japanese, Korean and Thai.</p>
