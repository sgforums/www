              <p>Likewise the TS seems to think that everything can be seen in English; to heck with Chinese.</p>

              <p>I believe it's the same logic here with the TS. He doesn't see the point of broadening his horizons with a second language, and in the end, he'll be the only one who loses out on everything. </p>

              <p>Chinese is a race. So is Caucasian who are from USA, Britain and Europe. Mandarin, English, Malay and Tamil are languages. Judging from your definition of Scottish speaking scotts, we also have Chinese further divided into Teochew, Cantonese etc. However, the common langauge among Chinese is still Mandarin so are the Caucasians who speaks English in their daily conversion.</p>
              <p>By the way Singaporean is a nationality not a race, language or a root.</p>
