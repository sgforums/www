              <p>I am an English speaking Chinese Singaporean. I have been reading this forum and talking to many Singaporeans (duh) and I just can't understand why some Singaporeans of Chinese ancestry say things such as  "if you can't speak Chinese, you have lost your roots", "English is not our language" etc. </p>
              <p>Let me make some points clear.</p>
              <p>1. I am Singaporean, not Chinese. I have never been to China. My culture is Singaporean not Chinese. Anyone who has been to China will know Singapore culture and Chinese culture are like night and day, totally different. Our laws, medical system, social conventions, dressing, thinking, schools, transport, everything are TOTALLY DIFFERENT.</p>
              <p>2. I, like all Singaporeans, grew up in school with English as our first language. I only use English at work and at home, since Singapore is runs on English. Our laws, newspapers and everything else are all in English.</p>
              <p>I don't understand why under such an environment, some people still reject the use of English and speak Mandarin.</p>
              <p>3. English IS Singapore's language. Some Singaporeans reject English as a "foreign language", the language of the British and Americans etc and say that as "Chinese" we should speak Mandarin, our ancestral language, our "roots". This is just a very bigoted view which is based on ignorance.</p>
              <p>If we subscribe to this "foreign language" argument, every English speaking country in the world except English would be speaking a "foreign language" and have lost their ancestral "roots"!</p>
              <p>If we follow this argument, in Britain, the Welsh should speak Welsh. Scottish should speak Scots, those at Cornwal should speak Cornish. Those in Northern Ireland should speak Irish.</p>
              <p>Ireland should speak Gaelic or Irish, not English, a "foreign" language from England.</p>
              <p>Americans, who are mostly of Irish, Germans, Polish descent would all be speaking a "foreign language". After all, they should speak German, Polish or Irish language, not English! And African Americans should be speaking Afrikaans?</p>
              <p>English is no more a foreign language to Singaporeans than it is to the Americans, Canadians and 80% of British people.</p>
              <p>If Singaporean Chinese should speak Mandarin, then German Americans should all speak German, Irish Americans, Irish, African Americans, Afrikaans etc.. But they like Singaporeans, are not German/Irish/African, the link has long been cut, they are Americans, they speak American English.</p>
              <p>4. I think Singaporeans should be clear that they are Singaporeans not Chinese citizens. Just like African Americans are Americans not Africans. German Americans are Americans not Germans...so on and so forth. </p>
              <p>I say we speak Standard Singapore English proudly with our Singaporean accent. (Mild) Singlish is fun as well, no it is not "bad English" because if you compare it with some British dialects such as "Geordie" or "Scottish English" or even "Welsh English", it is actually easier to understand.</p>
              <p>If a foreigner does not understand my accent or comment that I sound weird, I would tell him he is the one who sounds weird! This is Singapore and this is our accents. If you can't speak with a Singaporean accent, then of course we can't understand you well, don't compain.</p>
              <p>5. Mandarin is not even my ancestral language if you want to be anal about it. Mandarin is the dialect of Beijing and my forefathers were probably from Fujian, though I have some Malay blood in me as well.</p>
              <p>6. Mandarin is useful? If you are dealing with China, yes. But lets not forget that 55 countries worldwide and almost all supranational organs use English.</p>
              <p>The biggest economy in the world, America, uses English. Europeans all speak English as their second language these days. Canadaians, Australians, etc. And without English, you cannot find a good job in Singapore.</p>
              <p>7.  Lets not forget my "forefathers" and probably yours ran away from China and took up Singapore citizenship for a reason. He didn't want to be a Chinese citizen.</p>
              <p>So don't tell me to speak Mandarin (a beijing dialect) in Singapore (an English society).</p>
              <p>If you can't speak English  in Singapore, I suggest you hang your head in shame, for you have truly "lost your roots".</p>

              <p>First and foremost i actually took some time to read that fail story of yours. You dont even deserve for me to look for a cool story bro picture. Yes some of our ancestors originate from china and yes our roots belong to there. If china culture and bla bla bla is different from ours, what makes you think that in london/british/US, our culture is similar to theirs.</p>
              <p>For god's sake, our national language is malay and not english/chinese. Thus i wont elaborate on point 3</p>
              <p>As for the rest of the points, nobody cares if you speak england or china or iraq here. Fact is language, is just a communication medium that we use. For point no.7 , our forefathers escaped from china that time due to world war 2 happening in china. I suggest reading up on your secondary history textbook. And btw, in dialects we mean hokkien/cantonese/teochew , and not chinese which is a language. Lastly china like india is a developing country, we shall observe with open eyes in the future, will it be the ang mos that is rushing to learn chinese or the other way around.</p>
              <p>Once again on your last few sentence, nobody cares what language you speak. Its not our fault that you got butt hurt over these things and decided to QQ here. I speak TTFU's language and i am proud of it</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I am an English speaking Chinese Singaporean. I have been
              reading this forum and talking to many Singaporeans (duh) and I
              just can't understand why some Singaporeans of Chinese ancestry say
              things such as  "if you can't speak Chinese, you have lost
              your roots", "English is not our language" etc. </p>
              <p>Let me make some points clear.</p>
              <p>1. I am Singaporean, not Chinese. I have never been to
              China. My culture is Singaporean not Chinese. Anyone who has
              been to China will know Singapore culture and Chinese culture are
              like night and day, totally different. Our laws, medical system,
              social conventions, dressing, thinking, schools, transport,
              everything are TOTALLY DIFFERENT.</p>
              <p>2. I, like all Singaporeans, grew up in school with English as
              our first language. I only use English at work and at home, since
              Singapore is runs on English. Our laws, newspapers and everything
              else are all in English.</p>
              <p>I don't understand why under such an environment, some people
              still reject the use of English and speak Mandarin.</p>
              <p>3. English IS Singapore's language. Some Singaporeans reject
              English as a "foreign language", the language of the British and
              Americans etc and say that as "Chinese" we should speak Mandarin,
              our ancestral language, our "roots". This is just a very bigoted
              view which is based on ignorance.</p>
              <p>If we subscribe to this "foreign language" argument, every
              English speaking country in the world except English would be
              speaking a "foreign language" and have lost their
              ancestral "roots"!</p>
              <p>If we follow this argument, in Britain, the Welsh should speak
              Welsh. Scottish should speak Scots, those at Cornwal should
              speak Cornish. Those in Northern Ireland should speak
              Irish.</p>
              <p>Ireland should speak Gaelic or Irish, not English, a "foreign"
              language from England.</p>
              <p>Americans, who are mostly of Irish, Germans, Polish
              descent would all be speaking a "foreign language". After all, they
              should speak German, Polish or Irish language, not English!
              And African Americans should be speaking Afrikaans?</p>
              <p>English is no more a foreign language to Singaporeans than it is
              to the Americans, Canadians and 80% of British people.</p>
              <p>If Singaporean Chinese should speak Mandarin, then German
              Americans should all speak German, Irish Americans, Irish, African
              Americans, Afrikaans etc.. But they like Singaporeans, are not
              German/Irish/African, the link has long been cut, they are
              Americans, they speak American English.</p>
              <p>4. I think Singaporeans should be clear that they are
              Singaporeans not Chinese citizens. Just like African Americans are
              Americans not Africans. German Americans are Americans
              not Germans...so on and so forth. </p>
              <p>I say we speak Standard Singapore English proudly with our
              Singaporean accent. (Mild) Singlish is fun as well, no it is not
              "bad English" because if you compare it with some British dialects
              such as "Geordie" or "Scottish English" or even "Welsh English", it
              is actually easier to understand.</p>
              <p>If a foreigner does not understand my accent or comment that I
              sound weird, I would tell him he is the one who sounds weird! This
              is Singapore and this is our accents. If you can't speak with a
              Singaporean accent, then of course we can't understand you well,
              don't compain.</p>
              <p>5. Mandarin is not even my ancestral language if you want to be
              anal about it. Mandarin is the dialect of Beijing and my
              forefathers were probably from Fujian, though I have some Malay
              blood in me as well.</p>
              <p>6. Mandarin is useful? If you are dealing with China, yes. But
              lets not forget that 55 countries worldwide and almost all
              supranational organs use English.</p>
              <p>The biggest economy in the world, America, uses English.
              Europeans all speak English as their second language these days.
              Canadaians, Australians, etc. And without English, you cannot find
              a good job in Singapore.</p>
              <p>7.  Lets not forget my "forefathers" and probably
              yours ran away from China and took up Singapore citizenship
              for a reason. He didn't want to be a Chinese citizen.</p>
              <p>So don't tell me to speak Mandarin (a beijing dialect) in
              Singapore (an English society).</p>
              <p>If you can't speak English  in Singapore, I suggest
              you hang your head in shame, for you have truly "lost your
              roots".</p>

              <p>Mandarin itself, is another dialect, as pointed out by TS already.  It is only elevated to the status of National Language by the government.</p>

Lastly china like india is a developing country, we shall observe with open eyes in the future, will it be the ang mos that is rushing to learn chinese or the other way around.</p>
              <p>Once again on your last few sentence, nobody cares what language you speak. Its not our fault that you got butt hurt over these things and decided to QQ here. I speak TTFU's language and i am proud of it</p>

              <p>Mandarin, Tamil, Malay are all part of Singapore's language. If your argument is to be subscribed, you should learn our national language as well.</p>
              <p><em>True, but I am afraid I can't learn 4 languages, neither do I see the need to do so, so I stick to the predominant one and the one I am best at - English. Which is probably the most useful language by far in Singapore and the world we live in today.</em></p>
              <p><em>Besides, a language brings with it culture as well and I feel more aligned and comfortable with English.</em></p>
              <p>This is Singapore, this is us. Why don't speak Mandarin?</p>
              <p><em> Because I was educated in English? My country's laws are in English? Civil service, working society all run in English? I feel more comfortable and proficient in English?</em></p>
              <p>So what's wrong with speaking Mandarin as second language?</p>
              <p><em> Nothing wrong at all.</em></p>
              <p>Don't worry, we won't tell you to. We will just speak Mandarin among ourselves.</p>
              <p> <em>Glad to hear that. I don't want you to lower my IQ.</em></p>
