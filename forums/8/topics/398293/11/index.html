              <p><br> Ha ha you can call me whatever you want. I am no more "Banana" than
              President Obama (of African Kenyan ancestry), or the 90%
              of Americans with no English ancestry or the leaders of
              Singapore, many of whom cannot speak Mandarin well.</p>
              <p>I was educated in English and working in Singapore, I haven't
              written a word of Chinese for over a decade after leaving school. I
              speak with a Singaporean accent. In fact, I don't really enjoy
              Chinese culture much, which is why I tend to lean towards speaking
              English.</p>
              <p>I pity those who lack self esteem and feel so insecure about
              using English that they find whatever means to justify their
              ignorance from deliberately speaking Singlish to muffling their
              voice etc despite them being educated in English.</p>
              <p>You will be wiping my tables while I will be shaking my legs
              sitting in my chair. And you can bleach yourself since you like it
              so much ha ha, I am happy with who I am.</p>
              <p><br> America is leading by a mile. Its economy is 15 trillion. China in
              number 2 is only 5 trillion I think.</p>
              <p>You throw in the economies of 55 English speaking countries, and
              of course Singapore, you will see the utility of English.</p>
              <p>Plus all the EU countries and even ASEAN uses English.</p>
              <p>Even in China, the Chinese are paying 20000 yuan just to take
              part time English courses from Singaporeans and British alike.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mandarin only spoken in 3 countries in the world - Singapore,
              Taiwan and China.</p>
              <p>And as you can see, even in Taiwan and China, people who are
              fluent in English easily earn more, muc more.</p>

              <p>I am an English speaking Chinese Singaporean. I have been reading this forum and talking to many Singaporeans (duh) and I just can't understand why some Singaporeans of Chinese ancestry say things such as  "if you can't speak Chinese, you have lost your roots", "English is not our language" etc. </p>
              <p>Let me make some points clear.</p>
              <p>1. I am Singaporean, not Chinese. I have never been to China. My culture is Singaporean not Chinese. Anyone who has been to China will know Singapore culture and Chinese culture are like night and day, totally different. Our laws, medical system, social conventions, dressing, thinking, schools, transport, everything are TOTALLY DIFFERENT.</p>
              <p>2. I, like all Singaporeans, grew up in school with English as our first language. I only use English at work and at home, since Singapore is runs on English. Our laws, newspapers and everything else are all in English.</p>
              <p>I don't understand why under such an environment, some people still reject the use of English and speak Mandarin.</p>
              <p>3. English IS Singapore's language. Some Singaporeans reject English as a "foreign language", the language of the British and Americans etc and say that as "Chinese" we should speak Mandarin, our ancestral language, our "roots". This is just a very bigoted view which is based on ignorance.</p>
              <p>If we subscribe to this "foreign language" argument, every English speaking country in the world except English would be speaking a "foreign language" and have lost their ancestral "roots"!</p>
              <p>If we follow this argument, in Britain, the Welsh should speak Welsh. Scottish should speak Scots, those at Cornwal should speak Cornish. Those in Northern Ireland should speak Irish.</p>
              <p>Ireland should speak Gaelic or Irish, not English, a "foreign" language from England.</p>
              <p>Americans, who are mostly of Irish, Germans, Polish descent would all be speaking a "foreign language". After all, they should speak German, Polish or Irish language, not English! And African Americans should be speaking Afrikaans?</p>
              <p>English is no more a foreign language to Singaporeans than it is to the Americans, Canadians and 80% of British people.</p>
              <p>If Singaporean Chinese should speak Mandarin, then German Americans should all speak German, Irish Americans, Irish, African Americans, Afrikaans etc.. But they like Singaporeans, are not German/Irish/African, the link has long been cut, they are Americans, they speak American English.</p>
              <p>4. I think Singaporeans should be clear that they are Singaporeans not Chinese citizens. Just like African Americans are Americans not Africans. German Americans are Americans not Germans...so on and so forth. </p>
              <p>I say we speak Standard Singapore English proudly with our Singaporean accent. (Mild) Singlish is fun as well, no it is not "bad English" because if you compare it with some British dialects such as "Geordie" or "Scottish English" or even "Welsh English", it is actually easier to understand.</p>
              <p>If a foreigner does not understand my accent or comment that I sound weird, I would tell him he is the one who sounds weird! This is Singapore and this is our accents. If you can't speak with a Singaporean accent, then of course we can't understand you well, don't compain.</p>
              <p>5. Mandarin is not even my ancestral language if you want to be anal about it. Mandarin is the dialect of Beijing and my forefathers were probably from Fujian, though I have some Malay blood in me as well.</p>
              <p>6. Mandarin is useful? If you are dealing with China, yes. But lets not forget that 55 countries worldwide and almost all supranational organs use English.</p>
              <p>The biggest economy in the world, America, uses English. Europeans all speak English as their second language these days. Canadaians, Australians, etc. And without English, you cannot find a good job in Singapore.</p>
              <p>7.  Lets not forget my "forefathers" and probably yours ran away from China and took up Singapore citizenship for a reason. He didn't want to be a Chinese citizen.</p>
              <p>So don't tell me to speak Mandarin (a beijing dialect) in Singapore (an English society).</p>
              <p>If you can't speak English  in Singapore, I suggest you hang your head in shame, for you have truly "lost your roots".</p>

              <p>no matter how well you speak in english, in "ang mo's" eyes you are always a chinese. the westeners will never regard you as westener even if you can speak english in their accent. so why be so cheapskate keep wanting to be å�‡æ´‹é¬¼å­� ?</p>
              <p>i have friends who are americans, they told me it is easy to differentiate chinese singaporeans when they are oversea. only chinese singaporeans speak to each other in chinese.</p>
              <p>taiwanese chinese, koreans, japanese, hong kong chinese etc. speak in their own language, they do not speak english to their own people even they can speak english. the only exception is singaporean chinese.</p>
