              <p>Originally posted by: <br>Ranson<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">In Red</span> (No offence - just to differentiate) are my comments<br><br>I am an English speaking Chinese Singaporean. I have been
              reading this forum and talking to many Singaporeans (duh) and I
              just can't understand why some Singaporeans of Chinese ancestry say
              things such as  "if you can't speak Chinese, you have lost
              your roots", "English is not our language" etc. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">OK. This one I let you win. <br></span> <br> Let me make some points clear.</p>
              <p>1. I am Singaporean, not Chinese. I have never been to
              China. My culture is Singaporean not Chinese. Anyone who has
              been to China will know Singapore culture and Chinese culture are
              like night and day, totally different. Our laws, medical system,
              social conventions, dressing, thinking, schools, transport,
              everything are TOTALLY DIFFERENT.<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ok. You win.</span></p>
              <p>2. I, like all Singaporeans, grew up in school with English as
              our first language. I only use English at work and at home, <em><span style="color: #ff0000;">since
              Singapore is runs on English (????)</span></em>. Our laws, newspapers and everything
              else are all in English.</p>
              <p>I don't understand why under such an environment, some people
              still reject the use of English and speak Mandarin.<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">I disagree. we grew up in school with Singlish as our first language.
              You use Singlish at work and at home, since Singapore is runs on
              Singlish (You already confirm you use Singlish, not Singlish). Not
              really. Recent newspapers advertisement also have OLD COW EAT YOUNG
              GRASS. You understand anot?</span></p>
              <p>3. English IS Singapore's language. Some Singaporeans reject
              English as a "foreign language", the language of the British and
              Americans etc and say that as "Chinese" we should speak Mandarin,
              our ancestral language, our "roots". This is just a very bigoted
              view which is based on ignorance.</p>
              <p>If we subscribe to this "foreign language" argument, every
              English speaking country in the world except English would be
              speaking a "foreign language" and have lost their
              ancestral "roots"!</p>
              <p>If we follow this argument, in Britain, the Welsh should speak
              Welsh. Scottish should speak Scots, those at Cornwal should
              speak Cornish. Those in Northern Ireland should speak
              Irish.</p>
              <p>Ireland should speak Gaelic or Irish, not English, a "foreign"
              language from England.</p>
              <p>Americans, who are mostly of Irish, Germans, Polish
              descent would all be speaking a "foreign language". After all, they
              should speak German, Polish or Irish language, not English!
              And African Americans should be speaking Afrikaans?<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes, and Singaporeans should speak Singlish.</span></p>
              <p>English is no more a foreign language to Singaporeans than it is
              to the Americans, Canadians and 80% of British people.</p>
              <p>If Singaporean Chinese should speak Mandarin, then German
              Americans should all speak German, Irish Americans, Irish, African
              Americans, Afrikaans etc.. But they like Singaporeans, are not
              German/Irish/African, the link has long been cut, they are
              Americans, they speak American English.</p>
              <p>4. I think Singaporeans should be clear that they are
              Singaporeans not Chinese citizens. Just like African Americans are
              Americans not Africans. German Americans are Americans
              not Germans...so on and so forth. </p>
              <p>I say we speak Standard Singapore English proudly with our
              Singaporean accent. (Mild) Singlish is fun as well, no it is not
              "bad English" because if you compare it with some British dialects
              such as "Geordie" or "Scottish English" or even "Welsh English", it
              is actually easier to understand.<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thank god you know you speak Singlish! -_-" </span></p>
              <p>If a foreigner does not understand my accent or comment that I
              sound weird, I would tell him he is the one who sounds weird! This
              is Singapore and this is our accents. If you can't speak with a
              Singaporean accent, then of course we can't understand you well,
              don't compain.<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes, and you blame others for not understanding Singlish.</span></p>
              <p>5. Mandarin is not even my ancestral language if you want to be
              anal about it. Mandarin is the dialect of Beijing and my
              forefathers were probably from Fujian, though I have some Malay
              blood in me as well.<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">So, you should speak Singlish.</span></p>
              <p>6. Mandarin is useful? If you are dealing with China, yes. But
              lets not forget that 55 countries worldwide and almost all
              supranational organs use English.</p>
              <p>The biggest economy in the world, America, uses English.
              Europeans all speak English as their second language these days.
              Canadaians, Australians, etc. And without English, you cannot find
              a good job in Singapore.<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Since you are given a chance to master Chinese Language as a foreign language, why not? No need pay extra tuition fees to learn Mandarin. </span><br></p>
              <p>7.  Lets not forget my "forefathers" and probably
              yours ran away from China and took up Singapore citizenship
              for a reason. He didn't want to be a Chinese citizen.</p>
              <p>So don't tell me to speak Mandarin (a beijing dialect) in
              Singapore (an English society).</p>
              <p>If you can't speak English  in Singapore, I suggest
              you hang your head in shame, for you have truly "lost your
              roots".<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nah. Singlish rules. So we should stop speaking anything. Lets start Singlish. </span></p>

              been 
                  ridiculed by your Chinese teacher and your peers? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Got
                   so exasperated with Chinese that you desperately needed to vent 
              your 
                  frustration by making a senseless tirade to make it seemed like - 
              oh, my
                   Chinese is bad but (because I want to save face),  I want it to be 
                  lousy intentionally. Never mind. You can continue trumpeting your 
              own 
                  warped ideologies on this virtual space; any person of some 
              intellect 
                  (not you perhaps) would be able to dismiss your whole chunk of 
              tirade as
                   a whining post by some loser. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I shan't even do a point-by-point refutation because I know you 
              are so devoid of any thought process. Poor thing..</p>
              <p>Swallow
                   this statement down your stinky and grubby throat - your English is
               mediocre at best; coupled
                   with presumably, your wonderful Chinese, I think you'd better STFU 
              lest
                   you corrupt others with your waffle.</p>

              <p>Whats the point of this thread?</p>
              <p>If you (TS) dont want to speak Chinese, then suits yourself. You can speak whatever language you want. Not as if somebody will punish you for it.</p>
              <p>Point is, nobody gives a hoot what language you want to speak as long as the person you speak to understand you.</p>
              <p>Case closed. Any mods can close this pointless thread?</p>
