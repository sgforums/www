              <p>I am an English speaking Chinese Singaporean. I have been reading this forum and talking to many Singaporeans (duh) and I just can't understand why some Singaporeans of Chinese ancestry say things such as  "if you can't speak Chinese, you have lost your roots", "English is not our language" etc. </p>
              <p>Let me make some points clear.</p>
              <p>1. I am Singaporean, not Chinese. I have never been to China. My culture is Singaporean not Chinese. Anyone who has been to China will know Singapore culture and Chinese culture are like night and day, totally different. Our laws, medical system, social conventions, dressing, thinking, schools, transport, everything are TOTALLY DIFFERENT.</p>
              <p>2. I, like all Singaporeans, grew up in school with English as our first language. I only use English at work and at home, since Singapore is runs on English. Our laws, newspapers and everything else are all in English.</p>
              <p>I don't understand why under such an environment, some people still reject the use of English and speak Mandarin.</p>
              <p>3. English IS Singapore's language. Some Singaporeans reject English as a "foreign language", the language of the British and Americans etc and say that as "Chinese" we should speak Mandarin, our ancestral language, our "roots". This is just a very bigoted view which is based on ignorance.</p>
              <p>If we subscribe to this "foreign language" argument, every English speaking country in the world except English would be speaking a "foreign language" and have lost their ancestral "roots"!</p>
              <p>If we follow this argument, in Britain, the Welsh should speak Welsh. Scottish should speak Scots, those at Cornwal should speak Cornish. Those in Northern Ireland should speak Irish.</p>
              <p>Ireland should speak Gaelic or Irish, not English, a "foreign" language from England.</p>
              <p>Americans, who are mostly of Irish, Germans, Polish descent would all be speaking a "foreign language". After all, they should speak German, Polish or Irish language, not English! And African Americans should be speaking Afrikaans?</p>
              <p>English is no more a foreign language to Singaporeans than it is to the Americans, Canadians and 80% of British people.</p>
              <p>If Singaporean Chinese should speak Mandarin, then German Americans should all speak German, Irish Americans, Irish, African Americans, Afrikaans etc.. But they like Singaporeans, are not German/Irish/African, the link has long been cut, they are Americans, they speak American English.</p>
              <p>4. I think Singaporeans should be clear that they are Singaporeans not Chinese citizens. Just like African Americans are Americans not Africans. German Americans are Americans not Germans...so on and so forth. </p>
              <p>I say we speak Standard Singapore English proudly with our Singaporean accent. (Mild) Singlish is fun as well, no it is not "bad English" because if you compare it with some British dialects such as "Geordie" or "Scottish English" or even "Welsh English", it is actually easier to understand.</p>
              <p>If a foreigner does not understand my accent or comment that I sound weird, I would tell him he is the one who sounds weird! This is Singapore and this is our accents. If you can't speak with a Singaporean accent, then of course we can't understand you well, don't compain.</p>
              <p>5. Mandarin is not even my ancestral language if you want to be anal about it. Mandarin is the dialect of Beijing and my forefathers were probably from Fujian, though I have some Malay blood in me as well.</p>
              <p>6. Mandarin is useful? If you are dealing with China, yes. But lets not forget that 55 countries worldwide and almost all supranational organs use English.</p>
              <p>The biggest economy in the world, America, uses English. Europeans all speak English as their second language these days. Canadaians, Australians, etc. And without English, you cannot find a good job in Singapore.</p>
              <p>7.  Lets not forget my "forefathers" and probably yours ran away from China and took up Singapore citizenship for a reason. He didn't want to be a Chinese citizen.</p>
              <p>So don't tell me to speak Mandarin (a beijing dialect) in Singapore (an English society).</p>
              <p>If you can't speak English  in Singapore, I suggest you hang your head in shame, for you have truly "lost your roots".</p>

              <p>Singapore is multi-racial. in fact now with integration of new immigrants its now sortta like multi-national. For those who joined no matter the nationality i hope they are contributors. And i mean at least they have proper education enough for any task or jobs, businesses they do here. As for languages many older generation may not be fluent with it, probably the very first few generations if they were still around. Our educational system has not changed the English language as the first and our mother tongue as the second. The decision was a right one and with the english language we had made full use of it in constructing our country and communicate between our people and at an international level. Keeping our second language ensures we can still communicate with our elders or at least someone from another country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if you insist not to use mandarin be it. Its not that you do not want to, but i guess you can't because you don;t know. Even if you do and choose not to so be it.</p>

              <p>1. I am Singaporean, not Chinese. I have never been to

              social conventions, dressing, thinking, schools, transport,
              everything are TOTALLY DIFFERENT.</p>
              <p>2. I, like all Singaporeans, grew up in school with English as

              still reject the use of English and speak Mandarin.</p>
              <p>3. English IS Singapore's language. Some Singaporeans reject
              English as a "foreign language", the language of the British and
              Americans etc and say that as "Chinese" we should speak Mandarin,
              our ancestral language, our "roots". This is just a very bigoted
              view which is based on ignorance.</p>
              <p>If we subscribe to this "foreign language" argument, every

              speak Cornish. Those in Northern Ireland should speak

              <p>Ireland should speak Gaelic or Irish, not English, a "foreign"

              <p>Americans, who are mostly of Irish, Germans, Polish
              descent would all be speaking a "foreign language". After all, they
              should speak German, Polish or Irish language, not English!
              And African Americans should be speaking Afrikaans?</p>
              <p>English is no more a foreign language to Singaporeans than it is
              to the Americans, Canadians and 80% of British people.</p>
              <p>If Singaporean Chinese should speak Mandarin, then German
              Americans should all speak German, Irish Americans, Irish, African
              Americans, Afrikaans etc.. But they like Singaporeans, are not
              German/Irish/African, the link has long been cut, they are
              Americans, they speak American English.</p>
              <p>4. I think Singaporeans should be clear that they are
              Singaporeans not Chinese citizens. Just like African Americans are
              Americans not Africans. German Americans are Americans
              not Germans...so on and so forth. </p>
              <p>I say we speak Standard Singapore English proudly with our
              Singaporean accent. (Mild) Singlish is fun as well, no it is not
              "bad English" because if you compare it with some British dialects
              such as "Geordie" or "Scottish English" or even "Welsh English", it
              is actually easier to understand.</p>
              <p>If a foreigner does not understand my accent or comment that I
              sound weird, I would tell him he is the one who sounds weird! This
              is Singapore and this is our accents. If you can't speak with a
              Singaporean accent, then of course we can't understand you well,
              don't compain.</p>
              <p>5. Mandarin is not even my ancestral language if you want to be
              anal about it. Mandarin is the dialect of Beijing and my
              forefathers were probably from Fujian, though I have some Malay
              blood in me as well.</p>
              <p>6. Mandarin is useful? If you are dealing with China, yes. But
              lets not forget that 55 countries worldwide and almost all
              supranational organs use English.</p>
              <p>The biggest economy in the world, America, uses English.
              Europeans all speak English as their second language these days.
              Canadaians, Australians, etc. And without English, you cannot find
              a good job in Singapore.</p>
              <p>7.  Lets not forget my "forefathers" and probably
              yours ran away from China and took up Singapore citizenship
              for a reason. He didn't want to be a Chinese citizen.</p>
              <p>So don't tell me to speak Mandarin (a beijing dialect) in
              Singapore (an English society).</p>
              <p>If you can't speak English  in Singapore, I suggest
              you hang your head in shame, for you have truly "lost your
              roots".</p>
