                      your roots", "English is not our language" etc. </em></span></div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><span style="color: #808080;"><em>Let me make some points clear.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #808080;"><em>1. I am Singaporean, not Chinese. I have never been to
                      China. My culture is Singaporean not Chinese. Anyone who has
                      been to China will know Singapore culture and Chinese culture are
                      like night and day, totally different. Our laws, medical system,
                      social conventions, dressing, thinking, schools, transport,
                      everything are TOTALLY DIFFERENT.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For a start, lets remember that there is a difference between Race, and Nationality. My race is Chinese, and my nationality is Singaporean. When we refer to Chinese culture, we are referring to the culture and history of the race, not that of China. We have a Singapore culture for sure, but that is the culture of our country, not our race.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #808080;">2. I, like all Singaporeans, grew up in school with English as
                      our first language. I only use English at work and at home, since
                      Singapore is runs on English. Our laws, newspapers and everything
                      else are all in English.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #808080;">I don't understand why under such an environment, some people
                      still reject the use of English and speak Mandarin.</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is anyone here saying that we should reject the use of English. What we are emphasizing is simply that we should be bilingual.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #808080;">3. English IS Singapore's language. Some Singaporeans reject
                      English as a "foreign language", the language of the British and
                      Americans etc and say that as "Chinese" we should speak Mandarin,
                      our ancestral language, our "roots". This is just a very bigoted
                      view which is based on ignorance.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #808080;">If we subscribe to this "foreign language" argument, every
                      English speaking country in the world except English would be
                      speaking a "foreign language" and have lost their
                      ancestral "roots"!</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #808080;">If we follow this argument, in Britain, the Welsh should speak
                      Welsh. Scottish should speak Scots, those at Cornwal should
                      speak Cornish. Those in Northern Ireland should speak
                      Irish.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #808080;">Ireland should speak Gaelic or Irish, not English, a "foreign"
                      language from England.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #808080;">Americans, who are mostly of Irish, Germans, Polish
                      descent would all be speaking a "foreign language". After all, they
                      should speak German, Polish or Irish language, not English!
                      And African Americans should be speaking Afrikaans?</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #808080;">English is no more a foreign language to Singaporeans than it is
                      to the Americans, Canadians and 80% of British people.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #808080;">If Singaporean Chinese should speak Mandarin, then German
                      Americans should all speak German, Irish Americans, Irish, African
                      Americans, Afrikaans etc.. But they like Singaporeans, are not
                      German/Irish/African, the link has long been cut, they are
                      Americans, they speak American English.</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">My question here is simple - does What Is, equate to What Should Be? Does the fact that the same phenomenon is happening in various places make this any more acceptable? And while we're on this topic, how about all the other countries that you failed to mention?</p>
              <div><br></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #808080;">4. I think Singaporeans should be clear that they are
                      Singaporeans not Chinese citizens. Just like African Americans are
                      Americans not Africans. German Americans are Americans
                      not Germans...so on and so forth. </span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #808080;">I say we speak Standard Singapore English proudly with our
                      Singaporean accent. (Mild) Singlish is fun as well, no it is not
                      "bad English" because if you compare it with some British dialects
                      such as "Geordie" or "Scottish English" or even "Welsh English", it
                      is actually easier to understand.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #808080;">If a foreigner does not understand my accent or comment that I
                      sound weird, I would tell him he is the one who sounds weird! This
                      is Singapore and this is our accents. If you can't speak with a
                      Singaporean accent, then of course we can't understand you well,
                      don't compain.</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I think you should be clear on the difference between Race and Nationality <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #808080;">5. Mandarin is not even my ancestral language if you want to be
                      anal about it. Mandarin is the dialect of Beijing and my
                      forefathers were probably from Fujian, though I have some Malay
                      blood in me as well.</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Noted <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> But please also note that Chinese (and thus Mandarin in its spoken form) is the main (probably only) dialect from China that was recorded down (thus giving us Chinese characters), and much of the Chinese culture was based on that language.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #808080;">6. Mandarin is useful? If you are dealing with China, yes. But
                      lets not forget that 55 countries worldwide and almost all
                      supranational organs use English.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #808080;">The biggest economy in the world, America, uses English.
                      Europeans all speak English as their second language these days.
                      Canadaians, Australians, etc. And without English, you cannot find
                      a good job in Singapore.</span></em></p>

              <p>Noted again <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #808080;"><em>7.  Lets not forget my "forefathers" and probably
                      yours ran away from China and took up Singapore citizenship
                      for a reason. He didn't want to be a Chinese citizen.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #808080;"><em>So don't tell me to speak Mandarin (a beijing dialect) in
                      Singapore (an English society).</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #808080;"><em>If you can't speak English  in Singapore, I suggest
                      you hang your head in shame, for you have truly "lost your
                      roots".</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First of all, congratulations on reading the minds of our ancestors (who, presumably for this context, came from China). What is more likely to have happened though, was that they left for Singapore not because they didn't want to be China citizens, but because of circumstances (probably financial). From there on, their offsprings are Singaporeans by default. </p>
              <p>But anyhow, I really think that there is a need for you to look at your arguments again, for you are totally missing the point by focusing on nationality.</p>

                  things such as  "if you can't speak Chinese, you have lost
                  your roots", "English is not our language" etc. </p>
              <p>Let me make some points clear.</p>
              <p>1. I am Singaporean, not Chinese. I have never been to
                  China. My culture is Singaporean not Chinese. Anyone who has
                  been to China will know Singapore culture and Chinese culture are
                  like night and day, totally different. Our laws, medical system,
                  social conventions, dressing, thinking, schools, transport,
                  everything are TOTALLY DIFFERENT.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I would call myself a Singaporean Chinese (Chinese Singaporean seems to imply something else in today Singapore...)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So you take offence at people calling you Chinese because you're </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">ethnically </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chinese?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did you confused the term Chinese (ethnicity) &amp; Chinese (citizens of PRC)?</span></p>
              <p>2. I, like all Singaporeans, grew up in school with English as
                  our first language. I only use English at work and at home, since
                  Singapore is runs on English. Our laws, newspapers and everything
                  else are all in English.</p>
              <p>I don't understand why under such an environment, some people
                  still reject the use of English and speak Mandarin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Our newspapers and everything else aren't all in English, for we have Chinese, Malay and Tamil newspapers as well. Open your eyes and check out the news stand in convenience stores.</span></p>
              <p>3. English IS Singapore's language. Some Singaporeans reject
                  English as a "foreign language", the language of the British and
                  Americans etc and say that as "Chinese" we should speak Mandarin,
                  our ancestral language, our "roots". This is just a very bigoted
                  view which is based on ignorance.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">English is Singaporeans' first language. We have four official languages or do you not know that?</span></p>
              <p>If we subscribe to this "foreign language" argument, every
                  English speaking country in the world except English would be
                  speaking a "foreign language" and have lost their
                  ancestral "roots"!</p>
              <p>If we follow this argument, in Britain, the Welsh should speak
                  Welsh. Scottish should speak Scots, those at Cornwal should
                  speak Cornish. Those in Northern Ireland should speak
                  Irish.</p>
              <p>Ireland should speak Gaelic or Irish, not English, a "foreign"
                  language from England.</p>
              <p>Americans, who are mostly of Irish, Germans, Polish
                  descent would all be speaking a "foreign language". After all, they
                  should speak German, Polish or Irish language, not English!
                  And African Americans should be speaking Afrikaans?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So a Scottish American</span><span style="color: #0000ff;"> speaking Scottish Gaelic in America have lost their ancestral "roots"? What kind 
                  of bloody logic is that?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Well, I believe they do speak their mother 
                  tongues among themselves. English is the bridge to bring these people of different languages together but it doesn't mean the elimination of one's mother tongue.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Btw Afrikaans is not an language native to Africa.</span></p>
              <p>English is no more a foreign language to Singaporeans than it is
                  to the Americans, Canadians and 80% of British people.</p>
              <p>If Singaporean Chinese should speak Mandarin, then German
                  Americans should all speak German, Irish Americans, Irish, African
                  Americans, Afrikaans etc.. But they like Singaporeans, are not
                  German/Irish/African, the link has long been cut, they are
                  Americans, they speak American English.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As I said above</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">they bloody hell do speak their mother 
                  tongues among themselves. </span></p>
              <p>4. I think Singaporeans should be clear that they are
                  Singaporeans not Chinese citizens. Just like African Americans are
                  Americans not Africans. German Americans are Americans
                  not Germans...so on and so forth. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And we bloody do!</span></p>
              <p>I say we speak Standard Singapore English proudly with our
                  Singaporean accent. (Mild) Singlish is fun as well, no it is not
                  "bad English" because if you compare it with some British dialects
                  such as "Geordie" or "Scottish English" or even "Welsh English", it
                  is actually easier to understand.</p>
              <p>If a foreigner does not understand my accent or comment that I
                  sound weird, I would tell him he is the one who sounds weird! This
                  is Singapore and this is our accents. If you can't speak with a
                  Singaporean accent, then of course we can't understand you well,
                  don't compain.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I applaud you.</span></p>
              <p>5. Mandarin is not even my ancestral language if you want to be
                  anal about it. Mandarin is the dialect of Beijing and my
                  forefathers were probably from Fujian, though I have some Malay
                  blood in me as well.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Then speak Hokkien or Teochew or one of the other dialects of Fujian that you belong to. And maybe add Malay to your list along the way.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mandarin like English is a bridge to bring Chinese of different dialects together.</span></p>
              <p>If you can't speak English  in Singapore, I suggest
                  you hang your head in shame, for you have truly "lost your
                  roots".</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If one can't speak English &amp; his/her mother tongue, then he/she have truly lost his/her roots.</span></p>

              <p>The biggest economy in the world, America, uses English. Europeans all speak English as their second language these days. Canadaians, Australians, etc. And without English, you cannot find a good job in Singapore.</p>

              <p>actually, I remember reading some, I think it was german or british research, that mandarin is more demanding cognitively than other languages, cos the script is partially pictographic in nature, and there is much more implied context which has to be decoded and interpreted on the fly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>English is the ancestral language of England alone. That means all other native English speakers today who are of non English ancestry are speaking a "foreign language" . In the United Kingdom, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall and Northern Ireland all have their own "ancestor languages" but now are almost all dead. They all speak English.</p>
              <p>In fact, scotland, wales etc were all colonised by England many centuries ago as well, that is why they speak English today.</p>
              <p>Lets look at America, an English speaking country. According to their govt census in 2000, only 8.7% have English ancestry. So basically over 90% of their country are non English and are speaking a "foreign language" that their ancestors did not speak.</p>
              <p>Going by the "ancestor language" argument German Americans (15%) should speak German, Irish(10.8%) should speak Irish etc.</p>

              <p>Have they all betrayed their roots then? This applies to ALL English speaking countries today. About 90% of all native English speakers today are speaking a different language from their ancestors. This is a fact.</p>
              <p>We haven't got round to the second language English speakers yet.</p>
