              <p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
              <p>That still mean it's still the national language, which would
              explain its choice as logical. It also explains the written
              characters learned here. As for the other dialects, there isn't any

              <p><br>Ha ha you can call me whatever you want. I am no more "Banana" than President Obama (of African Kenyan ancestry), or the 90% of Americans with no English ancestry or the leaders of Singapore, many of whom cannot speak Mandarin well.</p>
              <p>I was educated in English and working in Singapore, I haven't written a word of Chinese for over a decade after leaving school. I speak with a Singaporean accent. In fact, I don't really enjoy Chinese culture much, which is why I tend to lean towards speaking English.</p>
              <p>I pity those who lack self esteem and feel so insecure about using English that they find whatever means to justify their ignorance from deliberately speaking Singlish to muffling their voice etc despite them being educated in English.</p>
              <p>You will be wiping my tables while I will be shaking my legs sitting in my chair. And you can bleach yourself since you like it so much ha ha, I am happy with who I am.</p>
              <p><br>America is leading by a mile. Its economy is 15 trillion. China in number 2 is only 5 trillion I think.</p>
              <p>You throw in the economies of 55 English speaking countries, and of course Singapore, you will see the utility of English.</p>
              <p>Plus all the EU countries and even ASEAN uses English.</p>
              <p>Even in China, the Chinese are paying 20000 yuan just to take part time English courses from Singaporeans and British alike.</p>
              <p>A perfect Beijing accented Chinese fresh grad in Shanghai makes 1500-2000 yuan.</p>
              <p>A Singapore/British fresh grad who chooses to teach English in one of many English schools in Shanghai makes 7000-10000 yuan. In fact, they prefer you not to speak Mandarin at all so their students wont be tempted to use Mandarin with you.</p>
              <p>Mandarin only spoken in 3 countries in the world - Singapore, Taiwan and China.</p>
              <p> And as you can see, even in Taiwan and China, people who are fluent in English easily earn more, muc more.</p>

              <p><br>It is true. Most NATIVE English speakers are not of English ancestry. They are of German, African, Asian, Polish, Irish etc.</p>
              <p>Even Barrack Obama is of African Kenyan ancestry and therefore should speak Kenyan? Extrapolate to most of our Singaporean leaders, are they not Singaporean enough for you?</p>
              <p>I never said speaking Mandarin will lower my IQ, read my original post. I said you should speak to your friends in whatever language and leave me out of it, because speaking to you will lower my IQ. Why? Isn't it obvious?</p>
              <p>If you have no interest in Chinese culture or working in China, why should a Singaporean speak Mandarin, I personally don't see a need to. If you have a keen interest, yes of course go ahead.</p>

              <p><br>You said it yourself, "immigrants". Meaning they have REJECTED their original citizenship, moved away to a foreign land, took up ANOTHER CITIZENSHIP and are now in a seperate SOVEREIGN country with its own culture and language.</p>
              <p>In fact, I think my grand father disliked China so much he would hated for me to go back to China. He was starved and had a terribly hard life there. No one would care if he died in China , just 1/1.3 billion. </p>
              <p>Singapore gave him hope. He learnt basic English, started a coffeeshop in Singapore and made good in Singapore. Singapore gave him dignity.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, there are no famines. No war. No strife. No corruption.</p>
              <p>I am 3 generations away from him. Will China come to Singapore's aid if it was attacked? I don't know. Maybe since we have good ties, maybe not.</p>
              <p>Does ASEAN fear the military poweress of China? Definitely. Open your eyes and you will see an arms race in ASEAN and countries around China as countries spend more on their military.</p>
              <p>They are wary of China's communistic dictatorship.</p>
              <p>I am sure Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia will show some support to Singapore under the Five Powers Agreement. Our close friends Brunei, USA, will probably do something as well.</p>

              <p>Mandarin is just a language that one uses to communicate with people who can only speak mandarin or who are more comfortable with mandarin.</p>
              <p>When you talk to someone in mandarin, it evokes some instant closeness between the two mandarin-speaking individuals.</p>

              <p>Everyone has an agenda, even you have an agenda for posting all these threads....so your point is?</p>
              <p>I know you support TS becoz he's not doing what the govt is forcing the rest of us to do.</p>
              <p>But let me ask you....will learning Mandarin kill you? Will it render you incapable of speaking another language? Then why not? Why not take up a language that would most probably help you in future? It's not like Mandarin is a ancient/long forgotten language that would not be useful in these times. SO I ask again? Why not?</p>
              <p>And I would rather not drag politics into this btw....if not this would be a never ending debate.</p>
