I have 3 modules (Accounting Fundamental, Business Fundamental, Office Applications) to handle each semester and there are test like every now and then. If you are treating ITE as your backup plan if you screw up at O levels, then you have to make sure that you maintain your GPA at &gt;3.5 in order to get into Poly after you finish ITE.<br><br>Maintaining &gt;3.5 is hard. To me it's hard. GPA is consecutive and if you screw up one test, you have to work doubly hard for the next one.<br><br>And making sure that you're doing both very well. Do you think it's hard? You have to sacrifice a lot of leisure activities to cover both sides well. My lecturer told me that very few people can juggle both well.</div>
