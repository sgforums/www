            <div class='col-md body'>Read on the newspaper, that a lawyer was beaten up for being standing up and telling the ah beng behind him to stop using the celluar phone. Hm..., seems that nowadays the ah bengs are more and more aggressive or either the lawyer is trying to impress the girl friend of his by telling the guys behind to stop using the phone.<br><br>What do you think guys ? Would you do that if you are 1) alone with you gf,(knowing     that you are outnumbered)<br>2) with a group of friends (knowing you outnumbered them) ?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I don't think I'll risk doing any funny things when my gf is around...I mean that may put her in danger or something. Even with friends, if we outnumber them, I still don't think doing anything aggressive is the right thing to do...especially if the ah beng is not REALLY disturbing you...I mean you may outnumber them 2 to 1 this time, but who says they won't 'recruit soldiers and buy horses' to get back at you when they outnumber you 10 to 1? So my advice to people is to try not to make any trouble if you can help it. Spoils the evening and could prove potentially dangerous.<br><br>Of course, what I'm saying is if you're not distrubed so much that you can't enjoy your movie. If you are so pissed off, I guess you can report them to the relative authorities or something. Personally I won't try to confront them (probably because I'm too small in size). I dunno, what do you guys think?<br><br>Malbordus<br>"...peace, coz safety comes first..."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well that depends on the occasion. If they really piss me off, heheheh i think i will piss them off too. But that doesn't mean i will take them head on, maybe report to the ushers or the ppl in charge there.<br><br>If my gf is ard, i will not take them regardless whether we are being outnumbered or we outnumbered them. The safety of my gf comes first.<br><br>Well fight is not something we can control. Try not to fight, but what if someone is bent on whacking u up, if u dun fight back, i think its going to be worse. If this is the case, i be glad to give them a fight they never forget. Yah hopefully we win of course hahahaha Again thats provided my gf is not ard.<br><br>Mind</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, u can say that we can tell the usher abt it... but I saw this in theST this morning... some guy said dat wat if the usher got beaten up too? n I think dat makes sense...<br><br>Anyway, personally I will not confront them face-to-face... Most of the time, the offender's hp rings in the other corner of the cinema... n I will juz shout from my seat,"Wallow eh!" n then, the ppl sitting ard me will look @ me...<br><br>I sincerely hope dat the lawyer getting beaten up will not deter others from telling the offenders off... but I guess the best way is still to tell the usher instead... n the usher can get his manager along to confront the offender...<br><br>But, I feel dat the cinemas should take certain measures to ensure dat hps n pagers do not go off duing showtime...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, even though I'm famous for being bochup, I think I'd probably tell him politely that he shd stop talking on the phone(provided my GF is not with me!).<br><br>If my GF is with me, I'll just keep quiet. I dun wan to get my GF into any sort of danger.<br><br>If that guy still don't listen, I'd probably report to the usher and tell him to get the manager in.<br><br>And if those guys wan to find trouble with me, guess I'll either take them on, or run if I cannot win...

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi hi hi. It has been a long time since i last post any messages in there. Suppose if there is any sweet souls waiting for me, that is. Ha ha ha.<br><br>Talk about people interrupting the movie. Some bengs do more than just interupting with a handphone. For instant, Some lousy movies like Blair Witch Project, I do hear some of them jeer and joke badly. ANd that is worse than interupting with a phone......<br><br>Well in any case. The best thing is not to do anything. If someone interupts, I presume that you can only let the management handle this. Afterall , it is THEIR out right responsiblity to handle such people.<br><br>&lt; I m no Longer Araven. But i m the Apocalypse of the millieunm next to come ! &gt;</div>
