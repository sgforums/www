            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah thats ture lots of people judge by the outlook of a person. Its amazeing how my big brother can stand those girls that have ugly hearts but yet pretty face and body and yet he can't even stand those girls who don't qualify as hunk magnets but yet have the sweetest personality and a kind heart. I am not "hot" but being in between is pretty good to me. So I have somewhat of a kind heart.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have a different opinion. I think the case why we've been biased against physically larger people recently is the prototype mindset. Let's explain it.<br><br>Look at the models in popular magazines and beauty resources. What you see are all slim people who have a figure that no one on earth can achieve without an airbrush. Why? Because of the prototype we have created for beauty. I remember it was once considered to be beautiful if you were fat. Example: Yang Gui Fei. I also remember this African or some other tribe that the more rings and longer your neck is, the more beautiful you are. Cameron Diaz would be ugly to them. Another culture is the size of the coin that is embedded between the gums and the lower lip. The rounder and wider diameter, the more beautiful the woman, imagine someone with small lips walking into the village.<br><br>Beauty is not only in the mind of the beholder, but also in the prototype model that is currently fashionable.<br><br>Who knows maybe one day Moses Lim will seem sexy and Brad Pitt is considered weak and too tiny.<br><br>------------------<br>Honesty is the Worst policy when taking an exam in CME</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO , fat is indeed an obsticle IRL . But it really depends on your mentality .

A study showed that the most attractive face is that with average, well-proportioned features. The same applies to figures, I guess.<br><br>In the process of natural selection, more people select 'average' partners.

            <div class='col-md body'>I would think that the extreme is an obstacle. Whether is it an obstacle to yourself depend on individual's mindset. I agree with BluErf, average will be prefered by most.<br><br>If you think you are too fat, why not start doing something to clear this obstacle. I think it's depend on the individual's effort both for the sake of a healthy lifestyle and your own presentation to others.<br><br>As for job seeking, job nature will be the key factor. Most engineering job might require the engineer to meet up with the customer, work on site or be on the move all the time. Fat might be considered an obstacle in this case. In any case, job are harder to come by these bad days. With less job available in the market, there are still lots of job seeker out there esp incoming talented foreigners.<br><br>Singaporean are having too good a life to be able to get fat when you can see skinny and poor pple in other countries working hard just to fill their stomach. It's all due to individual's lifestyle. It's you yourself who decide whether you want to be the extreme or not living in such a well-fed environment when others have no choice but to be skinny due to lack of food.</div>
