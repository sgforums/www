Justice is really fattening...<br><br>in any case, without certainty, it's always better not to raise hell coz the company's lawyers will bury u in a moutain of goo and then subsequently sue u for defamation...<br><br>not the kinda senario anyone would like to face...</div></blockquote>BB,<br><br>This is why in my previous post, I asked ur fren to ask for a professional opinion.  If I were to simply simply say tt, ur fren shd sue them, it wld be v. Irresponsible of me, n then I'd be like some pple who dun think properly before they say somethg i.e. Brainless.<br><br>Therefore, if ur fren is really really v. upset abt this, n if he's sure tt those coys haf not hired him based on his size, then he cld seek professional help.  Of cosh Sgreans r mainly abit scared @ times, a little meek.  They wldn't rock the boat if possible, n I guess it's prettee understandable.<br><br>Oh well, best of luck to ur fren then... if he gets knocked back time n again, perhaps he cld find out more abt the Equal Employment Act, as well as advice on wat to do, shd he feel he's being discriminated against.<br><br>RP</div>
