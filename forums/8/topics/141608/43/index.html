If these stuffs are trimmed, more money can be used to subsidize the treatment. Correct me if I'm wrong, that's what they have been urging the donors to do so?<br><br>Obviously, there should be some accountability to what was spent and how much there were allocated for the patients. Ask he majority of people who donate, I dun think they donate just to pay for the CEO/Head of various Dept/etc's salaries. They donate cos they thought the money will go to the patients.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wednesday July 7, 10:17 PM<br>Dr Seamus Phan apologises for defamatory article on NKF<br>ADVERTISEMENT<br>SINGAPORE : The chief executive of a technology firm has publicly apologised to the National Kidney Foundation for what he now admits were baseless and malicious allegations.<br><br>The defamatory comments were in an article "NKF Singapore's 189-million-dollars in the bank" on Dr Seamus Phan's website.<br><br>Dr Seamus said: "I come forward to apologise to the NKF, the staff, beneficiaries and donors of my own accord.<br><br>"If I make a mistake and this is a very genuine mistake. I am a publisher, I made a mistake allowing the publication, I step forward, I don't see it as a bad thing. If I make a mistake, I own up."<br><br>And the NKF looks pleased that Dr Phan has cleared the air.<br><br><strong>Mr Richard Yong, Chairman of the NKF, said: "The people, our donors, our patients were also affected because they are worried that people write such things about the NKF and with this clarification, people will have a better understanding that what he has written is baseless and there is no truth in it."</strong><br><br>The article in question, which appeared on Dr Phan's public website, accused the NKF of mis-spending and mis-managing public donations as well as misleading the public about its mission.<br><br>Dr Phan now admits these are blatantly untrue allegations.<br><br>As an added precaution he has also restricted access to his website.<br><br><strong>As a gesture of his remorse and repentence for the distress caused to the NKF, its donors and beneficiaries, Dr Phan has agreed to pay all damages and legal costs to NKF.<br><br>NKF refused to say how much this adds up to, but stressed that it will not hesitate to take legal action against anyone who defames the organisation.<br><br>Mr Yong added: "If they make allegations that are defamatory and that are damaging to NKF, we will have to take action because our reputation is at stake and knowing what we have done for the citizens of Singapore, for the poor and for the 2,000 patients that we have, we have to take the necessary actions as required." </strong><br><br>The NKF is also in a legal tussle with The Straits Times, which claimed in an article there are gold-plated taps in the NKF CEO's office. - CNA<br><br></div>

Ask he majority of people who donate, I dun think they donate just to pay for the CEO/Head of various Dept/etc's salaries. They donate cos they thought the money will go to the patients. </div></blockquote>X2 if u r the patient would u b happy to see those ex fish tanks? i would b thinking wat the hell, y cant they dun buy those fish tanks n instead lower our dialysis cost.</div>

I am a publisher, I made a mistake allowing the publication, I step forward, I don't see it as a bad thing. If I make a mistake, I own up."<br><br>And the NKF looks pleased that Dr Phan has cleared the air.<br><br>[b]Mr Richard Yong, Chairman of the NKF, said: "The people, our donors, our patients were also affected because they are worried that people write such things about the NKF and with this clarification, people will have a better understanding that what he has written is baseless and there is no truth in it."</strong><br><br>The article in question, which appeared on Dr Phan's public website, accused the NKF of mis-spending and mis-managing public donations as well as misleading the public about its mission.<br><br>Dr Phan now admits these are blatantly untrue allegations.<br><br>As an added precaution he has also restricted access to his website.<br><br><strong>As a gesture of his remorse and repentence for the distress caused to the NKF, its donors and beneficiaries, Dr Phan has agreed to pay all damages and legal costs to NKF.<br><br>NKF refused to say how much this adds up to, but stressed that it will not hesitate to take legal action against anyone who defames the organisation.<br><br>Mr Yong added: "If they make allegations that are defamatory and that are damaging to NKF, we will have to take action because our reputation is at stake and knowing what we have done for the citizens of Singapore, for the poor and for the 2,000 patients that we have, we have to take the necessary actions as required." </strong><br><br>The NKF is also in a legal tussle with The Straits Times, which claimed in an article there are gold-plated taps in the NKF CEO's office. - CNA<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Thought this is old news? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

'This is important because we still have patients to take care of.'<br><br>He will also visit the dialysis centres this week to understand their workings and to meet the staff and patients there.<br><br>Yesterday, Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, said Mr Ee was the best person for the job.<br><br>Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a community event, he said of Mr Ee: 'He's got his work cut out for him, but he's also just retired three weeks ago. So, fortunately for all of us, he is experienced and has sufficient time to take on the task of restoring public confidence, public trust.'<br><br>He added: 'I think at this point, everyone needs to calm down, take a deep breath and wait for the interim board to get into position, conduct investigations and let us know what really happened and what the true situation is.'<br><br>He cautioned against overreacting.<br><br>'We'll take our time to decide whether anything needs to change, whether the rules and regulations need to be altered in any way,' he said.<br><br>'I think it's very important that we do this in a careful, deliberate fashion because there are lives at stake; there's the long-term vibrancy of the social service sector at stake.'<br><br>only 500 clinical staff !!! wat are the rest of 400 doing !!! going around conning ppl's money ?  knn  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
