NKF has already started off poorly with a last min withdrawal of the 'agenda claim' against SPH, prompting the judge to not only throw out their application but award damages against them. It's obvious they do not have case at all.<br><br>SPH reported on facts and figures. Either they have inside information or they have been tipped off by whistle-blowers. Either way, they have the figures to back their defence.<br><br>For all that he may contend, the immense negative publicity will unleash a backlash the likes of which charitable organisations have never known.<br><br>I see a 99% withdrawal of monetary support from current patrons. I see angry patients demanding that they be given immediate repatriations. Most of all, i see a legal inquiry into the audit of NKF accounts upon the conculsion of this trial and the dismissal of the entire board of directors should they have been found guilty of misappropriating public donations for unscrupulous dealings.<br><br>Sadly, i also see a distinct loss of trust between all charitable origansations as a whole and the general public tks to TT Durai.<br><br></div>

Besides, by doing that, there's this thing call humanity and human rights. These patients can sue them and this can be brought up to international groups to investigate... Actually i tot being ill .. already tired and want to live happily to the end with loved ones. I would definitely never agree to go harass ppl for money even if its to save myself.<br><br></div>
