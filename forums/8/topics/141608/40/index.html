It's one thing to get Durai and his entire board to resign, but it's another to regain the trust and goodwill that has been lost.<br><br>I'm not saying that we should condone this behaviour of harping on what has past, but let's face it... a lot of people are going to hold grudges against the NKF in the years to come. And with good reason too - they all feel betrayed by the revelations of the past few days. Every company knows that it is far better to lose some money in the short than to lose customers and try to rebuild the lost goodwill in the long run.<br><br>The same goes for NKF. Just substitute 'customers' with 'donors'.<br><br>NKF has been building a huge amount of trust in the people of Singapore for 36 years - and it took them 72 hours to lose it all. They have an uphill battle ahead of them. I'm pretty sure most people are willing to give second chance - but a lot has to be done first before that can happen.</div>

It's one thing to get Durai and his entire board to resign, but it's another to regain the trust and goodwill that has been lost.<br><br>I'm not saying that we should condone this behaviour of harping on what has past, but let's face it... a lot of people are going to hold grudges against the NKF in the years to come. And with good reason too - they all feel betrayed by the revelations of the past few days. Every company knows that it is far better to lose some money in the short than to lose customers and try to rebuild the lost goodwill in the long run.<br><br>The same goes for NKF. Just substitute 'customers' with 'donors'.<br><br>NKF has been building a huge amount of trust in the people of Singapore for 36 years - and it took them 72 hours to lose it all. They have an uphill battle ahead of them. I'm pretty sure most people are willing to give second chance - but a lot has to be done first before that can happen.  </div></blockquote>Well...
