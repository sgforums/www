The public built the NKF into the efficient organisation it is, so the public has expectations on transparency and expectations on how things should be done.<br><br>"And looking at the events in the past 24 hours, it appears this trust that the public had in the NKF has suffered. <strong>It is very important that NKF rebuild the trust of the public by being transparent, and by accounting to the public and answering all the questions that the public may have.</strong>" - CNA/ir<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/157861/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/157861/1/.html</a><br><br>rite now its not the matter of whether tt CEO got or wat other ppl said...rather wat matters most to the public is that they must be give a clear detailed break-down on how they actually operates...<br><br>n i pity the patients man...ultimately they are the 1s who really suffered after all these events...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br><br>I really feel disgusted with this affair.<br><br>I have no problem with Mr. Durai's salary package if this is clearly disclosed to the public (although I sincerely believe this is extremely excessive for a charitable Organization.)<br><br>However, I am extremely disappointed with the Board of Directors who condones his behavior to run the organization as he pleased.  Misuse of The organization funds to subsidize his wife car, private bath room, first class travel, mis-info on reserves, suing others in the courtroom for what is essentially as the truth - my sincere sympathy to the 2 private individuals who does not have the muscle of SPH to defend themselves, and non-disclosure of personal interest In call centre etc.)<br><br>I wonder what are the perks enjoyed by the Board Members that they keep quiet about the going on there. Is this a case of "you scratch my back, I scratch yours"?  Who are the senior staffs that have the use of company cars?  (I presume, the Chairman would be one who has the privilege.) By the way, how many MNC (not GIC) you know has 6 companyÂ’s cars in Singapore nowadays?  In my previous company, there is none.<br><br>Mrs. Goh, a sponsor to NKF, was reported to say that she has no problem with Mr. Durai's salary for someone who is responsible for $200 million reserve. I don't know on what basis is she saying that.  To me, I can only ask, is Mr. Durai putting that $200 million reserve to good use to earn future income to sustain the charity or is he using the money to sustain his lifestyle or building an self-indulging organization (such a private bath room that can access through his office) for his and his senior staff's benefits.  Since based on ST report, NKF only use 7.x million a year to subsidize patients.<br><br>According to report, Mr. Durai claimed that the bathroom is not only for his use.  By the way, how many of you working in an organization that has a bathroom in the CEO's office would knock on your CEO door and ask him to let you use that bathroom.<br><br>According to Mr.Durai, not correcting the errors in the no. of patients and how long the reserve can last are merely oversights.<br><br>I do not know what you think. Is these oversights not corrected because someone bonus is dependant on the amount donated every year?  Just imagine 10 to 12 month bonus (300k a year).  How many MNC paid such bonus to their CEO?  How many Charities in the world do that?<br><br>For the NKF staff who are supporting Mr. Durai, I am not surprise, their career and jobs is on the line.  Without NKF, there will be no paycheck. I really wonder how much are the senior staff being paid and what are perks they are enjoying!<br><br>For the patients who are supporting Mr. Durai, they are the silly lots who think that the NKF's subsidy will be taken away from them.  How silly, didn't they comprehend NKF has a reserve can last 30 years if nothing is do to grow it.  If this reserve were put into good use, say earning 8% per annum, it would add another 10 to 15 years before it is depleted.  And that is excluding any smaller annual donation NFK may collect from now on!<br><br>Mr. Durai perhaps has some prominent sponsors and supporters who are behind him and he may be able get away with it.  If this is a commercial entity in US, the CEO and its senior staff will be jailed.  The corporate or charity governance in Singapore just does not have enough TEETH.  There must be a mandatory jail terms for CEO to come clean.<br><br>Having say that I am glad to read what Mdm. Ho Ching mentioned in ST this morning,  there is a need for the Board to be independent and be the watch dog for the public, it should not be too close to the CEO, the roles that they should played and examples on how that could be achieved.<br><br>There is a petition put up at www.petitiononline.com to remove Mr. Durai; I am not able to access it this morning.  Perhaps it has crashed due to overload with the too many people signing up for the petitions.  If you agree with me, please sign the petition.<br><br>Regards<br><br></div>

That much the public can do to help the needy, dont force them down their throats to support those who are abusing the system to misuse public donations.<br>Dont just rely on public funds, the government has their role to play as watchdogs.<br><br><a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages/?msg=76794" rel="nofollow">http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages/?msg=76794</a></div>
