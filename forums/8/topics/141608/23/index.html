Think about it MR NKF! With the economic crisis and jobless people trying to earn a living. Yet people still donate money to help the needy and who give him the right to use the money for his enjoyment. Why is he in need of so much money? For what? Replace a new heart or WHAT!

Who knows, maybe they are all link together. Even if NKF falls, who knows maybe after a few more weeks another new charity organization will be born to replace NKF. I thought donation is suppose to be at peoples free will not force to donate!<br>You also never know maybe all the movie makers out there is trying to tell use something about the GOV throught thier movies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes and now we know why the income gap is widening...with the current focus on corporate govenance issues, even a 24K platinum tap cannot wash away dirty launderies without the public knowing. we need more whistle blowers to oust those cocky and god like creatures who sit on the top and think that the many hardworking ordinary folks who toil even harder owes them a living.  they are many with barely enough to survive and maintain a family unit in this hard times, let alone think about the future.  these are signs of the times, one shrouded with over complacency and that, in general, many policies set in place are just falling apart.  due to greater insulation, the very systems in place will be those that self-destruct, even the orchestrator. More such 'private' matters will be exposed and these will extend to every facets of private and public organizations and businesses, even government. all have to come clean. do we owe these people a living and willingly part hard earned money, commitment, sweat to satiate their comfortable lifestyles? Are there many more overpaid individuals at the top who just keeps getting more prosperous? you bet.  the lower and middle rungs are just being 'yes man' to this class of individuals for fear of their power position, nothing more.  little respect, in all honesty. fortunately, not many of these are geniuses and as they stay there long enough, they gradually get detached from the most significant stakeholders of all - the public.  the very people who loyally support and  give them such free rein, complete trust and mutual accontability. all that is needed is a small tilt, a slight intervention, will just be all that is necessary to exposure every human fallibilities, greed and inconsistencies.  the undercurrents of discontent will gain momentum and the disbursments of such 'peanuts' or  'righful entitlements' claims will come to light.  those institutions that have lost their favour will not take flight again and those individuals who have suckled away the benefits at the expense of other fellow citizens will not go away unscathed.  crisis strategies may temporarily whitewash the damages to an entity's reputation to function as an ongoing business concern, but they were never built in or meant to repair what the conscience has done wrong.  though this public outcry is just one minor incident, but it is not in vain. nature has a strange but effective way to bring balance, just as sickness/healing, sun/rain, ying/yang. so fear not, people's voice is power...on another note, switch off your tv to avoid those repetitive tv advertisements to get you to call up and donate more money so that you get a 4D chance to win a car/condominium. and the music/soundtrack is overplayed it becomes a mental torture. even with donor fatigue, the organizers have obviously, in a stupid sort of zealous way misunderstood and crossed the line between commercialism and those of evoking genuine public generousity/spirit.  and in an equally stupid sort of brainwashed way, the participants while good intention, are plain gullibble.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by judgedren:</div><div class="quote_body">The board of director from NKF should feel ashame of themselves.......using public donation to give themselves 12 month bonus for the pasts 3 years!<br><br>These donated money should be used to help those poor families........government should step in and do something.<br><br>Meanwhile......everyone should not donate till they get rid of this bloodsucker!<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We the public should band together and sue NKF to get back that amount of money they spent on those unneccessary stuffs. The compensation sought should be channelled directly into a new 100% not for profit organization where it will definitely benefit those who are in dire need directly.<br><br>NEXT, i am totally disappointed by Mrs *o*'s reply on whether she thinks that the CEO's salary is that high. She says to an organization like NKF that have hundreds of millions, 600,000 is a small sum. LOOK, you d*m* arr*gant bi*c*. Haven't you forgotten that NKF is to help those who can't afford dialsis treatment? OHMYFUCKINGHELL..YOU D**N BI*C*..Still high in your head??<br>I think you had stood to gain from NKF's public funds if not you wouldn't have said that. Don't think you're MRS *O* and you can say that.</div>
