SPH has a new duty - charged with finding worthy causes for Singaporeans to donate to and not let Singaporeans continue donating to some fiasco "business corporation".<br><br>at the heart of it all, nkf has spent money to run the NPO like a business, building a brandname that many Singaporeans becomes obliged to donate to... there are many other truely charities that could not have afforded such expenses and don't say 5 years of reserves, they probably hardly any reserves at all.<br><br>we cannot depend on the govt to take all censor directions. the public let it be known and charge our newspaper with the duty to find us an alternative... this is positive action.... let our hardearned monies pour into worthy causes that our hearts agree to... let the unworthy causes dwindle off....<br><br>remember the goodness of people will make them want to donate to help the needy. that's why 2/3 of Singaporeans support nkf.... we need to show people that there are other worthy charities to donate to to help these unfortunate people in need. many Singaporeans could live in the dark not knowing that many other support organizations exist.... we need the powress of a big communication tool to convey out the rite message and the time to strike is when the iron is hot too...otherwise sentiments soften with time....<br><br>As for nkf, they should move their funds from reserve into action to help their pool of 1800 patients and not beg for more money on telly. that is the message we should advertise and spread.<br><br>i sincerely hope the SPH or any other worthy journalistic avenues would take into serious consideration what i  have shared here and set the wheels in motion. also, i believe proper and full coverage should also be duplicated in the other languages as many naive Singaporeans tend to read the Chinese papers as well as not all of them can read English..... all those aunties and uncles should be informed......</div>
