They are the beneficiaries, it is the management. We should continue to support the patients."<br><br>"I will still donate, it is about helping people. What if someone in your family gets kidney disease or cancer?"<br><br>"The NKF still needs to raise funds here and there, and as a Singaporean, I don't mind to chip in a bit."<br><br>Despite the backlash, many staff members and patients at the National Kidney Foundation have rallied behind its chief Mr Durai, and they have also called on donors to take a more measured response to the revelations over the past few days.<br><br>Dialysis patient Chan Poh Choo, 58, visits a dialysis centre three times a week for treatment.<br><br>She made a plea to donors not to write off the NKF because of what has happened.<br><br>Ms Chan said: "As a patient, I know the NKF has done a lot for kidney, cancer patients or else we can't afford expensive dialysis and with medical so costly now, the NKF has done a lot and I hope it will carry on with the good work they have done, as we need the funds for survival."<br><br>For Job Loei, he is not just a patient but has been working closely with patients there.<br><br>Mr Loei said: "Whatever money we raised goes back to the public. Mr Durai has worked very hard, I have seen him over the past four years. He is very passionate about the cause and no matter what, he has done a good job and I will stand by him."<br><br>Mr Durai is seen as the engine of the organisation, not only for the 1,800 patients at the 21 dialysis centres islandwide, but also among his 900-strong staff.<br><br>Ms Michelle Ang, Deputy Communications Director of NKF, said: "He addressed staff to explain the decision on withdrawing the case, and they gave him a standing ovation.<br><br>"As we all know how hard he has worked, his whole life has been about the NKF, the patients especially, as he knows them by name, he sees everyone of them so we all know what TT Durai stands for and he is a great boss."<br><br>That is the general consensus among many staff members of the man who has played a key role in building the NKF over the years. - CNA/de</span><br><br>No one doubts that Durai has done much for the NKF over the years. But it is these astonishing skeletons now that have damaged the entire reputation of the organisation.<br><br>Perhaps the staff of NKF do not see the harm they are doing if Durai and the ex-co board remain in office. The integrity and direction of the NKF has been seriously dented. Only a clean-out of management with new faces can convince those who discontinued gyro donations to abstain and re-establish links.<br><br>The fact that a <span style="color: red;"><strong>standing ovation</strong> </span>was given makes people wonder whether they were either taken in by company propaganda or they are in fact as misguided as their management.<br><br>This is more than just a misuse of public donations; it has become a public outcry at what is perceived to be an integrity and moral issue which is being swept aside as 'trivial' by the very organisation which was put in the hot seat.<br><br>The repercussions it will have on other charitable organisations is unfanthomable. People will start to doubt charities everywhere and donations will plument to an all time low...unless relations can be repaired.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hai, I registered becos I have to write something about this case. I have stopped all the donations to NKF since last year, as I think money is not spent 'wisely' for the patients.. patients still get to pay, get rejected for funding... and then they can spend on renovation dollars to build a nice building.<br><br>To my horror, that man is paid $600K a yr... for a clerk who earn $1500 a month.. that makes up to 400 months of the pay, 33 years of working. And to someone who i respect... this sum is considered peanut. This sum of $600K comprises of how many calls, how many monthly $50 donations? Donors sacrificed not for the patients, but for the corporate company entitlements, 12 months bonuses... I felt disgusted.<br><br>My friend told me her experience in NKF networking session few years ago. A daring lady asked the spokeman 3 questions, first, how much in a dollar donated is given to the patient? - spokeman never give a satisfactory answer. Second, why use lucky draws for donation drives? just sell the property or cars and get more money. - spokeman said people are greedy by nature, when its the last 5 mins to win something, the calls flood in. These are just investments to get more returns... Oh ya, the last question... How do NKF compared with KDF... His answer was ultimate, when i hear that i nearly fell down... "please do not compare us with KDF, we are different, they are not business man, they do not know how to run business."<br><br>Perhaps he should really get $600K a year... or more.. as he is very capable to ""get money out"" of many of us. Or perhaps on commission based? haha</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ALL,<br><br>Personally, i am NOT advocating that we STOP all donation. What i am or rather majority of us are saying is <strong>STOP all donation to NKF for the <span style="color: red;">time being</span></strong>.<br><br>Reasons?<br>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BIG Reserve</strong></span><br>According to the interpretion make in court, their reserve is able to long at least 30 years (till 2035). Therefore, the concern that some of us and the kidney patients have, such as we are depriving the kideny patients from their treatment. Without our donation, those patients will be in trouble, etc etc. is <span style="color: red;"><strong>NOT true or accruate</strong></span>. <strong>REMEMBER</strong> for now till 30 years later, they will still be able to get their treatment given that NKF reserve is BIG enough to last that long (and this is proven in court).<br><br>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mismanagement</strong></span><br>Some would say they are doing a good job and as such, its ok. However, public fund aside, they could have better channel this "expenses" to Subsidize more to their patients (so that they could pay less). or help more people by either donating more to other charity organisation etc.<br><br>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Helps are needed elsewhere</strong></span><br>Kidney is number 3 diseses in Singapore. However, NOT the number 1. Therefore, we could better channel our donation to elsewhere to help more people with other illness.<br><br>However, till when should we start donating again? well, my take is, till a time when NKF manage to clean up their own mess in their backyard (such as removal of their CEO &amp; BOD and FULL transparency) and regain our confident in their handling of funds. This could take YEARS. <strong>However, i would like to remind everyone that NKF reserve can still continue to help those patients whom they are currently treating</strong>. If NOT for 30years, how about 10-15 years? i believe 10-15 years would be "long" enough for a major overhaul in the management and BOD of NKF. Till then, personally, i will channel my donation to other organisation.<br><br>P.S: However, the money is yours lah, thus, its really up to who and which organisation you want to chose to donate  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
