            <div class='col-md body'>Hi i able to get a real life experience of a fella whose mom is under NKF subsidy...<br><br>Quote:<br>This is precisely the point why I DO NOT support them even though my mom is under their subsidy. I used to work there during school holidays as FA artist. I saw their luxury office and totally changed my mind about them.<br><br>Even though my mom is under their subsidy, they make the kdiney patients to go thru blood test all the time (say twice a week). Each test cost abt $100 over. Reason for the test is to see if patients have HIV. It's fair to have blood test BUT if my mom has done it in a hospital a few days ago and the doctor gave us the blood test results to be handed over to NKF for record. The test is still valid for submission. One of the nurse insisted my mom go thru the test again for no valid reason but just to make money out of the patients whom they claim to hugely helped in their battle in their daily life. SO NOT TRUE!! If their patiems are so poor, how are they supposed to pay for their REGULAR blood test (which I don't find the need to do so frequently).<br><br>Apart from earning money from the blood test, they sent the next of kin of the patients a donation collection card for them to go around begging for NKF! It's somekind of a blackmail tactic as my mom is under their dialysis centre. I ask them how they got my contact when they call me for help. I told them I'm supporting my mom but they literally forced it down my mailbox and insisted that I can do my best to help them since I've been supporting them (NOT TRUE..I have never supported them in any way before. They found my number from my mom's database and hound for any contacts they can find to help support their expensive lifestyle corporation).<br><br>The point is they are using public sympathy with their sad ads about these kidney patients and now they have cancer patients unit for their own gain.<br><br>Dunno how true is it but worth reading.</div>
