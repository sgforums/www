Error in publish, and he know about it but does not correct it.  No orgainsation is perfect but many know how to correct an error.  But he can let it go inaccurate for years. How to believe anything they say again in the media.  It could have errors and inaccurate.<br><br>2.  He sue two poor guys regarding the travel first class issue and yet he can say he wont even apologize to them.  One wont admit his mistake even it is place right in front of him.<br><br>3.  He think that the public dont have to know this dont have to know that.  The public doesnt want to know how he run his "charity orgainzation", the public want to know how is their money being used or spend.  He is answerable for every cent and dollar the public donated.<br><br>Yeah a CEO make $600K is peanut.  But all these make me feel he doesnt deserve the $600k CEO position.</div>
