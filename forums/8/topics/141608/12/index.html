            <div class='col-md body'>Just a silly stress relieving response<br><br>The best retribution is for this CEO to get sued by SPH, made bankrupt, got kidney problems and had to ask NKF for aid. In the end he appear in the show crying and regretting and telling people about his sad story and asking for donations to NKF<br><br>Don't donate any more money to NKF ! Feel soft hearted after seeing all the poor people asking for money ? Don't worry, even if no one donates they can survive for another 30 years. Feel softhearted when the stars asked and plead for money ? Don't, because not donating to a charity (tat don't need charity) is not because u do not like the star, but because it is the right thing to do. They should not linked their popularity with the amount of donations</div>

Therefore he can only speak the truth or he'll be charged. I bet he will stick to the same story he told Susan Long if it were really the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help him, God.</div>
