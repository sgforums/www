If they disclose, I think there will also be critics who will say that whatever they pay will be too high.<br><br>'So, I think they are caught between a rock and a hard place.'<br><br>Mr Lim also defended the 30 per cent cap on expenses used for fund-raising, saying it helped the smaller charities.<br><br>They run up higher overheads in fund-raising and would be hit if the cap was lowered, he said.<br><br>On the controversial issue of sharing its database of donors with its partners, Mr Lim saw 'nothing objectionable' as NKF had declared that the data would be given only if the donor agreed.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On aquariums and plasma TV sets at its dialysis centres, he said they helped keep patients occupied during their treatment and added: 'We do have aquariums and TV sets also in our blood donation centres.'</span><br><br>Mr Lim does not see fund-raising as 'a zero sum game', maintaining that there is room for big and small charities.<br><br>Singaporeans have big hearts, and 'if you convince them of the worthiness of your causes, Singaporeans will open up their wallets'. He also urged the smaller charities to pool their efforts in fund-raising to 'get a bigger share of the pie'.<br><br></div>

With the recent groundbreaking news, their comments cannot be <strong>unfairly associated </strong>as they were honest mistakes.<br><br>The main contention is the manner in which NKF has immorally spent public donations and the irresponsible (though technically faultless) comments made by certain parties who are desperately trying to salvage the fallen reputation of a so-called non-profit organisation.</div>
