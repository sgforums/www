            <div class='col-md body'>Like what? Mrs Goh says Durai's salary is peanuts. If he was the CEO of a for-profit company, that is really peanuts, and even if he earned some 1 million bucks I wouldn't have any say. But he is in charge of a CHARITY ORGANISATION. $600,000 is a large pack of peanuts. Donated by we Singaporeans. I remember last year when my school gave all of us one NKF life-saver's card each, and i went from door to door asking for donations. Right now I feel like a fool.

            <div class='col-md body'>Looking at the financial accounts of NKF it is not difficult to come to the conclusion that either the mangement or the junior staff are very well paid. At $27 million yearly wage bill, divided by 900 staff, each one gets something like $20k a month. This is not possible. So if you work backwards, assuming each staff gets a decent $2k a month, and a 80% junior staff level, you still have <strong>$10 million</strong> attributed to the management.<br><br><a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages/?msg=76909" rel="nofollow">http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages/?msg=76909</a></div>
