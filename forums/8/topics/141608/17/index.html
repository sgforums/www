            <div class='col-md body'><strong>In a separate statement, the NKF Board says it has discontinued its proceedings against Singapore Press Holdings and its senior writer Ms Susan Long.<br><br>And the decision to withdraw was a considered decision made in the best interests of the NKF, its supporters, donors and patients.<br><br>The Board also reiterated its whole-hearted support for Mr Durai as its CEO and looked forward to carrying on all its life-saving activities with full vigour and strength, and to continue to serve the public to the best of its ability.<br><br>- CNA /ls</strong><br><br>The sickening thing is that legally, they have not committed any crime. If they are guilty of something, it is that NKF is run by an unethical and immoral bunch of blood sucking merceneries who choose to make luxury use of public donations for their own cosy comfort.<br><br>The board of directors may have unanimously given a confidence vote for the CEO, but the public image and righteousness has been forever tarnished. In effect, NKF has become damaged goods.<br><br>This all stems from plain and simple greed. Just like monks who drive mercedes benz and churches that use state-of-the-art entertainment systems during their masse, money is being lavished in all the wrong places. Charity has become a money-spinning business.<br><br>I have no dispute over his monthly salary as i accept that when TT Durai started out he was offered 20K and chose to take only 12K. That was probably his last gracious act as CEO. But why organisations are willing to hand out exhorbitant bonuses, why they splurge on drivers and expensive cars and why they no longer treat NKF as a charity organisation but as a 'business' with annual turnovers and profit margins, is truly beyond my understanding.<br><br>The donation process has just another means, another cash cow by which to obtain public funds for purposes that may not have had the patients' best interest at heart.<br><br></div>
