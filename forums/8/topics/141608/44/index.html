            <div class='col-md body'>If we do a financials study and analysis , it is not difficult to realise that the kidney patients are infact assets not liabilities to NKF. Without these patients it is almost impossible to attract so much donations which translates to revenues and possitive cashflows for NKF. Its ROA is very high by any standard. But the patient expenditure only constitutes 20% of the total operating expenses.<br><br><a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages/?msg=77428" rel="nofollow">http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages/?msg=77428</a></div>

I think they had the same wool over their eyes as ours.<br>I do genuinely think they want to perform and help those patients, by doing stunts to garner more calls.<br><br>They did perspired and spent hours practicing on those stunts. Although, some did want more air time showing off their muscle, chest or whatever.<br><br>I think Cao Qi Tai is a good man, and gave all his best in trying to help those patients.<br>He, like most of us was not aware, what the board was doing.<br>Like in Star Wars, the empire has turn to the dark side. What was once good has turn evil.<br><br>Please give the artistes a break.<br><br>Lastly, durian, how do you sleep at night for the last three years (at least)?<br>When your eyes are close, before drifting to your dreamy heaven of the golden taps and 1st class flights, is there a grin on your face?<br><br></div></blockquote>Heard that he was being paid 16K for each performance, no wonder he is so angry over this incident and critise us. By getting so much pay, I believe as a smart man, he should smell fishy. If he really want to help those patient, he should'nt get so much paid already. He did'nt contribute much, just 'beg' for money on the stage only. He should apologise to the public too. He have no right to say the donars when part of his salary is from the donars. If he has the pride don't take their money lah.</div>
