            <div class='col-md body'>Movie review for re-cycle with spoliers<br><br>The show started off by having the female lead being a ghost writer and things started to behave strangely one night as what she wrote began to materialize in her apartment. One day, while taking the life from the 10th floor, she was transported to the ghost world when she left the lift at the ground floor.<br><br>As she stepped into the ghost world, she saw a dilapidated street of old buildings that was torn into pieces here and there. Soon, an avalanche of dead bodies began to fell and they started chasing her. She began to run from one ghostly realm to another, all which were graphically impact and haunting. All these things have a common theme in them and that they were all things that have been abandoned by people in the real world.<br><br>Hence, you will see one scene where the whole placed is filled with huge toys which has this Alice in the wonder land effect as stated by another review. It was also mentioned that this movie is also like silent hill with its various kinds of dead bodies swaying silently and suddenly bouncing into action to strangle the lead actress.<br><br>She met a little girl who saved her from a forest scene from the ghosts who led her to a old man. The old man told her that she could leave the place at a location called transit but she has to passed through many scary places.<br><br>The movie contains scenes where places will start to vaporise by oncoming Â‘suckerÂ’ kind of thing and it explains that things in this ghost world gets recycled occasionally and if the lead actress donÂ’t run away from it, she will be deleted permanently too. With the help of the girl, she has to escaped back to her world avoiding three things.<br><br>1.	Ghosts in the initial old building who were chasing her.<br>2.	ghosts that were at the places she has to cross through to reach the transit.<br>3.	the sucker thing that vaporize the places.<br><br>The movie up till now still has no reveal why the hell was she here in the first place and who are these little girl and the old man really. The subsequent explanation were slightly lamed and not exciting reasons.<br><br>The first thing apparently that is shown in the end of the movie is that the story that Xinjie, lead actress, is encountering seems to be happening because someone in the human world is continuing the story left by Xinjie as she left her workplace and enters the ghost world. As the person, who is a Xinjie carbon copy, (the movie never explain why it is the same person), is writing the story, the original Xinjie begins to live out the story in the movie.<br><br>This is shown by the fact that at the end of the movie, the writer typed that the character in the story managed to escaped from the ghost world, which she did. She returned to her bed and when she goes to her living room, she met the writer who has just finished up the story. The movie ends there.<br>There are two possible reasons why she enters the story. First reason is because she wrote in her story that the female character enters the ghost realm, hence she led herself into the realm.<br><br>The second reason is because the little girl in the ghost realm asked the old man to get her into the realm because she wants to meet her. This is because the little girl is actually Xinjie aborted baby eight years ago. She wanted to ask her why she aborted her and caused her to left her in such horrible realm. So apparently this little girl should be eight year old in the movie.<br><br>However, she was very kind and helpful in the movie to xinjie as she keep helping her to reach the transit. Before the transit place, the little girl did not reveal that she was her unborn daughter and said that it was her who brought her to this place. She only started to ask her why she abandoned her in the transit area and xinjie began to cry and did not really give a good reason.<br><br>At the transit, the ghost at the first place caught up with xinjie and finally reveal why they were chasing her. They were actually created in xinjie ghost story but was abandoned as she threw away the papers in the paper bin. So they were angry that they were being abandoned in her story and thus being sent to this place, which was a place for the abandoned.<br><br>Hence, things like toys, abandoned babies, rejected story ideas were all found in the realm. These explanations were a bit lame reasons like ghost trying to seek revenge just because xinjie threw the papers into the bin. What the hell is the problem with these ghosts.<br><br>One scary thing about this movie is the focus on the theme abandonment and how this is all caused by our actions in the human world and it can be triggered guilt feelings in viewers. The movie also adds a touch of sadness and love in the movie by playing the corresponding poignant music at certain places. One is at a cemetery where dead people were forgotten by their living relatives and one is at a field between xinjie and her daughter.<br><br>The special effects of places and character been moleculized and swaying in the strong wind was nice effect. And the mood transit between fear and melancholy which it successfully try to bring out but the explanation were so-so on why she was there and why there is such a world in the first place.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I watched it , its not scary. But thats not the point, i was attracted to the concept art and setting visuals when i see the trailer. So i watch liao, and i conclude the show suks monkey balls becoz<br><br>1. story sucks<br><br>2. transition between scene amateurish<br><br>3. at times, it seems like the story progressed to show more and more nice          scenes that served no purpose.<br><br>4. i watch halfway want to sleep<br><br>5. Very nice ending twist, BUT THE FINAL ENDING SO RETARDED and abrupt  it spoiled the "nice ending before that"<br><br>6. Character development abit bochap</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>worst movie of the year? it only showed u watch not much movie.<br>i can name much more movie this year that is much more worse.<br><br>the visual art provided by the movie though not very well, but i think are much nicer than most asian movie.<br>the storyline, i kind of like it, cuz it's goes to a twist at the ending, and it sets me thinking about what are the things i have left out/forgotton in my mind.<br>I think it's a good show if anyone with the right mind/understanding watches it.<br>especially the ending part, if you don't get what the ending is, then ya, you have wasted your 9.50.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>and last of all, i surely think it deserves more positive credit than what most people here had said. It's a rare chance where i can actually see some chinese show putting in effort on the visual art/storyline. rather than making some cheapskate horror movie, with no meaning, and just pure scaring/screaming/blood/loud music tp scare u..
