It's not a typical screamer, and because the picture is quite strange indeed, so I thought some pple might want to have a look.<br><br>If you're curious about this wierd looking doll (pple actually buy these dolls), and still wanna take a look, but if u have a weak heart or are easily shocked, simply turn off your speakers, to observe the picture.<br><br>It's not a typical screamer, in which they say, "look closely to spot the diff in the picture", and then a ghost pops up screaming its lungs off. There is some accompanying sound for this, but the image does not change, ie. the image (picture of the wierd doll) shown is all there is."<br><br><blockquote>wah! heng my browser only open 1/2-way!<br><br>seeing less than half the page was more than enough!<br><br>furthermore, it's the SEVENTH MONTH now leh.<br><br>u got such a bad heart...</blockquote>I replied, "Paiseh lah, mei you er yi de.<br><br>But the doll quite... erm, unique hor... got some pple like to collect this kind of dolls and put in their bedroom leh, even in Sg, i remember seeing one shop (can't remember where), had a collection of many such dolls... somemore that shop was closed and not lit, and had to peek through the dark glass to see these dolls staring back..."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I had earlier and elsewhere posted the link to a picture of a doll, that was rather interesting looking (originally designed as a 'screamer'):<br><br>http://lindsaylohannekkid.ytmnd.com<br><br>There has been a variety of responses on the doll. One one forum, someone submitted another url in reply, "If you think that's wierd for a doll, check this out - http://www.demonkidz.com/Custom.html ".<br><br>Now, unlike the "Lindsay Lohanne Nekkid" doll, which while alien-like (proportion of eyes, forehead, face) in appearance interpreted as eerie for some, still has some measure of asthethic quality (ignore the accompanying soundtrack), on the other hand, the "demonkidz" dolls (as the manufacturer calls them), are markedly different in nature.<br><br>( Caution - do not view if you are easily disturbed by these matters -<br>http://www.demonkidz.com/Kidz2.html<br>http://www.demonkidz.com/Custom.html )<br><br>Upon viewing the 'demonkidz' dolls, a wide variety of emotional reactions may be observed in different individuals. Ranging from feeling somewhat disturbed or unsettled, to outright disgust or loathing, to possibly a perverse 'demonic' lust for such 'beauty' for some (eg. the many loyal customers and fans of the 'demonkidz' doll series).<br><br>For myself however, like some others, what I felt was understanding and compassion. Not compassion or love for (ie. directed towards) the shadow/shell of darkness that is the demonic force as represented by the dolls, for that is but an illusion, the very existence of which based a lie of deception (see William Baldwin's writings). But compassion or love, for the Light within, the God essence within; as well as for the beings who might have been intruded/attached/possessed by these shadows/shells of darkness.<br><br>It is not helpful for people to react in fear of this darkness (which would only be feeding the lie), FEAR = False Evidence Appearing as Real; because such fear is born out of ignorance, and would only be feeding the lie, the deception that these beings fall under; and thus would only be detrimental to the person expressing the fear, as well as not truly helping/enlightening the dark force entity or demonic being in question.<br><br>For a better understanding, read my post on "Spirit Releasement and Dark Force Entities" :<br>http://infinity.hispeed.com/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1122476471<br><br>For a one-page summary of the "Sequence of a Demonic Spirit Releasement" (as utilized by Dr William Baldwin), ie. what to (ideally) do in a situation involving the demonic, see :<br>http://infinity.hispeed.com/Heart.Of.God/SRT/SpiritReleasementTherapy_TreatmentOfTheDemonic_pg324.gif<br><br>Hence, you need not, and should not, upset yourself in viewing these dolls, or when encountering these concepts involving the demonic, dark forces, and ghosts (more on this in a while). If you do, that's just fear, which is a *LIE*.<br><br>Instead, understand objectively the situation, and armed with total clarity and lucidity, expressing only love and compassion, take the personal stand of maximum assistantiality and cosmoethics.<br><br>Use this as an opportunity to re-affirm your dedication and committment to working closely and colleagially with the Guides &amp; Helpers, Angels &amp; ArchAngels, Ascended Masters, Evolutionary Orientors, Serenissimus and All Beings of the Highest vibrations; towards maximum assistantiality and cosmoethics.<br><br>Those with the proper training in Spirit Releasement Therapy, can proceed in their role as the SRT therapist, and carry out the "Sequence of a Demonic Spirit Releasement". The rest, will have to make do what they feel is most appropriate or helpful, such as their own prayers, methods, Vibrational State, seeking the assistance and guidance of their guides &amp; helpers, etc. But always acting not out of fear, but of compassion and love.<br><br>(However, as written in my other post, never engage the dark beings directly on any emotional level; the love is always for the Light within, and not for the illusion of the shadow/shell/cloak of darkess whose manifestation is based on a lie. See Baldwin's writings - http://infinity.hispeed.com/Heart.Of.God/WilliamBaldwin/index.htm ).<br><br>Hence, as to the concept of the demonic, all that's needed, is to be open to the possibility that there can be aspects of consciousnesses (usually non-human in origin) that have become so warped (due to the deception that they have no Light/God within), that they manifest an illusion of a 'shadow/shell/cloak' of darkness, so dark in nature, that it goes way beyond the realm of the human psyche. The darkness becomes as a 'non-alive' computer virus, rather than the soul of the person who wrote it (eg. out of bitterness).<br><br>This possibility, however, does not (need to) actually violate or alter any fundamental concepts that most Soul Retrievers and Therapists are already comfortable with, such as the healing power of Pure Unconditional Love. It just needs a bit of intelligent tweaking, ie. Would it be appropriate to send love to the computer virus, which has the programming capacity to misuse and abuse even love energy sent to it, and further its own dark intentions?<br><br>Or would it more correct/accurate/to-the-point, to instead send love to the soul of the person who created the computer virus, who upon contact, realizes that the bitterness he felt was in fact based upon false beliefs (see work of Byron Katie - *all* emotional suffering is based upon false beliefs), and the darkness is 'turned', the newly emerged being returns home to the Light of clarity and love, and dismantles the computer virus, which was never 'real' in the first place.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------<br><br>In the same vein, one should not fear ghosts (human psychotic post mortems). There are people who had replied indignantly, "This is the 7th Month of the Chinese calendar! The gates of hell are open and ghosts roam the mortal realm freely! How can you post this about this demon doll at a time like this!!!"<br><br>Again, this is fear. FEAR = False Evidence Appearing as Real. The ghost, correct term being "psychotic post mortem", or the human mind that becomes psychologically disturbed after death, being in a self-created state of confusion or psychological pain, due to similar patterns heavily present in the psyche at the time of death, or in the life of the individual, while he/she was alive.<br><br>Such psychotic post mortems need compassion and help (instead of more fear!), and are often vibrationally and psychologically beyond the reach of the guides &amp; helpers directly. That is to say, the assistance of intraphysical human incarnates is needed, to act as an intermediary for the guides &amp; helpers to contact, assist and free the psychotic post mortem ('ghost').<br><br>Such lightwork, is the focus of the "Out-Of-Body Ministry" or "Soul Retrieval" healing work, that is carried out by many individuals and groups, one of such are the individuals affiliated with Bruce Moen's work, ie. carrying out Soul Retrievals along the lines as conceptualized by researcher and author Bruce Moen - http://www.afterlife-knowledge.com<br><br>The International Academy of Consciousness also have their own methods for retrieval, deintrusion and healing, under the broad heading of "ConscientioTherapy" - http://www.iacworld.org<br><br>In conclusion, the time has come to let go of fear, and in its place, the light of understanding and clarity, motivated by the light of compassion and love within your heart. If you've not already done so, educate yourself on these matters of evolution and assistantiality now, and help to educate those around you who ask for it. Do it for your loved ones, if not for yourself. The time is Now.<br><br></div>
