In fact CHC has been brewing with rumours like 1 or 2 years back.. I can't be bothered to tell friends to avoid such stuff, because i have been tired doing this the past few instances.<br><br>MLM uses "helping you to succeed".. MLM exploits on kinship, and kin's kin, and kin's kin's kin.. and the list goes on..<br><br>CHC uses the name of religion to suck money from people.<br><br>In fact you can't really blame all of these conmen, james phang, or Kong Hee.<br><br>Remember these words, guys..<br>When there is a buyer, there is a seller.<br>When there is a conman, there is a person willing to be conned.<br><br>It always take 2hands to clap. (ignoring those circumstances where the other party is forced).<br><br>Now, when there is a conman, who is the guy willingly to be conned? Don't that guy has any form of basic intelligence before departing his own hardearned money?<br><br>And i come to one conclusion: (i am sorry to say it, but can't help it) Singaporeans are stupid.</p></div>

              <p>I am deeply disappointed that you equate donation to religious insitutions with MLM and even magnetic bed selling.</p>
              <p>These are 2 completely different things.</p>
              <p>Giving money to a religious body, is to do good, and is coming from the pureness of the heart.</p>
              <p>Obviously it is different with MLM or magnetic bed selling.</p>
              <p>Because it is not a business and it is not to gain profit.</p>
              <p>Of course how the money is managed is another matter. If some fund managers in religious institutions violated some ethics and diverted the money for wrongful purposes, then they are doing a wrong action. But this is different with the donator.</p>

              <p>I was born yesterday in the fridge. I am the twin brother of Meat Bao.</p>
              <p>Which part of what I said is naive and gullible?</p>
              <p>Did you not read my last paragraph.</p>
              <p>I said it already, if some fund managers do something wrong with the money, then the fault is theirs.</p>
              <p>But as donors, donors donate out of the pureness of their heart.</p>
              <p>These are 2 separate different layers.</p>
              <p>The layer of donor......there is only so much that a person can do.</p>
              <p>When people donate to NKF........what do you expect them to do? Make enquiries? Read financial statement ? Check to accountant office ? Ask to see receipts of financial transactions ?</p>
              <p>So are you saying those NKF donators are stupid and are the same with MLM practitioners and magnetic bed sellers?</p>
              <p>If tomorrow I see a beggar on the street and give him 5 dollars and buy a tissue from him, what do you expect me to do? Should I interview him first? Should I ask him what he would do with the money? Should I ask him whether he smoke and gamble or not?</p>
              <p>People want to do good is one thing, how the money is used is another thing.</p>
              <p>There should be some check and balance system, some independent supervisory body, to see how the donated money is managed. But I repeat again, this is at the layer of the fund management. This is not at the layer of the donator side.</p>
              <p>Doing good deed and donate money is not called "stupid" and "naive" or "gullible"</p>
              <p>I think there are certain people here who are rabid anti-something. In my opinion, they are closely bordering to extremists and fanatics.</p>

              <p>Nothing wrong to do charity but don't do it blindly.     It is naive to donate to charity thinking all charities are functioning for the good (I am speaking in general not addressing anyone in particular).   If possible, find out about the charities.</p>

              <p>So should we suspend such motivations ?</p>

              <p>If you intend to donate huge amount of money then be bothered to find out.    Sometimes info can be obtained from internet like probably donors may have written some complaints or so, but if nothing is being found out from the internet or other source then it is up to the donor.    What I do is if I know the charity organisation is not a credible one I will not donate.  For those that I have donated to and later read that the newspapers stating that they are not credible, I stop my donation to them.</p>

              <p>You never know how psychotic SOME church go-ers are... Their self-destructive actions of sinking and relying every single bit of their life on this hardly - clingable glimpse of hope from Almighty GOD.</p>
              <p>I used to be a church go-er, the act of having us giving up 5% of our weekly income to GOD is ridiculous (Again i emphasis it is just my PERSONAL opinion, you may or may not agree to)  The Almighty GOD will need us to hand over the 5% (which is nearly gst-ed off our income?) I won't mind the 5% as, it is not a big lump sum of money, however we're not given a choice to go for or to not go for the 5%, but we're somehow required to do it. If you overspent, u somehow disagree with GOD's teaching and is some unholy men...That is where the problem arises, we're not willing donors we're physco-ed into doing so, unhealthy it may be, nevertheless million of people are doing so right now this very minute.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'd like to say that, all in all, whatever happens it all happens from the root of evil - money $$$$$</p>

              <p>Please understand a bit about the 5% donation.</p>
              <p>I dont know about whether you feel "coerced"</p>
              <p>However there are people who send monthly check to NKF, UNICEF, all these organizations etc.</p>
              <p>It's same with religious donation.</p>
              <p>Some people want to donate a certain portion of their monthly income to do good, and just make it easier and make it automatic, like a giro arrangement.</p>
              <p>If someone feels "coerced" , then it is a different matter altogther.</p>
              <p>Nobody should be coerced to make donation.</p>
