I don't see why the truth should offend me.<br><br>You pretty much reiterated what I said about how 'the misguided few' is more and more becoming the norm instead of the exception. As I've mentioned in my experiences with Malays in the army, mediocrity is more and more becoming the norm, and those who strive to excel are increasingly viewed as heretics.<br><br>Which is why I said that while I agree with you that a major cleanup is needed, we can't entirely rely on the government for that. For change to happen, it has to come from within. We'll be kidding ourselves if we think we can always turn to the government as the magic bullet that will solve what ails the Malay race.<br><br>Without a change in mindsets, you can kick them in the backsides all you want, and all you get is a sprained ankle. So long as the Malay race refuses to look itself in the mirror and see the problems within, it will never reach the pinnacle of the mountain of society.<br></div>

It doesnt matter which race they hate.<br><br>From what i know, hatred towards the malays are not as bad as compared to the amount of hatred towards other minorities like the Indians and Caucasians.<br><br>coz in my whole life, i have seen chinese boys mixing well with malay boys. but i havent seen chinese boys with indians or malay with Caucasians.<br><br>even back from my secondary school days, i mixed along greatly with Chinese boys and girls. My best Friends were not even malays but CHINESE BOYS. I have to say that these chinese boys were gr8 to be with coz they very happennig yet not rowdy. The reason y i mix with chinese girls are coz they are simply cute.<br><br>But i never had the chance to mix around with Indian boys in Secondary school.<br>coz my school had only 4 indian boys and we are just too suey coz all 4 are troublemakers. thats y we never mixed with them.If only the government could do something about this..like having a rule that all schools should have a standardized percentage representing each race.<br><br>then i can bet with you that i can have the oppurtunity to mix around with better behaving indian boys.<br><br>i agree totally that all these trouble makers are the cause of the stereotype towards a particular minority group..In the case of a chinese boy, i know they hate those f#*king irritating malay Mats who is always out to create trouble.. the same goes for a malay boy who have equal amount of hatred towards the annoying Ah Bengs.<br><br>these scoundrels really potray a bad image of their own race and being normal people like us, we are always up to wrongly accuse or stereotype the races when we see these chaps.<br><br>Another factor which i find troubling is the fact that the older generation of ppl are also the ones that like to stereotype alot.<br><br>I think its time we erase off all these troublemakers, annoying aunties and racists off the grounds of Singapore..</div>

During their stay in their education, I found that the school do not really care them, let them do whatever they like. Only those who are concerned will try their best to help out. Students can also make friends with them and need not to be feel so scared and may distance themself away which is a not good pratice.<br><br>If you want a country to prosper, you need everyone to work together as different people have different ideas which can be integrated together and you are be able to experience it. Avoiding all the way, will not benefit at all and may lead you to be more anti-social. So, just mix around <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
