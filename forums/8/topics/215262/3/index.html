I'm kind of disappointed with my own race. Primary school and Secondary, we enjoy free education but yet look at the percentage of Malay undergraduates? I don't have the percentage and I might be stereotyping but its just too common that everywhere I go the ITEs are the malays hanging place. I'm not saying ITEs are a bad place but looking at the mats and minahs from ITEs you will know what kind of people they are.<br>In terms of Soccer, I DARE YOU THAT BASE ON TALENT, SG can take on the angmohs. The mats can ACTUALLY f<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>uckin play leh, BUT THE STINKING ATTITUDE is why we are still lagging far behind. SUPER F<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>UCKED UP attitude, its disappointing.<br>The best thing that I hate is how some of the malays blame the government for not giving enough chance for malays to do well. They say Chinese are controlling this country. That is a separate issue which I don't wanna touch on as I believe I'm in no position to comment about such stuff. But what irks me is that, these malays, are just playing the blaming game. Its disgraceful. I mean if you want to be succesful, bloody hell STUDY HARD &amp; WORK FOR IT!<br>For these various reasons, I'm striving hard in my own career path to make enough money to contribute to help and dive into the root of the problem, which is when these malay kids are young.<br><br>*disclaimer* I know I MIGHT be biased and stereotyping based on my own experiences but I take the risk to express it as a generalisation as I believe it is sufficiently significant in the current situations.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For instance,<br><br>You will see a typical Chinese man in Singapore working hard until night time, OT.<br><br>Yes, he is hardworking.<br><br>But he is very stressed, has little time, and cannot even find a wife.<br><br>This is true.<br><br>Then you will see a Malay man, 'not working so hard' but he will have a big family with 4 kids. On weekeds they will gather with cousins on void deck or their place, having a good time.<br><br>It's clear there is a difference in their world views.<br><br>Personally Im not sure which one is better. I certainly wont say the stressful life is better.<br><br>And....actually to expand on this....<br><br>Why some youth go to drugs or crime.....I believe it's the same reason with any other races or cultural groups, all youth sometimes get confused. However the most affected group is the group undergoing a major change, a shift, a disruption in their world view as well as environment.<br><br>I mean, look at American Indians, Australian Aborigines, etc groups with rapid environment change. There are alot also of drug abuse and crime. Why?<br><br>If white europeans never arrive in America, or Australia, maybe they will be having a different life, wont be so confused.<br><br>Not to say the situation is exactly the same with Singapore, but I bet there is a similar connection with cultural-aspects or environment-aspect, which make some of these youth confused and cannot integrate quickly into another set of mindset in the new environment dominated by another cultural group.<br><br>So again,<br><br>It's unfair to call Malays 'druggie'. I feel this is an incorrect term.<br><br>Maybe, less pressure to reform and more soft soft natural evolution way is better way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be brutally honest and transparent, there will always be some bias and discrimination from the way we have been brought up. It is only a question of degree. On my part, I grew up with many close Malay friends in primary school and have no problems with Malay colleagues. I cannot speak for every Singaporean Chinese but I think the Malay community should start helping themselves by stop being paranoid about racism and discrimination. Never let what is said bother you. Just focus on getting better and ahead in life. If every Malay has this ambition, the atreriotyping on Malays will change for action speak louder than words.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

If anything, to be contented with what you have and to lead a simple life is an achievement in itself.<br><br>But the big issue I have is with us Malays taking the concept too far and letting it metamorphose into 'tidak apa-thy'. I've seen too many Malays not doing well in life and trying to pin the blame on others instead of looking at their own lack of effort. When I was in the Army I'm sad to say that many of the Malays in my company felt that I was a heretic of sorts just because I'm was a A Level student and they had less education.<br><br>And I swear to God, I didn't treat them any differently just because they were any less educated. If anything, some of them saw past the education barrier and I became good friends with them. They were the ones who told me about all the backstabbing and politics that goes on behind my back. But as for the rest... they backstabbed me and whispered behind my back that I was snooty and arrogant just because I had higher education than them.<br><br>I'm a medic, and it has been drilled into my head to treat everyone equally, even if they are my enemies who have sworn to kill me. I see us all as soldiers with a common goal, but they refused to share that viewpoint.<br><br>Heck, I once overheard them talking about two PCs who had A Level education. I heard one of them say, 'I can't stand this 2LT Ismail who has a full A Level cert. At least for 2LT Ali, even though he was in JC, at least he dropped out of it! Now that's something for me to look up to!' (names changed to protect privacy)<br><br>You want to live the simple life, then that's your choice. But if you're going to blame others for your lack of success and diss them for putting in the effort and doing their best, I must protest.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, in my opinion, to remove all hatred towards the malay race, the government has to do something to reform the malay youths. From my observation, they are the main cause of racial issues. All my "racist" friends have issues against these malay youths, particularly those less educated ones, yet none have problems with the malay race as a whole.</div>

I don't have the percentage and I might be stereotyping but its just too common that everywhere I go the ITEs are the malays hanging place.
