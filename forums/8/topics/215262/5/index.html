            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tarZen:</div><div class="quote_body">On the note of racism in Singapore and racial harmony, I would like to relate an incident that just occurred to me on my way home on the MRT.<br><br>I was standing at the end of train where you could look out of the window and see the track(NE line). I was on the phone with my friend, when suddenly this group of 3 Indian kids, one about 18-19, the other about 9-10 came really close to me to look out onto the track. Now I've read that Indians tend to have a very different idea of proxemics than most other people. They have very small personal spaces, so they can stand very close to each other. From what I experienced just now and previous experiences, I think people should really learn to respect others' personal spaces in public, and not squeeze close up to strangers when there is no need to.<br><br>After a while they went to sit down nearby. I was still on the phone when I noticed one of the smaller boys point and me and say something to the older guy, and then that guy started glaring at me in a VERY hostile manner.<br><br>I know that most people in my shoes will choose to ignore this guy at this stage, but I'm just not that kind of person. I believe in leaving strangers alone, and when strangers break this rule with me, I get very offended. The other thing is I'm always astonished as to why people would like to "find trouble" in public with people they don't know, and I feel the need to know exactly why they do such things.<br><br>Which was why I asked him, "Why are you staring at me?" What followed was a lame conversation with him accusing me of staring at him first and him admitting to being a gangster. Throughout the whole trip he just stared at me with that fierce look, and I stared blankly back at him while continuing my converstation on the phone. He happened to alight at the same station as me as well and as I alighted I told him, "If you are not happy, just hit me right now." To which he suggested "meeting him outside to settle". Which of course I was not interested in, if he wanted to hit me he could jolly well do it infront of the public so that I can report him. After all I know a few close friends who are policemen who stayed just nearby.<br><br>In the end I bumped into a friend on the way out of the station and he didn't dare to follow me.<br><br>What I want to bring to attention with this anecdote are a few things. First of all, while we champion racial harmony, is it really unfair to those people(Chinese mostly) who habour ill feelings towards those from other races, when these minority races are not doing anything to justify otherwise? I've had many of these encounters before, and most of the time the offenders are either Indians or Malays. I want to make it clear that I always remind myself not to make generalizing judgments, and I have a few good Indian friends whom I admire as people. But certainly these other misbehaving Indians are not doing their own race a favour by behaving like this in public. Are minority races behaving like this because they feel a consistent threat of being the minority, and find such means to alleviate the feeling?<br><br>My other question is, what would you have done if you were in my shoes? I think most people would choose to ignore the guy, then I ask, are we to be socialized to accept such unprovoked intimidations and just pretend not to see it? I find myself always getting into such unpleasant situations because I tend to retaliate. Am I to convince myself that to exist happily in this world, I have to learn to accept that there will always be people behaving like this? Is there not the danger that not reproaching these people will further encourage and embolden them into more frequent and more severe misbehavings in public?<br><br>I wish the government would have another courtesy campaign. </div></blockquote>Tarzen, in my humble views and thoughts, I feel that your incident is more of a separate and individual issue which does not concern racial issues. The fact that they are of a different race is just simply a mere coincidence. Lets say, if you were to encounter something similar with someone your own race now, would your queries and theories be applicable now?<br><br>On your point <span style="color: red;">"I think people should really learn to respect others' personal spaces in public, and not squeeze close up to strangers when there is no need to."</span><br>This, I believe, has nothing to do with Indians for that matter. I have experienced similar things too except that they are not Indians but Chinese. So its not really a racial issue here I feel. But its more on each individual's level of tolerance. From what you have expressed yourself so far, it seems that you have a relatively low level of tolerance. Nothing wrong with that, different people have different level of tolerance.<br><br>*Hope I didn't offend you in my post. Just to clear out some misunderstandings  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Soccer in SG is very disappointing. 1st, I feel its kind of internalised. The players chosen are because they have connections and so on. Are there really talent scouts walking around looking for talents? Tell me the current batch of players are the best they can scout for? Probably can't be bothered..<br>2nd, believe me skyfoo when it comes to skill and techniques, malays are the dominant race. Of course I have seen Chinese and Indians with absolutely amazing skills, can match Ronaldinho, but majority of these skilfull guys are malays. BUT the problem with these malays are their stinking attitude. Those mats you see under the blocks being a nuisance and all, you will be amazed at some of the skills they can do. Because they lack discipline and attitude, the players that represent SG are not the best SG can offer. Believe you me, technically we can match brazillians.<br><br>Back to Tarzen,<br>Somehow I'm still not convinced. You see, these acts of gangsterisms I believe do not stem from the fact that the feel inferior as minorities. Heck, if I were to interview 100 non-minorities, I doubt any of them experience staring incidents as much as you do. If I were to interview 100 minorities, I still doubt that any of them purposely get into staring fights as they feel inferior as minorities. Heck, I doubt that they would even feel inferior. My point is basically that I believe these gangsterisms acts are independent issues that you faced somehow. Luck? Your mannerisms? Too good looking? I don't know, but definitely nothing near issues of racism.<br>For the Indians and personal space thing, the arguement and views can sway 2 ways. One is that, they should be aware and careful of the public's sensitivities and the other one can be argued that, you should be more tolerant enough to understand that different kind of people live in this world and sometimes you give sometimes you take.<br>Sometimes, when we experience things that affects our mentality and emotions intensely, we tend to form prenotations and stereotypes that could be biased and unjust when viewed from a third person perspective.<br>* I'm sorry, take note I don't mean to be harsh if I do come across as such in my posts..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
