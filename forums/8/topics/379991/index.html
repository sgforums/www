                  issued an ultimatum to Bruce's dojo to stop teaching non-chinese<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee#cite_note-66"><span>[</span>67<span>]</span></a></sup>.
                  Refusing to be told what to do or to discriminate who is allowed to
                  learn Lee had been challenged to a combat match with their top fighter
                  Wong Jack Man <sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee#cite_note-67"><span>[</span>68<span>]</span></a></sup>.
                  The formidable Wong Jack Man had mastery of Xingyiquan, Northern
                  Shaolin, and Tai Chi Chuan while being a direct student of Grand Master
                  Ma Kin Fung<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee#cite_note-68"><span>[</span>69<span>]</span></a></sup>.
                  The arrangement was that if Bruce lost he would have to shut down his
                  school, if he won then Bruce would be free to teach Caucasians or
                  anyone else<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee#cite_note-69"><span>[</span>70<span>]</span></a></sup>.
                  Wong stated that he requested to fight Lee after Lee issued an open
                  challenge during one of Lee's demonstrations at a Chinatown theater<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee#cite_note-70"><span>[</span>71<span>]</span></a></sup>.
                  However, contrary to this claimed motive is the signed formal letter
                  manifested by Dan Chan with signatures by the martial art community,
                  including Chan and Wong, as a petitioned document by the community does
                  not correspond to the motive of responding to an open challenge. "That
                  paper had all the names of the sifu from Chinatown, but they don't
                  scare me"<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee#cite_note-71"><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></a></sup> --Bruce Lee.

                  Lee (Bruce Lee's associate, no relation) and William Chen, a teacher of
                  Tai Chi Chuan. According to Bruce, Linda, and James Lee, the fight
                  lasted 3 minutes with a decisive victory for Bruce. "The fight ensued,
                  it was a no holds barred fight, it took three minutes. Bruce got this
                  guy down to the ground and said 'do you give up?' and the man said he
                  gave up."<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee#cite_note-73"><span>[</span>74<span>]</span></a></sup> --Linda Lee Cadwell. Reportedly, Wong Jack Man published his own
                  account of the battle in the Chinese Pacific Weekly, a Chinese-language
                  newspaper in San Francisco, which contained another challenge to Lee

                  Lee had no reciprocation to Wong's article nor were there any further
                  public announcements by either, but Lee had continued to teach
                  Caucasians.</span></p>

                  was frightening to see how easy it was for Bruce. The Tae Kwon Do black
                  belt mentioned that he knew Bruce had good hands, so Bruce said he
                  would only use his feet. They went pretty hard, and the guy really
                  tried to kick Bruce. Every time the guy kicked, Bruce got just barely
                  out of range, and just as the guy’s foot came down, Bruce held his kick
                  up to the guy’s face—a roundhouse kick right up to the guy’s nose or a
                  side kick up to the guy’s temple. This guy was putting everything he
                  had into getting Bruce, and Bruce was barely putting out any effort. If

                  sought to make a name for themselves by causing a confrontation with
                  Lee. A challenger had invaded Lee's private home in Hong Kong by
                  trespassing on the backyard to incite battle against Lee in combat. Lee
                  had finished the challenger violently with a kick from feeling
                  infuriated upon the home invasion. Describing the incident, Herb

                  asking him to jump down from the wall he was sitting on. Wall described

              <p>He did not challenge any chinese martial arts experts.</p>
              <p>If he is really so good, why didn't he challenge his master who teach him wing chun and defeat his master? I am sure he is not capable enough of doing that.</p>
              <p>If he is really so good he should also go to shaolin temple which have all the kung fu experts staying there and challenge them 1 by 1 and defeat them all than he will really be considered as a kung fu expert</p>

              <p>I not interested to know what he do. I am not impressed with his stunts like doing 2 finger push up etc.</p>
              <p>Why didn't he challenge his teacher Yip Man? Since his jeet kune do is a modification of wing chun and he claims that it removes all the unecessary steps, than it should be better than wing chun and he should be able to defeat his teacher.</p>

The arrangement was that if Bruce lost he would have to shut down his school, if he won then Bruce would be free to teach Caucasians or anyone else<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee#cite_note-69"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[70]</span></a></sup>.

However, contrary to this claimed motive is the signed formal letter manifested by Dan Chan with signatures by the martial art community, including Chan and Wong, as a petitioned document by the community does not correspond to the motive of responding to an open challenge.

Individuals known to have witnessed the match included Cadwell, James Lee (Bruce Lee's associate, no relation) and William Chen, a teacher of Tai Chi Chuan. According to Bruce, Linda, and James Lee, the fight lasted 3 minutes with a decisive victory for Bruce. "The fight ensued, it was a no holds barred fight, it took three minutes. Bruce got this guy down to the ground and said 'do you give up?' and the man said he gave up."<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee#cite_note-73"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[74]</span></a></sup> --Linda Lee Cadwell. Reportedly, Wong Jack Man published his own account of the battle in the Chinese Pacific Weekly, a Chinese-language newspaper in San Francisco, which contained another challenge to Lee for a public rematch<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee#cite_note-74"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[75]</span></a></sup>. Lee had no reciprocation to Wong's article nor were there any further public announcements by either, but Lee had continued to teach Caucasians.</span></span></p>

              community does not correspond to the motive of responding to an
              open challenge. "That paper had all the names of the sifu from
              Chinatown, but they don't scare me"<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee#cite_note-71"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[72]</span></a></sup> --Bruce Lee.
              Wong and witness William Chen stated that the fight lasted an
              unusually long 20-25 minutes<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee#cite_note-72"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[73]</span></a></sup>. Individuals
              known to have witnessed the match included Cadwell, James Lee
              (Bruce Lee's associate, no relation) and William Chen, a teacher of
              Tai Chi Chuan. According to Bruce, Linda, and James Lee, the fight
              lasted 3 minutes with a decisive victory for Bruce. "The fight
              ensued, it was a no holds barred fight, it took three minutes.
              Bruce got this guy down to the ground and said 'do you give up?'
              and the man said he gave up."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee#cite_note-73"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[74]</span></a></sup> --Linda Lee
              Cadwell. Reportedly, Wong Jack Man published his own account of the
              battle in the Chinese Pacific Weekly, a Chinese-language newspaper
              in San Francisco, which contained another challenge to Lee for a
              public rematch<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee#cite_note-74"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[75]</span></a></sup>. Lee had no
              reciprocation to Wong's article nor were there any further public
              announcements by either, but Lee had continued to teach
              Caucasians.</span></span></p>
