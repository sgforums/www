              <p>tv shows that huang feihong is so skillful that he is able to fly. like his low shallow kick he is able to do it in mid air. lol.</p>
              <p>wonder if this is true anot. if its true than I think he will be more powerful than bruce lee</p>

              <p>Its obviosly not from what I've read up before on his shadowless kick (I don't want to offend any of his fans)</p>
              <p>But it actually might just be an illiusion and speed technique sought of like the continues punches of Wing Chun but with the legs and the illusion is that he kicks his robe up so that when the attention of the opponent is diverted the speed of his kicks makes it look super fast and super blur.</p>
              <p>And again no offense to Huang Fei Hong's fans.</p>

              <p>But he is the son of one of the Ten Tigers and a master of many styles as well. So lets just say that Huang Fei Hong and Ip man are the the 2 Tigers after the Ten and Bruce is both Huang Fei Hong and Ip Man after them.</p>

              <p>   Fireng keep saying that bruce lee should use his fist to whack a iron head shaolin monk . Have he ever really use his bloody brain to think , in a fight you were suppose to find your enemys weakness and defeat him and not to stupidly use your fist to hit a perosn on the head knowing that he is a iron head practitioner .  One can see how stupid the TS is or maybe he really have zero experience in sparring thats why he keep making pointless suggestions . If he really keep insisting that bruce should fight his own teacher , then if TS had martial art knowledge , why didn't he do that himself ? And if he do not have the slightest knowledge of martial art  then please shut up .</p>
              <p>  Hey TS why don't you use your head to whack a cement wall ? Thats what you keep trying to say what . Whacking something that you know will be cause hurt to oneself . Or maybe he don't have the wisdom to apprehend what we were trying to say .</p>
              <p>  If he say that all martial art come from shaolin then all the more bruce lee shouldn't challenge shaolin monastry monk as it will be like challenging the founder of martial arts which is like the chinese idiom Qi Shi Mie Zu , to bully your master and to destroy your ancestor .</p>
              <p>   Guess its very obviouse that TS had very poor moral ethics and knowledge of chinese values . Hope he's not a chinese , don't disgrace us please .</p>

              <p>Values, Principles, Honor, This are the (Maybe) very things a Master would hold to themselves..</p>
              <p>But maybe its to keep a drive to keep improving maybe that is why Bruce Lee never wanted to prove he could be better? Maybe he wanted Ip Man as a drive to keep improving? Or maybe he did surpass his master but he didn't want it to be known publicly (I mean it in a conversation way, like they talk and believe that he have already surpassed Ip Man)</p>
