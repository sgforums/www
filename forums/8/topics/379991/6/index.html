              <p>I found this thread on a search engine and want to reply because there is so much rumor and misinformation posted in this thread about Bruce. I have trained with one of Bruce's very first students for over 15 years and I have met with several other of his later students and also had the pleasure of meeting Linda.</p>
              <p>To everyone saying Bruce's skill was overrated, you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. To make such a statement not only shows your true ignorance, it is insulting to Bruce and the millions of martial artists influenced by him. Bruce was able to shut down anyone he fought, before they could even get a hit off. Those of you keyboard warriors (not everyone reading this, obviously, just the ones who think they could have had a chance at beating Bruce in the street) would have been humiliated had you faced Bruce in a fight. Humiliated physicall, psychologically, spritually. You would either have thrown yourself at his feet and begged for training, or you would have never wanted to fight another human again in all your days on earth.</p>
              <p>Joe Lewis said Bruce was the fastest man ever to stand before him. Hawkins Cheung said that if this were the old west, Bruce would have been the fastest gunfighter.</p>
              <p>I don't have all day to address everything wrong in this thread but I will just cover the issue of whether Bruce was a "paper tiger" or if he really could fight (since most of the ignorance stems from the view that Bruce was only an actor and couldn't fight). Here are some quotes from those who actually knew and hung out with Bruce, not some idiot trolling message boards posting whatever they can pull out of their ass and passing it off as fact. Also quotes from those influenced by Bruce.</p>

              <p><strong>1958:</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>In the tournament consisted of twelve schools the three time champion British boxer Gary Elms was defeated by Lee by way of knockout in the third round in the 1958 Hong Kong Inter-School amateur <a title="Boxing" href="/wiki/Boxing"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Boxing</span></a> Championships by using Wing Chun traps and high/low-level straight punches. Hawkings Cheung, his fellow Wing Chun street fighter, witnessed the event.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>←Before facing Elms in the finals, Lee defeated Shen Yuen, Lieh Lo, and Yang Huang, all by way of knock out in the first round<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></span></a></sup>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Lee knocked-out Pu Chung, a <a title="Cai li fo" href="/wiki/Cai_li_fo"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Choy Li Fut</span></a> fighter, in the roof tops of Hong Kong in a 1958 Full-Contact match. The match was refereed by Sheun-Leung Wong</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>1959:</strong></p>
              <p>During Lee's initial training as a youth, he was as a member of the "Tigers of Junction Street," and was involved in numerous gang-related street fights. "In one of his last encounters, while removing his jacket the fellow he was squaring off against sucker punched him and blackened his eye. Bruce flew into a rage and went after him, knocked the fellow out, broke his tooth, broke his arm. The police were involved." The incident took place on a Hong Kong rooftop at 10 P.M. on Wednesday, April 29, 1959</p>
              <p><strong>1960:</strong></p>
              <p>In Seattle, Lee back-fisted and busted a man's nose after Lee saw him harassing a Chinese Girl. Lee was taking a walk. This fight was witnessed by James DeMile in 1960.</p>
              <p><strong>1962:</strong></p>
              <p>Lee knocked out Uechi,a Japanese black belt, in 11 seconds in a 1962 Full-Contact match in Seattle. It was refereed by Jesse Glover The incident took place in Seattle at a YMCA handball court. Taki Kamura says the battle lasted 10 seconds in contrary to Harts statement.</p>
              <p>Ed Hart states "The <a title="Karate" href="/wiki/Karate"><span style="color: #002bb8;">karate</span></a> man arrived in his gi (uniform), complete with black belt, while Bruce showed up in his street clothes and simply took off his shoes. The fight lasted exactly 11 seconds--I know because I was the time keeper—and Bruce had hit the guy something like 15 times and kicked him once. I thought he'd killed him."</p>
              <p>The fight ended by Bruce knocking Uechi the length of the gymnasium.</p>

              <p>Steve Golden, one of Ed Parker's black belts in kenpo, witnessed Bruce face a challenge from a TKD black belt.</p>
              <p>"It was frightening to see how easy it was for Bruce. The Tae Kwon Do black belt mentioned that he knew Bruce had good hands, so Bruce said he would only use his feet. They went pretty hard, and the guy really tried to kick Bruce. Every time the guy kicked, Bruce got just barely out of range, and just as the guy’s foot came down, Bruce held his kick up to the guy’s face—a roundhouse kick right up to the guy’s nose or a side kick up to the guy’s temple. This guy was putting everything he had into getting Bruce, and Bruce was barely putting out any effort. If it was for real, it would have lasted until the first kick."</p>
              <p>World Martial Arts Hall Of Fame member Richard Bustillo, former student and friend of Bruce, witnessed a man attempt to attack Bruce with a knife.</p>
              <p>“While a few of us were training, a guy asked Bruce if he actually thought he could stop his attack if he were to charge at Bruce with his knife. Well, Bruce told this guy to come at him with the blade, so the guy did. It was so fast when Bruce kicked the knife right out of the guys hand, before he could take more than two steps, that we were all left amazed by it…but, perhaps not as much as the guy who no longer held that knife.”</p>
              <p><sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference">Herb Jackson, friend and stunt of Bruce, describes what happened when a man trespassed into Bruce's home backyard and tried to challenge him.</sup></p>
              <p>Lee's eventual celebrity put him in the path of a number of men who sought to make a name for themselves by causing a confrontation with Lee. A challenger had invaded Lee's private home in Hong Kong by trespassing into the backyard to incite Lee in combat. Lee finished the challenger violently with a kick, infuriated over the home invasion. Describing the incident, Herb Jackson states,</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>"One time one fellow got over that wall, got into his yard and challenged him and he says 'how good are you?' And Bruce was poppin mad. He [Bruce] says 'he gets the idea, this guy, to come and invade my home, my own private home, invade it and challenge me.' He said he got so mad that he gave the hardest kick he ever gave anyone in his life."<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29"></a></sup></p>

The extra yelled that Lee was "a movie star, not a martial artist," that he "wasn't much of a fighter." Lee answered his taunts by asking him to jump down from the wall he was sitting on. Wall described Lee's opponent as "a gang-banger type of guy from Hong Kong," a "damned good martial artist," and observed that he was fast, strong, and bigger than Bruce.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></span></a></sup></li>

              <p>Please, let the man rest in peace and all of us enjoy the great contribution he made to the world. There will never be another like him in a thousand years. If you enjoy him as an actor, then enjoy his movies. If you want to train like him, do your best and it will make you a better person and a better warrior in life. If you don't like Bruce, that is fine but do not ever think, in a million years, that you could have beaten him. Instead of trying to put down a legend, which you will never be able to do, why not put your energy into trying to improve the world or at least contribute something positive to others.</p>
