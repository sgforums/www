              <p><br>Actually I am not sure whether Ed Parker defeated Bruce Lee but judging from his bio, he is quite a martial art expert so it could be true that he defeated Bruce Lee.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But Wing Chun was pretty much an unknown skill until Yip Man started spreaded it by recruiting students to learn it so I guess he could be angry with Bruce Lee for not spreading Wing Chun instead?</p>

              <p>Well most people dont know this but Bruce Lee discarded most of the Wing Chun he grew up learning (after his fight with Wong Jack Man when he chased him up and down for too long) and started studying and incorporating alot of Fencing and boxing principles into his martial art which he calls Jeet Kune Do. Prior to that, his martial art was known as Jun Fan Gungfu . <br><br>Fireng, u obviously know nothing much about martial arts because u cant tell the difference between performing and fighting....hence the needless debate about shaolin monks vs bruce lee. If u dig up on youtube, you'll be able to find a video on kyokushin karate black belt beating up a shaolin monk in a sparring match.</p>
              <p>JKD was an ever evolving art while Bruce Lee was still alive and hence he had to disband his schools when he realised what he was doing was no longer the same as what his students were learning in his schools (taught by his senior students). He was also too busy to teach and hence only shared his most up to date knowledge with a private group of close friends and martial artists.<br><br>JKD is not a mix of 27 different martial arts nor is it modified wingchun as many people believe. Also alot of ppl misquote JKD as just a mix of martial arts because Bruce Lee said something like if you teach a guy 6 months of boxing and wrestling and he will destroy many traditional martial artists. He was actually just mocking the martial arts who did not practise resistance training (e.g. sparring or live fighting) </p>
              <p>If JKD must be defined, The best way to define it would be as Bruce Lee's personal style of fighting(with principles which he researched on) which in my opinion is very advanced especially during his era and you'll see this same style being employed by more successful fighters in the ring( major similarity but with variation of course) especially later in their careers when they become more experienced in fighting.</p>
              <p>Some examples are Samart Payakaroon (muaythai), David Hayes (boxing), Lyoto Machida (MMA) and even Manny Pacqiao shows such traits.</p>
              <p>I train in Jeet Kune Do under Mark Stewart whos a private student of Ted
              Wong ( also attended his seminar before).  Ted Wong is the last student of
              Bruce Lee and spent the most hours training with him.</p>
              <p>Hope I have enlightened some of you....</p>

              <p>The fact is that throughout the centuries, shaolin monks have used their martial arts to participate in wars and defeated their enemies using their martial arts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1 such example is the shaolin monks during the Ming dynasty used their superior martial art skills to defeat the Japanese pirates. So the saying that shaolin kung fu is just a performance is nonsense.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, there were some saying that Bruce Lee did not really defeat Wong Jack Man as Wong did not use his full skills to fight with Bruce Lee for fear that he might kill Bruce Lee.</p>
