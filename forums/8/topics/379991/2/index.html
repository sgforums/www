              <p>Bruce Lee is a martial art legend more so than a screen legend.  In the excerpt posted by the thread starter, it can be seen that Bruce Lee was first and foremost a street fighter.</p>
              <p>It is also noted that he was a hot head but usually fight only when challenged.  He has defeated many martial artists with inpunity, and all those who had witnessed his fights and those who had fought him had high respect for his ability.</p>
              <p>So I am not sure what the thread starter is trying to do to disparage his image as a legend saying that he has not fought with all the martial experts and the kickboxers in Thailand.</p>
              <p>I don't think all his exploits were recorded. </p>
              <p>I am sure if these martial experts and kickboxers challenge him to a fight, I am sure he wouldn't have backed down.</p>
              <p>In his short lifetime, he had fought from the streets to the competitions and to the screen.  I don't many competitive fighters in the world today had such an experience as his.  Fighting in the streets and fighting in a competition are very different; a person who trained in a school such as the Shaolin Temple for years and only fought in a competitions and controlled sparing sessions will never fight like a street fighter who has to fight for his life.</p>
              <p>Bruce Lee is dead for many years.  He is a legend to many.  Let's show him some respect and let the legend lives on. </p>
              <p>No point arguing that he is overrated when he can't be here to defend himself.  Perhaps the thread starter thinks he is a better fighter than Bruce Lee or perhaps he has a hero whom he thinks is better than Bruce Lee.  Well, then...don't do the same mistake as Bruce Lee, go and challenge all the Kickboxers and martial arts experts in Shaolin Temple.</p>

              <p>So tell me what are you trying to prove? Because he is dead

              <p>Are you sure that bruce lee have to fight for his life? I never read any of that in his biography.</p>

              manifested by Dan Chan with signatures by the martial art
              community, including Chan and Wong, as a petitioned document by the
              community does not correspond to the motive of responding to an
              open challenge. "That paper had all the names of the sifu from
              Chinatown, but they don't scare me"<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee#cite_note-71"><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></a></sup> --Bruce Lee.
              Wong and witness William Chen stated that the fight lasted an
              unusually long 20-25 minutes<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee#cite_note-72"><span>[</span>73<span>]</span></a></sup>. Individuals

              (Bruce Lee's associate, no relation) and William Chen, a teacher of
              Tai Chi Chuan. According to Bruce, Linda, and James Lee, the fight
              lasted 3 minutes with a decisive victory for Bruce. "The fight
              ensued, it was a no holds barred fight, it took three minutes.
              Bruce got this guy down to the ground and said 'do you give up?'
              and the man said he gave up."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee#cite_note-73"><span>[</span>74<span>]</span></a></sup> --Linda Lee

              battle in the Chinese Pacific Weekly, a Chinese-language newspaper
              in San Francisco, which contained another challenge to Lee for a
              public rematch<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee#cite_note-74"><span>[</span>75<span>]</span></a></sup>. Lee had no
              reciprocation to Wong's article nor were there any further public
              announcements by either, but Lee had continued to teach
              Caucasians.</span></p>

              said he would only use his feet. They went pretty hard, and the guy
              really tried to kick Bruce. Every time the guy kicked, Bruce got
              just barely out of range, and just as the guy’s foot came down,
              Bruce held his kick up to the guy’s face—a roundhouse kick right up
              to the guy’s nose or a side kick up to the guy’s temple. This guy
              was putting everything he had into getting Bruce, and Bruce was
              barely putting out any effort. If it was for real, it would have

              in the path of a number of men who sought to make a name for
              themselves by causing a confrontation with Lee. A challenger had
              invaded Lee's private home in Hong Kong by trespassing on the
              backyard to incite battle against Lee in combat. Lee had finished
              the challenger violently with a kick from feeling infuriated upon
              the home invasion. Describing the incident, Herb Jackson states
              "One time one fellow got over that wall, got into his yard and
              challenged him and he says 'how good are you?'. And Bruce was

              Lee answered his taunts by asking him to jump down from the wall he
              was sitting on. Wall described Lee's opponent as "a gang-banger

              <p>Frankly speaking after reading his fights I think his skills is
              over rated. It seems that he is only capable of defeating americans
              and japanese martial arts experts.</p>
              <p>He did not challenge any chinese martial arts experts.</p>
              <p>If he is really so good, why didn't he challenge his master who
              teach him wing chun and defeat his master? I am sure he is not
              capable enough of doing that.</p>
              <p>If he is really so good he should also go to shaolin temple
              which have all the kung fu experts staying there and challenge them
              1 by 1 and defeat them all than he will really be considered as a
              kung fu expert</p>

              <p>Errr...prove what?  I am not here to prove anything.  Just replying to your stance that Bruce Lee is overrated as you pointed out in your initial statement.</p>
              <p>As you have pointed out in the excerpts that he grew up fighting in the streets in gang fights. Aren't there always an element of danger in such a fight?  Even in a sanitized country like Singapore today, it is not unheard of people being killed in a gang fight, what more in the time during Bruce Lee's youth in Hong Kong streets.</p>
