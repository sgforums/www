            <div class='col-md body'>Just a starter for discussion. Basic argument for anyone doing philosophy of religion 101. It can be proven either way of course but i would like to ONLY hear your philosophical comments.<br><br>Premise 1. If there is a God, He must be morally good, omnipotent and omniscient.<br><br>Premise 2. There is evil and suffering  in this world.<br><br>Premise 3. If He is omniscient, He KNOWS there is suffering and evil.<br><br>Premise 4. If He is omnipotent, He HAS THE ABILITY end evil and suffering.<br><br>Premise 5. If He is morally good, He WOULD wish to end evil and suffering.<br><br>Premise 6. If He could stop it and would stop it BUT doesn't know about it - He is not omniscient.<br><br>Premise 7. If He knows about it and wishes to stop it but can't - He is not omnipotent.<br><br>Premise 8. If He knows about it and could stop it but chooses not to - He is not morally good.<br><br>Conclusion: Therefore no such God exists.<br><br>edit. correction as someone pointed out: Premise 6 should read 'omniscient' and NOT 'ominpotent' as I earlier wrote. cheers<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 22 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Old problem, any student of theology would<br>know this problem as the Problem of Evil.<br><br>It basically says that given God's qualities<br>and what we are observing of the world now<br>(evil exists), the set of facts is internally<br>inconsistent. That is, inside this set of<br>claimed facts, some facts must be wrong.<br><br>Christians resolve this by stating that free<br>will is given to us, do you really that<br>resolves the whole contradiction?

If you want<br>to be totally logical and reasonable about<br>this.<br><br>Since God is omniscient (knows everything),<br>He already knows who is going to inherit the<br>Kingdom of God, why does God even need to<br>test? since he already knows the answer?<br><br>And I think you have missed the whole gist of<br>the Problem of Evil.

            <div class='col-md body'>The notion of "Free Will' in the christian sense is also problematic. If we assess it as the ability to choose or express ourselves without hinderance of any nature it fails because it turns paradoxical.<br><br>For example: Christianity says that only a belief in God will provide eternal life. Any other belief - other religions, atheism and even agnosticism - would lead to damnation. This in itself is a hinderance. Lets use an analogy. If I give someone the choice of chicken soup and beef soup and tell him he is free to choose either, but hold a gun to his head and say however, if he chooses chicken soup I will pull the trigger, this surely removes the nature of free will from his decision.<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I should like to object to a number of difficulties with what is being claimed in this thread.<br><br>1.)  It is not true that IF there is a God THEN he MUST be omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent.  It is just that in most traditional theistic conceptions, He does indeed have these properties.<br><br>2.)  There is no LOGICAL contradiction in the conjoint claims that God is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent.<br><br>3.)  The Free Will Defence (FWD) is logically compatible with the three central theistic tenets and does explain moral evil.  It presupposes that a world whereby humans have free will is better than one where they do not.<br><br>4.)  God's omniscience would suggest that he knows at the time of creation (and before) those who will and will not be saved.  There is no test.  (This claim is consistent with Reformed/Calvinist theology).  Consider the formulation of God's omnniscience in modal logic, that is: necessarily(if A, then God knows A).  It should be reasonably clear what follows from this.<br><br>5.)  Augustine suggested that evil was the privation of good. (POG)  This presupposes a standard of goodness and this is determined by God.  Augustines resolution of the problem of evil employing both FWD and POG is widely considered an adequate response by theists and atheists alike in response.<br><br>6.)  If you consider this an adequate disproof (which it plainly is not) of the existence of God, I would refer you to Plantinga's modal formulation of the Ontological Argument. It is an extremely strong and hitherto unrefuted proof FOR the existence of God.  I imagine it is available in any decent library.<br><br>------------------<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ontological argument. Tsk a rather faulty<br>argument for God.<br><br>I do not really know whether the version of<br>of Ontological Argument is same as Platinga's<br>one. I have never read Platinga before.<br><br>But if they are not much different, then<br>ontological argument is a bullshit argument<br>for God.<br><br>Before I say anything. Let me explain what is<br>Ontological argument first. Ontological<br>argument purports the philosophic stance that<br>by virtue that moralistic feelings and hidden<br>yearning for God in our minds are the best<br>proof for God, for God has placed those<br>feelings in us for us to feel/yearn for God.<br><br>That is bullcrap.<br><br>Considering these 2 things<br><br>1) That ideas of God and morality have been<br>placed in your mind against your will and<br>wishes! That is the role of the<br>establishment, to build into you those so<br>called "values" so that a social security<br>can be maintained.<br><br>2) If a baby is born and placed in a<br>deserted place for 21 years without any<br>human interaction, this baby will not have<br>any so called installed yearning for God<br>or moralistic feelings.<br><br>Ontological argument is another one of those<br>sad examples of Nietzsche's Will to Power.<br>That man tries to fantasise all these<br>nonsense to address his own inadequacies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Van Til,<br><br>Let me reiterate Plantinga's Ontological Argument for those not familar with it.<br><br>According to Plantinga's OA, it establishes a world where there is a being with Â‘maximal greatnessÂ’. Unfortunately (as Plantinga himself admits) this argument does not establish that there is a God in the actual world. It establishes that there is something with maximal greatness. But being maximally great does not mean having the attributes traditionally ascribed to God.<br><br>Plantinga therefore introduces the notion of Â‘maximal excellenceÂ’, which he thinks of as a possible property connected with maximal greatness.<br><br>Quote<br>Â“The property has maximal greatness entails the property has maximal excellence in every possible world. Maximal excellence entails omnipotence, omniscience and moral perfection.Â’<br>Unquote<br><br>Now, maximal greatness is possibly exemplified. There is a possible world where there is a being who is maximally great. Hence, in any possible world this being has maximal excellence. And it follows from this that our world there is a being who has maximal excellence, which is to say that there is actually a God whose existence follows from his essence and who can thus be thought to exist in reality by reasoning that counts as a form of the OA.<br><br>This of course leads us away from the Problem of Evil and the moral and logical complications and contradicts I wanted to elicit from my initial post. The OA brings about another whole set of critique which non-philosophy trained people here might find hard to contribute to.<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terence,<br>I think your analogy of choosing Eternal life and Damnation parallel with a bowl of chicken soup and beef soup is totally unfair. Your analogy only assumed that there is only one influence on the decision, ie telling the person if he chooses the chicken soup, it's death.<br><br>Well, in Christian context there is also the Deceiver who is at "Prince of this world" and one who is at work to draw us away from God. That's what he did in the Garden of Eden and that's what he's been doing since then. His sole purpose is to deceive humans of the existence of God, he wants to be greater than God. IF he manage to convince that God doesn't exist (choosing the chicken soup) he "wins". God has given us free will. He gave Adam free will, God specifically told him not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. For if he ate from it, he shall surely die (spiritually). it's the same as pointing the gun at you right? but under Satan's sweet talk and tempting, Adam chose to eat it. He chose to go against God commands and be his own god.<br><br>To everyone,<br>This is what's written in the Bible and this is what I believe in. Whether you believe what I say, it's up to you.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>I have personally experienced God and He is real to me. I'm sure there are lots of awful things happening right now that if I got to know about it, I can't explain why God allowed it to happen. Any god in the other religions would have their reasons behind things that happen. But as humans, we simply won't know why.  His ways are not our ways and His thoughts not our thoughts. He is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent. if He wants to prove His existence and force everyone to believe and acknowledge Him, He can easily do so, but I'm sure that's not what He wants. Whether He exists or not, you just have to take that step of faith and allow Him to work in your life. I'm by doing so, you'll live life to the fullest.<br><br>p.s.<br>I believe no baby can survive in the desert for 1 week, let alone 21 years.

            <div class='col-md body'>Iamsilly,<br><br>No, I am not being unfair at all. If you want to strip the logic behind the operation of Free Will to its bare mechanics then my soup analogy shares the same operative features. The Deceiver concept may be co-opted into all that is antithesis to the values that procure Eternal Life. Whether there is a Deceiver or evil bowl of chicken soup, they are contradictory to these values where one is suppose to choose the latter over the former under the conditions of Free Will. Hence there may be a Deceiver who seeks to seduce your poor sweet soul but under the auspices of Free Will you are MEANT to reject him by exercising your Free Will Â– which is already contaminated by a rigged premise.<br><br>The fact that Adam was sentenced to spiritual death by choosing that which was not Â‘allowedÂ’ shows the fallacy of Free Will. Free Will should mean that Adam could munch on apples all day from the Tree of Knowledge and STILL be safe from Â‘deathÂ’.<br><br>General,<br><br>To defeat the Problem of Evil argument, one can show how Premise 5 above is flawed. There is no logical reason why moral goodness cannot co-exist with evil. Premise 8 as well, the decision not to prevent evil does not automatically suggest the lack of moral goodness.<br><br>A lot hinges on the definition of moral goodness. What does it mean to say that Â“God is GoodÂ”? For instance, do we have to believe that goodness of God is the same as moral goodness?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, just wondering here, but how about modifying MsSuess' idea from testing to teaching? afterall, many people believe that life on earth is simply a 'stage', a small little station in the whole railway network... perhaps it's all for us to learn? an analogy would be... schools. in schools, students are put through the '18 stages of hell'. tests that never end, homework that keeps pouring in, teachers that never cease screaming... ahh!!! and you ask, what's the point?? why do i have to disect a frog to see it's circulatory system when i already know it exists? why do i have to spent an hour making sure my titration is perfectly accurate when the teacher already knows the answer? why do i have to be tested when the textbook already exists? why do i have to go through all this crap?? maybe "life's" like that in a way.. not a test, but a lesson. and just like in 'real-life', it's only when you get out of 'school' that you realise how easy it had actually been....<br><br>=======================================<br>DISCLAIMER: i don't actually believe in this (how could i? i just thought of it!) but just felt like playing the devil's advocate and argue a little.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> once again, comments anyone?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>iamsilly,<br><br>Yes, I hear what you are saying. However,<br>I believe understanding the nature of what theology defines as Free Will is important because it as an ideology, the notions of Free Will and the Eternal Life/Damnation dichotomy are logically incompatible.<br><br>I understand what you mean by saying a Christian tells a non-Christian about God's promise and leaves it to him/her to decide. Christians say this is Free Will but it is not because the premises are already rigged by the Eternal Life/Damnation dichotomy. You don't have to enforce the 'choose or be condemned' because it is already implicit in the introduction of the choice.<br><br>cheers</div>

Sometimes can't understand the way some people phrase their sentences with bombarstic words and complex structure. Too cheem for me mah.<br><br>Anyway, just to add on to the Adam and Eve issue. I think God really didn't give free will, He would have not put the tree of knowledge of good and evil there in the first place. He had made man ruler of this earth, everything under the sky was his, He made him a wife, Adam had direct fellowship with his Creator. Hey, isn't he the luckiest?

            <div class='col-md body'>ngkaihoe:  Your notion of proof leaves a great deal to be desired.  A logician will tell you that a proof for it to be acceptable must be both logically valid in form and have as its starting point true premises.  What do you consider a proof?<br><br>Furthermore, your characterisation of the ontological argument is not merely inaccurate but wildly wrong.  It has nothing to do with God putting ideas into our heads that we might recognise Him.  I suggest you do your research or reading more thoroughly.  The ontological argument is one that shows the necessary (in the logical sense) existence of God.<br><br>I suggest you read Plantinga's argument.  It has not been well characterised here, although a valiant attempt has been made.  Might I also direct you to the writings of Cornelius Van Til for a discussion of the logic of the transcendental arguement for the existence of God and the place of our presuppositions in argument.  Van Til demonstrates that evidentialist objections to the existence of God are without firm basis.  The God that he defends is the Christian one and not merely some vague omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent entity.</div>

Hence by using FW, they can align the notion of evil with the notion of good, by creating the possibility to explain God's existence in this world (in which there is evil). Now, by using the concept of FW, theological arguments have not considered theological dogma of which basically says believe in God or go to hell. Its that simple. Hence by using FW to explain God's existence, they imply that the choice between good and bad has already been prefixed. (Good means choosing God and not choosing God is wrong). For since hell awaits those who exercise Free Will to choose something other than God. The concept of FW collapses in itself.</div>
