            <div class='col-md body'><br>I am getting sick of this redneck drawl so I might as well revert back to good ole English with a touch of Singlish please.<br><br>Yes, back to the point of dating someone's boyfriend or girlfriend in my case. Since you don't appreciate my attempt at humour, i shall engage you in your own ground then.<br><br>Since i wish to debate this issue with you respectably, I shall apologise for my satire before. Yes...back to the issue. Is me dating somebody from this forum, and the fact that she is well known for being attached, a constant thorn in your morality? If so, I am sorry. The world is such as it is, so buck up and adapt to it. If she's your gal I am dating, well, I am sure you have the generosity of a New Age Man (another piece of propaganda in my opinion)to allow your gal the opportunity right? Or are you going to, to phrase my redneck personality, use a gun to enforce your rule over her?<br><br>*Chuckle*<br><br>If my appearance in somebody's cosy little relationship is causing unnecessary pain and humiliation, I shall bow out of it. By the way, are you acting so gung ho about it because you view it as a treasonable act, after all, they did hang people for immoral behaviour in the 16th century.<br><br>As for the woman I am going to date (most likely not, since it arouses such fury from the people in here), she is a terrific lady. All I can say, her boyfriend is a very lucky guy. I am still in the midst of growing up, but dear manhunt, you should too. After all, although this might not be the swinging 60s, I feared that your attitude towards relationship is sadly misplaced in time.<br><br>"I am not suffering from insanity.

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't really know. I try to be more adaptive after failed relationships and I think this is something you have to discuss with your partner. Dating to me is an outing with some seriousness and feelings included so I don't really like the idea.<br><br>However I wouldn't really mind if my partner has many friends of the opposite sex as I do too. Lifestyle is defined by yourself so I think if one partner is to date others it is something that should be discussed rationally and calmly too.<br><br>Of course my preference leans towards no dates but plenty of friend to friend outing is perfectly fine as long as no hanky panky goes on. I'd trust her but not the guys too so it works both ways.<br><br>Perhaps it would be more helpful if someone defined dating as a situation, not only as a word.</div>

Try harder to find out more evidences to prove all this are my nick. People like Evilfry, bear bear, Formatted are all my nick? Althought I got plenty of nick in this forum. This is my one and only nick in this topic. So carry on finding out who is my friends in this topic.<br><br><blockquote><strong>mille... dun u think by taking your personal dispute out in the open abit too shameful? Whatever u posted so far... showed everyone very clearly that u r a big liar... u lied abt knowing manhunt and u lied abt joking with hata-san of him being scarastic.</strong></blockquote>Manhunt decided to post out his comment is his business. Just look who is the one who started everything and who is the one who bring out the whole dispute here. You want to talk about shameful? Just look at yourself. Get involve in somebody else business and now trying to act hero here. Don't give me all this crap.<br><br><blockquote><strong>btw, hata-san wrote abt the stabbing thing was meant to be a joke... and so I am awaiting for one of you to say that u r joking too... which u did say to read with a pinch of salt what... so now who's talking?</strong></blockquote>Everything is meant to be a joke. Everything in forum is a joke. So where is the joker? Ask him to come out and entertain leh. I waiting for more joke.<br><br>------------------<br>Actions are not to be done to the extreme.<br>Words are not to be said to the extreme.<br>If things are done to the extreme.<br>Fate will bring you to the extreme.</div>

So your chance is here now.<br><br>Who is the one who started everything? Who is the busybody who started everything? Just look at the damn bloody topic. Now trying to push all the blame on me? Hatasan refuse to come in, so you post everything on his behalf. Even what I talk to him privately you also want to interfere.<br><br>Don't try to push all the blame on me. Who is trying to show everything here? Tell me, who is trying to show everything here? All the while you are just trying to be bossy, trying to get revenge for Hatasan. Hatasan cannot settle things between us, so you try to lump everything here to settle.<br><br>You thought I do not wish to settle with Hatasan? Things could be easily settle if not for his so call "friend" trying to create more problem here. Don't tell other to stop if you yourself got no intend to stop in the first place.
