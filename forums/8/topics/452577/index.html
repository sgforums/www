              <p>One professor I knew of in Canada once commented that Singaporeans are illiterated in 3 languages and is in the danger of becoming second class to every other nationalities.  I fully agree with him.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans go around speaking "Singlish" and yet sneer at others, particularly other Asians, who does not speak English like they are bona fide English people.  Their culture - well if Singapore has any culture- is a jumble of what is essentially Asian with a propensity to ape the "Hollywood" culture and then claim they are "westernized".  It is amusing to meet  Singaporeans spouting Singlish with a western name and pretending to be a European infront of other Asians.  They try to ingratiate themselves to the Europeans by criticizing Asiand- particularly Chinese.</p>
              <p>They are so insecure as to be condescending to other Asians who are poorer than them and to criticized other Asians who are better than them.</p>
              <p>They confused the issue of "Race" and "Nationality" - Nationality can be changed but race is genetically determined. </p>
              <p>Singaporeans should realize that when the chips are down, you are Asians ,and particularly the Singaporean Chinese are Chinese, and the western countries will not help you but call to you, you  fucking chinks go home.</p>

              <p>All these problems are mainly due to peranakan control of Singapore. The main trouble maker and destroyer of native cultures is Lee Kuan Yew.</p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The problem with Singapore is that during Independence a tiny group of minority peranakans controlled power.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">But population of Singapore is not peranakan, they are dialect chinese, malays and indians.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">That is the problem of Singapore.</p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">They are confused by Lee Kuan Yew, by PAP state media. Actually things are relatively simple.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">There is no profound logic behind Lee Kuan Yew's policies of suppression of dialects, promotion of english as dominant, destruction of chinese schools at all.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Lee Kuan Yew is a peranakan. He is from minority group. He feels threat from the chinese in Singapore. So his every move is aimed with the potential threat of chinese overthrowing peranakan control at the back of his mind.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan yew can be said to be the top bastard of Singapore.  </p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #333333;">What makes Singapore different? The majority of Singapore's population is ethnically Chinese, but Singapore is largely free of corruption, has sound institutions and the rule of law dominates. It's nothing like China.</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The answer lies in a historical division in Singapore's Chinese community between the babas and the sinkeh.</span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #333333;">The sinkeh, comprising the majority of the city-state's population, were the recent immigrants from China, or whose parents were born in China. They spoke Chinese, lived like Chinese and considered themselves overseas Chinese. In Indonesia, such Chinese were called the totok.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The babas, on the other hand, also known as Straits Chinese, were Chinese more in name than practice. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong></strong><span style="color: #333333;">They were the descendants of the very early Chinese immigrants (Hokkiens from the Fujian province) to the straits settlements of Malaya (Penang, Singapore and Malacca). They assimilated with both the local Malays and the colonising British, whom they especially admired. The babas developed their own culture, cuisine and language - Malay liberally sprinkled with Hokkien.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #333333;">The sinkeh were the traders, the coolies and the shophouse owners. The babas became the lawyers, the civil servants and the politicians; they attended the local English-language schools run in the tradition of the UK's public schools, and Oxford and Cambridge. If the sinkeh received an overseas education at all, it was in Nanking or another university in China.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #333333;"> Although the sinkeh dominated Singapore's population,</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> it was the babas who dominated public decision-making. In effect, a baba minority captured sinkeh Singapore, and that minority's attitudes were more those of Victorian England than China</span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;">.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #333333;">It was the babas who were the framers of Singapore's rules and institutions. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #333333;">Many of Singapore's most prominent Chinese have had baba backgrounds. </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee Kuan Yew, who became prime minister of Singapore aged just 35, is the most obvious example. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">He claims a Hakka heritage, although his upbringing was that of a baba: at home, he spoke English with his parents and baba Malay to his grandparents. "Mandarin was totally alien to me and unconnected with my life," Lee said of his childhood.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #333333;">For Lee, Chineseness was an acquired skill and later a political necessity. </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He was not brought up as a Chinese with a focus on China, but as a baba who looked to England. </span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;">He followed the conventional career path of a baba and went to London to study law. And so Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore became Harry Lee of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. His father had given him and two of his brothers English, as well as Chinese, names. </span></p>

Goh was born in 1918 in Malacca, the epicentre of baba culture, into a baba family. His parents were English-oriented Chinese Methodists.</p>

Singapore's current prime minister Lee Hsien Loong has the strongest baba pedigree of any of the country's leaders.</p>

              <p>Imo, your 'they' only represent a minority of Singaporeans - eps, 
              those who speak very 'slang' english. I have nothing against western 
              countries, just disagree with your gerneralised statement.</p>
              <p>Hollywood movies are popular all around the world. This is not exclusively in Singapore. Avatar, Titiaic, Harry Potter and many others had enjoyed huge success all around Asia - it isn't a 'unique Singapore' situtaion.</p>
              <p>If
               u look at the popularity of Korean pop(SNSD, Super Junior), Taiwan(Jay 
              Chou, Show Luo) and Japan(L'arc, Naruto, One Piece, Final Fantasy), it's
               hard to conclude Singaporeans(or most) incline to western culture.</p>
              <p>No
               doubt we are heavily influenced by the western culture, but that 
              doesn't mean we go around criticize and disregard other Asians' culture.
               In fact, I hardly see/hear any criticism(in a condescending manner) of 
              other Asians - except China, North Korea, Myanmar</p>
              <p>Why are they scrutinized? It has alot to do with their current human right records. Then again, Singapore's human rights records aren't anywhere good either. If u read foreign news, u should noe Singapore is subjected to many criticism too.</p>

              <p>Hi, I managed to contact the professor from Canada who Chee Liek was referring to and this is what he had to say about Chee liek.</p>
              <p>This letter is concerned only with establishing the truth about Mr. 
                  Chee Liek.  It is requisite, even in this summary sketch, to go back a 
                  few years to see how Chee has been trying to raise funds for scientific 
                  studies that "prove" that representative government is an outmoded 
                  system that should be replaced by a system of overt libertinism.  This 
                  is what's called "advocacy research" or "junk science" because it's 
                  funded by stroppy creeps who have already decided that the best way to 
                  reduce cognitive dissonance and restore homeostasis to one's psyche is 
                  to progressively narrow the sphere of human freedom.</p>
              <p>Now, I hope he was
                   joking when he implied he was going to treat people like 
                  possession-obsessed paranoiacs, but it sure didn't sound like it.  
                  Chee's rank-and-file followers form a crotchety organization devoted 
                  to harassment and barratry.  Yes, I could add that he's operating 
                  according to some very badly flawed logic, but I wanted to keep my 
                  message simple and direct.  I didn't want to distract you from the main 
                  thrust of my message, which is that Chee hates people who stick to the 
                  facts and offer only those arguments that can be supported by those 
                  facts.  He wants such people nabbed, grabbed, and thrown out of the 
                  country.  For future reference, by brainwashing his confreres with 
                  jujuism, he makes them easy to lead, easy to program, and easy to 
                  enslave.  In particular, all of Chee's representatives are thieves—idle,
                   envious, and ready to plunder and enslave their weaker neighbors.  It's
                   therefore not surprising that Chee claims that his mistakes are always 
                  someone else's fault.</p>
              <p>That claim illustrates a serious reasoning 
                  fallacy, one that is pandemic in his drug-induced ravings.  Then again, 
                  Chee would have you believe that he's a wonderful human being.  I have 
                  already, for the present at least, sufficiently answered the climatic 
                  part of this proposition and have only to add that if I recall 
                  correctly, Chee maintains that we have too much freedom.  This is a 
                  complete fabrication without a scintilla of truth in it.  What's more, 
                  Chee's backers argue that Chee can succeed without trying.  These are 
                  the same imperious tightwads who prosecute, sentence, and label people 
                  as pompous finks without the benefit of any evidence whatsoever.  This 
                  is no coincidence; a person who wants to get ahead should try to 
                  understand the long-range consequences of his/her actions.  Chee has 
                  never had that faculty.  He always does what he wants to do at the 
                  moment and figures he'll be able to lie himself out of any problems that
                   arise.  Mr. Chee Liek's primary motivation is self-enrichment at our 
                  expense.</p>
