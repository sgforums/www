              <p>One professor I knew of in Canada once commented that
              Singaporeans are illiterated in 3 languages and is in the danger of
              becoming second class to every other nationalities.  I fully
              agree with him.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans go around speaking "Singlish" and yet sneer at
              others, particularly other Asians, who does not speak English
              like they are bona fide English people.  Their culture - well
              if Singapore has any culture- is a jumble of what is essentially
              Asian with a propensity to ape the "Hollywood" culture and then
              claim they are "westernized".  It is amusing to meet 
              Singaporeans spouting Singlish with a western name and pretending
              to be a European infront of other Asians.  They try to
              ingratiate themselves to the Europeans by criticizing Asiand-
              particularly Chinese.</p>
              <p>They are so insecure as to be condescending to other
              Asians who are poorer than them and to criticized other Asians
              who are better than them.</p>
              <p>They confused the issue of "Race" and "Nationality" -
              Nationality can be changed but race is genetically
              determined. </p>
              <p>Singaporeans should realize that when the chips are down, you
              are Asians ,and particularly the Singaporean Chinese are Chinese,
              and the western countries will not help you but call to you, you
               fucking chinks go home.</p>

              <p>I knew a professor from UK that once commented that Canadians are illiterate in two languages and is in danger of become second class North Americans and overpopulated by immigrants and I fully agree with him.</p>
              <p>Canadians go about speaking "Frenglish" and yet sneer at others, particularly Asians who do not speak English like they are bona fide English people. Their culture - well if Canadians have any culture - is a jumble of what is essentially a north American with a propensity to ape the "tortoise"culture and then claim that they are "civilised". It is amusing to meet Canadians speaking Frenglish with a french name and pretending to be speaking English in front of British. They try to ingratiate themselves to the British by criticizing Asians - especially Indians and Singaporeans who speak English.</p>
              <p>They are so insecure as to be condescending to other Asians who they assumed to be poorer than them and criticized other English-speaking Asians who are more driven and outgoing than them. Afterall, most of the time they hole up in their houses.</p>
              <p>They confused the issue of "English"and "French" - French can only be learnt in school and never to be used in their lives because they will pee in their pants to do so but oftenly they speak "Frenglish".</p>
              <p>Canadians should realize that when the chips are added to their dishes, the dish is no longer a French cuisine even though you added "french fries". When they had natural disasters, no western country will help them but to ask them to help themselves.</p>
