            <div class='col-md body'>Did you know...<br><br>...that cholesterol is not a deadly poison but a substance vital to the cells of all mammals?<br><br>...that your body produces three to four times more cholesterol than you eat?<br><br>...that this production increases when you eat only small amounts of cholesterol and decreases when you eat large amounts?<br><br>...that the "prudent" diet, low in saturated fat and cholesterol, cannot lower your cholesterol more than a small percentage?<br><br>...that the only effective way to lower cholesterol is with drugs?<br><br>...that many of the cholesterol-lowering drugs are dangerous to your health and may shorten your life?<br><br>...that the new cholesterol-lowering drugs, called statins, do lower heart-disease mortality, but this is because of effects other than cholesterol-lowering?  Unfortunately, they also stimulate cancer, at least in rodents.<br><br>...that you may become aggressive or suicidal if you lower your cholesterol too much?<br><br>...that polyunsaturated fatty acids, those which are claimed to prevent heart attacks, stimulate infections and cancer in rats?<br><br>...that if you eat too much polyunsaturated oil you will age faster than normal?  You will see this on the outside as wrinkled skin.  You can't see the effects of premature aging on the inside of your body, but you will certainly feel them.<br><br>...that too much polyunsaturated oil may provoke atherosclerosis?<br><br>...that people whose blood cholesterol is low develop just as many plaques in their blood vessels as people whose cholesterol is high?<br><br>...that more than thirty studies of more than 150,000 individuals have shown that people who have had a heart attack haven't eaten more saturated fat or less polyunsaturated fat than other people?<br><br>...that old women with high cholesterol live longer than old women with low cholesterol?<br><br>...that many of these facts have been presented in scientific journals and books for decades but proponents of the diet-heart hypothesis never tell them to the public?<br><br>...that the diet-heart idea and the cholesterol campaign create immense prosperity for researchers, doctors, drug producers, and the food industry?"<br><br>--  Uffe Ravnskov, M.D., Ph.

            <div class='col-md body'>there is good and bad cholesterol.. blood cholesterol can be divided into two types, one of which actually lowers the risk of heart disease. cholesterol-filled protein orbs are called lipoproteins. lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). LDL contributes to the formation of plaques on the artery walls, while HDL helps prevent their formation.  LDL is often called the bad cholesterol while HDL is the good cholesterol. these only applies to blood cholesterol.. so dietary cholesterol have no effect.</div>
