            <div class='col-md body'>My wife recently received a letter stating that she has won/awarded through a certain promotional program, a New Toyota Corolla vehicle. The letter indicates that she must attend an interview at 350 Orchard Road, #12-08/09/10 Shaw House, Singapore 238868. Company in question is Touch &amp; Tech Media and Jue Shi Marketing for Oriental Travel Pte Ltd.<br><br>I did a check on the Internet, and came up with a few forums wherein several threads were posted regarding this same scheme. Unwary individuals were enticed into believing that they have or will win a car, and attended the "interview" wherein they were introduced to some travel package for approximately 45 minutes. During which, they were incessantly urged to sign or buy the package before they can be promised to collect or win the award.<br><br>I find that this sort of marketing tactic is disgusting, and the authorities should look into it, as there are already quite some gullible few who were taken in by their ruse. If you have received any of such letters from the above organization stating that you have won or are promised to win or be awarded a car, a plasma TV, or any other big ticket items; I'd suggest you simply ignore it. Times may be hard for businesses, but being in business myself, I still stick to doing business the ethical way. No BLUFFING!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If i didnt remember wrongly, Oriental is a time-sharing company that has been black listed by CASE b4.<br>Think it realli has bad marketing tactics n high pressure selling.<br>N they always promise customers wat they cannot deliver... leaving many members n non-members furious. As they did not explain in details the membership their selling clearly. N thus making members disappointed when they wan to use their membership for holidays but not able to do so..<br>They pitch too much heat..</div>
