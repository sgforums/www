              <p>I have 2 friends who started business.</p>
              <p>1 started with $100. 1 started with govt grant (or so I guess) from SPRING Singapore due to "innovative" nature of business (smartphone apps, which requires low start-up capital but tons of brain matter).</p>
              <p>Even if 300k is really needed, if you have an extremely good business plan write up, bring it to a venture capitalist or banker, and they will finance you. Some will even guide you. Only fools will put money with people who have no concrete plans, roadmaps, and still expect to generate a decent ROI.</p>
              <p>The key is whether you even bothered to try or find out the different ways of financing. I guess not. You wondered, others took action.</p>
              <p><br>Colonel Sanders failed multiple times (not 1, not 2, not 10, not 20, but much more) before finding a restaurant that was willing to use his recipe for fried chicken. If he gave up before even trying, there wouldn't be KFC today.</p>
