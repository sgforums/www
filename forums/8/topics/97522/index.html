            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Family Quotes</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Doc Childre and Howard Martin, The HeartMath Solution</span><br>Family is the first social unit for developing the qualities of the heart. A true family grows and moves through life together, inseparable in the heart. Whether a biological family or an extended family of people attracted to each other based on heart resonance and mutual support, the word "family" implies warmth, a place where the core feelings of the heart are nurtured. Family values represent the core values and guidelines that parents and family members hold in high regard for the well-being of the family. Sincere family feelings are core heart feelings. They are the basis for true family values. While we have differences, we remain "family" by virtue of our heart connection. Family provides necessary security and support, and acts as a buffer against external problems. A family made up of secure people generates a magnetic power that can get things done. They are the hope for real security in a stressful world.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sara Paddison, Hidden Power of the Heart</span><br>We are one big family of people, trying to make our way through the unfolding puzzle of life. We are all connected to one another in the heart. Connecting with the ultimate source of love is possible through discovering the hidden power in your heart.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Elizabeth Stone</span><br>Making the decision to have a child - it's momentous. It is to decide forever to have your heart walking around outside your body.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Gail Lumet Buckley</span><br>Family faces are magic mirrors. Looking at people who belong to us, we see the past, present and future.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carl Sandburg</span><br>A baby is God's opinion that the world should go on.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Martin Mull</span><br>Having a family is like having a bowling alley installed in your brain.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lyndon Baines Johnson </span><br>The family is the corner stone of our society. More than any other force it shapes the attitude, the hopes, the ambitions, and the values of the child. And when the family collapses it is the children that are usually damaged. When it happens on a massive scale the community itself is crippled. So, unless we work to strengthen the family, to create conditions under which most parents will stay together, all the rest Â— schools, playgrounds, and public assitance, and private concern Â— will never be enough.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>Don Marquis</span><br>I would rather start a family than finish one.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">George Santayana</span><br>The family is one of nature's masterpieces.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Unknown</span><br>None but a mule denies his family.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Robert Frost</span><br>The greatest thing in family life is to take a hint when a hint is intended Â— and not to take a hint when a hint isn't intended.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Richard Bach</span><br>The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Chinese proverb</span><br>To understand your parents' love, you must raise children yourself.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ogden Nash</span><br>A family is a unit composed not only of children but of men, women, an occasional animal, and the common cold.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ring Lardner</span><br>The family you come from isn't as important as the family you're going to have.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">George Bernard Shaw</span><br>If you cannot get rid of the family skeleton, you may as well make it dance.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Benjamin Franklin</span><br>He that raises a large family does, indeed, while he lives to observe them, stand a broader mark for sorrow; but then he stands a broader mark for pleasure too.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Reinhold Niebuhr</span><br>Family life is too intimate to be preserved by the spirit of justice. It can be sustained by a spirit of love which goes beyond justice.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">John Bowring</span><br>A happy family is but an earlier heaven.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ed Howe</span><br>Families with babies and families without babies are sorry for each other.<br><br></div>

Care gives latitude to another person and gets you past the dislikes and annoyances. Quite simply, caring sustains love.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Doc Childre and Sara Paddison, HeartMath Discovery Program</span><br>Are there certain friends you turn to when you have a problem or need to be listened to? Think about this:<br>Â— Are they compassionate, understanding and nurturing?<br>Â— Are they totally present, giving you their undivided attention?<br>Â— Do they try to solve your problems for you or do they help you to get clarity so that you can solve your own problems?<br>Â— Do they let you talk until you're done?<br>Chances are the people you turn to for support and understanding are good listeners. You can develop these qualities as well and take them even deeper into "essence understanding" through mastering deep heart listening.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">James Allen</span><br>In the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, for in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Frances Ward Weller</span><br>A friend can tell you things you don't want to tell yourself.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Kayla</span><br>A true friend sticks with you through thick and thin no matter what.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Unknown</span><br>A friend is someone who knows the song in your heart and can sing it back to you when you have forgotten the words.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Danish proverb</span><br>A road to a friend's house is never long.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Unknown</span><br>Similarities create friendship's while differences hold them together.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Unknown</span><br>To lose a friend is hardship, but to forget them is as if you died too.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Marie Louise De La Ramee</span><br>Could we see when and where we are to meet again, we would be more tender when we bid our friends good-bye. .<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Edgar Watson Howe</span><br>When a friend is in trouble, don't annoy him by asking if there is anything you can do. Think up something appropriate and do it.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Katherine Mansfield</span><br>I always felt that the great high privilege, relief and comfort of friendship was that one had to explain nothing.<br>Thanks to Maria Marquis<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Unknown</span><br>A friend is someone who can sing you the song of your heart when you've forgotten it.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Theocritus</span><br>Verily, great grace may go with a little gift; and precious are all things that come from friends.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Benjamin Disraeli</span><br>The greatest good you can do for another is not just to share your riches but to reveal to him his own.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Robert Louis Stevenson</span><br>A friend is a present you give yourself.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">George Eliot</span><br>Oh, the comfort, the inexpressible comfort of feeling safe with a person; having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words, but to pour them all out, just as they are, chaff and grain together, knowing that a faithful hand will take and sift them, keep what is worth keeping, and then, with a breath of kindness, blow the rest away.<br><br>John Churton Collins<br>In prosperity, our friends know us; in adversity, we know our friends.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">William Blake</span><br>Thy friendship oft has made my heart to ache; do be my enemy Â— for friendship's sake.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Unknown</span><br>True friendship is seen through the heart not through the eyes.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Robert E.
