I would take this story about the human milk replacing cow's milk thingy with a huge pinch of salt.  Look at it this way -------  1 cow can give you several litres of milk a day, that's cheap.. 1 human mother can give you 1 litre of milk at a session/day? I don't think so. Can your mother feed you with 1 litre of milk a day in one session? Maybe, most likely not. I watched as my wife used the pump to get milk for our daughter, when daughter was several months of age. Daughter somehow dun like to suckle. That session can only produce less than 200ml of milk. So maybe, in 24 hours, perhaps can get 1 litre of milk. It would be time consuming and much more expensive for the restaurant than buying cartons of milk, in bulk.<br></div></blockquote>psl lah.the restaurants etc can simply ask 20,30 women give milk at the same time then just pay them less than a dollar each or evem few cents.

U think the poor ppl wun do it meh,this way not cheaper than cow milk meh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>Still make no sense leh... unless the people were really that poor and hard up for cash.<br><br>About a dollar can get you more then 2 litre of cow's milk in china liao... and this includes costs like heat treatment and stuff so the milk will keep longer.<br><br>30 women can at best give you (assuming a very high estimate of 500ml per person) 15 litre, if you pay each person a dollar (which is ridiculusly low) it ends up you are paying 2 bucks a litre. This is several times more expensive then cow's milk. And this is not even counting the fact that raw human milk will spoil pretty fast and go sour if it is not treated, so the only application is immediate use in cooking... and all this for a higher cost.<br><br>Assuming people will even sell their milk for a dollar! Which is silly... they know the market rate for cow's milk, it makes little sense for them to sell something they have less of for less then the market rate.<br><br>Unless you are assuming the very poor who really need money for their next meal- but you miss out one important fact. People this poor will be on the verge of starvation and hence unable to lactate! Even if they could the yield would be very low and of poor quality. More importantly, the energy they expend generating the milk for the money they get (assuming they get paid 1 RMB for 500ml) is a lot more then what they can recoup from their pay. In short, being paid 1 dollar is actually selling your milk for a loss. It is cannot be sustained.<br><br>In fact the best yield would come from individuals who are of good nutritional status, and to have such a state a person must obviously have enough economic power to have such a diet to be like that in the first place. And if they are of that economic status they obviously would not need to sell their milk at 1 buck.<br><br>So I'm afriad your logic just makes no sense... and please stop writing the mainland chinese people as if they are animals willing to do anything for money. At the very least they have good economic sense, and anybody with a basic understanding of economics will know that you can't possible sell your breast milk cheaper then cow's milk and survive.<br><br>As I said, it is possible they have special dishes that use human milk, but if you are trying to push them as passing off human milk as cows milk then it's rather stupid... because in reality human milk is a lot more valuable then cow's milk and you could actually sell it for a lot more.<br><br>It is more likely that some dudes will come up with something that tastes like milk, but isn't milk at all with no nutritional value. But please don't be silly and suppose that it is possible to run a human milk subbing cow's milk racket... that's just not pratical.<br><br>So I think it's more urban legend then fact.</div>

Using the United NationsÂ’ standard of poverty,<span style="color: red;"> an income of one U.S. dollar a day</span>, more than 800 million farmers in China are struggling on the poverty line. The average annual per-person income in rural areas last year was US$317. This was 13 percent lower than the international standard. In addition, 21.6 million city citizens are still relying on financial support from the government.<br><br>From:ChinaGae<br>Even so, the work of aiding the poor in China is still a long-term and arduous task. At present, 70 million people do not have enough food and clothing. Most of them are living deep in the mountains, in karst, desolate, high and cold areas, and in loess plateau regions in central and western China, and in areas where endemic diseases rage. To get rid of poverty, more than 5 million of them have to move to other places. More must be done to help these people get away from poverty.<br></div>
