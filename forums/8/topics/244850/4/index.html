            <div class='col-md body'>For those interested, here is the article where infants were killed when drinking other sources of milk.<br><strong>**For people who dun believe poverty  can make one desparate</strong><br><br>By Liang Chao (China Daily)<br>Updated: 2004-05-21 09:43<br><br>An allout war against fake powdered milk has been launched across China following the deaths of 12 babies from malnutrition in Fuyang, in East China's Anhui Province.<br><br>Investigations have revealed the infants, aged between four and six months, died after being fed milk powder with little, if any, nutritional value.<br><br>A young victim of the fake milk powder in Huai'an, Jiangsu Province. Experts say that some of the babies victimized by the fake milk powder may suffer from further problems as they grow up. [newsphoto/file]<br><br>As a result of consuming these products, More than 100 other infants in Fuyang are suffering from "big head disease," so-called because their heads grew abnormally large, while their torsos, arms and legs were reduced to skin and bone.<br><br>Experts say that some of these babies may suffer from further problems as they grow up.<br><br>Worst of all, is the fear that killer milk powders like this could affect tens of thousands of other infants across the country, if their existence is not discovered in time.<br><br>The incident shocked the country, where at least 13 million babies are born each year, with over one-third of them mainly being fed breast milk substitutes for the first six months of their lives.<br><br>To date, a total of 47 people have been detained in the fake milk powder incident in Fuyang, which was exposed last month. The case involves 40 enterprises spread over 10 provinces.<br><br>Breastfeeding imperative<br><br>"The deaths of the babies (in Fuyang) might have been avoided if they were breastfed," said Dai Yaohua, a senior researcher with the Beijing-based Capital Institute of Paediatrics (CIP).<br><br>An increasing body of scientific evidence, especially in recent years, indicates that breastfeeding and the use of human milk for infant feeding offer diverse and compelling advantages for infants, mother, families and society.<br><br>Epidemiologic studies have shown that human milk and breastfeeding have positive effects on growth, development and the general health of children.<br><br>For babies in developing nations, experts say that breastfeeding is even more imperative, as babies' very survival largely depends on the immune-boosting properties of mother's milk.<br><br>A migrant worker from Guizhou Province carries her baby as she gets ready to go home from Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, for the Spring Festival in 2002. Many married women in Fuyang, Anhui Province, choose to cut short breastfeeding and leave their babies in the care of grandmothers when they go to cities to work. [newsphoto/file]<br><br>However, a survey found that less than 58 per cent of the infants born in 2000 were breastfed in Anhui Province, where "big head" infants were first reported.<br><br>The number of babies in China fed exclusively on breast milk during their first four months of life has declined from around 76 per cent in 1998 to only 64 per cent today.<br><br>In urban areas, maternity leave can be as long as seven and a half months for working mothers with stable incomes, meaning that they are in a position to be able to breastfeed their babies for the first few months, but nonetheless, the use of infant formula milk is on the rise.<br><br>Mothers in rural areas, however, have to give up breastfeeding within six months because more and more of them are moving to cities to work as migrant workers.<br><br>In Fuyang, many mothers were found to have gone to work in urban areas before their babies were six months old.<br><br>The babies are usually left in the care of their grandmothers, who frequently are unable to distinguish genuine from fake infant formula.<br><br>Investigations have shown that poor families, particularly in rural areas, often dilute costly formula with unclean water and mix it in unclean bottles, adding to the risk of illness among infants.<br><img src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-05/21/xin_1405012110010701159210.jpg"><br><br>Ps: Hate the things ppl do but dun hate the ppl</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm, why are you posting an article that was exactly what I posted eariler on the fake baby milk?<br><br><strong>EXACTLY</strong> my point... if they were truly desperate they would resort to <strong>PRATICAL</strong> means like making false formula or pirated foods, not run some inpratical, economically loss-generating, and physically impossible racket like trying to get human milk to sub cow's milk.<br><br>By all measures, your article on them wanting to sub in human milk for cow's milk fails all the features of a scheme that desperate people will take, because all things considered... it is entirely unworkable for poor people.<br><br>It is more feasible (and they have done it) that they collect human milk from the rural areas to prepare exotic dishes in the city, but these dishes are not sold cheap and the people providing the milk are certainly paid a reasonable amount, enough for them to become viable milk producers.<br><br>Your idea that you can simply drop 1rmb to some poor people and have them express milk and think it's a viable scheme the desperate poor will consider is quite laughable.<br><br>Human biology itself already contradicts your position- if you are poor enough to be willing to sell human milk cheaper then cow's milk, your nutritional status will prohibit you from being able to produce that said milk in the first place.<br><br>LOL, all the articles you are going to post on desperate people is not going to change this reality.<br><br><strong>Did you not just prove my point?</strong></div>

The orgin of a hoax is where you strike to chop the head off the viper.<br><br>In this case, you are most certainly the head. You yes, it ought to be, and will be directed at you as much as possible. In fact if you know what is good you should really remove your first post now that it has been shown almost likely that what you have posted is a hoax.<br><br>In any case, I am glad to see your topic has been mostly disregarded by general forum as well... this means that I have been sucessful in doing the most important thing, and that is:<br><br><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">MYTH BUSTED</span></span></strong><br><br>+1!!!<br><br>Your reactions to all these are irrelevant to me, my mission has by and far been acomplished.<br><br>Here's a tip, the next time before you post something that can inflame opinion, please do some proper homework first.<br><br>People have been hauled off for questioning in here (quite recently as well) for posting things that harmed international relations by inflaming public opinion but that later turned out to be a hoax.
