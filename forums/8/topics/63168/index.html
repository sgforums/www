But somehow, I see that the CEO/big boss brings in people regardless of their capabilities.  The key thing is they will be loyal to him.  It's like building a new empire of his own.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess a company will only change a CEO in 2 situations: Firstly the current CEO decides to retire or going for greener pastures and challenges. Secondly, he/she is sacked because results are not there.<br><br>I would not understand the need to change all the staff in the first instance but if the reason for a change of CEO is the 2nd instance, then such actions are needed.  A CEO who comes into a company to do firefighting needs results FAST thus he has no time to build rapport, build team spirit with people he is not familiar with, he has to assemble a team he is comfortable with in a short time and whom can give him results fast.

            <div class='col-md body'>Very interesting and weird happening in a company<br>that I know of... (shall not mention name... sensitive!)<br><br>This medium sized company is owned by one big company.<br><br>The CEO was newly hired and appointed less than a year ago.  During this year, he has not been a nice guy.  He "F" all the managers and directors.  Whenever there is a call for tender or quotation, he would insist the staff use his friend's company.  In other words, he wanted to give business to his friends even if their prices were the highest among the suppliers.  He implemented pay cut for all staff due to economic crisis, but secretly gave his one favourite staff a payrise.  He told the staff in charge of payroll to keep her mouth shut.<br><br>Lately, he's been told to leave.  All the other directors were kind enough to buy him a farewell lunch and ask him what he would like for a farewell gift.  He said he wants "Two Ball Parter" (not sure that's the correct spelling).  Nobody knows what it was, until one of the staff found out that it means "pointing the middle finger at someone".  He was trying to say that he was so bitter about the board of directors telling him to leave that he wanted to point his middle finger at the company.<br><br>The company is going to hold a farewell meal for him next month.  Not sure if he will "point the middle finger" or give a nasty farewell speech at the event.</div>
