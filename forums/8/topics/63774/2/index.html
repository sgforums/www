            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rad:</div><div class="quote_body">I have some elitist values of my own and I must say. I do not discriminate against or am prejudiced against any schools. If someone learns elitist thinking from a school and not his/her own experiences, what value does the mind set have? He/She is not any better that the person he/she/it is discriminating against, since he/she does not have any true understanding to the values involved.<br><br>The problem with Singaporeans is they place to much emphasis on what is learnt true direct teaching. All this information is passed down as knowledge, and while they know, they do not understand and are simply following the values mindlessly. To be prejudiced against neighbourhood schools in your manner is ridiculous in more ways then one.<br><br>Firstly, you clearly have no direct reason for being biased against neighbourhood schools. <span style="color: red;">Your lack of reason makes you as low a life form as the people you are discriminating against.</span><br>Neighbourhood schools nurture as many capable and productive people as independant schools and while they may not imbue such ignorant thinking as you have developed, I am sure they are as capable of creating able citizens just like any other school.<br><br>While I am not from any neighbourhood school, I can ensure you that I know and enjoy the company of people that were formally from such places. My previous schools have not in anyway tried to pass down elitist values and I have obtained them from hard experience at a young age. Graduating or attending such an academic facility does not totally affect what kind of person the student will eventually become. There are just as many degenerates from any other area or walk of life.<br><br>If you would like to discriminate, discriminate on people only if you have a proper understanding of the subject and reasons to which you are prejudiced against. I would much rather you discriminate against the upbringing or the lack of upbringing parents are providing their children in Singapore. Clearly there are parents that have failed to passed down proper etiquette, moral values and common sense. It is to my believe, that these values are more important then the knowledge your receive in school. They separate the normal human beings from your "idiots" and while they can be picked up from school such traits are more often picked up at a younger age from exposure.<br><br>I would continue to rant but I fear that I may lose your short span of attention. If the initial post was meant to be nothing more than a meaningless post in the name of poor humour, then forget all the above lines and instead walk away with the following one line said in a sarcastic manner, "Haha. Very funny."</div></blockquote>Hey your argument is not bad but that particular line (in red) don't sound right</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was from the top school studying Special Course with Higher Chinese, and the school was located in my neighbourhood.  So do I belong to a neighbourhood school or and the elite? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Btw, top schools only produce salaried workers (like me). Even though they are called the professionals, they are just employees.  Same for ministers, lawyers, presidents etc.<br><br>Neighbourhood schools are the one producing successful businessmen from time to time.  Sim Wong Hoo was never a top school student.  Neither did he have a degree.  He is the founder of Creative Technology.  Now, the neighbourhood school boy which kablisho condemns hires a lot of the scholar to work for him.<br><br>So who is dumbo here?</div>
