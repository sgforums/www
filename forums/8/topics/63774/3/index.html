They<br>And to be successful in life u nid a balance of both.<br></div></blockquote>Actually this is a common excuse ppl tend to use to justify why they are not studying as hard in school as they should be.  This is even more glorified by controversial authors like Kiyosaki, author of the highly debated over book <span style="font-style: italic;">Rich Dad, Poor Dad</span>.<br><br>True, we cannot argue against the fact that there <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> quite a few rich people in the world that have made their fortunes without having the accompanying qualifications.  Bill Gates, CEO of Microsoft and the world's richest man, is the most common example quoted.  He dropped out from Harvard school in 1975 to set up Microsoft.  But most people seem to ignore the fact that <span style="font-style: italic;">Bill Gates had qualified for Harvard school and dropped out voluntarily and NOT because of poor grades!</span><br><br>Face the facts.  Out of one Million school dropouts, perhaps only a hundred had dropped out voluntarily, and not for poor grades.  And out of this 100 poeple, if lucky there'll be perhaps 50 people who actually have real talent, and are sufficiently self-motivated to keep themselves ahead.  And out of these 50 people, perhaps only one or two will have the luck, opportunity to meet the correct poeple, and invest at precise timing just to make their fortune.<br><br>Now let us look at the graduates.  Most end up as employees.  But at least they bring home payslips that let them have at least an average or above average standard of living.  Most will have a route of advancement that qualify them for a steady increment of pay.  Most will retire with a satisfying sum.  Easily more than eighty percent of the leading positions in companies worldwide are held by graduates.  A large portion of the people that draw super-scale salaries are also graduates.<br><br>But there are two things that is common to the successful people, no matter whether they are graduates or dropouts.  One, is that they have talent, and they are able to maximise it.  Two, is that they are willing to put in the hard work.  Do you think they got to where they are today by slacking or procrastinating?  No way!  They have put in their 16-hour work-days, some may even live without weekend rests.  Success never comes with just talent or hard work alone, the two must come together!!!<br><br>Now think again of your chances to success as a dropout, against that of being a graduate.  Now do a critical assessment of your own talents and your own level of hard-work you're putting in.  I'm sure you've got your own answer to the question why we're not anywhere near to being a multi-billionaire.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Such stereotypes won't make you go far in life if you're gonna continue having a mindset like that.<br>I come from one of the top 15 schools in Singapore, but never will it ever cross my mind to look down on students from those neighbourhood schools nor pass such stereotyped remarks, because to do so will only degrade oneself.<br>I have my fair share of friends from neighbourhood schools; the intelligence they have in them is enough to rival those from the top schools. So while academics may not be their niche, their interests lie in other areas which is what compensates for it.<br>Maybe it's cases of delinquency that actually puts those neighbourhood schools in a bad light, but I dare say that top schools also have their fair share of such cases.<br>So drop the stereotypes, make peace, not war <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
