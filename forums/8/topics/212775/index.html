            <div class='col-md body'>S'pore likes courteous tourists<br><br>Singapore has voted. Its tourist idols are the Japanese, while the least-favoured visitors hail from mainland China.<br><br>These two sets of tourists are at the opposite ends of the courtesy spectrum in a survey of perceptions of inbound tourism.<br><br>The Japanese come out tops also in Hong Kong, Indonesia and Thailand in the regional tourism survey. In Singapore, 46 per cent of its residents considers visitors from the Land of the Rising Sun the most polite. Europeans come in second, while Americans are third with 12 per cent of the votes.<br><br>Interestingly, a minority of 6 per cent finds Americans the most impolite, while 14 per cent feel Indian tourists are worse, and almost half of the 913 respondents are none-too-impressed by the manners of mainland Chinese.<br><br>Singaporeans pick shouting, spitting and not queueing up in an orderly fashion, in that order, as the most impolite tourist behaviour, reported market research company Synovate.<br><br>However, the respondents admitted Singaporeans could do better as well.<br><br>"Singaporeans are aware that good manners work both ways and, despite their gripes, almost three-quarters believe their fellow citizens should be friendlier towards visitors," said Synovate's managing director in Singapore, Ms Miranda Cheung.<br><br>Out of the four countries polled, Singaporeans are the most grateful for the tourist trade. Specifically, the vast majority cites additional jobs and an improved economy as the big pluses of tourism, although only 7 per cent works in a job that relates to or benefits from tourism.<br><br>The less tangible benefits from increased cultural interaction matter to 73 per cent of the respondents.<br><br>According to Synovate, however, "despite the broad support for tourism and an acknowledgement of the rewards it can bring, some Singaporeans see its downside".<br><br>Almost a quarter believe that tourism has diluted local culture and about a fifth find "there is far too much tourism in my country at present".<br><br>Another 17 per cent believe tourism places too much strain on local infrastructure while a smaller group "dislikes the large numbers of foreigners who spend their vacation exploring (Singapore)", said Synovate in a press release yesterday.<br><br>Overall, though, Singaporeans are keen to impress tourists, said Ms Cheung.<br><br>"The level of tourism that Singapore receives can have its drawbacks but with 73 per cent of residents believing that more should be done to encourage tourism, it's clear that the majority of Singaporeans welcome visitors, and their wallets, with open arms," she said.<br></div>

I was told by my friend working in a jewellery shop that a small group of PRC tourists can sweep up up to 60k of goods at one go  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I think the difference is that Jap tourists have more money but PRCs are a lot more willing to spend.</div></blockquote>WHICH country has the world's most undervalued currency? Most people would answer China. Yet by many measures the Japanese yen is cheaper than the Chinese yuan. It cannot be long before America and Europe put Japan in the dock, and accuse it of keeping its currency unfairly low.<br><br>since 2001 the Bank of Japan (BoJ) had been printing loads of money in order to defeat deflation. An increased supply of yen relative to that of other currencies pushed down its price. But the yen's softness this year is a puzzle. Since the BoJ abandoned Â“quantitative easingÂ” in March, Japan's monetary base has withered. Deflation has gone away, and in July the BoJ raised interest rates, which had been stuck at zero for five years. Furthermore, Japan had a whopping current-account surplus of $165 billion in the year to July (the latest figure for China, for 2005, is only $161 billion, although it is expected to rise in 2006). In many respects, the yen should be climbing.<br><br>Instead, since March it has fallen slightly against the dollar and by as much as 8% against the euro, which fetched a record Â¥150 earlier in September, before edging back up a bit. Since mid-2001 the yen has fallen by around 35% against the euro, while against the weaker dollar it is little changed. Japanese exporters have also gained competitiveness relative to South Korea, where the won has risen strongly against the dollar during the past year.<br><br>Not only is the yen cheap in nominal terms, but many years of falling prices in Japan have made it even more competitive. Its real trade-weighted value fell this month to its lowest since 1982 (see chart). The latest update of The Economist's Big Mac index (see article) showed that the yen was by far the most undervalued of the developed world's currenciesÂ—ie, hamburgers are cheapest in Tokyo. Using a more sophisticated model, Stephen Jen, of Morgan Stanley, reckons that the yen is 12% undervalued against the dollar, whereas the yuan is only 7% too weak. Against the euro, the yen is almost 30% below its fair value.</div>
