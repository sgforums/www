              <p>I believe it has got more to do with the parents.</p>
              <p>As with the NS issue, if the child complains, the parents will do anything possible to protect their children. This results in a lower threshold for bitter times.</p>
              <p>Do you think if the parents had continued pushing their children while putting aside their parental instincts, would the children be as pampered?</p>
              <p>Most of our parents had to work hard to get where they are today. No complaints, no whining, no bullshit. Just pure hard work, on their own. Our grandparents did not shelter them, or spoonfeed them, or tie their shoelaces (except for the first time).</p>
              <p>But now, parents shelter their children so much - want wind get wind, want rain get rain. (chinese saying) Parents are more concerned about satisfying their children's materialistic needs that serves to make their life "better", easier, than making sure their children learn the right values. It can also be observed that parents rely on school teachers to inculcate those values.</p>
              <p>On he who can endure the bitter of the bitter, can become the man above all other men.</p>
              <p>Enduring pain and suffering is what the younger generations are unable to do - a little pressure causes them to crack and eventually fall apart.</p>

              <p>Yeah, I agree. <br>My generation and myself are more "made of fail" than our predecessors.</p>
              <p>The reason is obvious. <br><br>We are more sheltered, technology is more advanced and life isn't just about hard labour and farming like the labourers and peasants most of our forefathers were.</p>

              <p>Depression does have a biological link but its not totally biological and more often its due to environmental influence. If everyone is in the same environment yet only you fall into depression without any biological influence, it does shows that you are mentally weaker than the rest and unable to handle the same stress and pressure that others can. Depression is not like cough, flu that can be caught easily through the air etc so by falling into depression, its still partly the person's fault for not being strong enough mentally and fall into depression.</p>

              <p>We are talking about depression so why change it to physical problems now?</p>
              <p>For physical problems, its also u being weak to not be able to take the
              training cos everyone is taught the same thing. Sometimes physical
              injuries can be due to u being suay but mental illness has no luck
              involved.</p>
              <p>For mental illness, it is ur fault for not being able to cope. If you fail to cope thats ur fault for being weak so thats logical.</p>
              <p>If not whats your logic for explaining why everyone else can go through but you can't? Depression etc is a mental illness and getting it signifies a mental strength which is saying the person is weaker than the rest who went through the same thing.</p>
              <p>How can u blame others when u are the only 1 who didn't manage to go through training that everyone else can?</p>

              <p><br>So according to you, if you are running SOC halfway and than you fall down and fractured your leg and so OOT and downgrade to PES E, that is your fault too because you are weak?</p>

              <p>This is logic fail.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Back to depression, there are many external factors which causes you to get depression and not just the army settings. Like before you serve ns, you are working and contributing to your family expenses and now in ns, your allowance is not enough to contribute to your family expenses. So now your parents are not happy with you and this gives you pressure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Than perhaps your gf breaks up with you too when you are in ns.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So now you lose your gf and family ties plus the tough training and takaning by your superiors causes you to ahve depression.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So this is your fault too now that you got depression?</p>

              <p>And your saying that if you get a mental illness means you are weak is also logic fail.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some people get other type of mental illness such as sspilt personality. So according to your logic, does it mean these people are weak?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But what has spilt personality got to do with the person being weak?</p>

              <p>I have already said that depression has a biological link. Please read my post if you didn't know how to read properly. However biological causes requires a trigger. Not everyone with the genes that might cause depression is sure to get depression and not everyone who does not have the gene is immune from depression. As the article says, nature vs nurture.</p>
              <p>The nurture part is about your environment which you will need to go read about social psychology to learn about its influence.</p>
              <p>You should also go read up on a proper abnormal psychology textbook to learn more about depression and learn that biological is just a contributing factor but weak mental strength will result in higher chance of failling to depression regardless whether the person has the biological effect or not.</p>
