              <p>The recent natural disasters have sparked talks of dark age before  the second coming of Mr. J. They said now is the dark age.</p>
              <p>Guys, no doubt it is very unfortunate to have natural disasters but our era is definitely not the darkest age. Let me list you the darkest age in history and till today our earth is still rotating and we don't see anybody 2nd coming. So, don't be easily taken in by the saying of dark age. Use your general knowledge to rebutt these ignorant so called religious people.</p>
              <p>You guys can always google for these unfortunate events in history which were darker age than today.</p>
              <p>1) Black death - from 1348 - 1350 - 30% to 60% of the population in Europe were being killed.</p>
              <p>2) Spanish Flu - from 1918 - 1920 - Between 50 - 100 million people were dead</p>
              <p>3) 1st World War - from 1914 - 1918 - countless of people were dead.</p>
              <p>4) 2nd Word War - from 1939 - 1945 - countless of people were dead.</p>
              <p>But we guys have to be environmental friendly inorder not to hurt our Mother Earth but don't believe the dark age saying. After the darker ages I listed above, I don't see anybody 2nd coming, do you?</p>

              <p>Speculation, Postulations, Theories ... not just being limited to

              environmental doomsday mongering and the salience of pseudo-scientific 
              scare stories demonstrate.</p>
              <p>While alot of the people  talk about  nuclear wars, Ozone layer depletion, impending alien attacks, oh.. or the great Heat Death like in one of Hitchens books God is Not Great which I must say is not a bad book, just a book that has its logics and flaws at the same time, talks on about us being baked by the sun, while denouncing religious ‘visions of apocalypse’. lol</p>
