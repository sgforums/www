They are the kind of people who are prone to suffer from self pity because they don't express their real intention to people that ought to know - instead, like you mentioned, they retreat back to their shell when hurt.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cancer are the kind of people when something happened, they remain rather passive for that period and after a few days, they would blame you for everything and you will be like WTH?

            <div class='col-md body'>Â• Symbol	: The Crab<br>Â• Ruling House	: Fourth House<br>Â• Ruling Planet	: The Moon<br>Â• Gemstone	: Pearl<br>Â• Element	: Water<br>Â• Most compatible with	: Scorpio, Pisces, Cancer<br>Â• Can be good with	: Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn<br>Â• A 50-50 chance with	: Aquarius, Libra, Gemini<br>Â• Doubtful with	: Aries, Leo, Sagittarius<br><br>Cancer Personality<br>Certainly not the easiest person to understand, you are an introvert with a capital I. Emotions are hidden beneath the tough exterior that you possess -- quite similar to the crustacean that represents your zodiac sign. Although you can be kind and affable, your mood swings are unpredictable, tending to be bitter and melancholic, often feeling hurt unnecessarily. While you like to draw sympathy, you can be fairly insensitive towards others, snapping, being rude and short-tempered. However, your seemingly cruel behavior is only a clever means to hide your own insecurities and complexes. Inside, you are almost like a timid, hurt child. You can be admirably kind, generous, understanding and gracious, if all is well with you. Cancerians can be seen involved in many charitable activities, although they will all be at a very public level. No matter how unpleasant you may seem to some people, you have a conscience that prompts you to do the right things - like standing by people in their time of need. Like most water signs, you too have good intuitive powers and mostly put them to good use in managing your life. You have an urge to travel to distant lands but you are a home-loving person. You can do without being so crabby, if one may say so. Keep your moods in check. Remember the people you hurt most often are the ones who have been good to you. You tend to make a mountain out of the molehill and are prone to self-pity. Reserve some of your sensitivity for others who may need it. You can be a tad untidy which won't endear you to more stable signs.<br><br>Cancer Lover<br><br>You are continually pulled into romance with those who are quite opposite to you in nature. You are strongly attracted to people who are confident, strong and successful. Although you fall in love all the time, your introvert nature and your uneasiness in disclosing your true feelings makes many of these affairs one-sided. You are not likely to rush headlong into marriage, because in selecting a life partner, you will be most likely governed by your head. Those belonging to the zodiac signs of Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces will make good partners for Cancerians. Nevertheless, love for a stable home and loyalty towards the spouse will reward the majority of Cancerians with a reasonably happy married life. You attend to domestic chores cheerfully, take a keen interest in the children. and believe in saving for the rainy day. Man or woman, Cancerians love their home, it is where they feel most secure. Like Sagittarians there is a place for everything, but the Cancerians idea is -- it just does not matter where it is put as long as it's somewhere, under the bed, in cupboards, up in the attic, the garage; not that you are not untidy -- you are the original hoarder and for some it can take a while getting used to this.<br><br>Cancer Professional<br><br>You have a keen intellect and are good with your hands. You will make commendable painters and sculptors. You will be successful in sales and will do well in advertising and marketing for the food and drinks industry, discussing new campaigns over long lunches, or deals over a lazy breakfast would be utopia to you. Some of you may take to writing as your full-time profession, mix that with being a food critic and the world could be your oyster. Most of you will have reasonably good careers, although there will be a tendency to change to an entirely different field midway. This may happen sometime around the age of 35. Money and material wealth are fairly important to you and most of your important decisions in life are made with the accompanying monetary benefits in mind. Although you are almost miserly with the money you earn, sudden windfalls and gains are often squandered away thoughtlessly. Speculation and gambling rarely prove lucky for you.<br><br>Cancer Traveller<br><br>You are always happy when you are near water. You love to swim, sail or boat on holidays. Water has an added attraction for you. You are not very adventurous where new places are concerned so you normally keep visiting the same destination over and over.<br><br>Cancer Teens<br><br>More emotional than the average girl, she appreciates the nurturing aspects of home and hearth. She is dependable and does not view her duty as a chore, but really a pleasure. A true nurturer, she is a comfort-giver to all around. The Cancer girl goes through life with a shell around her that is not easily cracked. If fact, she can stay in that shell until she's sure it is safe to step outside. Most Cancerians are apt to be crabby from time to time, and the Cancer girl is no exception. However, for most part, she has a cheerful disposition. She takes her studies seriously and can retain information well, thanks to her good memory, which also makes her good at taking exams. She will sail through her exams with flying colours. She is apt to view college merely as a means to a great career rather an end in itself.<br><br>The Cancer lad is very emotional and apt to mood swings. He often takes offence when none is intended. He is family oriented and a deeply caring person. You can count on him to help out with family chores. He is bound to be involved in sports, preferably those requiring a team effort as he is drawn towards the camaraderie of a team. His hobbies usually involve collecting things. He never throws away anything. He is a natty dresser, though he is certainly not narcisstic . He tends to be a bit of a miser and rarely spends money on himself. Since Cancer rules the stomach, he usually has a healthy appetite, so make sure the fridge is always stocked. He usually makes a good leader and his friends look to him for help and guidance. He is likely to gravitate towards a small college or university where he can build a family environment away from home.<br><br>Cancer Kids<br><br>The Cancer child is generally bashful and withdrawn, preferring a quiet and peaceful existence, but being very sensitive, is susceptible to tears when things go wrong. The maternal instinct is an ingrained quality and the Cancer kid often becomes the baby sitter of the family. Blessed with an excellent memory and a good record in academics, this kid is given to occasional mood swings and then it's best to give him or her some room to be alone. If you find your Cancer kid lazing around don't worry too much; it's just a passing phase. The Cancer child values family ties and loves to celebrate family reunions.<br>Cancer Well Being<br><br>You normally do not like to engage in too much of physical activity. You would rather spend time lying around at home, reading a good book, snacking on a lot of chocolates and sweets, while this means that you have no problem relaxing, it also means that you have a tendency to overeat, especially fatty foods. You are often struggling to control your weight. To get around the problem, you will have to radically alter your eating habits. Lots of fresh fruits will appease your craving for sweets, while fresh vegetables and salads could replace less nutritious snacks. A low fat, high protein and vitamin-rich diet will have to form the basis of your diet. Last but certainly not the least, you will need to find some time for exercising. As you enjoy spending time with your family, you could try involving them in your exercise regimen, it will add an element of fun and you will have the added benefit of getting the exercise you need. You are prone to illnesses of the stomach and heart. You may also suffer bouts of melancholia. Therefore, you must also take care not to fall back on alcohol in your times of stress, as alcoholism is a great danger in your case.<br><br>Cancer Luck<br><br>Pale yellow, silver, violet and light green are good colours for Cancerians. You are not really affected by Monday blues. In fact, Mondays will find you upbeat, as solutions come easy and things seem to go on the right track - it is your lucky day. For those Cancerians who like jewellery or like to wear gemstones for luck, pearl and moonstone would be a good. You're lucky number is two. The moon is your ruler and your element is water.</div>
