It's only a thin line separating the 2, how can one gauge? When love strikes, you never will know. 6 years is a long time. People change and so do your friends. Maybe your friend just find this "internet" guy to be the sort of guy she prefers after all, instead of her bf? NO ONE is at fault. When it's time to let go, he/she should. NO point pinning on when there's NO love anymore. It's NOT a matter of temptation. Like I say, people do change they they grow older. You may have a gf/bf yourself now but 5 years later, you may find that he/she is NOT the one afterall, so why drag on? *SIGHZ* Communication is really important in a relationship. I guess your friend's bf is NOT exactly helping by being furious and breaking up with your friend. Maybe he does NOT know her that well after all? *SHRUGS*<br>Everything is in shade of grey. Who's right and who's wrong. It's just a thin line and maybe there's NO right or wrong. Life goes on and we move on.........  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>=================================<br>Do Pixies like a rainy day?<br>A-piping through the dell?<br>The Pixies must enjoy the rain;<br>Thats when they weave their spell.<br>Rain drops, rain drops<br>Play a Pixie-tune<br>=================================</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hehe......very contradicting to the other topic " Ideal age of getting married "  Love is a complex chemical reaction in our brain, which many people tries to fathom and cause some to seek refuge at monastery and nunnery.  This is a kind of war between the two most significant type of humans on earth which will be a bitter and cruel war that is going to last for eternity.  This is just an example of another war to add to the history of love.  So I guess it is either they fight it through or forsake it.<br><br>------------------<br>Nothing can't be done, unless you don't want to</div>

I magine u have to sleep with the person forever until u die once u are really married!Geesh, talk about chemistry or commitment nowadays? Is it happiness or joy are we talking about now? Huh!Feels like love is a one night stand nowadays..tsk tsk!No wonder there are so many broken marriages because they have lost the feeling!Ah huh!Is that chemistry or love?
