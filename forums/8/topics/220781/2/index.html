There's only one problem. For over two decades, the Russians have been funneling international aid money into a Top Secret air defense system, which has just been brought on-line and which will render any conventional attack upon their country utterly ineffective.<br><br>After exhausting all of his other options, and with Soviet sleeper agents preparing to detonate their deadly payloads across the United States, the President turns to the nation's final hope, Ex-Navy SEAL and Secret Service Agent, Scot Harvath.<br><br>Assigned to a covert section of the Department of Homeland Security and charged with defending the nation against all foreign aggressors by any means necessary, Harvath finds himself hand-picked by the President to unravel a brilliantly orchestrated, fiendishly timed conspiracy that has already shattered the fragile peace between the world's nations and which, if successful, will leave the United States in smoldering ruins.<br><br>With family friend and former Deputy FBI Director, Gary Lawlor nowhere to be found and suspected of betraying his country, Harvath embarks on an adventure that will test the bonds of loyalty and reveal a nation's deepest secrets.<br><br>As high-voltage and timely as they come, State of the Union is a frighteningly real, headline ripping tale of espionage and intrigue that will keep readers guessing until the last tantalizing piece of the puzzle locks into place.<br><br>With exotic, international locales, hair-raising suspense, and scenes of pulse-pounding action, Brad Thor has once again reaffirmed his position as the thriller writer readers and critics alike have hailed as Clancy, Cussler and Ludlum all rolled into one.<br><br></div>

As he prepares to close out his list, a bloody and twisted trail of clues points towards one man - the world's most feared, most ruthless terrorist, Hashim Nidal. Having assembled an international league of Islamic terrorist networks in an ingenious plot to topple both Israel and America, Harvath and his CIA-led team must reach Nidal before it's too late. One problem remains - they have no idea what the man looks like.<br>Only one person can positively identify Harvath's quarry - Meg Cassidy, a beautiful hijacking survivor. Together, Scot and Meg must untangle a maddening web of global intrigue stretching across four continents. From Macau, Jerusalem, and Chicago, to Libya, Capri, and Rome, Harvath and Cassidy find themselves locked in a desperate race against time to sort the pieces of a deadly puzzle that will test not only their physical and mental limits, but also the growing bond they feel for each other.<br></div>

But it does kill someone.<br><br>For several months, a ruinous sexual harassment suit has been building against the San Francisco Catholic Archdiocese, and when the plaintiff's lawyer is found dead, an apparent suicide, an almost audible sigh of relief is heard in certain quarters. But that is before the police find evidence of murder. Even worse--the evidence points to Father Aguirre.<br><br>Mike and his ex-wife law partner, Rosie Fernandez, jump in to take the priest's case, but what started out as difficult soon appears impossible as forensics, witnesses, and secrets from Father Aguirre's past all incriminate their client. Soon, their wits are the only things keeping the priest from a life sentnece or worse, and wits simply may not be enough--unless they can conjure up a miracle of their own.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sheldon Siegel - Special Circumstances<br><br>Storyline</strong><br><br>Meet Mike Daley. Yesterday he was booted out of his partnership at one of San Francisco's most prominent law firms. Today he's renting a makeshift office on the wrong side of town. Where does an ex-priest, ex-public defender, and ex-husband like Daley go to build a practice? Not far, he discovers.<br><br>In a stunning turn of events, Daley's best friend, an ex-colleague, is charged with the double murder of two lawyers at the old firm and asks Daley to defend him. Cobbling together a defense team composed of himself, his ex-wife, and a onetime courtroom fixture named Mort Goldberg who's been wished on him against his better judgment, Daley finds he's got more to defend than his friend's innocence. The newly elected media-hungry District Attorney, also a former colleague, will prosecute the case himself. As court is called into session, it becomes clear that in this trial ambition, honor, friendship, greed, and longstanding grudges will play as important a role as truth and justice.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sheldon Siegel - Incriminating Evidence<br><br>Storyline </strong><br><br>It starts with a phone call Mike Daley never expected to get from District Attorney Prentice Marshall Gates III, San Francisco's chief law enforcement officer and front-runner candidate for California attorney general. Friends they're not; Skipper Gates led the charge to get Mike fired from his job as a partner in a prestigious law firm. But Gates needs Daley now--and needs him badly. He's just been arrested. It seems that a couple of hours earlier he woke up in an armchair in his hotel room and found the dead body of a young male prostitute in the bed.<br><br>The details that continue to emerge from the crime scene are tabloid heaven. The SFPD is certain Gates did it. The prosecutors are already talking about the death penalty, and there's nothing in the mounting evidence, and certainly not in Gates's unpersuasive denials, to convince Daley and his partner (and ex-wife) Rosie Fernandez of his innocence. But even if he's lying, it's their job to defend him and that means finding out what really happened.<br><br>Sure enough, the deeper they dig, the seamer their findings. An array of influential power brokers is all too ready to cover questionable activities that may--or may not--connect them with the victim. There's a campaign manager with his own dirty secrets, a shady Internet entrepreneur who trades flesh for cash, and a prominent businessman who uses muscle to keep his enterprise prospering. Mike and Rosie chase down trails that take them from the lowest depths of the Mission District, where drugs and bodies are always for sale, to the gated mansions of Pacific Heights, all the while contending with a trial that gets under way even as they are frantically trying to piece together what is really at stake in the case against Gates.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sheldon Siegel - Criminal Intent<br><br>Storyline </strong><br><br>You can pick your friends, they say, but you can't pick your family. And lately, Mike Daley's family has been keeping him very busy. An ex-priest, ex-public defender and ex-corporate lawyer, Daley and his former wife, Rosie Fernandez, run their own San Francisco criminal defense firm - they weren't so good at being married, they discovered, but they are a pretty good legal team. Most of their cases are fairly small-time, which is why it would be surprising that the person accused of murdering movie director Richard (Big Dick) MacArthur is calling them - except that the accused is Rosie's own niece, Angelina.<br><br>That case is bad enough, but the family problems don't end there: Rosie's brother, Tony, may be on the wrong end of a strong-arm graft proposal; the son of one of the firm's lawyers has just been busted on a drugs charge; Mike is having a clandestine affair with a woman judgeÂ…and Rosie herself has a dark secret that may make all of it seem irrelevant.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sheldon Siegel - Final Verdict<br><br>Storyline</strong><br><br>Now, fate throws a curveball at the San Francisco ex-husband- and-wife legal team of Mike Daley and Rosie Fernandez, when Mike picks up the phone and hears the voice of Leon Walker. Years ago, Walker and his brother participated in a botched stickup that left a man dead. Through a series of (some said) questionable maneuvers, Mike got the charges dropped, but he and Rosie battled each other as well as the legal system throughout the process and the case ruined their marriage.<br><br>And now, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist has been found dead in a dumpster on San Francisco's skid row. The murder has been pinned on Walker, but he not only tells Mike that he's innocent, he says he's a dying man and doesn't want to go to his grave proclaimed a murderer. Dogged investigation, courtroom nimbleness and a healthy dose of luck usually have helped Mike and Rosie before, but it looks like it'll take more than that to prevail this time, and time is running out-both on their client and, just maybe, their partnership.<br><br></div>
