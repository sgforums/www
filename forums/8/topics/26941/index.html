My problem is that I feel too akward to ask w/o any assurances from the start. But the shyness only lasts for about a week...once I get it on with the girl, I won't feel shy anymore. It's just getting that first meeting going...<br><br>Btw, do girls like guys to move fast or slow? Which means is it better to suddenly pop the question one fine day or drop hints over a course of time...</div>

I myself chickened out numerous times too. Its all part of the learning process.<br><br>How steep the learning curve is gona be for you depends on your outlook of life. Learn to enjoy the process of getting there and not fret about the outcome. Lavish the process and victory will be so much sweeter.<br><br>Don't worry about her reaction. Dont approach her with a defeatist attitude. Talk to her like you would a friend. Ravel in the fact that we as men have the power to approach any girl we want. Most girls have to sit and wait for the 'guy with balls' to make the approach. So in other words be that guy.<br><br>I use to think that attracting women was rocket science. I could pass physics with my eyes closed and fail with women like a frustrated chump. All these came to pass when i changed my mindset. Its as simple as that. You don't need a 10inch dick or the look of a hollywood star. All you need is a positive and healthy outlook.<br><br>Be a man. Do not be ashamed of your sexuality but embrace it. See failure as a temporary setback to the inevitable -  which is finding the woman  you want.<br><br>Good luck my friend.<br><br>"The biggest risk you can take is not to risk at all."</div>
