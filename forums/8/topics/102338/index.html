            <div class='col-md body'>An article from ACRES on Polar bear at the zoo.<br><br>POLAR BEARS AT SINGAPORE ZOO<br>What are they doing in the tropics?<br>In 1978, Singapore Zoo acquired polar bears becoming one of the few zoos in Asia that held this species in captivity.<br><br>Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) inhabit cold and hostile environments. They are adapted to sea ice conditions, having a thick winter coat and fat layer to protect them.<br><br>Their short ears and tail are another adaptation to cold, being small and fur covered to prevent heat loss. These and other adaptations can cause polar bears to overheat, even in sub-zero conditions.<br><br>In the wild, polar bears have a large range and can travel 80 kilometres or more in one day.<br><br>WELFARE PROBLEMS FOR CAPTIVE POLAR BEARS<br><br>Polar bears are poor candidates for captivity, even in the best of circumstances.<br><br>In a recent report, researchers from Oxford University found that polar bears are one of the most affected species in captivity. The bears are prone to problems that include poor health and repetitive stereotypic behaviours. These problems stem from constraints imposed on the natural behaviour of susceptible animals with wide-ranging lifestyles in the wild. Naturally wide-ranging species show the most evidence of stress and/or psychological dysfunction in captivity.<br><br>Some animals (e.g., wide-ranging mammals) do not do well in captivity, so Acres believes their keeping should be phased out. Breeding should be curtailed and imports from the wild should end. However, considerable numbers of these animals already exist in captivity, so, in the short term, Acres advocates that captive management practices be improved to raise the standard of welfare experienced by these animals. In future, zoos should concentrate their efforts on species that respond better to being kept in captivity.<br><br>POLAR BEARS AT SINGAPORE ZOO<br><br>The bears are currently housed in an enclosure which is clearly detrimental to the well-being of the animals. Here's why:<br><br>The enclosure is too small to allow for the expression of a full range of species-typical behaviours and movements.<br>The open-air enclosure poses a clear problem since these bears are adapted to cold conditions. Singapore is however, a tropical country. The water in the pool provided for the bears is also not cooled.<br>The hard substrates in the enclosure fail to provide any opportunity for species-specific behaviours such as digging or foraging. Constant contact with this hard substrate may also lead to abrasions and sores on the animalÂ’s feet, or footpad ulcerations observed in animals exhibiting stereotypic pacing on concrete surfaces.<br>While some enrichment is provided, the bears interact with it for only short periods of time. The enclosure is relatively barren and lacks complexity.<br>The enclosure does not provide any privacy areas where the bears can retreat from public view or the view of each other.<br>Polar bears live in quiet environments in the wild, so the noise created by the waterfall in the enclosure may be problematic and a source of chronic low-level stress.<br>The bears have been observed to be constantly pacing or swimming in a stereotypic fashion, clear indications of an abnormal animal-environment interaction<br>In 1999, the male polar bear died, leaving the zoo with Sheeba, a female polar bear and her child, Inuka, a male polar bear.<br><br>DISCUSSIONS WITH SINGAPORE ZOO<br><br>Since April 2004, Acres has been in discussions with the Singapore zoo with regard to the polar bears. We have submitted our report to the zoo with detailed recommendations.<br><br>Since the bears cannot be released to the wild, Acres urges the zoo to move the bears to a more appropriate accommodation elsewhere. In addition, Acres urges the zoo to stop any further import of polar bears and other animals from arctic environments.<br><br>Until the polar bears are moved, Acres urges the Zoo to implement the recommendations contained in the report and make every effort possible to improve their living conditions, so the bears can, at the very least, express some of their natural behavioural repertoire.<br><br>Acres has also extended our help to the zoo for the improvement efforts and also in finding a new home for the bears (in a more suitable climate).<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>TAKE ACTION!<br><br>Please write to Singapore Zoo and thank them for meeting up with Acres. Please urge them to:<br><br>Make immediate improvements to the polar bear enclosure<br>Stop any further import of animals from the Arctic environment.<br>Send the polar bears to a more appropriate facility as soon as possible.<br><br>Please send your letters to:<br>Fanny Lai<br>Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS)<br>80 Mandai Lake Road<br>Singapore 729826<br>fannyl@zoo.com.sg<br><br>Please send us a copy of your letter at info@acres.org.sg.

The enclosure is relatively barren and lacks complexity.<br>The enclosure does not provide any privacy areas where the bears can retreat from public view or the view of each other.<br>Polar bears live in quiet environments in the wild, so the noise created by the waterfall in the enclosure may be problematic and a source of chronic low-level stress.<br>The bears have been observed to be constantly pacing or swimming in a stereotypic fashion, clear indications of an abnormal animal-environment interaction<br>In 1999, the male polar bear died, leaving the zoo with Sheeba, a female polar bear and her child, Inuka, a male polar bear.<br><br>DISCUSSIONS WITH SINGAPORE ZOO<br><br>Since April 2004, Acres has been in discussions with the Singapore zoo with regard to the polar bears. We have submitted our report to the zoo with detailed recommendations.<br><br>Since the bears cannot be released to the wild, Acres urges the zoo to move the bears to a more appropriate accommodation elsewhere. In addition, Acres urges the zoo to stop any further import of polar bears and other animals from arctic environments.<br><br>Until the polar bears are moved, Acres urges the Zoo to implement the recommendations contained in the report and make every effort possible to improve their living conditions, so the bears can, at the very least, express some of their natural behavioural repertoire.<br><br>Acres has also extended our help to the zoo for the improvement efforts and also in finding a new home for the bears (in a more suitable climate).<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>TAKE ACTION!<br><br>Please write to Singapore Zoo and thank them for meeting up with Acres. Please urge them to:<br><br>Make immediate improvements to the polar bear enclosure<br>Stop any further import of animals from the Arctic environment.<br>Send the polar bears to a more appropriate facility as soon as possible.<br><br>Please send your letters to:<br>Fanny Lai<br>Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS)<br>80 Mandai Lake Road<br>Singapore 729826<br>fannyl@zoo.com.sg<br><br>Please send us a copy of your letter at info@acres.org.sg. On behalf of the animals, Thank you.<br><br></div></blockquote>WHo gives a FUCK about polar bears goddamit!?!? Well my environmentalist mate might roflz.<br><br>The only reason the polar bears are here are so i can bring my cousin to the Zoo so i can show what a giant WHITE hairy monster looks like, so she don't have to go to the bloody north pole. SO THERE!<br><br>Who cares if the bears can't pose or express themselves, that's not their purpose, their purpose is to SIT there, EAT, grow fat and allow themselves to be looked at. PERIOD!!<br><br></div>
