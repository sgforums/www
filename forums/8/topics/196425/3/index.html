Last year it had signed a $14 million-contract with Italian independent producer-distributor Mondo TV to co-produce four new animated series. Its other clients include British animation companies Mallard Media and Ealing Animation.<br><br>Though animated films have always been used as a medium for entertainment and public information, the medium was never exploited in India as a money-spinner. But since the late 90s, the animation industry has begun to take money seriously. The key catalyst was the huge overseas market for which India is proving to be a cheap production alternative.<br><br>Now even veteran filmmakers like Ram Mohan, who is regarded as the father of Indian animation, feels that Indian animation houses should not restrict themselves to catering to the overseas market.<br><br>The digital miracle workers are not confining themselves to introducing visual effects of international standards in Bollywood films but are acquainting Indian viewers with the magical world of animation.<br><br>A report by Anderson Consulting pegs the Indian animation industry at $550 million. It also estimates a growth rate of 30 percent annually in the next three years resulting in a $15 billion industry by 2008. The study also reports that India will receive more than $2 billion worth of animation business by 2007.<br><br>Meanwhile, Nasscom (National Association of Software Service Companies) estimates the current global animation market to be worth around $45 billion and expects it to jump to between $50 billion and $70 billion by next year. It also states that India could use 300,000 professionals in content development and animation by 2008, up from 27,000 three years ago.<br><br>"Animation is a universal language. But in India it is still a nascent industry. We can't afford to be complacent and need to constantly upgrade our knowledge to international levels," says Rajesh Turakhia, CEO, Maya Entertainment Ltd.<br><br>Bollywood honchos are certainly waking up to the advantages of animation and visual effects. Yash Chopra's "Hum Tum" would not have been quite the same without the cartoon characters.<br><br>Atul Vohra of Arena feels more and more Indian production houses are realising the potential and joining the multimedia bandwagon. Almost all big budget Indian films now have a 3D animation component in their films.<br><br>In the past few months, Mumbai-based animator United Television (UTV) has won four animation production and two co-production deals worth a total of $4 million with overseas companies.<br><br>Though Indian animation industry has talents like Rahul Deshprabhu who worked in "The Day After Tomorrow" and "I, Robot", and visual effects producer N. Madhusudhanan who worked in "The Lord of the Rings", it still needs to go an extra mile to compete with the animation industry abroad.<br><br>Animated versions of stories based on Indian mythology are already being telecast in Indian homes and many more are in the pipeline. However, it may be some time before producers make full-fledged animation movies in Bollywood.<br><br>The industry, nonetheless, is trying its best to ensure that world-class made-in-India animation no longer remains the prerogative of Hollywood alone.<br><br>Hindi News<br>Film on Indian outsourcing to be screened in US<br><br>Deepa Mehta's 'Water' makes waves in North America<br><br>Jharkhand may not screen 'The Da Vinci Code'<br><br>I'd like my film to be like 'Crash': Apoorva Lakhia<br><br>With 'Krrish', the superhero comes to Indian celluloid<br><br>Salman Khan is my lucky mascot: Nadiadwala<br><br>Hrithik has strengthened our team: Rakesh Roshan<br><br>Youth who burnt himself over 'Fanaa' dies<br><br>More Hindi News<br><br>Advertisement<br><br></div>

But don't write off the possibility of a desi version of Lion King yet.<br><br>Of late, filmmakers are creating scripts with roles for animated characters. Recent films like Abhay, Mein Prem Ki Diwani Hoon, Shaadi Ka Ladoo and Hum Tum have used cartoons, in small bits.<br><br>Now an animated creature, Zampano plays the lead character in an upcoming film Friends Forever. What's more, Ashok Kaul's fulllength animation movie Bhagmati is also ready for release.<br><br>"It's good to see that the filmmakers using animation. But, it is only to keep the viewers interested. In Shaadi ... the song chal hat was a major talking point. It's a sort of marketing strategy. Everybody is scared to make a full-length animation movie as they feel it might not work in small centres. But Hum Tum proves that, if handled well, animation can help a movie do well," says Abhijit Anpat, senior animator at Zee Institute of Creative Arts.<br><br>Adds Sudhis Rambhotla, head of Colour Chips, "I think the filmmakers are waiting for some guy to take the plunge. They are sceptical." According to animators, Hum Tum did well because the cartoon characters were an integral part of the story.<br><br>"In Prem Ki... the parrot looked out of place. Animation should not be force fitted to any script," says Ravi Kiran, animator at Jadooworks Pvt Ltd,who is currently working on couple of Disney projects.<br><br>And Sooraj Barjatya did exactly that. His decision to introduce the parrot was a last minute one and backed by superstition. But in Friends Forever , Zampano — India's first computer-generated 3D animated character — is very much part of the movie. A childhood toy turned friend of the film's heroine (Hrishita Bhatt), Zampano helps her get her love. Zampano has 36 minutes of screen presence in the film and promises to be quite expressive.<br><br>And according to Ashok Kaul, director of Bhagmati , there's more to come. "Once Bhagmati is released, I think there will be more interest in animation. Currently, animation is being used as a novelty factor. It is still in a very nascent stage."<br><br></div>

Now they can't get enough of it."<br><br>However, film critic Indu Mirani believes it will be sometime before people warm up to animated features made in India.<br><br>"In the end, whether it is animation or Bollywood, people are looking for a good story.<br><br>"Our film-makers are very bad at selecting stories and tend to stick with Indian themes that lack universal appeal.<br><br>"So until we get that right, no amount of quality or star power will help get the kind of audience they are looking for."</div>
