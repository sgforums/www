            <div class='col-md body'>Episode 4<br>------------<br><br>The Zergling Lord couldnÂ’t believe in the order it just received. However, it had to execute it. In a well-structured military organization demonstrated in MR^2 (MMO-RTS-RPG, a new term coined for this kind of new gaming concept) Starcraft, one of the obvious ways to get promoted is to follow higher-level generalÂ’s order and execute it excellently. Otherwise, you can easily be replaced by any other person who is more willing to follow the instruction, anytime. This appointment power is one of the tools that enables higher-level general to rule effectively.<br><br>People who do not like work under organization or nation can choose to become a wandering ranger, move around in the realm of MR^2 Starcraft alone. In fact, more people choose to join a nation and hope in one day will climb to the power submit. Anyway, it is much more influential a nation leader can be than a lone high-skilled ranger.<br><br>The zergling horde was getting impatient to just hold to the ground doing nothing. The unrest began to spread in the horde. They wanted to taste some blood, rather than just waiting at this place. The Zergling Lord directed its army to advance. The zerglings couldnÂ’t wait any longer and rushed at the highest speed. They were so many and you could see dust covered every corner of the place when they passed-by.<br><br>What the zergling horde didnÂ’t realize was we were already following them, from a safe distance, monitoring their movement. I really didnÂ’t want to get any closer. It was so frightening to see such a huge amount of zerglings moving in a group. They had the strength to level everything blocking their way.<br><br>My memory reminded me the time when I was still a private, scouting The UnionÂ’s territory border in a small squad of 8 marines, many years ago. It was just a very ordinary routine checkup, but the ending wasnÂ’t ordinary at all. I was still troubled by the same nightmare until now Â– zerglings seemed to be everywhere, coming out from every tree. We totally lost control on the situation. Our small squad of 8 simply fired at will. It didnÂ’t work at all. Most of our bullets just hit the air. We felt so hopeless and helpless. We realized that we were surrounded by an outnumbered zergling force. Those brute zerglings began to rip us apart, one by one. The scene reminded me of the Doom3 scenario, the spooky Mars base came to life, monsters came out from dark corner and caught you in surpriseÂ…<br><br>I was the only survivor of the ambush. I was the one because they chose me to be the one Â– they wanted to leave a survivor to go back and tell the story. Those zerglings stood in a line in front of me, teasing my inability to fight them. Then I realized that there were only 5 zerglings in total - 8 marines couldnÂ’t handle 5 zerglings. I couldnÂ’t sleep well in that night. I woke up many times from the same nightmare. It was simply a huge blow to me. I vowed to repay them in double. This was the golden opportunity to show them our muscle.<br><br>4 vulture bikes scattered in 4 far corners. We were waiting the zergling horde to enter into the heart of our mine field. Our high tech binoculars enable us to monitor the zerglings from a great distance. The zergling horde didnÂ’t realize that they were getting closer to hell. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Â… We activated the mines. The zerglings immediately sense something wasnÂ’t good but it was too late. They tried to escape and totally lost their formation.<br><br>BoomÂ… a great explosion happened. 4 spider mines killed off 12 zerglings, not a bad deal! The Zergling Lord was indeed a superior leader. It quickly reassembled its force, putting them back to a good formation shape and came after us. We tried to return fire, however the minimum firearm we have on the vulture bike wasnÂ’t sufficient to hurt this huge group of zerglings. We were forced to retreat after suffering serious damage from the brute zerglingsÂ’ claws.<br><br>We headed back to the main base at full speed. The zerglings were following but they couldnÂ’t get us given our high speed bike. The broadcast had silently been on air in the middle of the battle. It drew attention of 50,000 audiences in the first 20 minute broadcast. According to initial estimate, it would bring 186,000 dollars to the ultimate winner.<br><br>As the FallensÂ’ force has gone beyond 100km safety line, I called Sam for reinforcement. Damn! Sam didnÂ’t pick up his cell phone.<br><br>70 zerglings are going to have a direct face-to-face skirmish with my smaller army soon. Reinforcement has yet been confirmed. I was so worriedÂ…<br><br>(to be continuedÂ…)<br>- How do you want the story to continue? Tell us and I will try to match it if possible.<br></div>
