            <div class='col-md body'>Victim Nick: Office_girl. Currently 28 year old Singaporean Girl<br><br>Hi people,<br><br>I am a Singaporean girl and currently working in a local MNC and I am 28 years old. Educated as NUS and armed with an MBA from NTU, I am your common Singaporean female. I am above average looking and chirpy. However, beneath this chirpy demeanour lies an entrenched history of mine in which I would rather forget. It is a deep emotional scar even though those responsible has been punished.<br><br>This will be the first time I am going public with my real life event as I feel the urge to protect the other adventurous young girls who may end up like me, a victim of rape. Fonts in bold are the story in which I have repeated to everyone, including the security guard of my condo, my family, my friends who know the event, the police IO, the DPP and of course, the learned Judge of Singapore.<br><br>I just want you guys to remember something, that after I have penned this story, I will be coming back to this thread with a Conclusion which is extremely crucial and germane to the entire event. The real life story will unfold in the 2nd reply of mine in this thread.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Exactly 7 years ago, there was this young man aged 22 who keeps wooing me in school. I was one of the school belle and it is hardly surprising that he was crazy over me. He was not bad looking but pesty though. At times, I really cannot stand him. He will appear at my doorstep just to pass me school notes and flowers even during examination period. I had wanted to avoid him but the condoÃ¢Â€Â™s security guard of mine is always relaxed in letting him into my condo. I was being pestered by him for more than 6 months. During these 6 months, I had hell and whenever I see his face, I literally wanted to puke at him.<br><br>On the april of 1999, he was at my door again. Being the only kid of my parents, I have no other siblings with me and my parents were overseas. In fact, i was alone most of the time and I really feel down and craving for more attention at times. He kept knocking on my door persistently, saying how much he misses me and wants me to be his girlfriend. Alright I admit. I have been using him to pass me useful notes for my final examinations. I allowed him in to drink some water after he asked.  His name is Leonard by the way.<br><br>After inviting him into my house, he commented on my one piece dress, which was actually my pajamas. I went into my room to place the notes that he had passed to me. When I turned to go out of the room, I was surprised to find Leonard right behind me already. He suddenly grabbed me by my face and rained kisses on me, telling me how much he loves me. He was army-trained and strong while I was relatively fragile. I struggled and he pushed me onto my king-size bed and my legs were open, revealing my red panty. He had a look at my private part area and I think he got high. He ripped off my panty and pulled up my entire one-piece dress within seconds even with my persistent resistance. I knew I had no power to stop him. I kept crying as everything came as a shock. I do not know what to do. When I was crying, I felt a sharp pain into my vagina. His cock literally thrust deep into my body. It was as if a knife had been pushed all the way in! Within seconds, he was thrusting like mad while I was pushing him away, to no avail.<br><br>He was panting heavily and definitely enjoying the sensation while I was literally begging for him to stop. I was being raped like a prostitute and despite my pleas to stop, he went harder in. I yelled. No one came to my rescue as my condo unit was sound proof.<br><br>He finally cummed inside me. I felt so cheap and used. I was raped. I can feel the hot sperms flowing out of my vagina even with the intense pain of being thrusted.<br><br>I was crying uncontrollably on the bed while he commented that my vagain was tight while giggling. I closed my eyes. He then had another idea. He took an umbella from the side of my cupboard and poke it 5 cm deep into my vagina while I closed my eyes! I screamed and begged him to stop. He got high on seeing this I bet. He then removed the umbella and shafted his cock into my vagina for the 2nd time of the day. Ouch! It was really sad and pathetic for me as I laid that, unable to do anything but being ravished and destroyed.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>LMAO... The first post was decent enough, almost convincing, the second post reveals a made up story. If a victim wants to write about a rape case, especially one from higher level education calibre, their main focus of the story would be about the incident, the anger, the emotions rather than the pretty specific descriptions of the steamy sexual details. From what I see, the post is more like a sex story.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Victim nick: Leonard. 29 years old fitness trainer<br><br>Exactly 7 years ago, there was this young woman aged 22 who keeps flirting with me in school. I was one of the school's nerd and it is very surprising that she was swooning over me. She was not bad looking but slutty though. At times, I really cannot understand her. She will appear at my doorstep just to pass me school notes even during examination period.<br><br>I had wanted to avoid her but the condo's security guard of mine was a ti ko and kept letting her in into my condo. I was being zapped by her for more than 6 months. For more than 6 months, I had hell and whenever I see her face, I literally wanted to run away but like a black widow who caught her prey on her web,I failed.......miserably.<br><br>On the april of 1999, she was at my door again. Being the only kid of my parents, I have no other siblings with me and my parents were overseas.In fact, i was alone most of the time and I really felt i needed some company.<br><br>She kept knocking on my door persistently,saying she had arranged a study group and my home was the venue.Alright I'd admit.I've allowed my smart brain ego to over-rule my common senses.<br><br>Believing her,I allowed her in,as she swore the others would be here shortly and she was here first to confirm I was in.I poured her and myself some drinks,like a good host would and walked back to the kitchen to return the tray.Her name is office_girl by the way.<br><br>After inviting her into my house,she,suddenly felt my chest and abs and commented on how well toned my body was(no thanks to NS).After taking a few sips and some small talk,I went into my room to place the notes that she had passed to me.<br><br>When I turned,I was surprised to find office_girl right behind me. She suddenly grabbed me by my face and rained kisses on me, telling me how much she wants me.<br><br>I was army-trained and strong while she was relatively fragile.I had to struggle and she pushed me onto my king-size bed with little effort.<br><br>There and then I knew,she had spiked my drink.My body went limp and I was powerless as she took off my clothes revealing my chocolate tanned body.She had a look at my privates and got wet,all the while making lewd comments about how big my guns were,comparing it with other horses she had ridden and how she'll enjoy riding it.<br><br>She skimmed off her clothes faster than a soilder can reload his M16,within seconds she was working my tool.Trying with all my might to fight my biological response,I knew I had no power to stop her.I tried to struggle but somehow,my body couldn't respond, as everything came as a shock and the spiked drink. I did not know what to do. When I had given up all hopes,I felt a heavy sensation,she was riding me,her womanhood literally engulfed my tool deep into her body. It was as if I was being eaten like a weenie!<br><br>Within seconds, she was riding me like mad while I was trying to resist the urge to come....alas,all that was to no avail.<br><br>She was panting heavily,definitely enjoying the sensation while I was literally begging for her to stop. I was being raped like a toy boy and despite my pleas to stop, she went harder,faster and louder. I yelled but it was like a yelp.Whatever she had used,it was so strong that it could knock a healthy male down.No one came to my rescue as I was being abused by her.I guess that sound proof wall worked a bit too well.<br><br>Finally,no longer being able to resist,I came inside her.I felt so cheap and used. I was raped. I can feel the hot come and her juices flowing out of her womanhood.Knowing I am suffering the intense pyschological pain of being raped,she refused to unmount,rubbing away,enjoying every last minute of her spasms,despite the fact she refused to use any form of protection.<br><br>I was lying there,manhood limping,crying mentally on the bed while she commented that my rod was stiff and hard while giggling. I closed my eyes thinking it was finally over after the torturous 47 mins,but it was not to be.<br><br>she then had another idea.she took out may nat king cole CD and played unforgettable! And began working my rod.Making it stiff again!I wanted to scream and begged her to stop but I was unable to.She got wet again on seeing this,knowing already what kind of person she is,She then mount me again,this time into her ass,for a 2nd ride.<br><br>The intense pain......!<br><br>It was really sad and pathetic for me as I laid that, unable to do anything but being ravished and destroyed.By then I had regain some control of my lower body,trying to move away,she thought I was pumping her,and began to match stroke by stroke!!!<br><br>Knowing its futile,I just laid there till she came.<br><br>And came she did.<br><br>I've stopped fighting my biological respond,I know if i didn't,she'll continue on till the cows came home.When she was done,she again made lewd comments .Walked straight to the showers as if it was her home.She got dressed,lit up,gave a final slutty air kiss and walked out my front door.<br><br>I tried making a police report but I was further ridiculed,humiliated and called a LIAR by the poodles.I did not know what happened,but news of me allegedly raping her got into the school,I was left with no choice but to leave the country emotionally and pyshcologically scarred.<br></div>
