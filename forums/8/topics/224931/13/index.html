Jesus tilth doesn't mean he tell christian to tilth. I can give u an example. Jesus is a jew, he followed all jewish laws including circumcised, not eating pork and all the jewish laws. So jesus circumcised all christians must circumcised ? U claim jesus state christian have to tilth, but u only show jesus, following jewish laws of tilthing. U r actually supporting my point<br><br><blockquote>At first i tot wow impressive. you can quote scriptures. but after looking the website then i know u copy and paste. why not copy the last statement as well. which says that all these prohecies will be established during the second coming of Christ. which i am not going to touch on that, cause it will be alot of posts just for that reasoning. </blockquote>And so ? I know about the fact tat jesus have not followed all the messiah criteria and prove my points. U want to talk about 2nd coming there is also something written in that website on the 2nd coming. So wat u got to say for tat ? Do u study your OT well ?<br><br><blockquote>well if it is because that cain gave crops so that God reject it and not because he gave something that is not the best. then i wonder why the bible states that abel gave the FIRSTBORN.. hm... they can might as well dont mention it? the reason why they wrote firstborn, it is to show that abel gave his very first "fruit" of his increase to God. </blockquote>Why does writing "firstborn" means anything ? There is nothing in the bible tat states cain not giving the best of the fruit etc. From the whole bible it become clear tat god do not like vegetable sacrifices. tat is why for all sacrifices, he demand lamb or ram<br><br><blockquote>pls post in the EH. this is not the correct platform to discuss such</blockquote>EH ?
