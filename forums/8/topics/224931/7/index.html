            <div class='col-md body'>Some information for people interested. From wiki btw.<br><br>Connections with Christianity and Tao Te Ching<br>Since Christian missionaries were among the first Westerners to study the Tao Te Ching, it is not surprising that they connected Taoism with Christianity. There are many parallels between the New Testament and the Tao Te Ching, for instance, "Do good to those who hate you" (Luke 6:27, tr. NASB) and "Requite injuries with good deeds" (chap. 63, tr. Waley[14]). Note that the Chinese Bible translates logos as Tao.<br>Two particular Tao Te Ching chapters are perceived as exemplifying Christian themes. Chapter 42 bears a resemblance to the Trinity doctrine: "The Way gave birth to unity, Unity gave birth to duality, Duality gave birth to trinity, Trinity gave birth to the myriad creatures." (tr. Mair 1990:9). In 1823, the French sinologist Jean-Pierre-Abel RÃ©musat suggested that Yahweh was signified by three words in Chapter 14; yi (? "calm; level; barbarian"), xi (? "rare; indiscernible; hope"), and wei (? "tiny, small; obscure").<br>We look for it but do not see it; we name it "subtle." We listen for it but do not hear it; we name it "rare." We grope for it but do not grasp it; we name it "serene." These three cannot be fully fathomed, Therefore, They are bound together to make unity." (chap. 14, tr. Mair 1990:74)<br>James Legge (1891:57-58[15]) dismissed this hypothetical yi-xi-wei and Yahweh connection as "a mere fancy or dream". According to Holmes Welch:<br>It is not hard to understand the readiness of early scholars to assert that the doctrine of the Trinity was revealed in the Tao Te Ching and that its fourteenth chapter contains the syllables of "Yahveh." Even today, though these errors have been recognized for more than a century, the general notion that Lao Tzu was Christ's forerunner has lost none of its romantic appeal. (1965:7)<br>Present day researchers, such as Damascene et al. (1999), continue to explore the similarities between Taoist and Christian teachings.<br></div>

Can't Christianity be practised as a more personal religion, as in based on own interpretation and devotion rather than institutionalised as embodied by the churches?</div>

I suppose it's easy to criticise religious institutions, especially the Christian ones, but are they suppose to serve any important purpose and how well do they do in that?</div>

Even my friend from I-Kuan-Tao go to her Fo Tang four times a week. So why should a christian not go to church?<br><br>Furthermore, the church provides support such as bible study, so that if u are in doubt u can ask ur bible study leader or discuss with ur mates. So going to church definitely beats being alone.</div>

To be fair, I agree with you on your intepretation of tithing.<br><br>I have a different interpretation of your second point about not doing anything knowing the fact that some people are delibrately twisting facts and exploiting people in the name of religion (all religions for that matter, not just Christianity). But of course, the difficulty lies in determining whether those people are twisting facts and exploiting, isn't it? So, the next logical step is to look at the outcome, which if there is no harm done, then most people would generally leave it as it is.<br><br>Take the example of the terrorist acts in the name of religion, this of course, prompted some people to suddenly assume that religion is evil. The true believers of the religion would then explain to the non-believers about the appropriate interpretation. Of course, this action would only occur when the outcome is known.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So, what is certain is until the issue becomes serious enough, it will always remain as it is because we have different perceptions of the facts and most of us refuse to do anything about it because it is not doing any harm (which, of course, harm is subjective).<br><br>It's the case of being pro-active vs reactive.</div>
