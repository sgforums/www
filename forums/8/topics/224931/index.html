            <div class='col-md body'>Have you ever wonder why Christian would ask people go church? If you believe that by believing Jesus you'll go heaven and if not you'll go to hell to suffer for eternity... then I think You'll go everyone telling everyone to go church..... just like if you found a cure for a deadly sickness you'll tell everyone who has the sickness to get the cure.... so if your fren ask you to go to church... is because your fren cares for you.... not because his church has a status quo to meet or he earn commission from it... as far as I know no christian get paid asking people to church. Sometime it could be annoying... but just like your mum naggin at you... she cares for you right?...Would you bring someone you totally hate to a very nice place so that you'll face him/her for eternity?... so next time if your fren ask you to go to church....  smile at her/him because you know that its beacuse your fren cares to bring you to a very nice place for eternity.. if not kindly reject your fren for your fren have a heart for you....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The thing that I really didn't liked about preaching to your peers is the use of "if you don't believe in Jesus, you will go to hell". And the over-emphasis of this "ticket to heaven" (I've heard sermons myself which just keeps ranting on and on about the exclusiveness of this ticket to heaven to christians, as if christians have really found some good bargain), even in the churches (I attended church for 3 years). Sometimes I really dunno if christians go to church because of this ticket to heaven or whether they are there to worship God.<br><br>But the worst sermon I attended is a particular mega church which the pastor preaches: "it is alright for christians to show off their wealth because God made them wealthy."<br><br>Not christians-bashing, but just relating my own experience.</div>

Because you want your friends to feel how good the watch is too.<br><br>To me, i think some christians preech the gospel just like above. We have the enthusiasim to outwardly invite our friends to our churches. Some christians bare the heart of introducing something good to you. Others hope that you can subscribe to salvation, all so that you can go for the good(to the chirstian).<br><br>So next time if you feel annoyed by your christian friend, why not think about his intentions, subjectively, he is introducing something good to you!!<br><br>What i am saying is assuming christianity to be true. But may we step into the person's shoes, to judge the person.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately, the way the church operates is a bit like MLM. One thing that the church is over-obsessed with these days are figures. I have attended two prostestant churches and the sad thing about it is that there is over-emphasis in "recruiting" people than the follow-up or guidance and fellowship.<br><br>I converted to christianity at a point when I didn't really know much about the religion but was under a pressured altar-calling session which turns out to be a bit forced as I was made to say the sinner's prayer. Before I converted, people were warm friendly and enthusiastic around me, but that changed after I converted. I was thrown aside and assumed to be able to pick things up myself (ie. read the entire bible) or learn how to say prayers, how to relate to God, how the whole thing works. I didn't have the benefit of sunday schools like my cell group mates. I felt neglected.<br><br>Regular church-attendance didn't help much either as sermons focussed on selective text randomly from here and there and at the end of the day, I only get a fraction of the picture, in bits and pieces. Ultimately, I came to a conclusion that people seemed more involved in clapping hands, jumping, shouting, yelling, fainting and going into trances than the actual education of the word itself. One particular mega church has its proportion of its regular session flipped around such that more time is spent on the concert part and the actual sermon is just flashed over, in point form. Cell groups operate in similar fashion, and increasingly caused my discomfort in this bizarre relationship with my church-going peers, where it is an extreme cycle from nonchalent relationship during the weekdays to uncomfortably intimate sharing sessions on saturdays.<br><br>I dunno whats the rationale behind mega churches, whether its for bringing in more money or preaching to the world so that Jesus would return.<br><br>I am agnostic now largely because of the way the church operates. It's scary. And attending a world religions module at NUS kinda also opened up my perspectives to the other religions of the world. And I realised the bible is not as flawless as I thought before. No offence.</div>
