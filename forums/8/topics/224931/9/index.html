I do not consider tt hiding behind God. Instead, i'm walking wif God fufilling His purpose for me, and tt purpose is definitely not debates about His existence.

During the period of about 300 years who can be sure that nothing was twisted or being added.<br><br>During the 300 years Rome actually was killing a lot of chirstists. How many lived to pass on the real truth about jesus and God. No one knows.<br><br>I am not saying that other Religions are 100% correct but words being pass more it is possible for the truth to be twisted from the original.</div></blockquote>Well, tts false information. The Gospels were written within the same generation as Jesus. In fact the entire new testament were written within the same generation. Thus when the Gospels were written, we can b sure tt nothing is twisted, cos many eye-witnesses of Jesus's life were still living.<br><br>As for one of the previous post, mentioning Gospel of Mary Magdelene, Thomas, Judas, etc. These Gospels are the ones written centuries after Jesus's death. In fact, they were not written by the actual people themselves. Tts the reason y they contained several inconsistencies and weren't included in the Bible.</div>
