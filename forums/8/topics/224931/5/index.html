U believe tat the other person is sick, when he believe he is perfectly healthy. U have to prove to him tat he is sick first because anyhow take medicine with side effects when u r not sick can be deadly. And furthermore, tis person who thought he have the cure can't prove to himself he got tat disease too. He just thought he do and he may be making the mistake himself. Why spread the wrong cure for a possibly non-existence sickness ?<br><br><blockquote>If we talk about intention,this person has fully good intentiions.</blockquote>Tat is right.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sermodabian:</div><div class="quote_body">Unfortunately, the way the church operates is a bit like MLM. One thing that the church is over-obsessed with these days are figures. I have attended two prostestant churches and the sad thing about it is that there is over-emphasis in "recruiting" people than the follow-up or guidance and fellowship.<br><br>I converted to christianity at a point when I didn't really know much about the religion but was under a pressured altar-calling session which turns out to be a bit forced as I was made to say the sinner's prayer. Before I converted, people were warm friendly and enthusiastic around me, but that changed after I converted. I was thrown aside and assumed to be able to pick things up myself (ie. read the entire bible) or learn how to say prayers, how to relate to God, how the whole thing works. I didn't have the benefit of sunday schools like my cell group mates. I felt neglected.<br><br>Regular church-attendance didn't help much either as sermons focussed on selective text randomly from here and there and at the end of the day, I only get a fraction of the picture, in bits and pieces. Ultimately, I came to a conclusion that people seemed more involved in clapping hands, jumping, shouting, yelling, fainting and going into trances than the actual education of the word itself. One particular mega church has its proportion of its regular session flipped around such that more time is spent on the concert part and the actual sermon is just flashed over, in point form. Cell groups operate in similar fashion, and increasingly caused my discomfort in this bizarre relationship with my church-going peers, where it is an extreme cycle from nonchalent relationship during the weekdays to uncomfortably intimate sharing sessions on saturdays.<br><br>I dunno whats the rationale behind mega churches, whether its for bringing in more money or preaching to the world so that Jesus would return.<br><br>I am agnostic now largely because of the way the church operates. It's scary. And attending a world religions module at NUS kinda also opened up my perspectives to the other religions of the world. And I realised the bible is not as flawless as I thought before. No offence.</div></blockquote>You are indeed very wise and discerning!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In short some of the core of christianity are being twisted. Some of what I learnt from the bible and my mother are as below.<br><br>(1) It is not compulsory to give offerings, but it is <strong>compulsory to to give with a cheerful heart.</strong><br><br>(2) <strong>It is not only giving to church that is considered giving.</strong> You help a begger along the streets up, clothe him, feed him, find him a job, make him your friend, when he dies, you settle his last moments, all in the name of Jesus. Is also a form of giving. And <strong>never ever expect a single cent from God or expecting to let other people know your deeds when you're doing this</strong>. And God while seeing you do this in private will be happy for you.<br><br>(3) When giving offerings (tithe), do not expect to reap the same amount from God. Because it is only duty to do it. <strong>What returns do you expect when you perform your duty.</strong><br><br>(4) Even when you received Christ before you go and murder someone, <strong>don't expect to escape punishments for your sins. But you can count on God to forgive you after your punishments.</strong><br><br>Today there are many perversed versions of how christianity should be. But alas, the perversed version is given so much attention to propagande to the people that the core of Christianity is neglected and misunderstood. And also, God's standard is always perfect. No one in the world can even fathom that level. For all fall short to the glory of God. Always ask and check the bible, don't always believe everything you hear from anyone blindly. Let God lead you to understand his ways because no man can replace God as a teacher.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, it really doesn't matter which religion you choose to believe in... No matter what people around you say or even your family say, I believe in one thing, FREE WILL....<br><br>With our Christian friends, this should not be a new concept... above everything else, God gave us Free Will... to choose what to do with our lives..<br><br>So even if everyone pitches the story of God to you, you have the choice to believe, or not to believe... but it does not give you the right to be mean to the well-meaning gospel-advocate...<br><br>Bottom line, doesn't matter what religion you believe in... doesn't matter if you don't have a religion... cos ultimately, religion (excludes cults) teaches good, and encourage people to live well.  It is a mindset that guides how we conduct ourselves and how we treat others.<br><br>Rather than to look at all the religions as separate entities, I'd choose to view it from a macro angle...</div>
