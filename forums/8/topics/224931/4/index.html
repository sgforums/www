It's just how you seem to want to purposely offend rather than any good you claim to be doing. No one's asking you to lie or anything, but you're at the opposite extreme.

A stage where you realise eternal happiness can be found within yourself. (pls correct me if i'm wrong)<br><br>anyway, buddhism is a very profound religion indeed, or rather i would say it is something beyond religion. (if the definitely of religion is the worship of a supreme entity and carry out rituals and rites, then buddhism is not a religion as it encourages intelligent doubting and believes the potential supremacy of the individual. Rites and rituals do not give ppl wisdom and happiness thus buddhism is a religion out of convention.)<br><br>Sorry i'm not anti any other religion btw, just trying to clear some doubts here about buddhism. And as a practicing buddhist, i will accept any teachings from other religions if it brings me happiness. As quoted from the website <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/5minbud.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/5minbud.htm</a>: <strong><br><br>Are Other Religions Wrong?<br><br>Buddhism is also a belief system which is tolerant of all other beliefs or religions. Buddhism agrees with the moral teachings of other religions but Buddhism goes further by providing a long term purpose within our existence, through wisdom and true understanding. Real Buddhism is very tolerant and not concerned with labels like 'Christian', 'Moslem', 'Hindu' or 'Buddhist'; that is why there have never been any wars fought in the name of Buddhism. That is why Buddhists do not preach and try to convert, only explain if an explanation is sought.</strong><br><br>So to me there is nothing wrong to visit churches, mosque, hindu temples and so on as long as i can gain wisdom from their teachings and i will accept only what i feel is correct and will lead me towards happiness (true happiness rather than material happiness which last only for a few moments before we start craving again)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
