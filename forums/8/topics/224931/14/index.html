Honestly, I'm really not the one with a reputation here. You can call it a personal attack in your own view if you like, I think you should also realise that I don't post about just anyone in sgforums like that. There are other people who have doubts about Christianity, but it's only a few that I have an issue with.<br><br>And before you shoot off, no, I don't post like this about anti-christians only.<br><br>I am not known in sgforums for anything, you however are a different thing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U r ignoring the base question again. According to the bible verses tat support tilthing, most of them come from the OT. Why accept some part from the OT and reject the others ? Pick and choose wat u like to believe ?<br><strong> Don't get what you means? Why did we choose to reject others? Jesus said He came to fufill the old testement not abolish it. you have a bad understanding of Christianity</strong><br><br>So god really test people by asking them to kill their decendents. Well tis really shows how fanatical u believe in your religion...<br><strong> Government put in a green uniform and expect you to kill another person.... hmmm that shows how fanatical you believe in your government. I think sometimes its about logic.... If one day you see an angel really appear out of no where and its those kind that is real and not your day dreams.... tells you to do that... tell me what would you do? You believe in your earthly government is because its real, and if really see that the government that rules the physcial and spiritual telling you to do something I think you'll do it too.</strong><br><br>Tat is strange. I remember over 1800 bishops were invited, and only a few hundred turn out. They have a great debate and in the end then they choose jesus to be as divine as his father. In the end everybody just guess wat they preceive as the truth. They shape the bible to wat they like to believe. And as said, the bible writers r unknown to u, and u believe them simply because they claim they get divine inspiration. Any tom dick and harry can claim they have divine inspiration. Furthermore, wat make u think tat god can only inspire successful religious leader and not pass his mesage to poor and normal people. In the bible there r many characters tat r not famous religious leaders isn't it ?<br><strong> Then again you had bad understanding of the bible history.... Go wiki and read about the council of nicea. All these books are added in because they have concrete evidence that they are not from unknow sources... even through time. Example Reformist have only 66 bibles with a few books short simply the source is unknown. The old testements are written by Historical people who does have leadership in both the history of Isreal or religious leadership.

Double standard ?<br><strong> God is not cruel to the people before Christ. God is just to the people before Christ. Is law cruel to the evil people? No Law is just to the evil people by giving them punishment. The only difference is when Christ came he bear your sin and punishment so you won't have to be punished.

And jesus also enforce tat the OT still applies to the jews and dos not apply to christians. As such the thigns he said to the pharisee belong to jews category</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Don't get what you means? Why did we choose to reject others? Jesus said He came to fufill the old testement not abolish it. you have a bad understanding of Christianity </blockquote>Bad understanding ? I think u do nto understand wat had been discussed bah. R u following OT laws ? If u do not then u just spoke my point<br><br><blockquote>Government put in a green uniform and expect you to kill another person.... hmmm that shows how fanatical you believe in your government. I think sometimes its about logic.... If one day you see an angel really appear out of no where and its those kind that is real and not your day dreams.... tells you to do that... tell me what would you do? You believe in your earthly government is because its real, and if really see that the government that rules the physcial and spiritual telling you to do something I think you'll do it too. </blockquote>So u mean u go to war as a soldier and u do not kill anyone ? R u sure u know wat the role of a soldier is about ? For your second part, I do not knwo wat u r talking about. If an angel suddenly appears and I have no reason to doubt it is true, I will believe wat he had said. However tat never happened, and tat to me, will never happened so I still maintain my stand<br><br><blockquote>Then again you had bad understanding of the bible history.... Go wiki and read about the council of nicea. All these books are added in because they have concrete evidence that they are not from unknow sources... even through time. Example Reformist have only 66 bibles with a few books short simply the source is unknown.

I formed the idea from wiki  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> And again u did not specifically say wat part is wrong from the words I say about the council  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The problem with the bible, as states, is the writer claim they r divinely inspire. There is absolutely nothing else tat backup their claim. If u look at other cults, the leaders r free to state watever they want and can claim they r divinely inspired. How r they different from these bible writers ?<br><br><blockquote>Wrong God didn't reject Abel's crops God only reject cain's Read your bible please before debating</blockquote>Ok, I admit the typo error. If u check the earlier reply it is always with cain. So wat have u got to say for tat ?<br><br><blockquote>God is not cruel to the people before Christ. God is just to the people before Christ.

Is eating pork deserving of punishment ? There r many many rules tat r silly and unnecessary in the OT. If it is just, why change the system ?</div>
