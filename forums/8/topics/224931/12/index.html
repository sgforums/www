            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Actually tithing is compulsory... Chatolics, Christian and Judahsim tithe... including Muslim but for muslim is 3% But tithing can be in may forms... For example in the past farmers tithe their crops and animals.. </blockquote>U r ignoring the base question again. According to the bible verses tat support tilthing, most of them come from the OT. Why accept some part from the OT and reject the others ? Pick and choose wat u like to believe ?<br><br><blockquote>I would, if it is really from God.... but in history there has yet to be such a case where God would really ask someone to kill his offspring... except for abraham of coz... which in the end it was just a test. </blockquote>So god really test people by asking them to kill their decendents. Well tis really shows how fanatical u believe in your religion...<br><br><blockquote>Of coz not, the council of Nicea had quite an thorough test before choosing which book to include. These books must have solid background check. If over centuries.... all the books comes together written by so many author yet so consistently tells the same story... I'm amazed at such an statistically impossible task. Btw these writers are not any tom dick any harry... they are known people and spiritual leaders </blockquote>Tat is strange. I remember over 1800 bishops were invited, and only a few hundred turn out. They have a great debate and in the end then they choose jesus to be as divine as his father. In the end everybody just guess wat they preceive as the truth. They shape the bible to wat they like to believe. And as said, the bible writers r unknown to u, and u believe them simply because they claim they get divine inspiration. Any tom dick and harry can claim they have divine inspiration. Furthermore, wat make u think tat god can only inspire successful religious leader and not pass his mesage to poor and normal people. In the bible there r many characters tat r not famous religious leaders isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>No if you read the bible in less than 5 chapter you'll see that Abel offer crops as offering to God.... in fact Esau offered animals... but rather God doesn't like Esau's offering simply because he didn't offer out of a willing heart... he gave the worse of his herd.... they actually donated animals to be sacrifice in the temple and also food for the Priest to eat and maintain the temple... but if nowadays you are still a christian farmer in sembawang for goodness sake... sell your vegetable before offering to the church pls... do everyone a favour </blockquote>U r avoiding the question again. Abel give crop to god. God reject them. True or not ? Why drag in other people like esau, willingness factor etc in ? The question is does god like crops. The answer is NO. So it answer the person who write the previous reply tat they can donate their crop to god if they want<br><br><blockquote>read my second point </blockquote>U r not reading the point where I ask why does god become cruel to the people before christ when it is not within their control for jesus to come down ? Double standard ?<br><br></div>

CONTRADICTIONS. The link u provide only answer a small difference about the numbers, but do not answer WHEN and HOW do they see the angels. Furthermore it seems a bit forced in the explanation in the sense tat the number of angels seems to be an important fact and they couldn't even get tat recorded properly.<br><br>The different books reflect different time, different people, and different events tat happened. If u felt tat the contradictions can be answered, please feel free to answer them instead of just claiming they can be answered.</div>

The only reason why they had no car was because none of them has a licence. Not even her 2 brothers.<br><br>Her mother warned against my ex gf not to associate with me because I am after the family's money. I am only a diploma holder and not degree. I was still riding a motorcycle and not driving a car. My family is not rich. I am only older than her by 1 year. Her sister's bf was 'QC passed' because "at least he has a car."<br><br>Her brothers said,"I can't believe you're going out with someone with only a diploma."<br><br>Her father was often insulted by her mother saying that he's useless because he does not have a class3 and can only ride the scooter which he owned before his 2 sons became rich.<br><br>Our relationship crashed badly. 3 years later, I received a call from her twin sister telling me that my ex gf passed away several months back.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Actually tithing is compulsory... Chatolics, Christian and Judahsim tithe... including Muslim but for muslim is 3% But tithing can be in may forms... For example in the past farmers tithe their crops and animals..<br><br>U r ignoring the base question again. According to the bible verses tat support tilthing, most of them come from the OT. Why accept some part from the OT and reject the others ? Pick and choose wat u like to believe ? </blockquote>wow seem like someone is trying to use the bible for a debate.. but stupidissmart  please do read up the whole bible before you comment. says who that most of the tithing verses comes from OT. In the NT, Jesus says that we must tithe. so it is not we chose what we like to believe.<br><br><blockquote>Of coz not, the council of Nicea had quite an thorough test before choosing which book to include. These books must have solid background check. If over centuries.... all the books comes together written by so many author yet so consistently tells the same story... I'm amazed at such an statistically impossible task. Btw these writers are not any tom dick any harry... they are known people and spiritual leaders<br><br>Tat is strange. I remember over 1800 bishops were invited, and only a few hundred turn out. They have a great debate and in the end then they choose jesus to be as divine as his father. In the end everybody just guess wat they preceive as the truth. They shape the bible to wat they like to believe. And as said, the bible writers r unknown to u, and u believe them simply because they claim they get divine inspiration. Any tom dick and harry can claim they have divine inspiration. Furthermore, wat make u think tat god can only inspire successful religious leader and not pass his mesage to poor and normal people. In the bible there r many characters tat r not famous religious leaders isn't it ?<br></blockquote>wow.. someone is trying to sound so correct.. well if u were to say 1800 bishops were invited and a few hundred turn up and to debate and chose Jesus to be as divine as Father God, wow.. please do read up the OT regarding the messiah. haha.. the way u say ma chiam they anyhow chose ppl. if you really want a debate, please do more studies and give more substantial comments.<br><br><blockquote>    quote:No if you read the bible in less than 5 chapter you'll see that Abel offer crops as offering to God.... in fact Esau offered animals... but rather God doesn't like Esau's offering simply because he didn't offer out of a willing heart... he gave the worse of his herd.... they actually donated animals to be sacrifice in the temple and also food for the Priest to eat and maintain the temple... but if nowadays you are still a christian farmer in sembawang for goodness sake... sell your vegetable before offering to the church pls... do everyone a favour<br><br>U r avoiding the question again. Abel give crop to god. God reject them. True or not ? Why drag in other people like esau, willingness factor etc in ? The question is does god like crops. The answer is NO. So it answer the person who write the previous reply tat they can donate their crop to god if they want </blockquote>hm... to correct you abit... the man is not Esau, but Cain. Cain gave offering of the fruit of the ground. and abel gave the FIRSTBORN of his flock. well you can see that cain might not give his best to God but Abel gave his best to God that is why God accepted Abel's offering and not cain..<br><br><blockquote>    quote:I would, if it is really from God.... but in history there has yet to be such a case where God would really ask someone to kill his offspring... except for abraham of coz... which in the end it was just a test.<br><br>So god really test people by asking them to kill their decendents. Well tis really shows how fanatical u believe in your religion... </blockquote>hm... well if you do read carefully, and to interpret it, u can see that in Abraham's exprience, Issac was his beloved or shall i say precious. So God want to test if Abraham will give his precious to Him. and when abraham obey, God actually stopped him. and God provided a ram for the offering. and you can see that this is the only time God actually tested someone in such way. Never did God did that the second time. And i am sure. that this test is only for Abraham. and it will not be used again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well.. sorry its not that i am running away from your question or not confirm myself. Just that i dun wish to write out a long post. i can answer you all these questions. but i am thinking will you accept it? cause if a person is trying to find faults, he will not accept what is the truth. but i just give a few quick one cause i kinda lazy to type all out..<br><br>1. Jesus says regarding tithing.<br>Luke 18:12--I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I possess.Â’<br>Jesus tithes. unless you are saying that Jesus tithes but tell the rest that there   is no need to tithe. hm... i wonder....<br><br>2.About Jesus as the messiah.<br>At first i tot wow impressive. you can quote scriptures. but after looking the website then i know u copy and paste. why not copy the last statement as well. which says that all these prohecies will be established during the second coming of Christ. which i am not going to touch on that, cause it will be alot of posts just for that reasoning.<br><br>3. About Cain's offering<br>well if it is because that cain gave crops so that God reject it and not because he gave something that is not the best. then i wonder why the bible states that abel gave the FIRSTBORN.. hm... they can might as well dont mention it? the reason why they wrote firstborn, it is to show that abel gave his very first "fruit" of his increase to God.<br><br>4.About the scarifices to God.<br>The reason why i know it will never happen. Because if you notice after the NT, there is no longer any animal/human or what ever scarifices to God? so if there is no longer such scarifices, of coz there will not be such test anymore. i think i dont need to be God to know that.<br><br>well for the last part about the contridiction of the number of woman and etc on the day they went to the tomb, i will post it later during the night... cause this need alot of flipping of the bible and i am working now. =) can only post those that dont really need to flip the bible first .. please pardon me</div>
