            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MS:</div><div class="quote_body">The scripture written by man is by will of God. <span style="color: red;">Not any Tom Dick or Harry can write the scripture. Only specially choosen people </span>who walked the hard road God gave. If anyone who reads the bible will understand what life they went through in order to gain heavenly riches which cannot be seen with Earthly eyes.<br><br>Tithes or aka offerings often gets abused.<br><br>Compare the following 2 sentences :<br><br>"You reap what you sow, you get what you give."<br><br>"Offerings are a sacred act decreed by God to Christians, for those who do not understand the meaning please refrain from giving."<br><br>One is actually sending the message that you must give to the church if you want God to bless you. It has become some sort of a transaction between 2 parties whereby blessings is proportionally equal to the amount you're giving as tithe.<br><br>The other is actually warning the people of wrong ideas towards offerings. Keeping only the right people to give and keeping away the wrong people from giving.<br><br>The above are 2 different sentences which I experienced from 2 different churches. One is obviously twisting the meaning of offerings.<br><br>The 10% which someone wrote in regards to my earlier post is a very subjective issue. Although God has decreed that 10% shall be used for his purpose, God do not need our income. He is actually not interested in our income. He is only testing our obedience to him. But he wants people who obey him cheerfully and not out of being forced. So if you do not feel like giving, yet give, God will not be happy and that defeats the purpose of the 10%. One must look at all aspects and not break the Bible's concept into pieces and re-piece them to your advantage.<br><br>At the same time, offerings can also be given in the form of donations to charity. Done quietly with zero publicity.<br><br>However there will always be some christian groups who twist the facts into their favour and argue as though they have the right facts behind them.<br><br>I'd like to highlight that we as fellow christians do not have the right to judge them. Know what is right and maintain the correct path. Do not pass judgetment on those who twist God's words. Let them answer to God themselves. For Jesus once said to pharisees who tried to make him pass judgement on a 'sinful' woman, "those who're without sin may throw the first stone."<br><br>Christ want us to lead by example and not words.</div></blockquote>yeah. but who choose these people?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by moongster:</div><div class="quote_body">I shall not touch on the existence of God since that is the axiom for your argument. To be fair, I agree with you on your intepretation of tithing.<br><br>I have a different interpretation of your second point about not doing anything knowing the fact that some people are delibrately twisting facts and exploiting people in the name of religion (all religions for that matter, not just Christianity). But of course, the difficulty lies in determining whether those people are twisting facts and exploiting, isn't it? So, the next logical step is to look at the outcome, which if there is no harm done, then most people would generally leave it as it is.<br><br>Take the example of the terrorist acts in the name of religion, this of course, prompted some people to suddenly assume that religion is evil. The true believers of the religion would then explain to the non-believers about the appropriate interpretation. Of course, this action would only occur when the outcome is known.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So, what is certain is until the issue becomes serious enough, it will always remain as it is because we have different perceptions of the facts and most of us refuse to do anything about it because it is not doing any harm (which, of course, harm is subjective).<br><br>It's the case of being pro-active vs reactive.</div></blockquote>Yes you are very true. If you view it from a more macro view, you'll relised that there's a deeper meaning to christianity.<br><br>If I go and do something drastic, I risk damaging the relationship with a friend who believe in churches who twist the core of christianity. The most that can be done is to remind my friend of the false teachings and it must be done tactfully. If no confidence that it will lead to an argument, let it be and let God do the work. Meanwhile, maintain the straight path of a christian. So that your fren who sees it will start to doubt the wrong ways himself. That is why Christ insists that leading by example is important. It is a lot more effective than arguments or force.<br><br>Terrorism, I would say is the world is not moving in the total correct direction. Rather than whacking, don't you think the best defense is respecting of all races and religions? With your actions, win them over and not suppress them to submission. The more suppression, the more retaliation. The more people suffer. Even if the terrorists are doing so by tarnishing the name of their religion, there is such a thing called retribution in Christian logic. Therefore there will always be someone playing the bad guy to whack them and announce to the world as a christian that he will lead a war against terrorism but not knowing he's also a terror himself. Nevermind, let God deal with him.<br><br>Even if a christian does evil, he has to be prepared to face the consequences. Therefore even when someone believes in God, he will still face sickness and death for the wages of sin is death. No one is exempted and NOT EVEN CHRISTIANS. But after the first death, the christian can count on Jesus to intercede on his behalf as his prince of peace and guarantee a ticket to heaven to avoid the 2nd death which is eternal when Satan will be thrown into the lakes of sulphur with his minions during judgement day.<br><br>Also, many christians failed to understand the fact that loving your neighbour, enemies also includes respecting their religions. No Christian should go outwardly and condemn other religions. <strong>But rather win them over with good conduct.</strong><br><br>Alas, I too failed as a christian. What I can only do is to cling tightly to the words of God as much as possible. If I lose my grip, God will come and grab me and make me wake up my idea. Therefore I do not have the right to judge other christians. Let them understand through good conduct of fellow christians and they will answer for their acts.</div>
