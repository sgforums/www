Maybe some people don't believe that God exists. But others do. From the way I see it, those who ask others to go to church really care about them. If they didnt really fear God and love Him -- if they didnt believe in his word -- they wouldnt feel the same urge to introduce Him to their friends, family and colleagues.</div>

Sometime it could be annoying... but just like your mum naggin at you... she cares for you right?...Would you bring someone you totally hate to a very nice place so that you'll face him/her for eternity?... so next time if your fren ask you to go to church....  smile at her/him because you know that its beacuse your fren cares to bring you to a very nice place for eternity.. if not kindly reject your fren for your fren have a heart for you....[/b]</blockquote>1st time see u post such a meaningful thread. all the best for u.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
