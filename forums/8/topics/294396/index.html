            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote> Stress FAQs<br>1.<br>What are the common warning signs of stress?<br><br>The signs are many and vary from individual to individual. Some of them are:<br><br>* Palpitations<br>* Stomach ache<br>* Increased perspiration<br>* Cold clammy hands<br>* Stuttering<br>* Shaky and strained voice<br>* High-pitch laughter<br>* Anxiety or panic<br>* Hyperactivity, with a sudden burst of energy<br>* Difficulty in falling asleep or frequent nightmares<br>* Fatigue<br><br>Other signs may include chills, thirst, nausea, fainting, twitches, vomiting, dizziness, weakness, chest pain, headaches, increased heart rate, higher blood pressure, muscle tremor and difficulty in breathing.<br><br>2.	How can we lower our stress level?<br><br>Here are some tips to Manage Stress:<br><br>1. Plan your time well. Be more organised. Make a list of all the things you need to do and arrange them in order of importance. Decide how much time you need for each job, and then stick to your plan.<br><br>2. Spread out the changes in your life - Give yourself time to adjust from one change to another. For example, avoid getting married, buying a house and changing jobs all at the same time.<br><br>3. Be realistic about what you can do - Choose your work according to your own ability and interest. Do not hope for the impossible. Set goals which are achievable so that you don't become frustrated or discouraged.<br><br>4. Make decisions wisely - Get all the relevant information first - don't make major decisions blindly. Consider the good and bad points of each choice. Involve the people who will be affected by the decision in the process.<br><br>5. Learn to like yourself - Don't worry too much about your looks, height, pimples and other faults. Make the best of what you have and learn to accept what you cannot change.<br><br>6. Think positive - Prevent negative feelings from building up. Learn to identify the cause of these feelings and deal constructively with them. Don't blow things out of proportion.<br><br>7. Share your problems - Do not keep all your problems and worries to yourself. Remember you are not alone. Talk to your spouse, friend, supervisor or religious leader. They may have had experience with similar situations and they may be able to suggest a solution to your problem.<br><br>8. Build a happy family - Be kind, loving and polite to your family. Treat them the same way you should treat your friends. They will provide you with love and support in times of need. Set aside some time each day to talk, play or relax together. Make your home a happy place to come back to after a hard day's work.<br><br>9. Make friends - Just as you need a happy family, you also need friends to talk to and laugh with, to visit you and go out with you and to help you in times of need. Treat others the way you would like them to treat you. Respect their views and be patient with their faults. Try giving in to others sometimes - even when you are right.<br><br>10. Keep healthy - Keep your body healthy by exercising regularly, eating wisely and getting enough sleep. Do not turn to cigarettes or alcohol to relieve your stress. Smoking and drinking do not solve anything and will cause more problems for your health.<br><br>11. Make some time for yourself - Do something that you really enjoy. It could be a hobby like collecting coins or an exercise like jogging. Take a short break when you feel tensed or tired. You deserve to have a little fun sometimes.<br><br>12. Learn some Relaxation Techniques - Deep breathing exercise, meditation, massage and muscle relaxation techniques can be helpful in relieving stress. </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Mental Health Education Programme<br><br>Introduction<br>Mental health is more than the absence of mental illness. It influences how we feel about ourselves, our relationships and our ability to cope with changes, transitions and life events. The World Health Organization defines mental health positively as "Â…a state of well-being in which the individual realises his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community". Having positive mental health is crucial for the wellbeing and effective functioning of an individual.<br><br>Positive mental health also serves as a protective factor against mental illness. In Singapore, the top mental illnesses are depression, anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. As these are treatable medical conditions, it is important to seek help early for these illnesses.</blockquote></div>

Now that I have moved overseas, I look back fondly on my life in Singapore and I am grateful that I was given opportunities that made me who I am.<br>However, in recent years, I have found it increasingly difficult to feel proud of my home country and my countrymen.<br>When I see posts left by Singaporeans on international forums in which they lash out at another person for asking them to refrain from using Singlish and quoting from Wikipedia to define Singlish as a 'crazy mixture of languages' but not 'improper English', or defensive blog entries by the younger generation which state that our country cannot possibly be inferior to another place because our currency unit is still stronger, it makes me feel ashamed.<br>I have kept the words of a very wise lecturer in junior college close to my heart all these years; she told me that if a person undergoes years of education up to university but comes out no better a person in terms of character and attitude, then the education was in vain.<br>The education that Singaporeans are blessed with is not to just give us book knowledge; it is also to equip us with the ability to reflect and better ourselves.<br>To my dismay, I noticed that many Singaporeans' reaction to any kind of criticism is to take it personally, fight back and then walk away with a 'I'm too civilised to continue the argument with you', without giving a thought to the criticism.<br>Our people are supposed to be well educated, well travelled, familiar with international happenings, so why are we acting so narrow-minded and provincial?<br>If we think of ourselves as 'knowing better', think of any criticism as a personal attack, where can we go if not down?<br>Let me reiterate on behalf of my Singaporean friends who are in situations similar to mine: We want to be proud of our country but it is hard to do so when our countrymen are giving the world excuses to call us 'defensive, inferior people'.<br>Those of us abroad are not gloating over having 'made it' in the global arena, we do not look down on those in Singapore, we are not trying to dissociate ourselves from our nationality.<br>We are just frustrated, and wondering what happened to the quality of our people.<br><br>Cynthia Tan (Ms)<br>Hong Kong<br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Story/STIStory_179579.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Story/STIStory_179579.html</a><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nothing wrong with taking pride in country </span><br><br>I REFER to Ms Cynthia Tan's letter, 'Singaporean traits that don't endear us to others' (ST, Nov 23).<br>The late American publisher Malcolm Forbes stated that 'education's purpose is to replace an empty mind with an open one'. This neatly encapsulates Ms Tan's line of argument that our education system, if effective, should have given rise to humble, self-criticising and not 'narrow-minded and provincial' individuals.<br>However, it is this same education system that has taught us to speak up and denounce what we see as injustice, inaccuracies in information, etc. I do not think that we have a deteriorating quality of people. Granted, we could be more polite in our postings on international forums and blogs and learn a little more Internet etiquette, but speaking up does not make for a lesser Singaporean. And if we analyse the quoted examples with an open mind, these are simply Singaporeans unabashedly proud of their country and quirks.<br>To condemn fellow Singaporeans in one fell swoop, as compared to those residing overseas, not only places one on an unnecessary moral pedestal but it also does not make for a better breed of Singaporeans.<br>That said, I do agree with Ms Tan that Singaporeans can improve in the humility department and increase their level of tolerance of criticism.<br>As the late American poet Robert Frost said, 'education is the ability to listen to almost anything without losing your temper or your self-confidence'. To this I would add 'or your patriotism'.<br>This is the way to go for Singaporeans in exchanges with foreigners where we can be self-critical and humble and yet not compromise our beliefs, and communicate that effectively and politely. The last thing we would want for all our 'ability to reflect and better ourselves' is for foreigners to think of us as pushovers.<br><br>Lau Ai Lin (Ms)<br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Story/STIStory_181890.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/Story/STIStory_181890.html</a><br><br></div>
