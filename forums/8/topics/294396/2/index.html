I was wondering how to start explaining the reason behind the so called "threats".<br><br>This was the original "threat"<br><br><blockquote>wow ok. I can take it when you misquote me to attack me. I can tolerate it when you insult me and my mom. But i will not take it lying down when you misquote me to mislead the public.<br><br>You sir, are a first class asshole. A perfect example of what is wrong with being selfish. You troll the forums hoping to promote your book, but as has been proven, know nothing about the topic you claim to write about. You claim you have prior knowledge of commodity markets, yet is unable to come up with any proof of knowledge in the basics of investments.<br><br>You want to believe in your own filth, that's fine. DO NOT misrepresent my words to mislead the public. I point out the mathematically correct way to invest, and you laugh at my efforts. That is fine. I can chalk it down to sheer ignorance. I touch on prevention from variance and bankruptcy, and you mislead the audience to believe everything i say will make them go broke? That is just pure malice. You sir, should be ashamed of yourself. You claim to be middle aged. Act your age and respect yourself sir.<br><br>If you have nothing constructive to say, please refrain from oozing stupidity and contaminating the forums. You say you want to protect people from gambling addiction. I applaud that. It is indeed a worthwhile goal. But all I've seen you do thus far is self-promotion. You have yet to touch on anything even remotely close to gambling. Even the few words coerced out of you betray your true nature. You want to be an expert on gambling, yet you prove yourself ignorant of many aspects of gambling. You claim to be a commodities future specialist, yet refuse to acknowledge the existence of odds estimation.<br><br>So please sir, return to the hole you crawled out of this morning. Go find a job. Go do something constructive. Finish writing your book or burn it. I don't care. Just find some meaningful thing to do. But for crying out loud. Just because your life sucks doesn't mean you should pull everyone down. And that is exactly what you're doing by going around spreading disinformation.<br><br>You have ceased to be amusing to me. Spread any more harm and you will regret it. This is not a threat. It is a promise.</blockquote>In essence, Andrew could not hold his own in an argument against me, and had by this point degenerated into off tangent off logic insults. Someone asked me a serious question, and Andrew tried to discredit me, while at the same time preaching a ridiculous theory.<br><br>So i warned him to back off, or i would have to take action. I would not stand for deliberate misinformation spreading for personal gain. He did not heed the warning, and so here's where we are.<br><br>No worries Andrew, I have not forgotten.</div>
