            <div class='col-md body'>Many parents in singapore are lazy bastards who expect the schools and the TV stations to raise their kids for them. The results are predictable. Friends of mine working in schools tell me that parents are always calling the schools long after classes have ended asking why their kids are not home yet, and then get upset when they're told lessons have ended already, we don't know where your kids went after that. MOE's decision to regard students and parents as "customers" is possibly the most boneheaded move by the ministry in recent memory.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
