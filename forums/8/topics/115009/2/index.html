            <div class='col-md body'>Yep.... there's no point in teaching our kids the ABCs if all that comes out of their mouth is 'knnb', 'ccb', 'wtf' and so on and so forth.... I remember taking a bus with my platoon mates on nights off and hearing a kid (no older than 8 years old) shouting the 'CB' word to his friend at the top of his voice....<br><br>We were all really stunned, man. Even in my camp (School of Military Medicine, Nee Soon Camp) we NEVER heard the 'CB' word..... I guess it's because a good proportion of the instructors were women (my PS was a woman, FYI).<br><br>Parents these days have to share a major portion of the blame. It seems that they believe that it's up to the teachers to teach their children moral ethics and standards, when in fact the sole responsibility rests on them. Teachers should only have to reinforce what the kids' parents have taught them in terms of moral and ethics.<br><br>And when the kid is in trouble (say for bullying another kid or something), more often than not, the parents will side with their kids and defend their reprehensible behaviour. They'll kick up a fuss, complain to the MOE.... they'll do anything but refuse to admit that their children are to blame. I know that any parent would be defensive when it come to charges levelled at their kids, but refusal to accept the truth is simply moral decadence.<br><br>Yup, moral standards are declining among the younger generation, whether we like to admit it or not.<br><br>As for the kid who kicked his teacher and caused a miscarriage..... I sure hope that story isn't true, but I would not be too surprised if it is.<br><br>If it's true...... I have to something to say to the kid: be VERY afraid.<br><br>I hope your immature mind will be able to digest the fact that you had killed an innocent child before he/she even had a chance to be born.</div>
