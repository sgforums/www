              <p>Non stop of importing foreigners.    Worse as it is the irresponsible govt who get them in cannot be bothered with the quality these bring have.    PRC also know our local govt anyhow bring in foreign workers and they know that with huge influx of these foreign workers there is no contribution to the country Singapore.      </p>
              <p>Yes, many of these come from different background and bring with them their own idiosyncracies which in one way or other contribution to misbehaviour.</p>

              <p>Hi. I have a very noisy and inconsiderate neighbour that stay
              below my unit. They often have late night parties till 2am or
               4am. They will drink, smoke, scream, laugh and play card game
              right below my window. I am living on the 2nd floor. We have tried
              on many occasion, called for police help but they will still
              continue to sing and drink till they are tired. They are laywers
              and the property management couldnt do much too change their
              behavior. I like to check if anyone out there knows how we can
              handle cases like this. Appreciate and looking for some support. I
              I am also surprise that professional like them can be so
              inconsiderate. All the more surprise that their guests will stay
              till wee hours to create those noise. Really no class
              individuals.</p>

              <p>Me Lim,</p>
              <p>Lawyers must also abide by rules and regulations.</p>
              <p>You shouldn't be afraid of them.</p>
              <p>If your condo has house rules, read them and see if there is anything pertaining to quiet time at night. If there is none, bring it up during the next board meeting and have them include that in.</p>
              <p>I would start with talking politely to your downstairs neighbours first.</p>
              <p>Ask that they keep the noises down after 11pm.</p>
              <p>Lawyers are educated people,  if you don't speak up, they will think you are ok with their behaviors.</p>
              <p>Most lawyers live a very stressful life, so they tend to play hard too.</p>

              <p>Actually, quite the contrary , I have lawyer friends.. they are just like any professionals. ....they too will flout rules and regulations occasionally.</p>
              <p>Ofcors being lawyers, society has a higher expectation on them.</p>
              <p>There's the well meaning lawyers and unscrupulous ones.. so we shouldn't just assume that they are all honest and self policing.</p>
              <p>Lawyers are just people who understand the laws and working of the court system more than common folks. So we consult them on issues regarding legal matters, and let them deal with our legal grieviences on our behalf.</p>
              <p>To deal with them, you just need to know what are your rights. Educate yourself first, before you seek to address issues with them.</p>
              <p>I think TS is just frustrated because he/she doesn't know what to do.</p>

              <p>Actually, quite the contrary , I have lawyer friends.. they are just like any professionals. ....they too will flout rules and regulations occasionally.</p>
              <p>Ofcors being lawyers, society has a higher expectation on them.</p>
              <p>There's the well meaning lawyers and unscrupulous ones.. so we shouldn't just assume that they are all honest and self policing.</p>
              <p>Lawyers are just people who understand the laws and working of the court system more than common folks. So we consult them on issues regarding legal matters, and let them deal with our legal grieviences on our behalf.</p>
              <p>To deal with them, you just need to know what are your rights. Educate yourself first, before you seek to address issues with them.</p>
              <p>I think TS is just frustrated because he/she doesn't know what to do.</p>
