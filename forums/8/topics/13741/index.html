Isaiah 19:19,20<br><br>The Great Pyramid of Egypt is one of the most remarkable buildings in the world. But even more important, this ancient structure is referred to in the Bible. The prophet Isaiah testifies of it in these words. "In that day, there shall be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the borderÂ…and it shall be for a sign and for a witnessÂ…" Isaiah 19:19,20.<br><br>The prophet Jeremiah 32:30, speaking of GodÂ’s mighty works, declares that he hath"Â…set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day."<br><br>The Great Pyramid is one of these signs and wonders which remains the only surviving wonder of the seven ancient wonders of the world.<br><br>An examination of this wonderful structureÂ—its size, accuracy, and internal arrangement, reveals an outline of the Plan of God, past, present, and future. The Great Pyramid proves to be an important storehouse of important truth, scientific, historic, and prophetic. Its testimony found to be in perfect accord with the Bible, expressing the prominent features of its truths in fitting symbols. The pyramid is a strong corroborative witness of GodÂ’s plan, harmonious with GodÂ’s wordÂ—the Bible.

Kirby's weekend seminar is titled "Manifesting Your Life - Purpose, Prosperity and Abundance." His self proclaimed fields of expertise include Corporate Negotiation, Accelerated Learning,<br><br>Transformational Psychology, Kinesiology, Emotional-Spiritual Revitalism, and Energy Field Research, among others. The brochure states, "Newly researched evidence now permits you to unleash enormous latent creative capabilities through your body's dynamic electrical energy field." Robert Kirby is one of the many people currently making a living utilizing information associated with the new age spiritual movement. The new age spiritual movement is a very broad ideological umbrella covering the terminology Kirby uses, and much more. The new age movement seems to signal above all, an interest in the mind-body-spirit connection. People are pursuing the idea that the knowledge is within each individual to unite the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects of themselves to create wholeness. The pyramid seems to have been adopted as a powerful symbol for these ideas. The pyramid of the 90's is a spiritual icon for health, power, abundance, and purpose. In our country riddled by mental and physical health-care crisis's, where traditional western medicine clearly lacks answers, the spiritual movement is becoming increasingly wide spread, and the pyramid carries the message. The pyramid symbol carries the traditional coding of the spiritual trinity. Each side of a pyramid is a triangle and the triangle stands for the trinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. The new age trinity is a somewhat different way of looking at the traditional religious trinity ideology. The difference is in the extension of the definition. The trinity in this case is the father (spirit), mother (matter), and son (consciousness, Christ). Interaction of father spirit, with matter (mother), creates the son. The belief is that this is true of everything that exists - - all life is formed within that trinity. So ultimately the pyramid is the symbol of creation, and the symbol of God. The new age spiritual movement of the 1990's definitely includes the notion that individuals have access to God.<br><br>Interestingly enough, the meaning of the pyramid in the 1990's is not that far removed from the meaning of the original pyramids of Giza. When first looking at the two images and deciding exactly what each represents, it seems at first as if the entire meaning of the original structure is lost in today's use; however, there is a connection of meaning on a deeper level on close examination.<br><br>The image of the pyramid at Giza, taken from Marilyn Stokstad's "Art History" is the oldest and largest of its kind, covering 13 acres at its base. The pyramid, erected in the forth dynasty around 2601-2515 BC, is made of granite and limestone and has a height of 450 feet. This funerary monument to the early Egyptian ruler Khufu, is listed as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. The elaborate tomb of Khufu served to commemorate him as a divine being (Stokstad 102). Egyptians believed that the spirit lived on after death and originally tombs were meant to ensure the well being of the spirit after death, but by the forth dynasty the meaning had grown to include a larger idea. At the time of the erecting of the Khufu pyramid, Egyptian rulers wanted to allude to their divinity. The name Khufu actually means "son of God." The Khufu pyramid is a descendant of the earlier step pyramid, and as the pyramid's structure evolved, so did the meaning. The original steps were thought to have a spiritual significance in addition to being part of the architectural construction of the building. They were to lead the spirit of the dead to the gods. Eventually the steps were eliminated, intersecting the horizontal and the vertical line, and lending geometric clarity and a sense of impenetrability. The motivation behind the shift from the step pyramid to the Khufu pyramid at Giza came from the new association of the rulers to the sun god, Ra. The new smooth, hard, shinny surfaced pyramids were built in conjunction with the new doctrine of the sun god. The pyramid was a place of accession for the king to the God, and the pyramid was an actual monument to the rays of the sun. The steps were no longer needed as the king could mount the rays of the sun to join the sun god, Ra. The way to God was guaranteed through these structures.<br><br>The pyramid's reputation as a powerful link to God remains unchanged, although both images make references to a personal relationship with God in a different way: the Khufu pyramid as a symbolic representation of a king's direct link to a God, and the advertisement pyramid icon as a suggestion of God's personal relationship to all individuals. The visual representation in each case is also very different, yet each holds some of the same meanings. The pyramid on the 1996 brochure is floating above the water, and includes the image of the sun behind it, visually suggesting some kind of divine association. A sense of the divine also must have been felt just from looking at the incredible pyramid of Khufu that originally had a gold sheath on the top lending the building an immateriality and feeling of otherworldliness. In addition to the images both making reference to the divine, both the original structure and the pyramidal form used for advertisement make a statement of personal power. The Khufu pyramid at Giza is obviously impressive in its mass, making an aggressive outward show of power for the king, and the pyramid icon suggests an inner power that any individual can access with the right tools. So Robert Kirby's use of pyramid iconography in his advertisement is a highly successful way of orienting the buyer to a particular feeling. The pyramid hooks into the desire for something to look to beyond this material world. The image of the pyramid still conveys a sense of awe and power and most importantly, the link to the divine. It is exactly what people are looking for - - the gateway to God.<br><br>TAKEN FROM <a href="http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/va11/houck/houck.html" rel="nofollow">http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/va11/houck/houck.html</a><br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>
