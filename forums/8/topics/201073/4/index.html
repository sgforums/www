I don't even hear it making battle cries at night.<br><br>i'll just keep the cat food... and hope that it will come back someday...</div></blockquote>Sorry to dampen your mood but I don't think your kitty is ever coming back cos cats are simply not loyal.<br><br>You have cat food but your neighbour (or others) give them better delicacies and the furry ball will just go for the better life.<br><br>With cats, you have to pamper them and then withstand their tantrum so if you love cats, then you have to live with their nonsense too.<br><br>Me ? I prefer dogs as they don't call them man's best friend for nothing, right ?<br><br>As for lizards, leave no food particles around and there should be no problems but there will still be unless your place is also insects free. Dry up your basins at night and close your toilet bowls too cos thats their watering hole at night when you are sleeping.<br><br>My place is quite free of lizards but I had a hard time when working in Thailand when I have to deal with huge lizards everyday. They are called tok-kay and they called out very loudly "Fcuk you" almost every night when you are sleeping.<br><br>They are ugly with rotten looking skins and the biggest ones I've seen are about 1 feet long. They can also claw and bite so be thankful for what we have in most homes here which is the common domestic lizards.<br><br>Good luck to your fight.</div>
