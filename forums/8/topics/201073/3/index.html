I dun mind roaches..n can kill them when i see them.  but now lizards just make me freeze on spot n can't move.. let you knowmy encounter with lizards..<br><br>3 yr old -  mum found me by the corridor chewing happily.  When she digged my mouth.. to her horror found a lizard head.. You can guess where the rest of the body is..  Hope she rinse my mouth with dettol.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>8 yr old -  went to kitchen to take someting, felt some rubbery stuff under my toes, like rubber band.  already walked out of kitchen but went back to take a look.  yes, stupid lizard had to cross my path n die under my toes! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Recent years.  I dunno why lizards like to scare the hell out of me, especially in my toilet, which is using the draw type door.  Once i drag the door open n walked out.. n felt someting drop in front of me, before i walked out d door..so i turned back n there.. lizard facing up on d floor struggling to turn over.<br><br>another time, not so lucky, dragged the door open, n someting fell on my arm.  wet, slimy lizard.  they just like to stay at the rim of d door n be hit when i drag d door open (maybe to peep at me in toilet....eee...) .  the next day, i found it dead in toilet with many cuts n wounds on its body.  Yucks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>a few days ago -  lizard in the toilet.. when hiding behind the door... when drag d door, will take cover behind d door, moving together.  I managed not to scream.  Came out of toilet n wanted to take my clothes out from cupboard.. another one on d door, n ran inside, into my clothes!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Arrgh....<br><br>a few days ago, went to my frd's hse, n while walking to her flat, a lizard dropped from the ceiling in the corridor, onto her clothes hanger, n it can turn n twist n struggle to prevent itself from falling down from d thin thin metal.  Damn disgusting white big lizard.<br><br>All of the above ended with me screaming n stamping my feet, but couldn't run.<br><br>so,u see i suay anot?  my future bf must b a lizard killer..</div>

I dun mind roaches..n can kill them when i see them.  but now lizards just make me freeze on spot n can't move.. let you knowmy encounter with lizards..<br><br>3 yr old -  mum found me by the corridor chewing happily.  When she digged my mouth.. to her horror found a lizard head.. You can guess where the rest of the body is..  Hope she rinse my mouth with dettol.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>8 yr old -  went to kitchen to take someting, felt some rubbery stuff under my toes, like rubber band.  already walked out of kitchen but went back to take a look.  yes, stupid lizard had to cross my path n die under my toes! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Recent years.  I dunno why lizards like to scare the hell out of me, especially in my toilet, which is using the draw type door.  Once i drag the door open n walked out.. n felt someting drop in front of me, before i walked out d door..so i turned back n there.. lizard facing up on d floor struggling to turn over.<br><br>another time, not so lucky, dragged the door open, n someting fell on my arm.  wet, slimy lizard.  they just like to stay at the rim of d door n be hit when i drag d door open (maybe to peep at me in toilet....eee...) .  the next day, i found it dead in toilet with many cuts n wounds on its body.  Yucks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>a few days ago -  lizard in the toilet.. when hiding behind the door... when drag d door, will take cover behind d door, moving together.  I managed not to scream.  Came out of toilet n wanted to take my clothes out from cupboard.. another one on d door, n ran inside, into my clothes!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Arrgh....<br><br>a few days ago, went to my frd's hse, n while walking to her flat, a lizard dropped from the ceiling in the corridor, onto her clothes hanger, n it can turn n twist n struggle to prevent itself from falling down from d thin thin metal.  Damn disgusting white big lizard.<br><br>All of the above ended with me screaming n stamping my feet, but couldn't run.<br><br>so,u see i suay anot?  my future bf must b a lizard killer.. </div></blockquote>i understand you ive got a HUGE phobia of lizards and i get paralysed with fear whenever i see one, i just freeze and cant move, cant scream, and i'll stare at it for hours...fcuking disgusting creatures, i wish i could wipe out their entire species, i heard outside the tropical parts of the world there are NO lizards in homes, wow it must be heaven there...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for those of u who say lizards are better than other insects, you DONT know the HORROR and TERROR the lizards have put me through sometimes i feel like just hiding in a small, bright corner and stay there all day where i hope they wont find me but they always do. i think they are avenging their fallen brothers, those ive tortured and killed so cruelly, maybe they sense my fear and try to freak me out i dont know, i just hate them so much...</div>
