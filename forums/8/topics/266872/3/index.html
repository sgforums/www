Guys bored you or your motive is just wanna to get to know more women so your chance of laying a girl is higher? What is this discrimination aganist guys?<br><br>Yes, it is precisely that you are rich (or you think that you are) that makes you use such methods. Women are never shallow my friend, it is you who needs to start living in a real world, which may be extremely painful for you, since you are *RICH and *HANDSOME.<br><br>Women look for men who are sincere and honest. Wealth and looks are bonus. If you are interested to get to know more girls, please state so. If you are looking for *Female Lunch Buddies, you are in the wrong forum.

At least now you seems to be more friendly and open-minded. Even if you get a guy lunch buddy, it is not so bad because, some guys know alot of women. The important thing is honesty and sincerity. Good luck with your lunch outings.</div>
