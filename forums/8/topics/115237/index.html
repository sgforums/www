            <div class='col-md body'>1. When a girl says she's sad, but she isn't crying, it means she's crying in her heart.<br><br>2. When she ignores you after you've done something wrong, it's best to give her some time to cool down before touching her heart with an apology.<br><br>3. A girl can't find anything to hate about the guy she loves (which is why it is so hard for her to 'get over him' after the relationship's over.)<br><br>4. If a girl loves a guy, he will always be on her mind every minute of the day, even though she flirts with other guys.<br><br>5. When the guy she likes smiles and stares deep into her eyes, she will melt.<br><br>6. A girl likes to hear compliments, but usually is not sure how to react to them.<br><br>7. When a particular guy flirts with a girl very often, a girl would start thinking the guy likes her. So if you treat a girl just as a friend, go easy on the smiles and stare ok?<br><br>8. If you don't like a girl who likes you, break it to her gently.<br><br>9. If a girl starts avoiding you after you reject her, leave her alone for a while. If you still treat her as a friend, talk to her.<br><br>10. Girls enjoy talking about what they feel. Music, poetry, drawings and writing are ways of expressing themselves (which explains why most girls like writing journals).<br><br>11. Never tell a girl that she is useless in any way.<br><br>12. Being too serious can turn a girl off.<br><br>13. When the guy she likes calls her for the first time, the girl may act uninterested during the call.  But as soon as the phone is back on the hook, she will whoop with joy and immediately start telephoning her friends to spread the news.<br><br>14. A smile means a lot to a girl.<br><br>15. If you like a girl, try making friends with her first. Let her get to know you.<br><br>16. If a girl says she can't go out with you because she has to study, leave.<br><br>17. But if she still calls you or expect a call from you, stay.<br><br>18. Don't try to guess a girl's feelings. Ask her.<br><br>19. Hearing the words "I love you" is a great reassurance to a girl that she is beautiful.<br><br>20. After a girl falls in love with a guy, she'll wonder why she never noticed him before.<br><br>21. If you need tips on how to flirt with a girl, read romance stories.<br>22. When class pictures come out, a girl would first check who is standing next to her crush before actually looking at herself.<br><br>23. A girl's ex-crush will always be in her memory, but the guy she loves now stays in her heart.<br><br>24. Girls love having fun!<br><br>25. A simple 'Hi' can brighten a girl's day.<br><br>26. A girl's best friends usually know best what she is feeling and going through.<br><br>27. Girls hate it when a guy pays attention to them just to get close to their 'prettier' friend.<br><br>28. Love means devotion, caring and happiness to a girl, in that order.<br><br>29. Some girls care about looks, some care about brains, but ALL girls want a guy who will love and care for them.<br><br>30. Girls want nothing more than to feel loved.<br><br><img src="http://skins.hotbar.com/Skins/mailskins/st/050104/050104_bgM17.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Young King Arthur was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of a neighboring kingdom.  The monarch could have killed him but was moved by Arthur's youth and ideals. So, the monarch offered him his freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult question.  Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer and, if after a year, he still had no answer, he would be put to death.<br><br>The question ?... What do women really want ?  Such a question would perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and to young Arthur, it seemed an impossible query.  But, since it was better than death, he accepted the monarch's proposition to have answer by year's end.<br><br>He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everyone: the princess, the priests, the wise men and even the court jester.  he spoke with everyone, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer.<br><br>Many people advised him to consult the old witch, for only she would have the answer.<br><br>But the price would be high, as the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged.<br><br>The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no choice but to talk to the witch.  She agreed to answer the question, but he would have to agree to her price first.<br><br>The old witch wanted to marry Sir Lancelot, the most noble of the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend !<br><br>Young Arthur was horrified.  She was hunchbacked and hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage, made obscene noises, etc.  he had never encountered such a repugnant creature in all his life.<br><br>He refused to force his friend to marry her and endure such a  terrible burden, but Lancelot, learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur.<br><br>He said nothing was too big of a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the preservation of the Round Table.<br><br>Hence, a wedding was proclaimed and the witch answered Arthur's question<br><br>thus:<br><br>What a woman really wants, she answered ... is to be in charge of her own life.<br><br>Everyone in the kingdom instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that Arthur's life would be spared.<br><br>And so it was, the neighboring monarch granted Arthur his freedom and Lancelot and the witch had a wonderful wedding.<br><br>The honeymoon hour approached and Lancelot, steeling himself for a horrific experience, entered the bedroom.  But, what a sight awaited him.  The most beautiful woman he had ever seen lay before him on the bed.  The astounded Lancelot asked what had happened.<br><br>The beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her when she appeared as a witch, she would henceforth be her horrible deformed self only half the time and the beautiful maiden the other half.<br><br>What would he prefer ?  Beautiful during the day ... or night ?<br><br>Lancelot pondered the predicament.  During the day, a beautiful woman to show off to his friends, but at night, in the privacy of his castle, an old witch ?

OKAY ?<br><br>Noble Lancelot, knowing the answer the witch gave Arthur to his question, said that he would allow HER to make the choice herself.<br><br>Upon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time because he had respected her enough to let her be in charge of her own life.<br><br>Now... what is the moral to this story?<br><br>The moral is ....<br><br>If you don't let a woman have her own way....<br><br>Things are going to get ugly.<br></div>
