I am not minister any more,' he told reporters.<br><br>'I have no more responsibilities,' he said, adding he was trying to arrange a flight back to Thailand after attending International Monetary Fund meetings in Singapore.<br><br>He said he had not been in contact with Mr Thaksin and he did not know his whereabouts.

There is also the issue of nationalism - i.e. selling a strategic interest to a foreign country, which some find it unthinkable.  Even in Singapore, we have laws to protect  &amp; ensure that no one single individual (be it local or foreign) own more than certain % of companies deemed strategically important (eg: Singtel, DBS, SPH, not sure if SIA also included).   For Shin Corp, which controls the telecommunication and being sold to Singapore govt may not go down well with the Thais.<br><br>Interestingly, the Thai King has chose to remain silent, perhaps to come out at an opt time to call off the coup &amp; pardon Thaksin so that he can balek kampong haha.<br><br>anyone know the whereabouts of his daughter ?
