Now wonder if signature can be solved.<br><br>------------------<br><strong>Genesis 1</strong><br><br>1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. 5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. 6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. 7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. 8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. 9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. 10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the wate rs called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. 11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. 12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 13 And the evening and the morning were the third day. 14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: 15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. 17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. 19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. 20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. 21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. 24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. 25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. 29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. 30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. 31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.<br><br><strong>Genesis 2</strong><br><br>1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. 2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. 4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, 5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground. 6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. 7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. 8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. 9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. 10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. 11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone. 13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. 14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates. 15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. 16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. 18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. 19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. 20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. 21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; 22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. 23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. 24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. 25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.<br><br><strong>Genesis 3</strong><br><br>1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? 2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: 3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. 6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. 7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. 8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. 9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? 10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. 11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? 12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. 13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. 14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: 15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. 16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. 17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; 19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. 20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. 21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them. 22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. 24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.<br><br><strong>Genesis 4</strong><br><br>1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD. 2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. 4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: 5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. 6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? 7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. 8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. 9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper? 10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. 11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; 12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. 13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear. 14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me. 15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him. 16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. 17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. 18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech. 19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. 20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle. 21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ. 22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah. 23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. 24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold. 25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. 26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.<br><br><strong>Genesis 5</strong><br><br>1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; 2 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created. 3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth: 4 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters: 5 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died. 6 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 7 And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters: 8 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died. 9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 10 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters: 11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died. 12 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel: 13 And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters: 14 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died. 15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: 16 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters: 17 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died. 18 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch: 19 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 20 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died. 21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 22 And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 23 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years: 24 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him. 25 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech. 26 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters: 27 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died. 28 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son: 29 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed. 30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters: 31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died. 32 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.<br><br><strong>Genesis 6</strong><br><br>1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, 2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. 3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. 4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. 5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. 7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. 8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD. 9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God. 10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. 13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. 14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. 15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. 16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. 17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die. 18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. 19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. 20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. 21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. 22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.<br><br><strong>Genesis 7</strong><br><br>1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. 2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female. 3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. 4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. 5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him. 6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. 7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. 8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 9 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah. 10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. 11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. 12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; 14 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. 15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life. 16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in. 17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. 18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. 19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered. 20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. 21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: 22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died. 23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark. 24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.<br><br><strong>Genesis 8</strong><br><br>1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged; 2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; 3 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. 4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. 6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: 7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. 8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; 9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. 10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; 11 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more. 13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry. 14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried. 15 And God spake unto Noah, saying, 16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. 17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. 18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: 19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark. 20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. 22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.<br><br><strong>Genesis 9</strong><br><br>1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. 2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. 3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. 4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. 5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man. 6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man. 7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein. 8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; 10 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. 11 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. 12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. 14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 15 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. 17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth. 18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. 19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread. 20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: 21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. 22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. 23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. 24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. 25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. 26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. 27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. 28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. 29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.<br><br><strong>Quotes from FOS (no, it's not full of shit)<br>I love gloating.

            <div class='col-md body'>.<br><br>------------------<br>1 Corinthians 14<br>1 Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy.<br>2 For anyone who speaks in a tongue [1] does not speak to men but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries with his spirit. [2]<br>3 But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort.<br>4 He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.<br>5 I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, [3] but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, [4] unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified.<br>6 Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?<br>7 Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes?<br>8 Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?<br>9 So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.<br>10 Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.<br>11 If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me.<br>12 So it is with you. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church.<br>13 For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says.<br>14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.<br>15 So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind.<br>16 If you are praising God with your spirit, how can one who finds himself among those who do not understand [5] say "Amen" to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?<br>17 You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified.<br>18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.<br>19 But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.<br>20 Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults.<br>21 In the Law it is written: "Through men of strange tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me," [6] says the Lord.<br>22 Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers.<br>23 So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who do not understand [7] or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind?<br>24 But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand [8] comes in while everybody is prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all,<br>25 and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, "God is really among you!"<br>26 What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church.<br>27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, two--or at the most three--should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret.<br>28 If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God.<br>29 Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.<br>30 And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop.<br>31 For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.<br>32 The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets.<br>33 For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the congregations of the saints,<br>34 women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says.<br>35 If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.<br>36 Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?<br>37 If anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command.<br>38 If he ignores this, he himself will be ignored. [9]<br>39 Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.<br>40 But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.<br><br>1 Corinthians 4<br>1<br>So then, men ought to regard us as servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the secret things of God.<br>2<br>Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful.<br>3<br>I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself.<br>4<br>My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.<br>5<br>Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait till the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men's hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God.<br>6<br>Now, brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, "Do not go beyond what is written." Then you will not take pride in one man over against another.<br>7<br>For who makes you different from anyone else? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?<br>8<br>Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! You have become kings--and that without us! How I wish that you really had become kings so that we might be kings with you!<br>9<br>For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like men condemned to die in the arena. We have been made a spectacle to the whole universe, to angels as well as to men.<br>10<br>We are fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, we are dishonored!<br>11<br>To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we are in rags, we are brutally treated, we are homeless.<br>12<br>We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;<br>13<br>when we are slandered, we answer kindly. Up to this moment we have become the scum of the earth, the refuse of the world.<br>14<br>I am not writing this to shame you, but to warn you, as my dear children.<br>15<br>Even though you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.<br>16<br>Therefore I urge you to imitate me.<br>17<br>For this reason I am sending to you Timothy, my son whom I love, who is faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church.<br>18<br>Some of you have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you.<br>19<br>But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking, but what power they have.<br>20<br>For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.<br>21<br>What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a whip, or in love and with a gentle spirit?<br><br>1<br>After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi [1] from the east came to Jerusalem<br>2<br>and asked, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east [2] and have come to worship him."<br>3<br>When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.<br>4<br>When he had called together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Christ [3] was to be born.<br>5<br>"In Bethlehem in Judea," they replied, "for this is what the prophet has written:<br>6<br>"`But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.' [4] "<br>7<br>Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.<br>8<br>He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him."<br>9<br>After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east [5] went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.<br>10<br>When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.<br>11<br>On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh.<br>12<br>And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.<br>13<br>When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up," he said, "take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."<br>14<br>So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt,<br>15<br>where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son." [6]<br>16<br>When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.<br>17<br>Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:<br>18<br>"A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more." [7]<br>19<br>After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt<br>20<br>and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child's life are dead."<br>21<br>So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.<br>22<br>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,<br>23<br>and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets: "He will be called a Nazarene."<br><br>2 Corinthians 9<br>1<br>There is no need for me to write to you about this service to the saints.<br>2<br>For I know your eagerness to help, and I have been boasting about it to the Macedonians, telling them that since last year you in Achaia were ready to give; and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action.<br>3<br>But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow, but that you may be ready, as I said you would be.<br>4<br>For if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we--not to say anything about you--would be ashamed of having been so confident.<br>5<br>So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised. Then it will be ready as a generous gift, not as one grudgingly given.<br>6<br>Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.<br>7<br>Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.<br>8<br>And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.<br>9<br>As it is written: "He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor; his righteousness endures forever." [1]<br>10<br>Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.<br>11<br>You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.<br>12<br>This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of God's people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God.<br>13<br>Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, men will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else.<br>14<br>And in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you, because of the surpassing grace God has given you.<br>15<br>Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!<br><br>2 Corinthians 1<br>1<br>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God in Corinth, together with all the saints throughout Achaia:<br>2<br>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>3<br>Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,<br>4<br>who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.<br>5<br>For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.<br>6<br>If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.<br>7<br>And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.<br>8<br>We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about the hardships we suffered in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life.<br>9<br>Indeed, in our hearts we felt the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.<br>10<br>He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us,<br>11<br>as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our [1] behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.<br>12<br>Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God. We have done so not according to worldly wisdom but according to God's grace.<br>13<br>For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that,<br>14<br>as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus.<br>15<br>Because I was confident of this, I planned to visit you first so that you might benefit twice.<br>16<br>I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.<br>17<br>When I planned this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say, "Yes, yes" and "No, no"?<br>18<br>But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not "Yes" and "No."<br>19<br>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by me and Silas [2] and Timothy, was not "Yes" and "No," but in him it has always been "Yes."<br>20<br>For no matter how many promises God has made, they are "Yes" in Christ. And so through him the "Amen" is spoken by us to the glory of God.<br>21<br>Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us,<br>22<br>set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.<br>23<br>I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.<br>24<br>Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand firm.<br>2 Corinthians 2 :: New International Version (NIV)<br><br>1<br>So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.<br>2<br>For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved?<br>3<br>I wrote as I did so that when I came I should not be distressed by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy.<br>4<br>For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.<br>5<br>If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent--not to put it too severely.<br>6<br>The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him.<br>7<br>Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.<br>8<br>I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him.<br>9<br>The reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.<br>10<br>If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven--if there was anything to forgive--I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake,<br>11<br>in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.<br>12<br>Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me,<br>13<br>I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said good-by to them and went on to Macedonia.<br>14<br>But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him.<br>15<br>For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.<br>16<br>To the one we are the smell of death; to the other, the fragrance of life. And who is equal to such a task?<br>17<br>Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, like men sent from God.<br><br>2 Corinthians 3<br>1<br>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you?<br>2<br>You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everybody.<br>3<br>You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.<br>4<br>Such confidence as this is ours through Christ before God.<br>5<br>Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God.<br>6<br>He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant--not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.<br>7<br>Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was,<br>8<br>will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?<br>9<br>If the ministry that condemns men is glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!<br>10<br>For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory.<br>11<br>And if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!<br>12<br>Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold.<br>13<br>We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at it while the radiance was fading away.<br>14<br>But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away.<br>15<br>Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.<br>16<br>But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.<br>17<br>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.<br>18<br>And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect [1] the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.<br><br>2 Corinthians 4<br>1<br>Therefore, since through God's mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart.<br>2<br>Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.<br>3<br>And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.<br>4<br>The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.<br>5<br>For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.<br>6<br>For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," [1] made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.<br>7<br>But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.<br>8<br>We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;<br>9<br>persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.<br>10<br>We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.<br>11<br>For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body.<br>12<br>So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.<br>13<br>It is written: "I believed; therefore I have spoken." [2] With that same spirit of faith we also believe and therefore speak,<br>14<br>because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you in his presence.<br>15<br>All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.<br>16<br>Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.<br>17<br>For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.<br>18<br>So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.<br><br>2 Corinthians 5<br>1<br>Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands.<br>2<br>Meanwhile we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling,<br>3<br>because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked.<br>4<br>For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.<br>5<br>Now it is God who has made us for this very purpose and has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.<br>6<br>Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord.<br>7<br>We live by faith, not by sight.<br>8<br>We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.<br>9<br>So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it.<br>10<br>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.<br>11<br>Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade men. What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your conscience.<br>12<br>We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us, so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart.<br>13<br>If we are out of our mind, it is for the sake of God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.<br>14<br>For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.<br>15<br>And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.<br>16<br>So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.<br>17<br>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!<br>18<br>All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:<br>19<br>that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.<br>20<br>We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God.<br>21<br>God made him who had no sin to be sin [1] for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.<br><br>2 Corinthians 6<br>1<br>As God's fellow workers we urge you not to receive God's grace in vain.<br>2<br>For he says, "In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you." [1] I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation.<br>3<br>We put no stumbling block in anyone's path, so that our ministry will not be discredited.<br>4<br>Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses;<br>5<br>in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights and hunger;<br>6<br>in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love;<br>7<br>in truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;<br>8<br>through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine, yet regarded as impostors;<br>9<br>known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not killed;<br>10<br>sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.<br>11<br>We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you.<br>12<br>We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us.<br>13<br>As a fair exchange--I speak as to my children--open wide your hearts also.<br>14<br>Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?<br>15<br>What harmony is there between Christ and Belial [2] ? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?<br>16<br>What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: "I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people." [3]<br>17<br>"Therefore come out from them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you." [4]<br>18<br>"I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty."<br><br>2 Corinthians 7<br>1<br>Since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.<br>2<br>Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have exploited no one.<br>3<br>I do not say this to condemn you; I have said before that you have such a place in our hearts that we would live or die with you.<br>4<br>I have great confidence in you; I take great pride in you. I am greatly encouraged; in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds.<br>5<br>For when we came into Macedonia, this body of ours had no rest, but we were harassed at every turn--conflicts on the outside, fears within.<br>6<br>But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,<br>7<br>and not only by his coming but also by the comfort you had given him. He told us about your longing for me, your deep sorrow, your ardent concern for me, so that my joy was greater than ever.<br>8<br>Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret it--I see that my letter hurt you, but only for a little while--<br>9<br>yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us.<br>10<br>Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.<br>11<br>See what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what concern, what readiness to see justice done. At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.<br>12<br>So even though I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did the wrong or of the injured party, but rather that before God you could see for yourselves how devoted to us you are.<br>13<br>By all this we are encouraged. In addition to our own encouragement, we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.<br>14<br>I had boasted to him about you, and you have not embarrassed me. But just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting about you to Titus has proved to be true as well.<br>15<br>And his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that you were all obedient, receiving him with fear and trembling.<br>16<br>I am glad I can have complete confidence in you.<br><br>2 Corinthians 8<br>1<br>And now, brothers, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonian churches.<br>2<br>Out of the most severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity.<br>3<br>For I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own,<br>4<br>they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints.<br>5<br>And they did not do as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God's will.<br>6<br>So we urged Titus, since he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part.<br>7<br>But just as you excel in everything--in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us [1] --see that you also excel in this grace of giving.<br>8<br>I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others.<br>9<br>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.<br>10<br>And here is my advice about what is best for you in this matter: Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so.<br>11<br>Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means.<br>12<br>For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have.<br>13<br>Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality.<br>14<br>At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. Then there will be equality,<br>15<br>as it is written: "He who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little." [2]<br>16<br>I thank God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you.<br>17<br>For Titus not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative.<br>18<br>And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel.<br>19<br>What is more, he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering, which we administer in order to honor the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help.<br>20<br>We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift.<br>21<br>For we are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of men.<br>22<br>In addition, we are sending with them our brother who has often proved to us in many ways that he is zealous, and now even more so because of his great confidence in you.<br>23<br>As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; as for our brothers, they are representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ.<br>24<br>Therefore show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you, so that the churches can see it.<br><br>2 Corinthians 10<br>1<br>By the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you--I, Paul, who am "timid" when face to face with you, but "bold" when away!<br>2<br>I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some people who think that we live by the standards of this world.<br>3<br>For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.<br>4<br>The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds.<br>5<br>We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.<br>6<br>And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience, once your obedience is complete.<br>7<br>You are looking only on the surface of things. [1] If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should consider again that we belong to Christ just as much as he.<br>8<br>For even if I boast somewhat freely about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than pulling you down, I will not be ashamed of it.<br>9<br>I do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters.<br>10<br>For some say, "His letters are weighty and forceful, but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing."<br>11<br>Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present.<br>12<br>We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise.<br>13<br>We, however, will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the field God has assigned to us, a field that reaches even to you.<br>14<br>We are not going too far in our boasting, as would be the case if we had not come to you, for we did get as far as you with the gospel of Christ.<br>15<br>Neither do we go beyond our limits by boasting of work done by others. [2] Our hope is that, as your faith continues to grow, our area of activity among you will greatly expand,<br>16<br>so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. For we do not want to boast about work already done in another man's territory.<br>17<br>But, "Let him who boasts boast in the Lord." [3]<br>18<br>For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.<br><br>2 Corinthians 11<br>1<br>I hope you will put up with a little of my foolishness; but you are already doing that.<br>2<br>I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him.<br>3<br>But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.<br>4<br>For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.<br>5<br>But I do not think I am in the least inferior to those "super-apostles."<br>6<br>I may not be a trained speaker, but I do have knowledge. We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way.<br>7<br>Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge?<br>8<br>I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you.<br>9<br>And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so.<br>10<br>As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine.<br>11<br>Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!<br>12<br>And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about.<br>13<br>For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ.<br>14<br>And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.<br>15<br>It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.<br>16<br>I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do, then receive me just as you would a fool, so that I may do a little boasting.<br>17<br>In this self-confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would, but as a fool.<br>18<br>Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast.<br>19<br>You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise!<br>20<br>In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or pushes himself forward or slaps you in the face.<br>21<br>To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that! What anyone else dares to boast about--I am speaking as a fool--I also dare to boast about.<br>22<br>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I.<br>23<br>Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again.<br>24<br>Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.<br>25<br>Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea,<br>26<br>I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false brothers.<br>27<br>I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked.<br>28<br>Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches.<br>29<br>Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?<br>30<br>If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.<br>31<br>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying.<br>32<br>In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me.<br>33<br>But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands.<br><br>2 Corinthians 12<br>1<br>I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.<br>2<br>I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know--God knows.<br>3<br>And I know that this man--whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows--<br>4<br>was caught up to paradise. He heard inexpressible things, things that man is not permitted to tell.<br>5<br>I will boast about a man like that, but I will not boast about myself, except about my weaknesses.<br>6<br>Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say.<br>7<br>To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations, there was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.<br>8<br>Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.<br>9<br>But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me.<br>10<br>That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.<br>11<br>I have made a fool of myself, but you drove me to it. I ought to have been commended by you, for I am not in the least inferior to the "super-apostles," even though I am nothing.<br>12<br>The things that mark an apostle--signs, wonders and miracles--were done among you with great perseverance.<br>13<br>How were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was never a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!<br>14<br>Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.<br>15<br>So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well. If I love you more, will you love me less?<br>16<br>Be that as it may, I have not been a burden to you. Yet, crafty fellow that I am, I caught you by trickery!<br>17<br>Did I exploit you through any of the men I sent you?<br>18<br>I urged Titus to go to you and I sent our brother with him. Titus did not exploit you, did he? Did we not act in the same spirit and follow the same course?<br>19<br>Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ; and everything we do, dear friends, is for your strengthening.<br>20<br>For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I want you to be, and you may not find me as you want me to be. I fear that there may be quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder.<br>21<br>I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged.<br><br>2 Corinthians 13<br>1<br>This will be my third visit to you. "Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses." [1]<br>2<br>I already gave you a warning when I was with you the second time. I now repeat it while absent: On my return I will not spare those who sinned earlier or any of the others,<br>3<br>since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you.<br>4<br>For to be sure, he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God's power. Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by God's power we will live with him to serve you.<br>5<br>Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you--unless, of course, you fail the test?<br>6<br>And I trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test.<br>7<br>Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong. Not that people will see that we have stood the test but that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed.<br>8<br>For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.<br>9<br>We are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong; and our prayer is for your perfection.<br>10<br>This is why I write these things when I am absent, that when I come I may not have to be harsh in my use of authority--the authority the Lord gave me for building you up, not for tearing you down.<br>11<br>Finally, brothers, good-by. Aim for perfection, listen to my appeal, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.<br>12<br>Greet one another with a holy kiss.<br>13<br>All the saints send their greetings.<br>14<br>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.<br><br>1 Corinthians 1<br>1<br>Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,<br>2<br>To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ--their Lord and ours:<br>3<br>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>4<br>I always thank God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus.<br>5<br>For in him you have been enriched in every way--in all your speaking and in all your knowledge--<br>6<br>because our testimony about Christ was confirmed in you.<br>7<br>Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.<br>8<br>He will keep you strong to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>9<br>God, who has called you into fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful.<br>10<br>I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another so that there may be no divisions among you and that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought.<br>11<br>My brothers, some from Chloe's household have informed me that there are quarrels among you.<br>12<br>What I mean is this: One of you says, "I follow Paul"; another, "I follow Apollos"; another, "I follow Cephas [1] "; still another, "I follow Christ."<br>13<br>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized into [2] the name of Paul?<br>14<br>I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,<br>15<br>so no one can say that you were baptized into my name.<br>16<br>(Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don't remember if I baptized anyone else.)<br>17<br>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel--not with words of human wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.<br>18<br>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.<br>19<br>For it is written: "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate." [3]<br>20<br>Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?<br>21<br>For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.<br>22<br>Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom,<br>23<br>but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,<br>24<br>but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.<br>25<br>For the foolishness of God is wiser than man's wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man's strength.<br>26<br>Brothers, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth.<br>27<br>But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.<br>28<br>He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things--and the things that are not--to nullify the things that are,<br>29<br>so that no one may boast before him.<br>30<br>It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God--that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.<br>31<br>Therefore, as it is written: "Let him who boasts boast in the Lord."<br><br>1<br>When I came to you, brothers, I did not come with eloquence or superior wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God. [1]<br>2<br>For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.<br>3<br>I came to you in weakness and fear, and with much trembling.<br>4<br>My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power,<br>5<br>so that your faith might not rest on men's wisdom, but on God's power.<br>6<br>We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.<br>7<br>No, we speak of God's secret wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began.<br>8<br>None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.<br>9<br>However, as it is written: "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him" [2] --<br>10<br>but God has revealed it to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.<br>11<br>For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.<br>12<br>We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us.<br>13<br>This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words. [3]<br>14<br>The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.<br>15<br>The spiritual man makes judgments about all things, but he himself is not subject to any man's judgment:<br>16<br>"For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him?" [4] But we have the mind of Christ.<br><br>1 Corinthians 3<br>1<br>Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual but as worldly--mere infants in Christ.<br>2<br>I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready.<br>3<br>You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere men?<br>4<br>For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," are you not mere men?<br>5<br>What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe--as the Lord has assigned to each his task.<br>6<br>I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.<br>7<br>So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.<br>8<br>The man who plants and the man who waters have one purpose, and each will be rewarded according to his own labor.<br>9<br>For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building.<br>10<br>By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should be careful how he builds.<br>11<br>For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.<br>12<br>If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw,<br>13<br>his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work.<br>14<br>If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward.<br>15<br>If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames.<br>16<br>Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit lives in you?<br>17<br>If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him; for God's temple is sacred, and you are that temple.<br>18<br>Do not deceive yourselves. If any one of you thinks he is wise by the standards of this age, he should become a "fool" so that he may become wise.<br>19<br>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. As it is written: "He catches the wise in their craftiness" [1] ;<br>20<br>and again, "The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile." [2]<br>21<br>So then, no more boasting about men! All things are yours,<br>22<br>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas [3] or the world or life or death or the present or the future--all are yours,<br>23<br>and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.<br><br>1 Corinthians 4<br>1<br>So then, men ought to regard us as servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the secret things of God.<br>2<br>Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful.<br>3<br>I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself.<br>4<br>My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.<br>5<br>Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait till the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men's hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God.<br>6<br>Now, brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, "Do not go beyond what is written." Then you will not take pride in one man over against another.<br>7<br>For who makes you different from anyone else? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?<br>8<br>Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! You have become kings--and that without us! How I wish that you really had become kings so that we might be kings with you!<br>9<br>For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like men condemned to die in the arena. We have been made a spectacle to the whole universe, to angels as well as to men.<br>10<br>We are fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, we are dishonored!<br>11<br>To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we are in rags, we are brutally treated, we are homeless.<br>12<br>We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;<br>13<br>when we are slandered, we answer kindly. Up to this moment we have become the scum of the earth, the refuse of the world.<br>14<br>I am not writing this to shame you, but to warn you, as my dear children.<br>15<br>Even though you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.<br>16<br>Therefore I urge you to imitate me.<br>17<br>For this reason I am sending to you Timothy, my son whom I love, who is faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church.<br>18<br>Some of you have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you.<br>19<br>But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking, but what power they have.<br>20<br>For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.<br>21<br>What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a whip, or in love and with a gentle spirit?<br><br>1 Corinthians 5<br>1<br>It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that does not occur even among pagans: A man has his father's wife.<br>2<br>And you are proud! Shouldn't you rather have been filled with grief and have put out of your fellowship the man who did this?<br>3<br>Even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this, just as if I were present.<br>4<br>When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present,<br>5<br>hand this man over to Satan, so that the sinful nature [1] may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the Lord.<br>6<br>Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough?<br>7<br>Get rid of the old yeast that you may be a new batch without yeast--as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.<br>8<br>Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with bread without yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth.<br>9<br>I have written you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people--<br>10<br>not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.<br>11<br>But now I am writing you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat.<br>12<br>What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?<br>13<br>God will judge those outside. "Expel the wicked man from among you."<br><br>1 Corinthians 6<br>1<br>If any of you has a dispute with another, dare he take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the saints?<br>2<br>Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases?<br>3<br>Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life!<br>4<br>Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, appoint as judges even men of little account in the church! [1]<br>5<br>I say this to shame you. Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers?<br>6<br>But instead, one brother goes to law against another--and this in front of unbelievers!<br>7<br>The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?<br>8<br>Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers.<br>9<br>Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders<br>10<br>nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.<br>11<br>And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.<br>12<br>"Everything is permissible for me"--but not everything is beneficial. "Everything is permissible for me"--but I will not be mastered by anything.<br>13<br>"Food for the stomach and the stomach for food"--but God will destroy them both. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.<br>14<br>By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us also.<br>15<br>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never!<br>16<br>Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will become one flesh." [2]<br>17<br>But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with him in spirit.<br>18<br>Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body.<br>19<br>Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;<br>20<br>you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body.<br><br>1 Corinthians 7<br>1<br>Now for the matters you wrote about: It is good for a man not to marry. [1]<br>2<br>But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.<br>3<br>The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.<br>4<br>The wife's body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife.<br>5<br>Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.<br>6<br>I say this as a concession, not as a command.<br>7<br>I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that.<br>8<br>Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am.<br>9<br>But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.<br>10<br>To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband.<br>11<br>But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.<br>12<br>To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her.<br>13<br>And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him.<br>14<br>For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.<br>15<br>But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace.<br>16<br>How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?<br>17<br>Nevertheless, each one should retain the place in life that the Lord assigned to him and to which God has called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches.<br>18<br>Was a man already circu</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lalalalalala<br><br>----------<br>Revelation 1<br>1<br>The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,<br>2<br>who testifies to everything he saw--that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.<br>3<br>Blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near.<br>4<br>John, To the seven churches in the province of Asia: Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits [1] before his throne,<br>5<br>and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood,<br>6<br>and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father--to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen.<br>7<br>Look, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and all the peoples of the earth will mourn because of him. So shall it be! Amen.<br>8<br>"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty."<br>9<br>I, John, your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.<br>10<br>On the Lord's Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,<br>11<br>which said: "Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea."<br>12<br>I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands,<br>13<br>and among the lampstands was someone "like a son of man," [2] dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest.<br>14<br>His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire.<br>15<br>His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters.<br>16<br>In his right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth came a sharp double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.<br>17<br>When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: "Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.<br>18<br>I am the Living One; I was dead, and behold I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.<br>19<br>"Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now and what will take place later.<br>20<br>The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels [3] of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.<br><br>Revelation 2 :: New International Version (NIV)<br><br>1<br>"To the angel [1] of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands:<br>2<br>I know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked men, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false.<br>3<br>You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary.<br>4<br>Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken your first love.<br>5<br>Remember the height from which you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.<br>6<br>But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.<br>7<br>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.<br>8<br>"To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again.<br>9<br>I know your afflictions and your poverty--yet you are rich! I know the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.<br>10<br>Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of life.<br>11<br>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt at all by the second death.<br>12<br>"To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These are the words of him who has the sharp, double-edged sword.<br>13<br>I know where you live--where Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true to my name. You did not renounce your faith in me, even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death in your city--where Satan lives.<br>14<br>Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: You have people there who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin by eating food sacrificed to idols and by committing sexual immorality.<br>15<br>Likewise you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.<br>16<br>Repent therefore! Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.<br>17<br>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to him who receives it.<br>18<br>"To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze.<br>19<br>I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that you are now doing more than you did at first.<br>20<br>Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols.<br>21<br>I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling.<br>22<br>So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways.<br>23<br>I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.<br>24<br>Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan's so-called deep secrets (I will not impose any other burden on you):<br>25<br>Only hold on to what you have until I come.<br>26<br>To him who overcomes and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations--<br>27<br>`He will rule them with an iron scepter; he will dash them to pieces like pottery' [2] -- just as I have received authority from my Father.<br>28<br>I will also give him the morning star.<br>29<br>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.<br><br>Revelation 3<br>1<br>"To the angel [1] of the church in Sardis write: These are the words of him who holds the seven spirits [2] of God and the seven stars. I know your deeds; you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.<br>2<br>Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your deeds complete in the sight of my God.<br>3<br>Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard; obey it, and repent. But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what time I will come to you.<br>4<br>Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy.<br>5<br>He who overcomes will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out his name from the book of life, but will acknowledge his name before my Father and his angels.<br>6<br>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.<br>7<br>"To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open.<br>8<br>I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.<br>9<br>I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars--I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you.<br>10<br>Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come upon the whole world to test those who live on the earth.<br>11<br>I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take your crown.<br>12<br>Him who overcomes I will make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will he leave it. I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on him my new name.<br>13<br>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.<br>14<br>"To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God's creation.<br>15<br>I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other!<br>16<br>So, because you are lukewarm--neither hot nor cold--I am about to spit you out of my mouth.<br>17<br>You say, `I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.' But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.<br>18<br>I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see.<br>19<br>Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest, and repent.<br>20<br>Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with me.<br>21<br>To him who overcomes, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I overcame and sat down with my Father on his throne.<br>22<br>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."<br><br>Revelation 4<br>1<br>After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this."<br>2<br>At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it.<br>3<br>And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian. A rainbow, resembling an emerald, encircled the throne.<br>4<br>Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads.<br>5<br>From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. Before the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven spirits [1] of God.<br>6<br>Also before the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and in back.<br>7<br>The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle.<br>8<br>Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under his wings. Day and night they never stop saying: "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come."<br>9<br>Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever,<br>10<br>the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say:<br>11<br>"You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being."<br><br>Revelation 5<br>1<br>Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals.<br>2<br>And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, "Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?"<br>3<br>But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it.<br>4<br>I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside.<br>5<br>Then one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals."<br>6<br>Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing in the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits [1] of God sent out into all the earth.<br>7<br>He came and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne.<br>8<br>And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.<br>9<br>And they sang a new song: "You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased men for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.<br>10<br>You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth."<br>11<br>Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels, numbering thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. They encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders.<br>12<br>In a loud voice they sang: "Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise!"<br>13<br>Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, singing: "To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power, for ever and ever!"<br>14<br>The four living creatures said, "Amen," and the elders fell down and worshiped.<br><br>Revelation 6<br>1<br>I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, "Come!"<br>2<br>I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest.<br>3<br>When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, "Come!"<br>4<br>Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make men slay each other. To him was given a large sword.<br>5<br>When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, "Come!" I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand.<br>6<br>Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures, saying, "A quart [1] of wheat for a day's wages, [2] and three quarts of barley for a day's wages, [3] and do not damage the oil and the wine!"<br>7<br>When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, "Come!"<br>8<br>I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.<br>9<br>When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained.<br>10<br>They called out in a loud voice, "How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?"<br>11<br>Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and brothers who were to be killed as they had been was completed.<br>12<br>I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red,<br>13<br>and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as late figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind.<br>14<br>The sky receded like a scroll, rolling up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.<br>15<br>Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and every slave and every free man hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains.<br>16<br>They called to the mountains and the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!<br>17<br>For the great day of their wrath has come, and who can stand?"<br><br>Revelation 7<br>1<br>After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree.<br>2<br>Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea:<br>3<br>"Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God."<br>4<br>Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel.<br>5<br>From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben 12,000, from the tribe of Gad 12,000,<br>6<br>from the tribe of Asher 12,000, from the tribe of Naphtali 12,000, from the tribe of Manasseh 12,000,<br>7<br>from the tribe of Simeon 12,000, from the tribe of Levi 12,000, from the tribe of Issachar 12,000,<br>8<br>from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000, from the tribe of Joseph 12,000, from the tribe of Benjamin 12,000.<br>9<br>After this I looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands.<br>10<br>And they cried out in a loud voice: "Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb."<br>11<br>All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,<br>12<br>saying: "Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!"<br>13<br>Then one of the elders asked me, "These in white robes--who are they, and where did they come from?"<br>14<br>I answered, "Sir, you know." And he said, "These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.<br>15<br>Therefore, "they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple; and he who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them.<br>16<br>Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not beat upon them, nor any scorching heat.<br>17<br>For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; he will lead them to springs of living water. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."<br><br>Revelation 8<br>1<br>When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.<br>2<br>And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and to them were given seven trumpets.<br>3<br>Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to offer, with the prayers of all the saints, on the golden altar before the throne.<br>4<br>The smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of the saints, went up before God from the angel's hand.<br>5<br>Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it on the earth; and there came peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning and an earthquake.<br>6<br>Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.<br>7<br>The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled down upon the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.<br>8<br>The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood,<br>9<br>a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.<br>10<br>The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water--<br>11<br>the name of the star is Wormwood. [1] A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter.<br>12<br>The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night.<br>13<br>As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud voice: "Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels!"<br><br>Revelation 9<br>1<br>The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss.<br>2<br>When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss.<br>3<br>And out of the smoke locusts came down upon the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth.<br>4<br>They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.<br>5<br>They were not given power to kill them, but only to torture them for five months. And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes a man.<br>6<br>During those days men will seek death, but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them.<br>7<br>The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled human faces.<br>8<br>Their hair was like women's hair, and their teeth were like lions' teeth.<br>9<br>They had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle.<br>10<br>They had tails and stings like scorpions, and in their tails they had power to torment people for five months.<br>11<br>They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon. [1]<br>12<br>The first woe is past; two other woes are yet to come.<br>13<br>The sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice coming from the horns [2] of the golden altar that is before God.<br>14<br>It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates."<br>15<br>And the four angels who had been kept ready for this very hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind.<br>16<br>The number of the mounted troops was two hundred million. I heard their number.<br>17<br>The horses and riders I saw in my vision looked like this: Their breastplates were fiery red, dark blue, and yellow as sulfur. The heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, smoke and sulfur.<br>18<br>A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths.<br>19<br>The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails were like snakes, having heads with which they inflict injury.<br>20<br>The rest of mankind that were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the work of their hands; they did not stop worshiping demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone and wood--idols that cannot see or hear or walk.<br>21<br>Nor did they repent of their murders, their magic arts, their sexual immorality or their thefts.<br><br>Revelation 10<br>1<br>Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven. He was robed in a cloud, with a rainbow above his head; his face was like the sun, and his legs were like fiery pillars.<br>2<br>He was holding a little scroll, which lay open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,<br>3<br>and he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion. When he shouted, the voices of the seven thunders spoke.<br>4<br>And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say, "Seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down."<br>5<br>Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven.<br>6<br>And he swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, and said, "There will be no more delay!<br>7<br>But in the days when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be accomplished, just as he announced to his servants the prophets."<br>8<br>Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me once more: "Go, take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land."<br>9<br>So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me, "Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach sour, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey."<br>10<br>I took the little scroll from the angel's hand and ate it. It tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach turned sour.<br>11<br>Then I was told, "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages and kings."<br><br>Revelation 11<br>1<br>I was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told, "Go and measure the temple of God and the altar, and count the worshipers there.<br>2<br>But exclude the outer court; do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles. They will trample on the holy city for 42 months.<br>3<br>And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth."<br>4<br>These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.<br>5<br>If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die.<br>6<br>These men have power to shut up the sky so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying; and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want.<br>7<br>Now when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them, and overpower and kill them.<br>8<br>Their bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.<br>9<br>For three and a half days men from every people, tribe, language and nation will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial.<br>10<br>The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth.<br>11<br>But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and terror struck those who saw them.<br>12<br>Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies looked on.<br>13<br>At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.<br>14<br>The second woe has passed; the third woe is coming soon.<br>15<br>The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, which said: "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign for ever and ever."<br>16<br>And the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God,<br>17<br>saying: "We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign.<br>18<br>The nations were angry; and your wrath has come. The time has come for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your saints and those who reverence your name, both small and great-- and for destroying those who destroy the earth."<br>19<br>Then God's temple in heaven was opened, and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant. And there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake and a great hailstorm.<br><br>Revelation 12<br>1<br>A great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head.<br>2<br>She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.<br>3<br>Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads.<br>4<br>His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that he might devour her child the moment it was born.<br>5<br>She gave birth to a son, a male child, who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter. And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne.<br>6<br>The woman fled into the desert to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.<br>7<br>And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back.<br>8<br>But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven.<br>9<br>The great dragon was hurled down--that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.<br>10<br>Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: "Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ. For the accuser of our brothers, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down.<br>11<br>They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.<br>12<br>Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short."<br>13<br>When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.<br>14<br>The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the desert, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent's reach.<br>15<br>Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent.<br>16<br>But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth.<br>17<br>Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to make war against the rest of her offspring--those who obey God's commandments and hold to the testimony of Jesus.<br><br>Revelation 13<br>1<br>And the dragon [1] stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. He had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on his horns, and on each head a blasphemous name.<br>2<br>The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority.<br>3<br>One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was astonished and followed the beast.<br>4<br>Men worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, "Who is like the beast? Who can make war against him?"<br>5<br>The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise his authority for forty-two months.<br>6<br>He opened his mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven.<br>7<br>He was given power to make war against the saints and to conquer them. And he was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation.<br>8<br>All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast--all whose names have not been written in the book of life belonging to the Lamb that was slain from the creation of the world. [2]<br>9<br>He who has an ear, let him hear.<br>10<br>If anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity he will go. If anyone is to be killed [3] with the sword, with the sword he will be killed. This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of the saints.<br>11<br>Then I saw another beast, coming out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon.<br>12<br>He exercised all the authority of the first beast on his behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed.<br>13<br>And he performed great and miraculous signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of men.<br>14<br>Because of the signs he was given power to do on behalf of the first beast, he deceived the inhabitants of the earth. He ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.<br>15<br>He was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that it could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed.<br>16<br>He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead,<br>17<br>so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.<br>18<br>This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man's number. His number is 666.<br><br>Revelation 14<br>1<br>Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.<br>2<br>And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps.<br>3<br>And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.<br>4<br>These are those who did not defile themselves with women, for they kept themselves pure. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among men and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb.<br>5<br>No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless.<br>6<br>Then I saw another angel flying in midair, and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth--to every nation, tribe, language and people.<br>7<br>He said in a loud voice, "Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea and the springs of water."<br>8<br>A second angel followed and said, "Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great, which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries."<br>9<br>A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: "If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on the forehead or on the hand,<br>10<br>he, too, will drink of the wine of God's fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. He will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb.<br>11<br>And the smoke of their torment rises for ever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image, or for anyone who receives the mark of his name."<br>12<br>This calls for patient endurance on the part of the saints who obey God's commandments and remain faithful to Jesus.<br>13<br>Then I heard a voice from heaven say, "Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on." "Yes," says the Spirit, "they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them."<br>14<br>I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one "like a son of man" [1] with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.<br>15<br>Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, "Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe."<br>16<br>So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.<br>17<br>Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.<br>18<br>Still another angel, who had charge of the fire, came from the altar and called in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, "Take your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth's vine, because its grapes are ripe."<br>19<br>The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God's wrath.<br>20<br>They were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press, rising as high as the horses' bridles for a distance of 1,600 stadia. [2]<br><br>Revelation 15<br>1<br>I saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign: seven angels with the seven last plagues--last, because with them God's wrath is completed.<br>2<br>And I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire and, standing beside the sea, those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and over the number of his name. They held harps given them by God<br>3<br>and sang the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb: "Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are your ways, King of the ages.<br>4<br>Who will not fear you, O Lord, and bring glory to your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous acts have been revealed."<br>5<br>After this I looked and in heaven the temple, that is, the tabernacle of the Testimony, was opened.<br>6<br>Out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were dressed in clean, shining linen and wore golden sashes around their chests.<br>7<br>Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever.<br>8<br>And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.<br><br>Revelation 16<br>1<br>Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, "Go, pour out the seven bowls of God's wrath on the earth."<br>2<br>The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land, and ugly and painful sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped his image.<br>3<br>The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it turned into blood like that of a dead man, and every living thing in the sea died.<br>4<br>The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood.<br>5<br>Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters say: "You are just in these judgments, you who are and who were, the Holy One, because you have so judged;<br>6<br>for they have shed the blood of your saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve."<br>7<br>And I heard the altar respond: "Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and just are your judgments."<br>8<br>The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and the sun was given power to scorch people with fire.<br>9<br>They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who had control over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify him.<br>10<br>The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was plunged into darkness. Men gnawed their tongues in agony<br>11<br>and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, but they refused to repent of what they had done.<br>12<br>The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East.<br>13<br>Then I saw three evil [1] spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet.<br>14<br>They are spirits of demons performing miraculous signs, and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty.<br>15<br>"Behold, I come like a thief! Blessed is he who stays awake and keeps his clothes with him, so that he may not go naked and be shamefully exposed."<br>16<br>Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.<br>17<br>The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne, saying, "It is done!"<br>18<br>Then there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder and a severe earthquake. No earthquake like it has ever occurred since man has been on earth, so tremendous was the quake.<br>19<br>The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed. God remembered Babylon the Great and gave her the cup filled with the wine of the fury of his wrath.<br>20<br>Every island fled away and the mountains could not be found.<br>21<br>From the sky huge hailstones of about a hundred pounds each fell upon men. And they cursed God on account of the plague of hail, because the plague was so terrible.<br><br>Revelation 17<br>1<br>One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, "Come, I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute, who sits on many waters.<br>2<br>With her the kings of the earth committed adultery and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries."<br>3<br>Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a desert. There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns.<br>4<br>The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries.<br>5<br>This title was written on her forehead: MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.<br>6<br>I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly astonished.<br>7<br>Then the angel said to me: "Why are you astonished? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides, which has the seven heads and ten horns.<br>8<br>The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and will come up out of the Abyss and go to his destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast, because he once was, now is not, and yet will come.<br>9<br>"This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits.<br>10<br>They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he does come, he must remain for a little while.<br>11<br>The beast who once was, and now is not, is an eighth king. He belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction.<br>12<br>"The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast.<br>13<br>They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast.<br>14<br>They will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings--and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers."<br>15<br>Then the angel said to me, "The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages.<br>16<br>The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire.<br>17<br>For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to give the beast their power to rule, until God's words are fulfilled.<br>18<br>The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth."<br><br>Revelation 18<br>1<br>After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor.<br>2<br>With a mighty voice he shouted: "Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great! She has become a home for demons and a haunt for every evil [1] spirit, a haunt for every unclean and detestable bird.<br>3<br>For all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries. The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries."<br>4<br>Then I heard another voice from heaven say: "Come out of her, my people, so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive any of her plagues;<br>5<br>for her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes.<br>6<br>Give back to her as she has given; pay her back double for what she has done. Mix her a double portion from her own cup.<br>7<br>Give her as much torture and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself. In her heart she boasts, `I sit as queen; I am not a widow, and I will never mourn.'<br>8<br>Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: death, mourning and famine. She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.<br>9<br>"When the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury see the smoke of her burning, they will weep and mourn over her.<br>10<br>Terrified at her torment, they will stand far off and cry: "`Woe! Woe, O great city, O Babylon, city of power! In one hour your doom has come!'<br>11<br>"The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargoes any more--<br>12<br>cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble;<br>13<br>cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and bodies and souls of men.<br>14<br>"They will say, `The fruit you longed for is gone from you. All your riches and splendor have vanished, never to be recovered.'<br>15<br>The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn<br>16<br>and cry out: "`Woe! Woe, O great city, dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls!<br>17<br>In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!' "Every sea captain, and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea, will stand far off.<br>18<br>When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, `Was there ever a city like this great city?'<br>19<br>They will throw dust on their heads, and with weeping and mourning cry out: "`Woe! Woe, O great city, where all who had ships on the sea became rich through her wealth! In one hour she has been brought to ruin!<br>20<br>Rejoice over her, O heaven! Rejoice, saints and apostles and prophets! God has judged her for the way she treated you.'"<br>21<br>Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, and said: "With such violence the great city of Babylon will be thrown down, never to be found again.<br>22<br>The music of harpists and musicians, flute players and trumpeters, will never be heard in you again. No workman of any trade will ever be found in you again. The sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again.<br>23<br>The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The voice of bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again. Your merchants were the world's great men. By your magic spell all the nations were led astray.<br>24<br>In her was found the blood of prophets and of the saints, and of all who have been killed on the earth."<br><br>Revelation 19<br>1<br>After this I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in heaven shouting: "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,<br>2<br>for true and just are his judgments. He has condemned the great prostitute who corrupted the earth by her adulteries. He has avenged on her the blood of his servants."<br>3<br>And again they shouted: "Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever."<br>4<br>The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, who was seated on the throne. And they cried: "Amen, Hallelujah!"<br>5<br>Then a voice came from the throne, saying: "Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, both small and great!"<br>6<br>Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peals of thunder, shouting: "Hallelujah! For our Lord God Almighty reigns.<br>7<br>Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready.<br>8<br>Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear." (Fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the saints.)<br>9<br>Then the angel said to me, "Write: `Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!'" And he added, "These are the true words of God."<br>10<br>At this I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, "Do not do it! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."<br>11<br>I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and makes war.<br>12<br>His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself.<br>13<br>He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God.<br>14<br>The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and clean.<br>15<br>Out of his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. "He will rule them with an iron scepter." [1] He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty.<br>16<br>On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.<br>17<br>And I saw an angel standing in the sun, who cried in a loud voice to all the birds flying in midair, "Come, gather together for the great supper of God,<br>18<br>so that you may eat the flesh of kings, generals, and mighty men, of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, small and great."<br>19<br>Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army.<br>20<br>But the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who had performed the miraculous signs on his behalf. With these signs he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped his image. The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur.<br>21<br>The rest of them were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.<br><br>Revelation 20<br>1<br>And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain.<br>2<br>He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.<br>3<br>He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be set free for a short time.<br>4<br>I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony for Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years.<br>5<br>(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.<br>6<br>Blessed and holy are those who have part in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.<br>7<br>When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison<br>8<br>and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth--Gog and Magog--to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore.<br>9<br>They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God's people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them.<br>10<br>And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.<br>11<br>Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. Earth and sky fled from his presence, and there was no place for them.<br>12<br>And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.<br>13<br>The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what he had done.<br>14<br>Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death.<br>15<br>If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.<br><br>Revelation 21<br>1<br>Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.<br>2<br>I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.<br>3<br>And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.<br>4<br>He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."<br>5<br>He who was seated on the throne said, "I am making everything new!" Then he said, "Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true."<br>6<br>He said to me: "It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who is thirsty I will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life.<br>7<br>He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son.<br>8<br>But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars--their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death."<br>9<br>One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, "Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb."<br>10<br>And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.<br>11<br>It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.<br>12<br>It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.<br>13<br>There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west.<br>14<br>The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.<br>15<br>The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates and its walls.<br>16<br>The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia [1] in length, and as wide and high as it is long.<br>17<br>He measured its wall and it was 144 cubits [2] thick, [3] by man's measurement, which the angel was using.<br>18<br>The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass.<br>19<br>The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,<br>20<br>the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. [4]<br>21<br>The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of pure gold, like transparent glass.<br>22<br>I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.<br>23<br>The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.<br>24<br>The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it.<br>25<br>On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there.<br>26<br>The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it.<br>27<br>Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.<br><br>Revelation 22<br>1<br>Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb<br>2<br>down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.<br>3<br>No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him.<br>4<br>They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.<br>5<br>There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever.<br>6<br>The angel said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants the things that must soon take place."<br>7<br>"Behold, I am coming soon! Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy in this book."<br>8<br>I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing them to me.<br>9<br>But he said to me, "Do not do it! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers the prophets and of all who keep the words of this book. Worship God!"<br>10<br>Then he told me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, because the time is near.<br>11<br>Let him who does wrong continue to do wrong; let him who is vile continue to be vile; let him who does right continue to do right; and let him who is holy continue to be holy."<br>12<br>"Behold, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to everyone according to what he has done.<br>13<br>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.<br>14<br>"Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city.<br>15<br>Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.<br>16<br>"I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you [1] this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star."<br>17<br>The Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" And let him who hears say, "Come!" Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life.<br>18<br>I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.<br>19<br>And if anyone takes words away from this book of prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.<br>20<br>He who testifies to these things says, "Yes, I am coming soon." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.<br>21<br>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people. Amen. �<br><br></div>
