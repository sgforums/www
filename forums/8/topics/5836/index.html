            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that we can find true love. Amongst the hustle and bustle of the world, somewhere, there is a person waiting for you. But few people know it and are left clinging to what is available. Only 3 percent of the human race can ever find true love.<br><br>------------------<br>Time is like sand in your hands.

            <div class='col-md body'>If I can offer you an answer, then I will have found that person who was meant to be my true love. Unfortunately, like patie, I feel that such questions do not make sense... The thing here, is waiting, just that how patient can you wait.. I was quite impatient for a while, but now, I am just taking things easy, and do what I have to do and let nature takes it course. For me, if I don't find that someone by a certain age, I will stay single for the rest of my life...<br><br>As for now, being the prodigal is my only option...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everyone's true love is different, because not all of us has gone thru the same steps or so called "stairs" in life. Everyone will have different pasts, different memories, which will induce a different way in effort to fathom what true love is. True love maybe if you want to spend life with, or anything. But just want to point out one thing that people that always try to say. "I will die for my true love." Unnecessary death is stupid. Unless if your death is so crucial that can save the person you love, don't do it. Juz an advice, "It takes courage to end own life, but it takes more than courage to continue your life." A lot of people used death as a way to avoid, to avoid anything they don't wish to see or admit. But if you are doing it for your true love, unless necessary, don't die, as you need to continue protecting him/her, stand by his/her side when he/she needs it. I don't know why i write so called "craps" (to some pple it's craps) about this.. but I know I learnt it the hard way. So, if you want to live for someone, that's what I really believe what true love is. But well, everyone's time is limited. So when you still have time, do your best, protect the one that you love. Don't wait until time is almost up like my case. It's sad to know when one day you are gonna close your eyes and never wake up again. All the best for the lovers out there, cherish the one you love, good luck.<br><br>------------------<br>"When you looked into my eyes, and you said goodbye, could you see my tears? Did you hear me say I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky, you promised me when you said goodbye, that you'd return when the storm was done, and now I'll wait for the sun to appear...."
