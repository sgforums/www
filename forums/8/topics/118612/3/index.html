There's a lots of market, and the PRC has only  overtaken the US as the worldÂ’s largest consumer of basic agricultural and industrial commodities - Nothing else.

Shop at Tommy Hilfiger and eat at Pizza Hut. The toilets flush automatically. The floors are spotless.<br><br>•	Chicago Tribune home page<br>•	Subscribe to the Tribune<br>•	Search the Tribune<br>•	More Chicago news<br><br>Gurgaon, just outside New Delhi, could be India's answer to Schaumburg, Ill.--if all the shopping centers of Schaumburg had been built in less than three years.<br><br>"There's a new culture coming now," said Pawan Dutta, sitting at a food court in Mega Mall, which opened last year. "The Western culture, the mall culture is coming. This is not really India."<br><br>This is closer to the opposite of India.<br><br>In this country, people traditionally shop at local markets, where vegetables are sold in one tiny shop and milk in another. Shoppers go from one store to the next, buying flowers here, chicken there. They bargain for better deals. The markets often are filthy, littered with garbage.<br><br>But the malls offer everything under one roof, even stores such as Big Bazaar, a smaller, more chaotic version of Wal-Mart. There is central air conditioning, a novelty here. Signs tell people how to ride the escalators, still new to India. Songs by Depeche Mode (news - web sites) and Radiohead blare over mall loudspeakers. People speak to each other in English instead of Hindi.<br><br>There are nightclubs such as Last Chance, Crave and the oddly named Suburbia, the Urban Lounge. One shop sells T-shirts with marijuana-leaf designs and beer signs. A beauty salon offers a $5.75 service called "detanning" to lighten a person's skin. Mall atrium banners and signs on shop windows promise 50 percent off, but the prices are fixed. In the malls, no one bargains for a better price.<br><br>The malls are another sign of the new, prosperous India, of call centers, outsourcing and more disposable income, of fashionable young people who look as though they belong on MTV. Although much of rural India remains in deep poverty, many urban Indians are becoming richer. The country's economy is forecast to grow up to 6.9 percent this year.<br><br>The malls showcase the encroachment of the West into a country that in the past doggedly resisted such foreign influence. The Indian government eased restrictions on foreign investment only in 1991.<br><br>In New Delhi, local shops have started to fight the suburban malls.<br><br>The city in September lifted a longtime ban on late-night shopping, allowing shops to stay open until 11 p.m. to compete with the malls.<br><br>But it's tough to beat the convenience of malls. Families come from New Delhi, 20 miles away, to spend the day. Those in Gurgaon do not leave.<br><br>"If I had to go to Delhi and hunt for everything at different shops, I wouldn't have time to work," said Vinti Saxena, 28, who works nights at a Gurgaon call center for American Express. "It would be impossible."<br><br>In the Gurgaon malls, people can shop at stores selling American brands. But they also can buy expensive pillows from Indian stores, statues of Hindu gods and fancy outfits. They can watch movies, eat Indian "street food" from the food court or have their pictures plastered on Coca-Cola cans at a promotional stand. At night they can dance and drink alcohol in the mall's swanky nightclubs, also relatively new in India.<br><br>In the past three years, 40 malls have been built in India, said Amitabh Taneja, director of the Indian branch of the International Council of Shopping Centers. Most are small or medium-size by American standards. Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, for instance, is almost seven times the size of Mega Mall, the largest in Gurgaon.<br><br>More malls are being planned, bigger and shinier. About 300 are to be built by 2007, including centers almost as large as Woodfield, called "Gen X" malls by developers, Taneja said. There will be more specialty shopping centers--entire malls dedicated to weddings, cars or home design.<br><br>"What took 20 years, 30 years, in any other country, here will take three or four years," Taneja said.<br><br>More than most places, Gurgaon shows the coming of the malls. The city of about 1 million is so small by Indian standards that it does not even make it into travel guides. As recently as five years ago, it was a sleepy suburb. The main street, MG Road, had only two lanes.<br><br>But the city was near the international airport and had cheap land. Multinational corporations set up call centers. Young people moved in from around the country; experienced Indians returned home from overseas.<br><br>There was no place to shop. In 2002, City Centre, the first mall in Gurgaon and only the second in India, opened its doors on MG Road.<br><br>Now MG Road is a six-lane highway, jammed with honking cars, rickshaws, tractors and the occasional cow. It's dotted with construction material, piles of bricks and dirt. Five malls have opened, and about 20 more are in various stages of planning, according to mall developers and government planners. The infrastructure has not always kept up with the new malls, acknowledged Madhusmita Moitra, a government planner. There still are occasional power outages.<br><br>The landscape of Gurgaon is stark. Malls sprout out of fields like a new cash crop, surrounded by nothing. Power and telephone lines have been strung over empty fields, where cows, sheep and pigs still roam. Towers of condominiums--another new concept in India--are springing up near the malls, advertising fulfilled dreams and luxury. The Legend development, for instance, bills itself as: "Not just homes. Masterpieces."<br><br>Although some people wring their hands about what such change could mean to Indian culture, people at the malls say the country can adapt. A mall is just a new kind of market, they say.<br><br>"It's all in a name," said Dutta, the diner at the food court and also a manager at the Big Bazaar in Gurgaon. "Once we called them tailors. Now we call them fashion designers. It's the same thing."</span><br></div>
