            <div class='col-md body'>The Republic of India is a large country in South Asia, and one of only two countries in the world with a population of over one billion. The Indian economy is the fourth largest in the world in terms of purchasing power parity and is the world's second fastest growing economy. India is also the second most populous country in the world and the world's largest democracy. It is the seventh largest country by geographical size. It has grown significantly, in both population and strategic importance, in the last twenty years. India has also emerged as an important regional power, possessing one of the world's largest military forces and a declared nuclear weapons capability.<br><br>Located in Asia and constituting most of the Indian subcontinent, India straddles many trade routes. It shares its borders with Pakistan, the People's Republic of China, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Afghanistan1. Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Indonesia are nearby island nations in the Indian Ocean. India is home to some of the most ancient civilizations and has given birth to four major world religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. The country was a part of the British Empire before gaining independence in 1947.</div>

It shares its borders with Pakistan, the People's Republic of China, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Afghanistan1. Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Indonesia are nearby island nations in the Indian Ocean. India is home to some of the most ancient civilizations and has given birth to four major world religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism.
