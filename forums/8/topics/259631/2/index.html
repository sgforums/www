Thats only shows the kind of legal system we have ( only to the rich and famous)<br><br>Paris Hilton claimed nervous breakdown and she was freed out of jail but have to be house confined, what the hell!!?? If other inmates all are like her then happy happy go home? There is something really serious here, there are definitely high social powers putting pressure on the justice system.<br><br>and for him, somemore drive, knocked someone down and drove away. thats person is lucky for only losing a toe, not his life. what if the victim layed there bleeding and he still drove away? Lady Justice being blindfolded symbolises equality treatment to all. Well, Im pretty sure if the person involved is not a celebrity, he/she would kena jia lat jia lat.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> </div></blockquote>the difference between us and them is that they made an effort to gain their recognition and fame, what about you? sitting at your com and whining.
