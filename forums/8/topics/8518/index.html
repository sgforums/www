            <div class='col-md body'>AngelDark, do think twice. Well, it isn't that your thread is not able to reach the impact it used to. They still have that potential, believe me, just need a little catalyst at times.<br><br>There used to be several threads I posted which somehow failed, and I don't really noe why...... then I realised maybe it is because the thread posted was not addressed to the appropriate audience. Give it another go, u know u will have the support of many around......<br><br>I don't know u personally, but hey, I do hope that you will stay and continue adding on to the topics of discussion. This forum is an amalgam of very different people, and diversity within the forum is definitely very much encouraged.<br><br>Well, how many of us can actually say that we have found the purpose in life??? We are all in a continuous search for the answer to that one question, and not many are able to find it. So don't despair, continue posting in here. You can assure yourself of at least one supporter in here, yah??? Who knows. Together maybe we  can all search for that answer??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>
