            <div class='col-md body'>OK think of it this way, when u choose 1 door out of 10, your chance of hitting a car is what.......only 1 in 10, correct anot.......Now when the host opens 8 other doors revealing goats, that means now it's left with only 2 doors, your chosen door and the remaining unopened door. One of them will have a car. Now how confident are you that your originally chosen door, which has a 1 in 10 chance, actually has a car behind? Well the chance is only 1 in 10, not so good right? You're not so confident, right? But now after the host elimitates 8 other doors, that means now the car has to be behind one of the two doors. In other words, he has helped eliminate other possibilities and improve the chance that the car is actually at the other remaining door. By switching you are taking advantage of this and improving your chance.<br><br>OK think of this another example.<br><br>-------------<br>Suppose now there are 100 doors. Behind 1 door there is a car, the other 99, goats. Now you choose a door, say door number 1. After that the host opens 98 other doors revealing goats. He then ask you whether you want to change your mind to switch to the other remaining door. Is it to your advantage to switch?<br>--------------<br><br>It's getting more and more clearer this way, use bigger and bigger numbers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By giving up 1 door .. it increases ur chance to 50/50 . So whether its advantagous or not , it comes down to whether u want to listen or trust on your own judgement or not.<br><br>50/50 of course its advan. Even if u increase doors ,  there is still a 1% probablity that the host is wrong. 1% is still it takes for something bad to happen. Something not 100% is not guranteed. It just means increasing ur odds in favour to it but still an unknown factor.<br><br>Like physics.. all can be calculated but there is always the 0.1% of human error n ur thing doesnt work. So it comes down to whether u think that u are going for majority and higher probability or the still 1% of error.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think we really need a try out here:<br><br>i'll think of a number 1 to 3 now, you guys will guess what number i'm thinking, i'll reveal a number that is not the correct answer after you've made your choice <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i've a better idea, let's put it another way...based on the 10 doors problem<br><br>i think of a number 1 to 10, you are supposed to guess that number<br><br>10 numbers are really hard to choose one from, say you choose 1.<br><br>now i say: 2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10 are NOT the correct answers<br><br>can you see something now? a very obvious hint that the 'gap' is probably the correct answer.<br><br>now all is left is 1 and 7. would you like to change your ans to 7? or insist on 1?<br><br>by common sense, i'm sure the choice to change or not is more or less decided.<br><br>can you still say the odds is still 50:50?<br><br>[in fact the odds are 1:9]<br><br>the reason why we dun see this in the 3 doors problem is becos the number of doors is too few (it's the minimum for this problem to work). ppl usually cannot detect the small difference of probability 2/3 and 1/2 through their intuition or common sense</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Read this excerpt:<br><br>"There are three possible scenarios, each with equal probability (1/3):<br><br>[*]The player picks goat number 1. The game host picks the other goat. Switching will win the car.<br>[*]The player picks goat number 2. The game host picks the other goat. Switching will win the car.<br>[*]The player picks the car. The game host picks either of the two goats. Switching will lose.<br><br>In the first two scenarios, the player wins by switching. The third scenario is the only one where the player wins by staying. Since two out of three scenarios win by switching and each scenario is equally likely, the odds of winning by switching are 2/3. In other words, a player who has a policy of always switching will win the car on average two times out of the three."<br><br>And also this:<br><br>"It may be easier to appreciate the result by considering a hundred doors instead of just three. In this case there are 99 doors with goats behind them and 1 door with a prize. The player picks a door; 99% of the time, the player will pick a door with a goat. Thus, the chances of picking the winning door at first are very small: only 1%. The game host then opens 98 of the other doors revealing 98 goats and offers the player the chance to switch to the other unopened door. On 99 out of 100 occasions the other door will contain the prize, as 99 out of 100 times the player first picked a door with a goat. At this point a rational player should always switch."<br><br>More <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the solution is quite difficult to understand if you read it and try to visualise in your head.  Just draw a car and two goat (use X and O for easier time) and follow the solution, you should get the answer in no time.</div>
