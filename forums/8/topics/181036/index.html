            <div class='col-md body'>"Well, I'm happy to report there are Ents and they're satisfyingly<br>Entish and not at all short. Many things are handled very well in<br>this production. Some of my favourite moments were Gandalf's return<br>(very dramatic and exciting), and Aragorn on the Paths of the Dead.<br>Now, that was a fantastic scene – it might be my second favourite<br>moment of night. Here is where I really felt A.R. Rahman's music. As<br>an Indian film fan it's something I'd been eager for since the start.<br>It's very dramatic and disturbing in this scene. Excellent!"<br><br>"<br>The music was composed by A.R. Rahman and VÃ¤rttinÃ¤ and is hauntingly<br>inspiring. Rahman is a veteran of the Indian film industry and he<br>isn't afraid to take chances with his music. He is a perfect choice<br>in this context as well as he blends together different types of<br>world music to create the unique and echoing melodies of Middle-<br>earth. VÃ¤rttinÃ¤ is a distinguished folk music group from Finland.<br>Together with Rahman they have created harmonies and a vocal quality<br>in the singing that will continue to resonate long after you leave<br>the theatre."<br><br><a href="http://www.warofthering.net/articles/article_10827.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.warofthering.net/articles/article_10827.php</a></div>

The show is magnificent and definitely one to see. I must say however, that I was thoroughly disappointed in Brent Carver's portrayal of Gandalf (others I have spoken to agree). He did not have the commanding presence necessary for the role. His voice came across weak and higher pitched than it should have and he stumbled occassionally on his lines. As you remark, every line seemed rushed. Apart from that distraction (and it was a big distraction for me), the sets were amazing, the costumes superb (particularly the orcs)and the story held true to the spirit of Tolkien. I was particularly happy to see that the sacking of the Shire had not been cut!<br><br>Cassandria	03-01-2006 08:00 [E,W]<br>'...the story held true to the spirit of Tolkien.' That is what I needed to hear! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Your article was a fun read and both you and Michael have convinced me to try to go if I get to attend The Gathering of the Fellowship. I just hope it is still playing in July! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Thanks Eledhwen!<br><br>IHD	03-02-2006 12:19 [E,W]<br>Great review, I'm hoping to see it soon.<br><br>john	03-04-2006 06:02 [E,W]<br>A.R.Rahman music was Rocking<br><br>Indian King 03-04-2006 12:35 [E,W]<br>AR Rahman proves it again time and time!.<br>This is absolutely the best show of the year.<br><br>Godfather 03-04-2006 12:36 [E,W]<br>Hi there guys.

Awesome<br><br>the One Ring 03-04-2006 12:55 [E,W]<br>Previews of Lord of the Rings, directed by Matthew Warchus, opened on February 4 at the Princess of Wales Theatre in Toronto and will run until March 22. Fans who have seen the preview said it was worth the wait. One even said, "It was unlike reading or watching Middle Earth, it was like being there!" The official Gala opening is scheduled for March 23. Toronto will be the only place to see this production for at least nine months, when it is scheduled to open in London.<br><br>Roxanne	03-04-2006 15:05 [E,W]<br>I'm going to see it this next Saturday, March 11. I can't wait! And your review definitely has me riled up now.

The talents of this compser is mindblowing, the use of sound in his music is spellbinding..Rahman is a star in his native India and has sold more than 100 million albums, composing the soundtracks to more than 50 Bollywood films..This techno 0 futuristic genuius from India probably the next John williams,,or maybe the Asia's version...<br><br>jOe 03-05-2006 08:06 [E,W]<br>Havent seen the show but having listened to Rahman's music a countless times, i bet this is one hellofa unique project.
