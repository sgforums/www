            <div class='col-md body'>I told a gal that i liked her.  During that period, she was already on the verge of breaking up with her ex-stead and i dont that she got a bf.  That time she told me she like me and has feelings for me.  until that day she broke up with her ex-stead, she told me she dont want to go back to him and give me a chance.  3 Days ago, she told me she got no feelings for me and treated me as a close friend.  I felt cheated.  She told me to give up on her.  look man, i already liked her so much and how to take back my feelings.  later she cried on the phone for being gulity of cheating me.  For several days, she and i have sleepless nites over this.  And she told my collegue that i didnt call her for a few days.  normally we can talk on the phone for hours and she never fails to call me everyday or the worst within 3 days time.  Does anyone out there think that i still have a chance?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is quite demoralising at times when you post your relationship problems and getting negative responses. Even if there are encouraging responses and it didn't turn out that well, it won't do the person any good either. So it's better not to take the responses so seriously.. do what your gut feeling tells.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But then she kept calling me constantly.  Even my friend who was with me when she called once said the way she talked to me is like a girlfriend talking to her boyfriend.  I admitted that when we talked, there will be a lot of giggles and teasing.  The day before she called me 5 times(that day only). and this morning 29/01/2000 12.03am , she called my mobile but i was already in dreamland.  So what do you ppl think&gt;?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe right now what you should do is to sort out this things with her again. But sound to me that you wanna give it a try again? If not, you won't be so persistent and have been writing so in defend of her, you know what I mean?<br>Anyway, if you really wanna try again, you got to ask yourself : "Can you stand another blow from her?" If the answer is no, then you can forget about this relationship, cos in the end, both of you will get hurt.<br>Remeber, it is your choice now, if she "cheated" you again, dun blame her again. I remember I saw it somewhere at a forum somebody writes : "If a person cheated you, it's his/her fault. But if you were cheated second time by the same person, it's YOUR FAULT!"<br>Hope my advice can do you help.<br><br>------------------<br>"Love comes to those who still hope, even though they've been disappointed,<br>To those who still believe, even though they've been betrayed,<br>To those who still love, even though they've been deeply wounded before."</div>
