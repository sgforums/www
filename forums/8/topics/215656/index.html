            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a very easygoing person and it took me only 2 weeks to move out last time and the time before. My only preferences are: fully furnished room with air-con, close to public transport, open-minded housemates ( though I can't judge people solely by emailing them) and below $700 p.m. Is it picky? The only two responses I had so far are about unfurnished rooms.

            <div class='col-md body'>Housing agents will definitely be helpful... but fact is alot of people who have rooms to rent do not go to housing agents! Cause usually the commission is paid by the landlord.. and most of the time they are not in a big hurry to lease out their room plus there are so many "free" advertising methods out there.<br><br>And some housing agents are also not interested to do rentals, especially if only a room as the commission is very little and they may have to bring the client around to alot of places before a suitable one is found. so not worth it.<br><br>Try the ad boards in the shopping centres in town or expat areas such as Holland V.. with your price range you will definitely be able to find something...</div>
