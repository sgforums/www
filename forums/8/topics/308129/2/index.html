            <div class='col-md body'><p>   Very happy you manage to " wake up " Nokia . I used to work in one of their care center getting super low salary yet have to work beyond " retail hrs " . And from what i heard is our supervisor used to be a customer service personnel which is from a different agent/company . And nobody knows how he manage to become our supervisor which is nt related to his experience n job scope at all . And once Nokia launched a " certain " model of phone which they did not supply us spare parts for 2 months which left alot of customers fuming mad cos that model of hp spoiled within days of buying it . We the technicians also have a hard time trying to rush to repair the hp once the stock comes as really alot of that model of hp needed repairs .</p></div>

              <p>I got no complaints about nokia cust service agents, most are polite and i definately do not agree to scolding them.</p>
              <p>I believe ts issue is that Nokia products/service sucks. Need to constantly send it in for repairs.</p>
              <p>The service level sucks really bad. The agents are polite but their tech seem to be unable to repair the products. I had my N95 fail again with the same problems 3 hours after leaving the service center.</p>
              <p>Last mth, the red disconnect button on my N95 cannot be used. I send it in to the causeway point service center - queue time to get queue ticket number - 20 minutes, waiting for queue number to come up - 40 mins, after they had receive my N95 for servicing, they cannot even tell me when i can pick it up. all they say is we will call you once it is repaired. After 3 weeks, i am still waiting.</p>
              <p>can i also sue them?</p>

But frankly speaking , would you spent your time to concentrate and think of how to repair the phone properly when you already have 50 phone under your name to be completed repair by today at that point of time early afternoon otherwise you face being scolded severly by your supervisor and the public enemy there cos the others have to help you out on top of their tight deadlines . My best record was having repaired 112 phones in a single day . Which shocks me also , so you can imagine the stress and pressure the technician are having ?</p></div>

              <p>Smart move, chap.  I always believed that everything is fair. </p>
              <p>There was an incident whereby some defects in a private property was not settled amaicably. The manager of the developer told the owner to sue them if they want. What do you expect? The case finally went to the High Court and although it was settled out of court, the owner was paid by the developer after all.  Like you, there were smiles all around.</p>
              <p>Never ever underestimate anyone!  Don't push anybody to a corner! There is always a limit to one's tolerance.</p>

              <p>NOKIA should replace their fault sets readily and not make consumers feel they became suckers to buy a faulty set.  </p>
