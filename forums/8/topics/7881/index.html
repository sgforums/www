I saw you at the party last weekend and you look kind of<br>interesting.. Let's meet sometime...<br>104.   I've had quite a bit to drink, and you're beginning to look pretty<br>good.<br>105.   No, I'm not a cop. What can I get for fifty bucks?<br>106.   Inheriting eighty million bucks doesn't mean much when you have a<br>weak heart.<br>107.   Hello, Susie. Your mom couldn't make it this afternoon, she asked me<br>to pick you up and take you home. My, what a pretty dress.<br>108.   Excuse me, do you live around here often?<br>109.   Excuse me, I'm a little short on cash, would you mind if we shared<br>a cab home together?<br>110.   What's your sign?<br>111.   You have the *ss of a great artist.<br>112.   Hi, the voices in my head told me to come over and talk to you.<br>113.   Let's take a shower together -- you smell.<br>114.   I've gotta thirst, baby, and you smell like my Gatorade.<br>115.   If I was Elvis, would you screw me?<br>116.   Didn't anyone tell you that you wanted to sleep with me?!?! I<br>thought you knew...<br>117.   Cold out isn't it? (staring at breasts)<br>118.

Stand back, I'm a doctor. You go get an ambulance, I'll loosen her<br>clothes.<br>122.   Do you know, your hair and my pillow are perfectly color<br>coordinated.<br>123.   Have you ever played leap frog naked ??<br>124.   I'll bet you 100 bucks that you couldn't get all your clothes off<br>in 30 seconds<br>125.   Since we shouldn't waste this day and age what you say we use these<br>condoms in my pocket before they expire<br>126.   Would you like to see me naked ??<br>127.   Do you like chicken?

So....How am I doin'?<br>133.   I would give you a piece of my mind but I have much more of something<br>else.<br>134.   Your legs must be tired because you've been running through my<br>mind all night<br>135.   I would kill or die to make love with you.<br>136.   Let's go to my place and do the things I'll tell everyone we did<br>anyway.<br>137.   The word of the day is "legs."  Let's go back to my place and spread<br>the word.<br>138.   Hey baby, let's go make some babies.<br>139.   I wanna floss with your pubic hair.<br>140.   I want to melt in your mouth, not in your hand.<br>141.   All those curves, and me with no brakes.<br>142.   If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put U and I together.<br>143.   If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put you between F and CK<br>144.   I must be lost. I thought paradise was further south.<br>145.   I had a wet dream about you last night.  Would you like to make it<br>a reality?<br>146.   I know I don't look like much now, but I'm drinking milk.<br>147.   Free mammograms, get your free mammograms here, get 'em while<br>they're hot!<br>148.   Do you come here often?<br>149.

Think you can dance in those shoes?<br>154.   (Walk over to her)"Ok, you can stand next to me, as long as you don't<br>talk about it."<br>155.   Excuse me, I don't want you to think I'm ridiculous or anything, but<br>you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I just felt like<br>I had to tell you."<br>156.   Why don't you surprise your roommate and not come home tonight?<br>157.   Hey, I know you! You were Miss Maryland last year, weren't you?<br>158.   I can sense that you're a terrific lover, and it intimidates me a<br>little.<br>159.   I know a great way to burn off the 300 calories in that pastry you<br>just ate.<br>160.   When she asks, for a match.<br>How about the hair on my head and the hair between your legs?<br>161.   A women asks, "Excuse me, do you have the time?"<br>You: "Do you have the energy?"<br>162.   At the office copy machine.  "Reproducing eh?"  "Can I help?"<br>163.   Say mother, want another? (if she has kids)<br>164.   You see my friend over there? [Point to friend who sheepishly waves<br>from afar]  He wants to know if YOU think I'M cute.<br>165.   [Lick your finger, then touch you and your "friend's" shoulder] How<br>about you and I go back to my place and get out of these wet<br>clothes?<br>166.   My face is leaving in 10 minutes. Be on it.<br>167.   Hey I am a wrestler, let me take you down.<br>168.   Those are nice jeans, do you think I could get in them?<br>169.   What do you say we go back to my room and do some math:  Add a<br>bed, subtract our clothes, divide your legs, and multiply.<br>170.   I'll cook you dinner if you cook me breakfast.<br>171.   Wow! Are those real?<br>172.   Hey babe, wanna make an easy fifty bucks?<br>173.   You've got to refer me to your plastic surgeon.<br>174.   I have had a really bad day and it always makes me feel better to see<br>a pretty girl smile. So, would you smile for me?<br>175.   Do you take it up the *ss?<br>176.   Is that a tic-tac in your shirt pocket or are you just glad to see<br>me?<br>177.   What would you do if I kissed you right now?<br>178.   I'm drunk.<br>179.   You know, I'd really love to f*ck your brains out, but it appears<br>someone beat me to it.<br>180.   Ever tried those weird prickly condoms?<br>181.   Hey baby, let's go back to my place and get something straight<br>between us.<br>182.   Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk by again?<br>183.   (Use index finger to call someone over then say) I made you come<br>with one finger, imagine what I could do with my whole hand.<br>184.   I'll suck you so hard that you'll have to pick the sheets out of<br>your *ss when I'm finished.<br>185.   Will you marry me and have my children?<br>186.   I want to thank you for [insert any event here], grab your ankles<br>b*tch!<br>187.   Ya know, if we cut your arms off, you'd look just like Venus de Milo.<br>189.   Hey, baby, wanna lock crotches and swap gravy?<br>190.   That shirt's very becoming on you. If I were on you, I'd be coming<br>too.<br>191.   Can I see your tan lines?<br>192.   I'm not trying anything, I always put my hands there.<br>193.   You know how they say skin is the largest organ? Not in my case.<br>194.   (leaning over to whisper) I think about you when I masturbate.<br>195.   I'm gonna have sex with you tonight so, you might as well be there.<br>196.   I'll bet you $50 I could get all your clothes off in 30 seconds<br>197.   I'm sorry I'm an artist and it's my job to stare at beautiful women.<br>198.   Hi. You'll do.<br>199.   Nice to meet you, I'm (your name) and you are...gorgeous!<br>200.   Your name is Sandra, huh? Can I call you Sandy? Really, what time?<br>201.   Were you in Boy Scouts? Because you sure have tied my heart in a knot.<br>202.   Have you seen (any movie)? Would you like to?<br>203.   If I gave you a sexy negligee, would there be anything in it for me?<br>204.   If you and I were squirrels, could I bust a nut in your hole?<br>205.   That dress looks great on you...as a matter of fact, so would I.<br>206.   (With hands on shoulders) Oh, those are shoulder blades, I thought<br>they were wings.<br>207.   Pardon me, are you in heat?!<br>208.   Are you O.K.? Because heaven's a long fall from here.<br>209.   You know, I never was to good at math...like if I put you and I<br>together, I'd get 69.<br>210.   You have pretty eyeballs. Of course they'd be better if they were<br>eyeing my pretty balls.<br>211.   You know the more I drink, the prettier you get!<br>212.   You're good at math right? Is 69 a perfect square?<br>213.   Was your father a farmer? Because you sure have grown some nice<br>melons!<br>214.   Am I dead, Angel? Cause this must be heaven!<br>215.   Hey Baby! I'd like to wrap your legs around my head and wear you<br>like a feed bag!<br>216.   Hey Baby! I'd like to use your thighs as earmuffs.<br>217.   Is there an airport nearby or is that just my heart taking off?<br>218.   When she asks, "What do you think of this (dress, sweater,<br>blouse, etc.)" Say: I like nothing better.<br>219.   At the dinner table, if you eat together, pick up the bread and ask,<br>"Wanna roll?"<br>210.   That's a really nice smile you've got, shame that's not all you are<br>wearing.<br>211.   Ask girl if she likes jewelry. Then grab your nuts and say,<br>"Then suck this, it's a gem!"<br>212.   You're 'No Parking' right? Just trying to guess your sign.<br>213.   (Good looking waitress pouring a drink) Say when!<br>As soon as I finish this drink.<br>214.   Lie down. I think I love you.<br>215.   What's a nice girl like you doing with a face like that?<br>216.   My lenses turn dark in the sunshine of your love.<br>217.   My friend and I have a bet that you won't take off you blouse in a<br>public place.<br>218.   Can you believe that just a few hours ago we'd never even been to<br>bed together?<br>219.   Was your father a mechanic? Then how did you get such a finely<br>tuned body?<br>220.   Have you ever kissed a rabbit between the ears?<br>(Pull your pockets inside out....) Would you like to?<br>221.   If it's true that we are what we eat, then I could be you by morning.<br>222.   I think I could fall madly in bed with you.<br>223.   You: Tickle your *ss with a feather?<br>Her: What?!<br>You: I said 'Particular nice weather?'!<br>224.   Hey baby, wanna play train conductor? OK. You sit on my face<br>and I'll Chew, chew, chew! (choo!)<br>225.   Hey baby, wanna play lion? OK. You go kneel right there and I'll<br>throw you my meat.<br>226.   Do you know the difference between my penis and a chicken leg?<br>No??? Well, let's go on a picnic and find out!<br>227.   Oh, you're a bird watcher....(Whip out your unit and ask) Well,<br>would you take this for a swallow?<br>228.   Stand back, I'm a police officer! You go call for backup and I'll<br>frisk her!<br>229.   Do you have a library card? Good, cause I wanna check you out!<br>230.   Your warm eyes melt the iciness of my heart.<br>231.   (At church during a sermon) (Put your arm around your gal...)<br>Honey, I don't know where he is....(motioning to the preacher)<br>but I do know I'm here with you.<br>232.   Baby, you look better and better each day...and tonight, you look<br>like tomorrow!<br>233.   Here's a quarter....call your roommate and tell her you won't be<br>coming home tonight!<br>234.   Hey baby, whatdya say we go behind that rock and get a little<br>boulder?!?<br>235.   Go up to a girl in a bar, and slip your arm around her, and say,<br>"Hi Kate!"<br>She says, "I'm not Kate!" And you say, as your hand slips a<br>little lower, "But you sure feel like her!"<br>236.   She: Gee, I really enjoyed myself tonight!<br>He: Me too. Maybe we could let our bodies enjoy each other<br>sometime!<br>237.   You know, I would die happy if I saw you naked just once!<br>238.   What's your favorite position on extramarital sex?<br>239.   I'm really sorry about Al. It was a lovely funeral. You look<br>ravishing in black, did you know that? What you need now<br>is a nice backrub. Are the straps  too tight, darling? How<br>tragic. How very, very tragic<br>240.   I've got an itch honey. Lower. Lower. Ahhh.<br>241.   I have only three months to live...<br>242.   Hey baby, what's your sign? All you can eat?<br>243.   In the produce department: "How can you tell if these things are<br>ripe?"<br>244.   Don't worry about it. Nothing that you've ever done before counts.<br>The only thing that matters is that we're together.<br>245.   I know milk does a body good, but baby, how much have you been<br>drinking?<br>246.   Your daddy must be a drug dealer, cuz you're dope.<br>247.   Hey, don't I know you? Yeah, you're the girl with the beautiful smile.<br>248.   Have you always been this cute, or did you have to work at it?<br>249.   Hi. I suffer from amnesia. Do I come here often?<br>250.   As she's leaving....Hey aren't you forgetting something?<br>She: What?<br>Me!<br>251.   Have you run into any trees lately? Then how bout a root!<br>252.   If you want me, don't shake me, or wake me, just take me.<br>253.   Want to see my stamp collection?<br>254.   Want to come see my HARD DRIVE? I promise it isn't 3.5 inches<br>and it ain't floppy.<br>255.   Hi, do you want to have my children? (assuming the answer is 'no') ,<br>OK then, can we just practice?<br>256.   Excuse me, you have some lipstick on your tooth, mind if I lick it<br>off?<br>257.   Do you know how to use a whip?<br>258.   Do you wash your panties with Windex? Cuz I keep seeing myself in<br>them.<br>259.   Are those space pants? Cuz your *ss is out of this world!<br>260.   How do you like your eggs cooked? Why? Well I just wanted know<br>what to make for you in the morning!<br>261.   Baby, somebody better call God, cuz he's missing an angel!<br>262.   Hi, wanna f*ck?<br>Her: No!<br>Mind lying down while I have one?<br>263.   Baby, I'm an American Express lover....you shouldn't go home<br>without me!<br>264.   Baby, I'm a Nike lover....just do it.<br>265.   Hi, my name is "Milk." I'll do your body good.<br>266.   Excuse me, maam, is that dress felt? Would you like it to be?<br>267.   I'm sorry, were you talking to me?<br>Her: No.<br>Well then, please start.<br>268.   I've got the ship, you've got the harbor...what say we tie up for the<br>night?<br>269.   Would you like to come over to my place later? You can bring some<br>friends because my face seats five.<br>270.   Wanna go halves in a baby?<br>271.   I hear you like to sing.<br>Her: Yeah...<br>(Whip out your pud) Well, then step up to the mike!<br>272.   Beauty is only a light switch away...<br>273.   Hey baby, are you a glover? NO? Well, I am, wanna wear me?<br>274.   I hope you know CPR, cuz you take my breath away!<br>275.   Hey baby, you must be a light switch, cuz every time I see you, you<br>turn me on!<br>276.   Stand still so I can pick you up!<br>277.   Hi, we're taking a survey and I need your phone number. If you give<br>it to me, I'll call you and tell you the results.<br>278.   I didn't know that angels could fly so low!<br>279.   Excuse me, but I think I dropped something!!! MY JAW!!<br>280.   Do you like music?(Yes) Good, I've got a great stereo in my car!<br>281.   Are you looking for Mr. Right, or Mr. Right Now?<br>282.   Girl, you look so good, I could put you on a plate and sop you up<br>with a biscuit!<br>283.   Excuse me, I am about to go masturbate and needed a name to<br>go with the face.<br>284.   Pardon me, but are those stretch marks around your mouth?<br>285.   Do you hula?<br>286.   I like your butt, can I wear it as a hat?<br>287.   Pardon me, but are you a screamer or a moaner?<br>288.   I think I can die happy now, cause I've just seen a piece of<br>heaven.<br>289.   Baby, you must be a broom, cause you just swept me off my<br>feet.<br>290.   Baby, you're so sweet, you put Hershey's outta business.<br>291.   Go up to a girl at a bar or a dance and ask her "do you want<br>a f*ck (wait for a second gauging her reaction)<br>...ing drink.<br>292.   Go up to a girl, ask her: "Do you know what winks and screws<br>like a tiger?" She says no.<br>Then wink.<br>293.   Wasn't I supposed to eat you somewhere?<br>294.   Excuse me do fries come with that shake?<br>295.   I'd spend money on you I haven't even made.<br>296.   I would give you more money than a show dog could jump over.<br>297.   Baby, you look good coming AND going!<br>298.   I'd marry your cat just to get in the family.<br>299.   I can't decide if you are a better person than you are a woman or<br>you are a better woman than you are a person.<br>300.   Well hello there! How you screwin; glad to eat ya!<br>301.   I'm not drunk, I'm just intoxicated by you.<br>302.   Excuse me, miss, do you give head to strangers?<br>No.<br>Well, then, allow me to introduce myself.<br>303.   If this bar is a meat market, you must be the prime rib.<br>304.   You look like my third wife.<br>She: Oh, how many time have you been married?<br>Twice.<br>305.   Take an ice cube to the bar, smash it, and say, "Now that I've<br>broken the ice, will you sleep with me?"<br>306.   I play the field, and it looks like I just hit a home run with you.<br>307.   You know what I like about you? My arms.<br>308.   What did you say? Oh, I thought you were talking to me.<br>309.   So, what are the chances that we can engage in anything more<br>than just conversation?<br>310.   You make my software turn to hardware!<br>311.   As long as I have a face, you'll have a place to sit.<br>322.   Was you father an alien? Because there's nothing else like you<br>on earth!<br>323.   Baby, I'm no Fred Flintstone, but I can make your Bedrock!<br>324.   Hey baby, let's play house, you can be the door and I'll slam you!<br>325.   Would you touch me so I can tell my friends I've been touched<br>by an angel?<br>326.   Hello, I'm a thief, and I'm here to steal your heart.<br>327.   You must be a hell of a thief 'cause you stole my heart from across<br>the room<br>328.   There are 256 bones in the human body. How'd ya like one more?<br>329.   You look like a hooker I knew in Fresno.<br>330.   You're ugly but you intrigue me.<br>331.   I had to find out what kind of woman would go out dressed like that.<br>332.   (Wait til the end of the evening when everything is real hazy and<br>alcohol soaked, walk up to someone you've never met and say, )<br>come on, we're leaving.<br>333.   You remind me of my dead ex-girlfriend.<br>334.   Do you think I could borrow that dress/bustier sometime?<br>335.   I found this [lace glove, rosary, etc.] on the floor at the club last<br>night, is it yours? Well, if it's not, I'd like to give it to you<br>anyway.<br>336.   Is that your boyfriend? I think you can do better than that!<br>337.   I keep all of my most important poems and drawings in this little<br>book. And I'd like you to have it because they're mostly about you. 338.<br>Excuse me, miss? Hi, I'm doing a scavenger hunt for my fraternity<br>rush, and one of the things on my list is a umm....weird chick.<br>339.   We're going to dance to one song, then go back to my apartment<br>and f*ck.<br>340.   By the way, are you 23?<br>341.   Roses are red, tulips are not, do you wanna go home with me and f*ck<br>342.   Just wanted to tell you I love the way you dance.<br>343.   Hi. Are you cute?<br>344.   So, come back to my place, and if you don't like it I swear I'll give<br>you a full refund.<br>345.   So you're a girl huh?<br>346.   Do you like food?<br>347.   Do you like music?<br>348.   what lovely eyes you have... I used to have some just like them.<br>349.   Blow me if I'm wrong, but you wanna f*ck me.<br>350.   Are you here alone or am I going to have to kill someone to win your<br>affection?<br>351.   I'd like to tie you to a rafter and f*ck you up and down.<br>352.   Would you please come home with me and tie me up...<br>353.   Wow.<br>354.   That outfit must make a lot of noise in the dryer, huh.<br>355.   (While looking at someone and waiting for them to say anything)<br>Oh, I'm doing fine!  And you?<br>356.  Aren't we supposed to get together for a candlelight dinner later<br>tonight?<br>357.  Hi, I just moved to this city and was wondering if you could recommend<br>a good restaurant here.  Would you also like to join me?<br>358.  My drink is getting lonely, so would you like to join me with one?<br>359.  Excuse me, but would you like an orally stimulated orgasm?<br>360.  Hey!  I like your shoes!  Do you like mine??<br>361.  walk up to a girl, put your hands on her shoulders, and say, "I'd<br>like to get something straight between us."  and then look at<br>your crotch<br>362.  I had sex with someone last night.  Was that you?<br>363.  Can I taste your drink/dish?  (Then lean over and kiss her.)<br>364.  Wow!  Are you really as beautiful as you seem or do you remind<br>me of myself?<br>365.  Can I please be your slave tonight?<br>366.  You should be someone's wife.<br>367.  What can I do to make you sleep with me?<br>368.  Want to come into the garden see my big hard cucumbers?<br>369.  Would you like to come to a party in my toolshed?<br>370.  Would you sleep with me for 20 million dollars?<br>She (sheepishly): Yes.<br>Well then, would you sleep with me for 20 cents?<br>She: No, what kind of woman do you think I am?<br>We've established what kind of woman that you are, we're just<br>haggling over the price.<br>371.  You know, I've *always* wanted to sleep with you.<br>372.   If you spot a girl waiting in a restaurant/theater/club for someone,<br>go up to her and say,<br>"If he doesn't show up, I'll be right over here."<br>--OR--<br>Waiting to be picked up?<br>373.  Picture this, you, me, bubble baths, and a bottle of champagne.<br>374.  God must have been in a very good mood the day we met.<br>375.  Be unique and different, say yes.<br>376.  If you ever want to see your children again, you'll do what I want.<br>377.  Would you like to be in movies?<br>378.  Excuse me, but you have a beep on your nose.<br>What?<br>reach up and gently squeeze her nose) BEEP.<br>379.  I wonder what our children will look like.<br>380.  Shall we talk or continue flirting from a distance?<br>381.  Take off that dress and f*ck my brains out, you cave newt.<br>382.  Did you know that the word 'motel' spelled backwards means 'letom'?<br>383.  Let's have a party and invite your pants to come on down.<br>384.  If you want me, don't shake me, or wake me, just take me.<br>385.  Want to see my stamp collection?<br>386.  Don't you know me from somewhere?<br>387.  Congratulations!  You've been voted "Most Beautiful Girl In This<br>Room" and the grand prize is a night with me!<br>388.  Brrr!  My hands are cold.  Can I warm them in your heaving breasts?<br>389.  Your legs look cold.  Do you want me to warm them up?<br>390.  Hey!  Ya wanna try out my new 'Home Artificial Insemination Kit?'<br>391.  I am writing a new algorithm, and I need some test data.  What are<br>your measurements?<br>392.  (Walk into her chest) "If they weren't sooo large, it wouldn't have<br>happened.<br>393.  Are you busy tonight at 3:00 A.M.?<br>394.  Love is like a rug.  So you can walk all over me and lie on me.<br>395.  Chicks dig me.  I wear colored underwear.<br>396.  Excuse me, do you have change for a $1000 bill?<br>397.  Wouldn't we look cute on a wedding cake together?<br>398.  Will you marry me for just one night?<br>399.  I'm an organ donor, need anything?<br>400.  Hey baby, I want to lick your thighs.<br>401.  Did the sun come out or did you just smile at me?<br>402.  Just where do those legs of yours end?<br>403.  Nice socks.  Can I try them on after we have sex?<br>404.  Uh, oh.  My parents met at a place like this.  Let's get the hell<br>out of here.<br>405.  Does my breath smell okay?<br>406.  You are so beautiful that I would crawl ten miles on my hands and<br>knees through broken glass just to jerk off in your shadow.<br>407.  You are so fine that I'd eat your sh*t just to see where it came from.<br>408.  If I could be anything, I'd love to be your bathwater.<br>409.  Here's your chance to get to know me.<br>410.  Do you mind if I stare at you up close instead of from across the<br>room?<br>411.  You are the reason men fall in love.<br>412.  I was, am, and will forever be crazy about you.<br>413.  I just had to come talk with you.  Sweetness is my weakness.<br>414.  Are you free tonight or will it cost me?<br>415.  Got a soggy bun for a lonely weenie?<br>416.  You know, you might be asked to leave soon.  You're making the other<br>women look really bad.<br>417.  Hi, I'm new to this country and you are the prettiest sight I've see<br>so far. Can you give me a tour of your body?<br>418.  You're the one I've been saving this drink/seat/ticket to Hawaii for.<br>419.  Oh no, I'm choking!  I need mouth to mouth, quick!<br>420.  You know, I'm not just an interesting person, I have a nice body, too.<br>421.  What's a slut like you doing in a classy joint like this??<br>422.  What time do you have to be back in heaven?<br>423.  So there you are!  I've been looking all over for YOU, the girl of my<br>dreams!<br>424.  You are just truly absolutely beautiful!  Can you cook and clean also?<br>425.  "My that shirt is becomming on you, 'course if I were on you, I'd be<br>cumming too!"<br><br></div>
