As long as there is 1 guy that can break your sterotype (however you spell it), what you just said is nonsense.<br><br>Perhaps you have not met "other" type of guys yet.<br><br>I can also come up with a generalisation that sg gals are all flat chested, B cup only act like they are amy yip... Average looks only act like they are princess, keep on trying to hook ang mo... So ugly still want to act like the whole world looking at them...<br><br>Everytime during lab session, gals always whining about lab being so difficult to do, want guys to do for them, teach them still dunno hw to set up circuit, how? Only know how to study for exams dunno how to do practical.<br><br>I'm sure you can see how lopsided my statements are. Of course, there are gals who are so knowledgeable that I have to approach them for help... IT is no longer a "guy thing" thanks to them.<br><br>The person that taught me programming is a gal.<br><br>I have had the privelege of meeting the best AND  the worse of the fairer sex...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha! You r SO wrong. Not all guys are like what u've described, including me. And I can confidently say that I'm 101% not like ur decription or perception of local guys. I'm a bit different. How? tt's 4 u to find out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And by the way, do u know why some uglier guys can have the pretty girls around them? Because they are the ones with confidence, good self-image and possess some sense of humour, at least. Women aren't attracted to looks as much as the way a man carries himself.<br><br>So let me ask u a question. How do u carry yourself? Since you're stereotyping people like this, how can u be open enuff to accept others who r not like u? Hence I dun think this is attractive to many though... and I can say that no girls will fall for u if u carry this sort of attitude towards life.</div>
