              <p>The Earth is facing a very critical danger NOW! ( Global Warming )<br><br>-Increase in temperature causing Melting Ice at the poles, Rising water level.<br>-Rapid increase in disasters over the past years.<br>-Increasing Greenhouse Gas emissions harmful to us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Each and everyone of us can do our part to SAVE THE ONLY EARTH we have.<br>( Its either to act now or never before its TOO LATE)</p>
              <p>-Go Veg and START eating LESS meats. (Over 60% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from livestock) This factor contributes the most to global warming.</p>
              <p><br>-Save Resources and RECYCLE (Cut down on unneccessary Electricity, Water and MORE)</p>
              <p><br>-Travel efficiently ( Use public transport or share a car. Eating a burger = enough car fuel to drive a car for 20 miles)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, Everybody should realize that <br>            Money - Useless<br>            House/Car - Useless<br>            Power - Useless<br>            Families and Friends - Useless</p>
              <p>Everybody will be gone without the Earth. So everyone should realize the importance and the urgency of saving the Earth now.</p>

              <p><br>The intention of this tread is mainly to let the public know more about saving our Earth and the critical situation the Earth is facing right now. I don't see any sort of advertisement on the video website. Urges everyone to spend a few minutes watching the video and u will understand the situation now so that u can do your part.</p>
              <p>Strictly no advertisement or whatsoever. If there is any advertisement or whatsoever feel free to remove the tread. I am here just to make more people realise the situation now.</p>

              <p>most of the livestock that we are consuming are from the farms. the farmers rear them for our consumptions. less demand = less supply. farmers feed the animals with food and then we eat the animals. do you know that the food that the farmer use to feed one animal can feed many people if we were to consume the food directly ?</p>
              <p>i am not a vegetarian but i try my best to eat less meat. watch the video below about how we obtain our meat. it is cruelty.</p>

              <p>since when vegetarianism is preventing you from baptism ? just because god said animals are created for consumptions ? this is exactly what is preventing me from believing christianity because animals do feel pain just like humans when they are being slaughtered. god is not so cruel to create something that bleed just like humans for consumptions. go to the slaughtering house and see for yourself and you will question animals are they really created for consumptions ?</p>
              <p>don't tell me you are quitting buddhism because you are not a true buddhist in the first place.</p>

              <p>plants, fungi and bacteria are different. they do not bleed like humans, do not have senses like humans, ears, nose, mouth, eyes etc. plants do not struggle when being chopped. animals are like humans fear of death and pain. they are like humans, care for their young. they did not let us eat them willingly.</p>
