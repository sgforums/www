              <p>ACCA is association of chartered accountants.<br>http://singapore.accaglobal.com/</p>
              <p>ACCA qualification is a "professional qualification" and is very recognised.<br>An ACCA qualification is like ATPL(Airline transport pilot licence) for commercial pilots, not sure if it falls under diploma/degrees</p>
              <p>I believe your aim is to be a certified public accountant(CPA). <img src="http://corp.icpas.org.sg/media/56972/pathway%20to%20cpa%20singapore_600x453.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="453">Taken from here:<br>http://corp.icpas.org.sg/qualifications/pathway-to-cpa-singapore.aspx</p>
              <p> Also from here: http://www.icpasmembers.org.sg/r_qual.asp?key=nm , you can see ACCA is one of the recognised professional qualifications for you to become a certified public accountant in singapore</p>
              <p> A diploma may not directly qualify you as an accountant. Based on <a href="http://sp.edu.sg/wps/portal/vp-spws/!ut/p/c1/hZBLr4IwEIV_UqctLXUJdoDCBXyAChtDjDHc-LiLGxP_ve0O8TWz_OacMzOkJbbP3bU_dP_95dwdyYa0clsnAlkkPCiFUmBKlXmqWjEvFpY3Ax7TBMEAz3L0OQMjH9U4t5QufF3GCAgwUqsqcu55wdJMcBbAl-y123aYrlc2M1EhZ5MApuCPeFmlwjoscRLijGWKfuQqH_MX1zkOb8rt_6AHnkrnL5dx-EMx4p95ONY__6dILqc9aUjrD6ZqSe1UoJk2GoopJc1xf-h2N_J3qjfQm978evUdmb6Hbg!!/dl2/d1/L0lJSklna2shL0lCakFBTXlBQkVSQ0lBISEvWUZOQTFOSTUwLXchLzdfVUg1RTJGNTQwOFU2MTBJT0FEMkRJRDBOQzE!/?WCM_PORTLET=PC_7_UH5E2F5408U610IOAD2DID0NC1_WCM&amp;WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/Lib-SPWS/site-spwebsite/future+students/full+time+diploma/diploma+in+accountancy+%28dac%29+jae+code+s75-your+future+%28future+students-courses-business-full-time+diploma-accountancy%29">SP's Diploma in accountancy course</a> , You can see from the website that after completing the diploma, you are only granted partial exemptions from examinations in ACCA and other professional bodies</p>

              <p><br>ACCA is a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">worldwide</span></strong> recognised chartered accounting body. it is not a diploma or degree. it's a professional qualification, even masters cannot compete with it. the first 9 papers of the qualification are easy peasy. but the last 5 papers (3 core + 2 option papers) are killer papers. many students are trapped at the 3rd level (i'm one of them) and find it difficult to give it up because we have invested so much (time and money) in it. do not forget you still have to pay for the exemption fees (equivalent to the exam fees) if you are exempted for the first few papers.<br><br>after you have completed all the exams, you will be an affiliate for 3 years before becoming a member. by then the member fee would be much higher than your annual student fee. do bear in mind that all fees are quoted in pound sterling.</p>
              <p>and if you're taking SGP variant papers, you also have to pay ICPAS the annual fee. all these fees are payable for lifetime.</p>
              <p>i hope i have enlightened you. feel free to ask me should you have more doubts. will try my best to help out.</p>
              <p>cheers~</p>

              yes you can proceed to ACCA with O level. But you'll be starting from first paper. If you take ACCA after degree, you may be exempted a few papers, depending on your modules in degree/ diploma program. As for the fees, you can check at ACCA website.
              
              Fees payable to ACCA is one cost, don't forget you have to pay tuition centre for the lessons you attend. In higher professional level, tuition + revision fees can cost up to $1k per paper, depending on individual tuition centres. it's optional to sign up for tuition classes, but I believe you would not want to risk retake exams over and over again.
              
              By the way, ACCA is not all about accounting. the syllabus also includes busines strategy, financial management, audit and tax.

              <p>Hi!</p>
              <p>Where are you going to get ACCA? I heard that in the UK there are good courses that provide <a href="http://www.lsbf.org.uk/programmes/professional/acca.html">ACCA</a>. I'm going to pass it next year so I'm considering the variants.</p>
