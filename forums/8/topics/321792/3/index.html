              <p><br> maybe u haven't read my reply clearly..</p>
              <p>i did mention it's an early preparation of family etc...and the
              earlier we learn to take up these stuffs, the faster and sooner we
              can lessen our own bunden in future..</p>
              <p>imagine when there's a rush of buying of home, marriage,
              child,,,new wife..4 problems one shot come together..it'll make ur
              head blow man..especially those shot-gun marriage..poor thing..</p>
              <p>well..i've being living with my mom since my birth..and i found
              the common problem of guys having to live with their silbings
              problem already harassing me for more than a few years
              already...</p>
              <p>arguements, disagreements..don't even talk..</p>
              <p>well the only stuffs we do talk is to talk back and interupt
              each other's lecture section..lol..</p>
              <p>i've got enough of my family's bad habits..</p>
              <p>rather than living off my mom, and having to like make and do
              with what elder sister and brother..i'll just move out for good..as
              soon as i can earn my own money..</p>
              <p>if nothing goes wrong..i'll start off by working
              home-based..thus having a comfortable home has always being on my
              mind..in fact a home office based type of home..</p>
              <p>get what i mean..</p>
              <p>we all gotta face up to reality and take responsiblitilies where
              it's due..so why not take it up early and show our parents that we
              can take good care of ourshelves thus they can have a peace of mind
              and not worry about us.</p>
              </div>

              <p>along with some peers, i've circled around the blocks between having
              to tolerate living arrangements at home, tolerate parents who quarrel,
              tolerate lack of space with siblings and living alone and with friends.
              so i suppose it really differs from one to the other.</p>
              <p>these things are different for everybody.</p>
              <p>moving out for a bit is quite liberating, gives you fresh
              perspective. i've had some rough years with my family from my late
              teens to early adulthood, 18-22, but my dad got sick afterwards and
              died, sibling got married.</p>
              <p>looking back on what happened,
              whether we would have experienced the turbulence while living together
              that we did had those not been the circumstances (living together), i
              don't know.</p>
              <p>regardless, i think everyone goes through the phase
              of change and wanting space of their own but for me, i'm lucky my mom
              and i are close now and i'd like to think that we're living together
              not because financially, we need to, but because i want to. splitting
              the bills helps me financially as well.</p>
              <p>so it really depends on
              your circumstances, space can be fabulous until you figure out what you
              want and what you eventually need. sometimes separation can be a good
              thing too.</p>
              <p>i know that from a pride perpective it troubles
              some of us to think that we're of a certain age and should be out of
              the nest. but me thinks, really, that must live alone stuff is
              predominantly a bunch of Western bullshit.</p>
              <p>as for responsibilities, heh, if given a choice, i'll rather never grow up.</p>
