              <p>Got good and bad la... Good thing is that u can have all the freedom and space u want. I also thought of staying alone sometimes, when I can live in peace.</p>
              <p>Bad thing is u have to settle everything for urself - food, housework, bills etc etc. Living alone is never easy I think.</p>

              <p><br> well, at least by staying alone, it shows that the person can
                          really take care of himself/herself if the place is neat and tidy
                          rite?</p>
              <p>with the fact that living alone is a sign of financially
                          independent isn't is?</p>
              <p>the only thing which i feel is that gotta do all the housework

              <p>when you cannot find a belt, forget where you left your jeans, socks or misplace a cell phone, no one else will know, no one you can blame, no one can help call to find it.</p>
              <p>the minor inconvenience and chores add up. weekdays are spent working. if you work late, kopitiams are closed. when you come home, all you want is home cooked food waiting on the table. but since you live alone and you have no maid, there is no food. so LL order mc donalds or eat bread or maggie mee.</p>
              <p>by friday night you've worked so hard, relished in so much bad food and silence, you  just want to catch up with friends so you go out late into the night, come home, crash. wake up on saturday.</p>
              <p>dedicate saturday mornings to running errands, to banks etc. afternoons to cleaning up your place, car, dishes, laundry. if you're lucky you'll finish everything in 7 hours.</p>
              <p>as for sundays, if disciplined enough, then will stock up on things like toiletries and maggi mee, groceries, shampoo. open up all your bills, letter, clear all necessary paperwork.</p>
              <p>this kind of independence, the later it arrives the better. it's grown up responsibilities, no one likes them.</p>
              <p>with a house pet, additional responsibilities, more time consuming.</p>
              <p>why would anybody want to show that they can take care of themselves? hehehe... cleaning the toilet and dust from the fan is not as glam as it seems leh.</p>
              <p>won't be long before you start feeling haggard and wonder whether you've officially become an uncle or auntie, worst if you start behaving like your own parents.</p>
              <p>you hate it, resent it, and want to join your friends at the beach on sunday... so suddenly, all you want is have your mom or dad do everything for ya the way it used to be!</p>

              <p>When you cannot find a sock or your favorite pair of jeans, and you search high and low for it. Only to find it under the bed and you chuckle, thinking how silly you were.</p>
              <p>And every night after work, you come home to your quiet solace - it might be a drag trying to tidy things up but you know you're happy. Almost 7pm and you're still fixing your own dinner, simple pasta with meatballs... Nothing extravagant but still very palatable!</p>
              <p>Friday night is nights out with your pals... After some merry making, you return to a place you can call your own, sit by the window with a glass of port with soft music in the background and singing a toast to the nighttime skies!</p>
              <p>Saturday might be a little hectic with the errands! Bank, supermarketing and probably drop by your folks to spend time a little. Saturday evening, you can choose to hang out with pals.. Recieve guests or just coop up at home before the tube!</p>
              <p>Sun... Rest and relax! Some housework, maybe! :P </p>

              <p>And every night after work, you come home to your quiet solace -
                      it might be a drag trying to tidy things up but you know you're
                      happy.</p>

              <p>why would you be happy knowing you have still have to work (tidy up the place) after work itself?</p>
              <p>it's 8pm, not 7pm. at 7pm you're still stuck in a traffic jam because some mofo caused a chain accident on the right lane.</p>

              <p>so technically speaking, you start fixing dinner at 8.15pm. boil the water, 5 minutes. Make meatballs, another 15minutes. by the time you sit down with food, it's 9pm, just in time for the 9pm drama serial. simple meal, but all that cream and tomato sauce on the pan needs cleaning. so you dump it at the sink overnight and think, great, accumulating more housework.</p>

              <p>when you cannot find a belt, forget where you left your jeans,
              socks or misplace a cell phone, no one else will know, no one you
              can blame, no one can help call to find it.</p>
              <p>the minor inconvenience and chores add up. weekdays are spent
              working. if you work late, kopitiams are closed. when you come
              home, all you want is home cooked food waiting on the table. but
              since you live alone and you have no maid, there is no food. so LL
              order mc donalds or eat bread or maggie mee.</p>
              <p>by friday night you've worked so hard, relished in so much bad
              food and silence, you  just want to catch up with friends so
              you go out late into the night, come home, crash. wake up on
              saturday.</p>
              <p>dedicate saturday mornings to running errands, to banks etc.
              afternoons to cleaning up your place, car, dishes, laundry. if
              you're lucky you'll finish everything in 7 hours.</p>
              <p>as for sundays, if disciplined enough, then will stock up on
              things like toiletries and maggi mee, groceries, shampoo. open up
              all your bills, letter, clear all necessary paperwork.</p>
              <p>this kind of independence, the later it arrives the better. it's
              grown up responsibilities, no one likes them.</p>
              <p>with a house pet, additional responsibilities, more time
              consuming.</p>
              <p>why would anybody want to show that they can take care of
              themselves? hehehe... cleaning the toilet and dust from the fan is
              not as glam as it seems leh.</p>
              <p>won't be long before you start feeling haggard and wonder
              whether you've officially become an uncle or auntie, worst if you
              start behaving like your own parents.</p>
              <p>you hate it, resent it, and want to join your friends at the
              beach on sunday... so suddenly, all you want is have your mom or
              dad do everything for ya the way it used to be!</p>

              <p>i did mention it's an early preparation of family etc...and the earlier we learn to take up these stuffs, the faster and sooner we can lessen our own bunden in future..</p>
              <p>imagine when there's a rush of buying of home, marriage, child,,,new wife..4 problems one shot come together..it'll make ur head blow man..especially those shot-gun marriage..poor thing..</p>
              <p>well..i've being living with my mom since my birth..and i found the common problem of guys having to live with their silbings problem already harassing me for more than a few years already...</p>
              <p>arguements, disagreements..don't even talk..</p>
              <p>well the only stuffs we do talk is to talk back and interupt each other's lecture section..lol..</p>
              <p>i've got enough of my family's bad habits..</p>
              <p>rather than living off my mom, and having to like make and do with what elder sister and brother..i'll just move out for good..as soon as i can earn my own money..</p>
              <p>if nothing goes wrong..i'll start off by working home-based..thus having a comfortable home has always being on my mind..in fact a home office based type of home..</p>
              <p>get what i mean..</p>
              <p>we all gotta face up to reality and take responsiblitilies where it's due..so why not take it up early and show our parents that we can take good care of ourshelves thus they can have a peace of mind and not worry about us.</p>
