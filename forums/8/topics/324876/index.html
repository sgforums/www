              There's always people around with an over inflated ego and unrealistic expectations.
              
              The OP's story reminds me of a case a few years ago of a Korean lady in the US (surname Kim, I think) who had a personal email that she wrote to a few friends, forwarded around the world, where she basically said the guy she dated had no chance as he didnt have what Singaporeans call the 5 C's (or is it 6 or 7 these days? :) )  The worldwide response was that she was a materialsitic slut.
              
              
              In an ironic twist, in the ensuing aftermath, she was seduced by a guy who had absolutely none of the 5 (or 6 or 7) C's.  
              
              You see, everyone was laying into her, and this guy saw his opportunity to stand out and did the opposite, writing emails supporting her and telling her what she wanted to hear. She fell for him and quickly did the naughty before he stopped seeing her.
              
              I'd pay good money to have learn his skills :)
