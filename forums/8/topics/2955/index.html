            <div class='col-md body'>From a female's point of view, or rather from my own point of view  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> , I personally would prefer my bf to be older than me, and wiser too. Education level, to a certain extent, is important too, coz it will allow both parties to be able to communicate at the same level. I doubt the r/ship will work out if the girl start talking about issues that dun make sense to the guy coz of this famous thing called the MALE EGO...i think u all understand what i mean...this is why education level is not so impt when it is the guy who is better educated...anyway, girls are "supposed" to be less smart than guys rite...<br><br>Another reason why i think it's better for girls to choose older and wiser guys is coz I like my bf to be something like my mentor..someone there to guide me through the way of life, someone to impart his knowledge and experience to me, and someone who is able to take care of me....i doubt many girls would want to be their bf's mothers...at least i personally dun want my bf to think of me as his mom!<br><br></div>
