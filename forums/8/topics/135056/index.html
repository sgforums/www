But in a society like Singapore currently, people are bred to be power or money hungry. They simply wan  more of it which i think is unhealthy. Of all countries i had been , people here are the greediest i had encountered! Yes there in overseas, people want money cars and such. But these things are so cheap over there that they are satisified and accpet it as one of the affordable necessities in life. In Singapore, these things are so ex, people seem to work and manipulate their way thru to attain them. They dont actually realise that what they wanted so much are like peanuts in other countries. The situation here is such that without all these things, they (singaporeans) consider themselves to be poor. But what is their definition of poor if they had a house to stay in, 3 meals to eat , a bed, television ect?<br><br>They dont seem to realise that comparing their situation with someone in a village in New delhi , a farmer is struggling to feed his family with the most basic of necessities<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gentlerock, i dont know which countries u have been to. But the ones i had been to were ok and yes some may practise some racism ect.<br><br>Forgive me if i forgot to add on that it may not be the same for everyone.<br>For eg. i have been speaking from a singaporean point of view. There may be drawbacks on both sides but the Q is which drawback are u and more willing to live by?<br><br>When i went overseas to work. I had been given a car and house.<br>When i told my male colleague here, he was eager and surprised to hear about it. It lifted his spirits and then he was complaining how he has to serve reservist and pass some ippt test every year.And still have to pay for taxes and cant withdraw his CPF money. Although i explained the drawbacks too like some taxes u have to pay like for in eg. Aus. He still insists that so long he can have a car and such he is happy. This goes on to show like i said , it all depends on one's envrionment. As he explained , probably he 's right. Do the maths and it just doesnt add up here in sg -  the amount which goes out of your pocket doesnt justify a living here.<br><br>Gentlerock, if u been born and bred overseas u may not see the difference, bu for a Singaporean guys like my colleague, they think that it is greener on the other side. Like someone  commented just now, views on this topic may be subjective<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the saying is correct "the grass is greener on the other side"<br><br>When u reach there its still "green" like when u saw it from your original place even though it may not be for a resident there.....There are foreigners from India and China willing to get a Singapore citizenship. To them this place probably "green"<br>it all depends on people's mindset views ect. It's psychological.<br><br>if  u would not believie it , I had some singaporean friends when i was overseas. They told me they expereinced a culture shock and miss their family and life back in Sg. So to these people they did rather come back and fight for their life in their homeland than call it quits no matter how tough it might be. Their emotions got the bettter of them hence changing their mindset  Whereas the other case is probably true here locally. People may want to get out but some may return the  like the above scenario while others may just call it quits and stay there<br><br></div>
