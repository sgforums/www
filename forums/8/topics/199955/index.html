            <div class='col-md body'>Shih Lin Night Market. But it's too crowded and big. If you go to Shih Lin Night market, find the food centre and queue up for the chao da Ji Pai (Chicken Chop)<br><br>If you don't feel like squeezing with people, you can go to Rao He Night Market and Tong Hua Night Market. Also got a lot of things to buy.<br>Their things will be slightly better to buy in terms of spaciousness and price. There's a lot of things to eat too.<br><br>Actually along the streets you will also find lu bian tan (Street side stalls where they sell clothes, accessories and food) So don't worry that you have nothing to shop. And of coz the famous Xi Men Ding<br><br>If you want to wash yourself in hot spring (wen quan), it might be summer, still there are people who go there, coz there are good food. *slurps* For hot spring you can go to Yang Ming Shan, and there are some special places there to enjoy the scenery and have some nice coffee.<br><br>The town below yang Ming Shan is Tian Mu. There are some other stuff to walk there too.<br><br>If you don't want to go till Yang Ming Shan, You can consider Bei Tou. There is subway there, but i don't know the actual direction there?<br><br>If you wanna go to clubs and see some shuai ge and mei nu, you can hop to Plush at Jing Hua Cheng, Room 18 at Neo 18(Dunno if i remember the name correctly, Just tell taxi driver the building beside Warner Brothers (Hua Na Wei Xiu), Mint at Taipei 101(The tallest building currently, branded shops inside)<br>Ministry of Sound at Nei Hu. From Taipei city you will see a big, green ferris wheel. That is at NeiHu also. Quite a tourist attraction, because u can see the whole Taipei City at night. It's consider the surburbs of Taipei City, however, you can still take a cab there, just that it might be a little ex.<br><br>Remember to try all the snacks you can, like Oyster Mee Sua (U can Opt for Just mee sua without the oyster or Mee Sua with Intestines only), Yan Su Ji (Salted Fried Crispy Chicken), Yan Sui Ji (Salted White Chicken - My Fav! The only stall that i eat from is at the street beside Huan Ya Qian Gui - Huan Ya Partyworld KTV),  Taiwan Xiang Chang, Ma La Guo (There are a lot of buffet Ma La Steamboat Restaurants around. Just Keep a lookout for 199, 299 or 399 chi dao bao kind of signs or wordings), Smelly Tofu (they really stinks), Xiao Long Bao, If you wake up early, try their breakfast by the Breakfast stall. Ask your hotel lobby where is the nearest ones.<br><br>For breakfast - recommend Dan bing with the condiments you wan, like tuna, egg, ham, bacom etc. Fan Tuan - Ball of rice with ingredients inside (there's salty and sweet, i always choose salty one), Sandwich, toast etc.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>allow me to add in more:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by shirurinu:<br>Shih Lin Night Market. But it's too crowded and big. If you go to Shih Lin Night market, find the food centre and queue up for the chao da Ji Pai (Chicken Chop)<br><br><strong>try to go during the weekdays.. the place is too crowded during the weekends.. remember to try the "guan chai ban!!" </strong><br><br>Actually along the streets you will also find lu bian tan (Street side stalls where they sell clothes, accessories and food) So don't worry that you have nothing to shop. And of coz the famous Xi Men Ding<br><br><strong>xi men ding mostly sell gals stuff.. a lot of sch gals during the afternoon.. big shopping centres r in "dong qui".. remember to go there.. </strong><br><br>If you wanna go to clubs and see some shuai ge and mei nu, you can hop to Plush at Jing Hua Cheng, Room 18 at Neo 18(Dunno if i remember the name correctly, Just tell taxi driver the building beside Warner Brothers (Hua Na Wei Xiu), Mint at Taipei 101(The tallest building currently, branded shops inside)<br>Ministry of Sound at Nei Hu. From Taipei city you will see a big, green ferris wheel. That is at NeiHu also. Quite a tourist attraction, because u can see the whole Taipei City at night. It's consider the surburbs of Taipei City, however, you can still take a cab there, just that it might be a little ex.<br><br><strong>i highly recommend room 18! lots of celebs n models! another club to go is "Luxy"</strong><br><br>Remember to try all the snacks you can, like Oyster Mee Sua (U can Opt for Just mee sua without the oyster or Mee Sua with Intestines only), Yan Su Ji (Salted Fried Crispy Chicken), Yan Sui Ji (Salted White Chicken - My Fav! The only stall that i eat from is at the street beside Huan Ya Qian Gui - Huan Ya Partyworld KTV),  Taiwan Xiang Chang, Ma La Guo (There are a lot of buffet Ma La Steamboat Restaurants around. Just Keep a lookout for 199, 299 or 399 chi dao bao kind of signs or wordings), Smelly Tofu (they really stinks), Xiao Long Bao, If you wake up early, try their breakfast by the Breakfast stall. Ask your hotel lobby where is the nearest ones.<br><br><strong>yes.. remember to try the smell tofu</strong><br><br></blockquote>remember to go these places too<br>-dan shui n fisherman's wharf! (bring ur gf there! very romantic)<br>-jing hua chen (voted the best tourist spot in taipei in a radio poll. yang ming shan was 2nd)<br>-taipei 101 (world's tallest builiding)<br>-chiang kai-shiek memorial hall (learn more abt their ex-president)<br>-long shan temple (the locals told me the temple beri 'ling' one.. its jus beside the "longshan temple mrt station"<br>-"xiao ren guo" &amp; "liu fu chun" (a bit out of the way cos not in taipei city. its near 'hsin zu"<br>-jian hu shan theme park (oso out of the way)<br>-stay at "yuan shan da fan dian" (if u got $$$$!)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
