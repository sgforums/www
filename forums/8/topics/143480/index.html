            <div class='col-md body'>I took the NEL this morning to go Dhoby to change line.<br><br>As the train was rather crowded, I had to stand and in front of me sat a woman in her mid-30s, in casual office attire.<br><br>She sat with her legs crossed such that her left leg popped out thus depriving people of standing space.<br><br>When the train reached Little India, she immediately stood up and tried to force her way to the door, in anticipation of Dhoby Ghaut where no doubt, she was preparing to be the 1st Singaporean woman on a thursay morning at 8.30 am to take the lift at the station.  And mind you, that was like even before the train had left Little India!!<br><br>That's IDIOT NO. 1.<br><br>And then came this old man who wanted to rush for her seat notwithstanding the fact that he was 50m away.  This piece of old shrivelled dry turd didn't even have the courtesy to say "Excuse Me" and just barged past me and landed his boney ass on the seat.<br><br>That's IDIOT NO. 2.<br><br>And did I forget all along the way, there was this young executive man in blue and specs who positioned himself at the front panel of the cabin and tried to act cool all the way to Dhoby Ghaut as if he was the most charming man in Singapore.   He had his briefcase placed in between his legs and placed his hand in his pockets like he was the coolest dude in the train.<br><br>And mind you, I thought he was Mark Lee's brother with his pock-marked face!!<br><br>That's IDIOT NO. 3 for you.<br><br>Then there's IDIOT NO. 4.  A woman. Again.<br><br>At Dhoby Ghaut, when the train door opened she rushed to the lift in competition with IDIOT NO.1 and in the process knocking onto me as I was going the other way to take the staircase.  Didn't even say sorry and gave me that kind of stupid clueless look that you spot on the faces of women queueing up for the opening sale of Mango.<br><br>Just what the heck is wrong with Singaporeans??  Pig swill anyone?<br><br></div>

The rest of the idiots who wanted to barge in also just stood frozen there.  You see, these people are raised on pig swill, you need to show them some true colors.<br><br>The same for those idiots who cannot seem to wait till they get off the escalator to use their hp to SMS but will whip out their HP as they stroll towards the escalator and start pressing here and there and in the process hold up everybody behind.  I'm not being a sexist here but invariably, they are women.
