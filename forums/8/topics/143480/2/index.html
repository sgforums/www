I was on 147 yesterday and the bus was very crowded.  One old Indian stand up from his seat to alight at Serangoon Road.  He couldn't move to the door as it was crowded and he was block.  Another Indian man, this one a young one also alighting but was behind the old man.  Wanted to get to the door quickly, he tried to push the old man.  The old man turned back and raised his voice. " Why are  you pushing ?, Can't you see there are people in front. This is Singapore, not India!!".  The yound man just shake his head like most Indian do when they talk..  I was like laughing lor and it make me realised not all passenger are Singaporean...</div>

And mind you, that was like even before the train had left Little India!!<br><br>That's IDIOT NO. 1.<br><br>And then came this old man who wanted to rush for her seat notwithstanding the fact that he was 50m away.  This piece of old shrivelled dry turd didn't even have the courtesy to say "Excuse Me" and just barged past me and landed his boney ass on the seat.<br><br>That's IDIOT NO. 2.<br><br>And did I forget all along the way, there was this young executive man in blue and specs who positioned himself at the front panel of the cabin and tried to act cool all the way to Dhoby Ghaut as if he was the most charming man in Singapore.   He had his briefcase placed in between his legs and placed his hand in his pockets like he was the coolest dude in the train.<br><br>And mind you, I thought he was Mark Lee's brother with his pock-marked face!!<br><br>That's IDIOT NO. 3 for you.<br><br>Then there's IDIOT NO. 4.  A woman. Again.<br><br>At Dhoby Ghaut, when the train door opened she rushed to the lift in competition with IDIOT NO.1 and in the process knocking onto me as I was going the other way to take the staircase.  Didn't even say sorry and gave me that kind of stupid clueless look that you spot on the faces of women queueing up for the opening sale of Mango.<br><br>Just what the heck is wrong with Singaporeans??  Pig swill anyone?<br><br></div></blockquote>I would like to add that this is common in Singapore.  I would gave up seat to people to need it but sometime, the way they approached you, you can be damn pissed off one.  Once, I was very tired and fall asleep... The next thing something hit on my head, I wake up and look, guess what. A pragant lady actually stand so close to me that I thought she use her stomach to wake me up.  The train wasn't so crowded for me to be so closed to me.  In my haste, I just stand up for her to sit.  Not even a word of thanks.  I regretted my action as I thought, hell with her attitude, I should just continue with my sleep.....</div>
