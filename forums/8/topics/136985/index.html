            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>1. You grew up watching He-man, Transformers, Silver hawk and<br>Mickey Mouse.<br>Not to forget, Ninja turtles and Smurfs too.<br><br>2. You grew up brushing your teeth with a mug in Primary school<br>during recess time. You will squat by a drain with all your classmates<br>beside you, and brush your teeth with a coloured mug.<br>The teachers said you must brush each side 10 times too.<br><br>3. You know what's Bin(1) Fen(1) Ba (1) San(1) is all<br>about.<br><br>4. You know what SBC stands for.<br><br>5. You were there when the first chinese serial, the Awakening was<br>shown<br>on TV.<br><br>6. Internet? What the hell is that?<br>So you thought a decade or more ago.<br><br>7. You find your friends with pagers and handphone cool in<br>Secondary school.<br><br>8. SBS buses used to be non-airconditioned.<br>The bus seats are made of wood and the cushion is red. The<br>big red bell gives a loud BEEEP! when pressed.<br>There are colourful tickets for TIBS buses. The conductor will check<br>for tickets by using a machine which punches a hole on the ticket.<br><br>9. Your favourite actor and actress is Huang Wenyong and<br>Xiangyun.<br>Next is Lee Nanxing and Zoe Tay and the Aiyoyo woman.<br><br>10. You've probably read Young Generation magazine.<br>You know who's Vinny the little vampire and Acai the<br>constable.<br><br>11. You were there when they first introduced MRT here.<br>You went for the first ride with your parents and you would kneel on<br>the seat to see the scenery.<br><br>12. Movie tickets used to cost only $3.50.<br><br>13. Gals are fascinated by Strawberry Short Cake and Barbie<br>Dolls.<br><br>14. You learn to laugh like The Count in Sesame Street.<br><br>15. You longed to buy tibits called Kaka(20 cents per pack)<br>and Ding Dang(50 cents per box), that had a toy in it and it changes<br>every week not forgetting the 15 cents animal crackers and the ring<br>pop, where the lollipop is the diamond on the ring.<br><br>16. You watched TV2(also known as Channel 10) cartoons because<br>Channel 5 never had enough cartoons for you.<br><br>17. All that you know about Cantonese is from the Hong Kong<br>serials you watched on TV2.<br><br>18. Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, The Three Investigators, Famous<br>Five and Secret Seven are probably the thickest story books you ever<br>thought you have read.<br>Even SweetValley High and Malory Towers.<br><br>19. Civics and Moral Education was "Hao3 Gong1 Min2".<br><br>20. KFC used to be a high class restaurant that serve food in<br>plates and let you use metal forks and knives.<br><br>21. The most vulgar thing you said was ******* and idiot<br>and THE MOST EXTREME WAS 'super white'...you just couldn't bring<br>yourself<br>to say<br>the hokkien relative.<br><br>22. Catching was the IN thing and twist the magic word.<br><br>23. Your English workbooks was made of some damn poor<br>quality paper that was smooth and yellow.<br><br>24. CDIS was your best friend.<br><br>25. The only computer lessons in school involved funny<br>pixellised characters in 16 colours walking about trying to teach you<br>maths.<br>26. Waterbottles were slinged around your neck and a must everywhere<br>you go.<br><br>27. Boys loved to play soccer with small tennis balls in<br>the basketball court or play something that uses tennis ball to hit<br>other<br>players known as "HUM TAM BOLA" during recess /after school<br><br>28. Hopskotch, five stones,chateh and zero point were all<br>the rage with the girls and boys too...<br><br>29. Science was fun with the balsam and the angsana being<br>the most important plants of our lives.<br><br>30. Who can forget Ahmad, Bala, Sumei and John, eternalized<br>in our minds from the textbooks.<br>Even Mr Willy.<br><br>31. You did stupid exercises like seal crawl and frog<br>jumps.<br><br>32. Every children's day and national day you either get<br>pins or pens with 'Happy Children's Day 1993' or dumb files with Happy<br>National Day 1994'.<br><br>33. In Primary six you had to play buddy for the younger<br>kids like big sister and brother.<br><br>34. Chinese teachers were always old, boring and damn<br>fierce looking.<br><br>35. Your form teacher taught you maths, science and<br>english.<br><br>36. The worksheets were made of brown rough paper of poor<br>quality.<br><br>37. You went to school in slippers and a raincoat when it<br>rained, and you find a dry spot in the school to sit down, dry your<br>feet,<br>and wear your dry and warm socks and shoes.<br><br>38. Famous Chinese singers were only Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau,<br>Aaron Kwok and Leon Lai.<br><br>39. School dismissal time was normally around 1 pm.<br><br>40. There would be spelling tests and mental sums to do<br>almost everyday.<br><br>41. Your friends considered you lucky and rich if your<br>parents gave you $3 or more for pocket money everyday.<br><br>42. During class gatherings, parents always tag along in<br>case someone gets lost at Orchard Road.<br><br>43. You freak out when the teacher tells you to line up<br>according to height and hold hands with the corresponding boy or girl.<br><br>44. Handkerchiefs were a must for both genders<br><br>45. Collecting notebooks and all kinds of stationery was a<br>popular thing.<br><br>46. Autograph books were loaded with "Best Wishes", "Forget<br>Me Not", and small poems like "Bird fly high, hard to catch.<br>Friend like you, hard to forget".<br><br>47. Class monitors and prefects loved to say<br>You talk somemore, I write your name ah!"<br><br>48. There were at least 40 people in one class.<br><br>49. Large, colourful schoolbags were carried.<br><br>50. You brought every single book to school, even though<br>there was one thing called the timetable.</div>
