            <div class='col-md body'>I decided to take the Games Design and Development course offered by Singapore Polytechnic, due to the assumption that the low cut-off point of 12 meant that it's the best. However with the JAE registration ongoing currently, I've suddenly had a number of people advising me not to go for it.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">http://www.sp.edu.sg/SPweb/appmanager/home/default?_nfpb=true&amp;linkNode=/BEA%20Repository/FutureStudent/Courses/Design/FullTime/DiplomaInGamesDesignDevelopment/YourFuture&amp;T17004799711148618167876_actionOverride=/cmsTools/extension/content/main/link&amp;_windowLabel=T17004799711148618167876&amp;_pageLabel=SP_ABT_C_FTD_MICT_GDD</span><br><blockquote>In terms of career development, graduates from this diploma have opportunities to further their studies and training in Australia, UK and the US where undergraduate degree courses in games design are plentiful.<br></blockquote>My father spoke to me regarding it yesterday, saying that he's concerned because there doesn't seem to be any University that recognizes the SP diploma in GDD. NUS, NTU, SMU or SIM don't offer any further courses in this field.  Seeing how SP doesn't seem to provide the names of any Universities that are willing to take you in and allow you to advance to the second year, it seems like they're saying "After you graduate from SP, you're going to have to find your own way".<br><br>Also, this morning one of my classmates of my present JC called me up, advising me against the SP course as well. His reason was that the software which SP makes the students use is basic and stupid, whereas NYP offers a more advanced/sophisticated software. He advised me to go for the Digital Entertainment Technology in NYP instead..<br><br>*sigh* I'm really not sure what to do. Part of the reason why I picked this course was due to it's low cut-off point (of course I do have a genuine interest in this), hence I wouldn't be dragged down by the slob-ness of my classmates. My dad told me to find out how far in University this can get me. He says that if there are no Universities that recognizes this diploma in GDD, then there's no point even going for this course.<br><br>My questions:<br>- Which polytechnic course would be most relevant, if I want to work in this industry.<br>- Which of these can prepare me the best? (lecturers; facilities; projects; etc.)<br>- Do they offer you an option to further your studies?<br><br>Anyone can help me out a little with some advice? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, made a mistake. It should have been Digital Entertainment Technology and not Digital Media Design. Anyway, I've gathered from a number of people that NYP is generally better in Media + IT.<br><br>If you were to put both Digital Entertainment Technology and Games Design &amp; Development side by side, would you actually say that DET would prepare you better in terms of understanding and skills? (I know it's very very hard for most of your to make a comparison, since 99% of your won't even be in either course, but any help would be appreciated <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">)<br><br>Also, does anyone know which Universities would I be able to advance to, should I take the DET course in NYP?<br><br>Thank so much.
