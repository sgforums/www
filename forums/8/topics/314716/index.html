              <p>A new picture book about plastic surgery aims to explain why mom is getting a flatter tummy and a 'prettier' nose.</p>
              </div>
              <p>When
              she was pregnant with her son Junior, who turns nine this month,
              Gabriela Acosta ballooned from 115 pounds to 196. Acosta lost the
              weight but wound up with stretched, saggy skin. Even her son noticed
              it. He told her that her stomach looked "pruney," the result, he
              thought, of staying in the shower too long. So the 29-year-old
              stay-at-home mom scheduled a consultation with Dr. Michael Salzhauer, a
              board-certified plastic surgeon in Bal Harbour, Fla.</p>
              <p>Acosta
              told Salzhauer that she wasn't sure how to talk to her son about the
              procedures she was considering. That's when he showed her the
              manuscript for his children's picture book, "My Beautiful Mommy" (Big
              Tent Books), out this Mother's Day. It features a perky mother
              explaining to her child why she's having cosmetic surgery (a nose job
              and tummy tuck). Naturally, it has a happy ending: mommy winds up "even
              more" beautiful than before, and her daughter is thrilled.</p>
              <p>The
              reassuring tale helped win Acosta over—she scheduled breast
              augmentation and a tummy tuck. Since February, when she had the
              surgery, she and Junior have read the book a half dozen times, and she
              says it helped him feel excited rather than scared. "I didn't want him
              to think [the surgery] was because I was hurting. It was to make me
              feel good," she says.</p>
              <p>That message seems to have
              gotten through. Instead of being uncomfortable about the surgery,
              Acosta says her son actually spoke up about it at a big party. "Did you
              see her new belly button? It's so pretty!" he said of his mom. "I think
              he was proud," she says.</p>
              <p>What's the market for a
              children's picture book about moms getting cosmetic surgery? No one
              specifically tracks the number of tummy-tuck-and-breast-implant combos
              (or "mommy makeovers," as they're called), but according to the latest
              numbers from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, breast
              augmentation was the most popular cosmetic surgery procedure last year,
              with 348,000 performed (up 6 percent over 2006). Of those, about
              one-third were for women over 40 who often opt for implants to restore
              lost volume in their breasts due to aging or pregnancy weight gain.
              There were 148,000 tummy tucks—up 1 percent from the previous year.</p>
              <p>Salzhauer
              got the idea for a book after noticing that women were coming into his
              office with their kids in tow. He says that mysterious doctor's visits
              can be frightening for children. "Parents generally tend to go into
              this denial thing. They just try to ignore the kids' questions
              completely." But, he adds, children "fill in the blanks in their
              imagination" and then feel worse when they see "mommy with bandages,"
              he says. "With the tummy tucks, [the mothers] can't lift anything.
              They're in bed. The kids have questions."</p>
              <p>"My
              Beautiful Mommy" is aimed at kids ages four to seven and features a
              plastic surgeon named Dr. Michael (a musclebound superhero type) and a
              girl whose mother gets a tummy tuck, a nose job and breast implants.
              Before her surgery the mom explains that she is getting a smaller
              tummy: "You see, as I got older, my body stretched and I couldn't fit
              into my clothes anymore. Dr. Michael is going to help fix that and make
              me feel better." Mom comes home looking like a slightly bruised Barbie
              doll with demure bandages on her nose and around her waist.</p>
              <p>The
              text doesn't mention the breast augmentation, but the illustrations
              intentionally show Mom's breasts to be fuller and higher. "I tried to
              skirt that issue in the text itself," says Salzhauer. "The tummy lends
              itself to an easy explanation to the children: extra skin and can't fit
              into your clothes. The breasts might be a stretch for a six-year-old."</p>
              <p>The
              book doesn't explain exactly why the mother is redoing her nose
              post-pregnancy. Nonetheless, Mom reassures her little girl that the new
              nose won't just look "different, my dear—prettier!"</p>
              <p>It
              remains to be seen how many plastic surgeons will recommend the book to
              patients. Richard D'Amico, president of the American Society of Plastic
              Surgeons, who gives the book a B grade, says he would "make them aware
              that it's out there and leave it up to the patient's discretion." He
              says the illustration (specifically the breasts) look somewhat
              "overdone," since most moms are just looking for restoration.</p>
              <p>Child
              psychiatrist Elizabeth Berger, author of "Raising Kids With Character,"
              likes the idea of a book for kids. "If the mother is determined to
              pursue cosmetic surgery, I think it's terribly important to discuss it
              with the child," Berger says. But she says the book is incomplete. She
              wishes that the mom had just said something like, "This is silly, but I
              really want it anyway," she says. "That is more honest and more helpful
              to the child."</p>
              <p>Berger doesn't want to come across as
              anti-cosmetic surgery, but she notes that it can be difficult for small
              kids to understand. "The younger the child, the more mysterious and
              potentially hurtful the mother's absence, or mother being out of
              commission, or mother looking like she's been beaten up, will be," she
              says. Small children are "concrete" and "sensible" and think "you go to
              a doctor because you're hurt or sick," she says. After considering how
              their children might react, she says that "some mothers may realize
              that the total burden of the child's anxiety might be a side effect of
              the procedure they hadn't quite thought through and that might inspire
              them to postpone it until the child is older."</p>
              <p>Despite the marketing nickname "<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/78042/page/1">mommy makeover</a>,"
              which can sound like a trip to a day spa, these are serious surgeries
              with potential complications that can require additional procedures—and
              disruption for kids. With breast augmentation, for example, the initial
              operation is not likely to be the last. Implants may last 10 or more
              years, but they do not last a lifetime, <a href="http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/breastimplants/handbook2004/localcomplications.html">according to the FDA</a>.
              About a quarter of all implant patients have to have another operation
              within five years due to problems like leaking, breast asymmetry and
              encapsulation of the implants.</p>
              <p>Then there are the
              body image issues raised by cosmetic surgery—especially for daughters.
              Berger worries that kids will think their own body parts must need
              "fixing" too. The surgery on a nose, for example, may "convey to the
              child that the child's nose, which always seemed OK, might be perceived
              by Mommy or by somebody as unacceptable," she says.</p>
              <p>The
              book doesn't go into any medical detail. "They should do more about
              what the surgery is," says my own eight-year-old daughter. "Kids," she
              says, will want to know more about "what they're going to do to you."
              But on the other hand, if they knew more about the procedures they
              might not want their mothers to go through with them. As my daughter
              points out, "a five-year-old is going to be horrified that their mom is
              getting water balloons put in her breasts."</p>
              <p>Salzhauer
              knows that not everyone will like his book. "There's a good percentage
              of your readers who are dead set against plastic surgery, who see it as
              a sign of the decadence of Western civilization," he says. "But when
              done by a properly trained board-certified plastic surgeon, it really
              does help make lives better." Salzhauer may someday get a chance to
              test that theory—and his book—at home. His wife hasn't had any work
              done yet but is pregnant with her fifth child.</p>
