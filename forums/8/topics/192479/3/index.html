She is also good looking herself. Some more i dont think she bedek me. i can see her eyes. i seen thru her psychology.<br><br>I asked her "why?". She said i good looking loh.<br><br></div></blockquote>Dear Diary,<br><br>Today,I felt very happy.You know what happened? Coz I think I have managed to grab a loyal customer.I think he will visit me regularly for at least the next 1 year or so.Thank god the strategy my Master taught me was successful! Well,my Master told me must always sweet talk especially to men who are only so-so looking.Must inflate their egos until big big.So I told him he is very handsome boy and coz of that,he can get discount!I could see his face brightening immediately! Yeah,I knew I was successful liao! Haha,guys will always be guys...Just say some nice words to them and they will give you the world.The discount I gave him today will be more than offset by the commissions I will get to earn over the next several months.<br><br>To be honest,I hate the way the guy thinks he is very handsome.He is merely OK only.He is much much worse than that Steven Lim...*shrugs*<br><br>Dear Diary,it has been a good day's work.Nite nite!</div>
