            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ecxentrique:</div><div class="quote_body">My take on this..<br><br>Accounting like engineering is a professional degree.. professional in the sense that its a basic cert to get you up to level of CPA (certified public accountant) or for engineering the PE (professional engineer).<br><br>The NTU accounting course basically starts off with basics.. 1st year is very simliar to NTU business.. take basic enttry level business and financial accounting modules.. then gradually in years 2 and 3 diverge and more heay accounting takes place..<br><br>after graduating with an accounting degree i think if you are good you can be able to easily get a job in one of the big 4.. namely KPMG, Ernst &amp; Young, PricewaterCooperHouse and Deloitte  &amp; Touche.. these are the big names in INTERNATIONAL accounting and auditing.. most will want to start their accounting degrees here. these big 4 firms are engaged by other companies.. listed or not listed to check their financial statements.. cashflow.. profit and loss and generate periodical financial statements.. the process of doing this is called auditing.. its mainly to report on the firms performance to the shareholders or the public (for public listed companies)<br><br>its basically coporate ladder once you get in.. you start of as a junior following seniors and other as a group going around to do audit.. slowly over a few years you will get promoted based on performance then you can slowly rise to audit senior, team leader... asst VP, VP.... Chief.. officer.. of course the pay rise over the years will also be based on your experience but from what i hear my friend say.. its quite substantial.. the rise are quite a lot very year.. although starting can be very small..<br><br>but one thing about these big firms are the tendencies to go into office politics.. my friend went around a few firms trying to avoid this stuff.<br><br>there are smaller audit firms.. those that are started my locals.. accounting grads can also end up there.. the stuff they do are exactly the same as the big audit firms.. but as they small they go after smaller firms.. usually not the listed ones.. charge small fee.. so pay less..<br><br>another likely place is internal audit or finance dept or ANY company these are the people that record financial activities in the company.. and every year prepare for audit..<br><br>can be a very stressful job (all the types) esp near audit season.. they have peak and off peak seasons.. if they are stressed they can be in the office til.. very late..very very late..</div></blockquote>I second that. Get ready for some very very late night work. Normal is until 8-10pm during peak period. If messy company, then probably do until 1am or more. Off peak maybe can go off at 5-6pm.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Starting pay maybe 2000 sing dollars. Promotion ladder: Graduate assistant 1,2 --&gt; senior 1,2 --&gt; assistant manager 1,2 and so on.<br><br>Be prepared to have no life during weekdays and possibly going back to work during saturday  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

I joined one of the Big 4 after my NTU days, met my wife there too!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Seriously, a lot of long hours during peak period.   But you really build up good friendship and camaraderie with your fellow sufferers, working into late nights and seeing each other in office at weekends as well.  You may think it's boring, but they're all about your age, you already know some of them during the NTU days, so they can be great company.   That's the thing I missed most when I left, after a few years with the firm.  During off-peak you practically have nothing much to do on some days, except go for training, clear leave, etc.  And it's a good career stepping stone, giving you access to the big companies and their management teams, and looks impressive on the CV.<br><br>It's also not necessary to start with a CPA firm.  After NTU you can work in banks, financial institutions, small companies, etc - but usually some audit experience is desirable so that you won't start at the very bottom of the graduate salary scale.<br><br>I don't know about chemical engineers, but a lot of my peers in NTU days are doing reasonably well now, although most of them are NOT doing accounting per se, more like finance / management work - eg, internal audit (local or regional), management consultancy, investment banking, head-hunting, etc.<br><br>Bottom line - if I can start all over again I would still go for Accountancy, and it's not just because of my wife!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i dun think smu's accounting course can be compared to ntu's superior accountancy course. For me i had chosen NTU Accountancy and i am happily in it now. What you learn in school many things do not apply to ur work life. Its how u go to the Society University and excel in it that matters. Look up to Dr Wee as a source of inspiration.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
