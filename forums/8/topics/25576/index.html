            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i really donno whats with singaporeans who tries to fake an accent when they speak to ang mohs. I mean who r they kidding!<br><br>For you people who dont know, the way u speak is predetermined in the first ten yrs of your life (actually shorter than that!) Thus the accent, the fluency of the language is all determined within that period. (Dont belive, check pyschology books)<br><br>So u will never be able to speak their kind of accent and dont even bother to try!<br><br>I find singaporeans in Ozzie tend to slang their way with non singaporeans, and when they meet fellow sg people.. all their singlish come out.

            <div class='col-md body'>Howdy,<br><br>I'll have to disgaree with you, mate.  It really depends on whom you mixed with when you were overseas.  I spent 7 years down under, and I'll have to say that so-called accent comes on and off depending on whom I talk to.  I spent heaps of time with the locals as well as the Irish and Poms, and a couple of Yanks there.  So I have several accents if I may say so.  When I talk to my local friends, my Singaporean accent shows itself.  When I give presentations, my Aussie accent shows itself.  When I want to make a real impression, my Irish accent reveals itself.<br><br>I'm assuming you've never spent time overseas.  I've seen people spend all their time with their own people, not mixing with the locals and they don't develop a 'slang'.  I still say 'mate', 'dude', 'good on ya', 'shazza', and all the words associated in the Australian culture and even the way it should be said.  Aye, mate?<br><br>What you should be spewing about are those people who never went overseas, and are talking with a pseudo-accent.  These are the ones that have the fake accent who try to impress our Western visitors.  Aye?<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yo sup possum!!!!!!!! now i remember why this nick was so familiar!!<br><br>well as u know i spent 12 years in australia.. and now that i'm back here pple can't tell i spent 12 years in australia from the way i speak. but when i was there as a waiter many of my customers asked me if i was born there. obviously for them to have asked me that question i would have had to be "slanging" to them.<br><br>it's not a slang if pple think i was born in australia when i actually wasn't.<br><br>maybe if u wanna think about it this way, where possible, in china u'd wanna speak chinese, in england, english, in germany, german. except now we're talking about accents. if u can adapt to their accent then go right ahead.. if u can't then use an accent u know best.<br><br>i know both just as well..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well I dunno if I'm in your category but whenever I speak to Ang Mohs I'd usually try to hide my accent. No, not because I'm ashame of my singlish accent but it's to convey a clearer and more understanding message to the Ang Mohs. Speaking better english is good too so you can at least blend in together with them.<br><br>But speaking to Ang Mohs doesn't mean I slang like them (I can never do that) I'm just hiding my "ups-and down tones" "leh" "loh" blah blah that's all.<br><br>No worries mate, I guarantee that only a minority of oversea Singaporeans do that "fake AM accent" simply bcos most of them can't do it.....somemore aussie accent.....forget it!!!<br><br>As I know, only those AM wannabes talk like them.....they even start to dress like them liao.......sad but true.<br><br>BTW....how many of us studied in Aussie before?

And no, I'm not ashamed to be a Singaporean, and I don't use any ccent to 'impress' anyone (looking at the way you've defined it).<br><br>I was born and raised in Singapore but I spent what I believed to be 7 of the most important years of my life Down Under.  But I've seen people who have spent time overseas, never mixed with a single local in their time there except for the lecturers themselves, and coming back without having changed their speech patterns.  In addition, what about those who have never been overseas for extended periods of time (at least 5 years) but talk like they were educated overseas.  You know who i'm talking about, mate.  The classic examples are the SPGs.  Well, most of them at least.<br><br>Just taking a pot shot here to deflate your arrogance perhaps.  I hope your fluency of the English language only applies to your verbal skills 'cause I could definitely not say the same for your writing cum typing skills.  Also, you seem to be really on this impression thing.  No one's impressing anyone.  It's plain communication, not an ego trip.  Perhaps you need to check your own assumptions, amigo.<br><br>Hiya, joHo.  Great to see you here, mate.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear possum, i hope u do remember this part which u typed " I hope your fluency of the English language only applies to your verbal skills 'cause I could definitely not say the same for your writing cum typing skills".<br>For what i can see or read, I did not INSULT you in anyway but merely asking questions. I do not understand why u have to move on from a nice little debate about accent to pure insults to other forummites.<br><br>I am just quizzical over why people cant just use their normal singaporean english ( i am not referring to singlish here folks) when they speak to AM. I am fine if they r "naturally" having an accent, but not so ok when they speak in singaporean english or singlish with fellow countrymates (sorta like discriminate here and there). It seems totally fake to me personally.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, everyone relax. Think Ah_Nic was just buay song about those who are so angmo-siao that they purposely speak with a slang when talking to angmos just for the purpose of making themselves feel so superior. I don't think he's trying to insult people with acquired slang from staying abroad from far. In fact, even if you acquire a slang from staying overseas for some time, many people still manage to revert to their original accent in no time, because that is what they are still most comfortable speaking in.<br><br>Actually when I speak to angmos (in the place I work, more than half are angmos  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> ), I tend to pronounce and speak slower so that they'll understand, 'cause their blend of english is different from ours. But no slang. They already need to get used to what you are saying in your own accent. If you try to slang in a way which you are not brought up/taught to do so, they'll find it even harder to understand you. Anyway, some angmos did tell me that they actually secretly mock at those people who purposely slang when they talk to them, just that they will not mock these people in the face out of politeness. So if you don't want to make a fool of yourselves...don't say I didn't warn you!<br><br>When I talk to friends, I speak a mixture of english/chinese/hokkien/malay, etc, but when I speak to my colleagues, I try to speak proper english, no slang, no overtone, no nothing, just flat - the way it is taught to me by my teachers. That, I don't think it's fake? Or at least I hope so.</div>
