Tell me which 3rd world do u find cab drivers with real university degree. Moreover this trend is increasing. Their talent and skill is not put to good use at all. U do not even need a degree to drive. The university grads has studied for the past 20 yrs, racking up hundred of thousand in education in the end they have to drive a cab. This group of people surely have all the rights in Singapore to complain for its the government who have a significant influence on the pave of education.<br><br>I expect now that u are going to point out the fact that the guy is an Uncle so the chance of him being a uni grad is low. Please do hot forget the hike in cab rental fare or $20. The cab rental is around $90. With rising oil prises oil for a single day can go up to $60.  In 3rd world u are able to own a cab with a few thousand dollar. So cab driver in which country will be happier?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, what's her problem?<br><br>She has the right to her own opinions; so does the cabbie. Just because the cabbie voices out his own negative opinions about the government doesn't mean that it's the end of the world. It doesn't mean that tourists are going to start shunning Singapore and all our hotels are going to crumble to dust.<br><br>If that's the case, then I suppose if I step into a cab in London and listen to the cabbie spouting anti-Blair rhetoric, I'm going to think badly of the UK? Kaoz.<br><br>Am I supposed to shun Taiwan if I board a taxi in Kaohsiung and the cabbie spouts anti-DPP rhetoric?<br><br>So what she's saying is that the only thing the cabbie's allowed to say is nice things about the government? But isn't that as good as making him say only the things which she wants to hear? If she's truly educated, then doesn't she know about the need to listen to several viewpoints, including those which aren't corresponding to her own?<br><br>'Nuff said.

So cab driver in which country will be happier?<br><br></div></blockquote>Indeed I cannot find any cab driver in the 3rd world with a University degree. In fact, there's a majority of pple in the 3rd world w/o a degree or even any form of education. Again the argument here can be put to the half glass full or half glass empty view point. You can see it as a governmental failure that a univeersity graduate cannot find a job here and have to "resort" to cab driving. But on the other hand, is it not to the credit to the government that the general population of Singapore are much more educated than people from the 3rd world.<br>I am unsure of the numbers of cab drivers in Singapore with a degree and the nature of their degree. But with the increasing number of graduates, this is the expected trend if they are not exported out. I mean, seriously, there are only so many "managers" available and we are having so many grads coming out each year, surely the Singapore job market cannot accomodate them all.<br>You were right in saying that we spend hundreds and thousands in education, in fact a closer estimate would be about close to a million per student's education from pre-primary to degree. A good deal of this million is subsidised by Singapore. And armed with this education, they can easily find a job in another part of the world, subjected to the nature of their degree.<br>People need to realise that there's a limit to the number of "good" jobs that can be created here in Singapore, but put any Singaporean on the world map, he/she is likely to be more qualified than someone else on the globe. There's a few expanding economies that would gladly give jobs to qualified Singaporeans, Australia, New Zealand and China...just to name a few.<br>With regards to whether a cab driver here or in 3rd world would be happier. Well, one have to really do a general survey to find out. But based on the factors that you have listed, you seemed to have not included non-tangible terms such as comfort and safety. Cab drivers in 3rd world and in certain first world are more likely to be subject to get mugged or simply shot in the head. From what I recall, cab driving in Singapore was a rather lucrative job. I am not too sure about the condition at the moment, how much exactly does an average driver earn and such. But considering that one of my uncle and my friend's father, both are cab driver, and both being able to not only support their family of four and see both children tru university education; the monetary payment should be close to satisfactory. I am not too sure that a cab driver in some 3rd world country would be able to do the same even with the current conditions that you have mentioned.</div>
