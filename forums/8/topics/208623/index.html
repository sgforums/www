            <div class='col-md body'>Of Singapore On Minds Of Tourists.<br><br>extracted from STforums.<br><br>AFTER a fulfilling Sunday meet-up with friends on Aug 20, my friends and I boarded a Silvercab to catch a quick peaceful ride home. However, the journey turned out to be more than we bargained for.<br><br>First, the speed of the cab was over the limit allowed on most roads in Singapore. Dying to catch up on our beauty sleep for the tiring week ahead, we were pretty glad the driver seemed to be in a more of a rush than us to get us back home. Whatever, we didn't really pay much attention to where the needle was pointing on the speedometer.<br><br>What was appalling in the behaviour of the driver was his vehement response to a simple roadworks on a stretch of the Central Expressway (CTE), most likely a frantic government initiative in preparation for the International Monetary Fund-World Bank meetings in mid-September. Hoping to strike up a friendly conversation with the cab uncle, I made a remark on the speed of traffic on an 'expressway', asking his opinion why the CTE is always so packed.<br><br>What ultimately resulted was verbal diarrhoea by the cab driver on his prophesy of how 'first generation of Government make money, second generation maintain stability, and third will eventually waste away all that was achieved by the predecessors'. As a 'skilled conversationalist' with his passengers, he managed to direct a conversation on roadworks and link it to CPF.<br><br>'Mark my words,' he said, 'by the time you retire, even if you have a million in your CPF account, you'll not be able to retrieve a single cent of it out of the Government's coffers.'<br><br>How pessimistic, I thought. What dismayed me was not just his attempt to convince me of his thoughts, but rather, I shudder to think that these exact same taxi drivers are the first point of contact with many tourists visiting Singapore. They could be the ambassadors of the nation, with such a rampant number of taxis plying the streets of Singapore.<br><br>I was appalled by the thought that such negative impressions could be etched on the minds of tourists even before they step into our welcoming hotels. <strong>With or without the much anticipated IMF-World Bank meetings just round the corner, it is such a shame that the people with the most opportunity to rub shoulders with tourists, have such negative views of the country they represent. </strong><br>Please, all taxi operators, do more to send drivers on courses in communication. Perhaps National Education should be promoted in taxi companies as well. Whatever is true or untrue, it is never too late to change the environment and attitude of people around us. It is only when we complain but do nothing that things start to spiral out of control.<br><br>Audrey Tan Liling (Ms)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>12-year-old students 'not spared atrocities of litterbugs'<br><br>extracted from STforums.<br><br>I REFER to the article, 'Warning! Singapore is becoming a garbage city' (ST, Aug 20).<br>As 12-year-old students, my friends and I are not spared from the atrocities of litterbugs. Every day, we go to school only to be greeted by the routine morning lecture on keeping the school clean. Even then, our classrooms, canteen, staircases and toilets are littered with tissue paper, scarps of foolscap, bits of pencil shavings or lead, and the biggest culprit, empty plastic water bottles. The standard lectures don't seem to be working, do they?<br><br>Is it enough if just a handful of us want to keep the city clean? Leave the city. Look at our schools. If children litter at school, how can we expect them, the leaders of tomorrow, to keep the city clean? Why do children litter? The biggest reason is that children are not taught well enough. They are not responsible enough. They don't care if Singapore becomes a wasteland. They don't really mind if foreigners throw rubbish at our bus stops and in our streets.<br><br><strong>Now, we face a big problem. With the International Monetary Fund-World Bank meetings happening, how are we going to clean up our city by the time all the foreigners come over here.</strong> Isn't it the same as when you have a visitor coming over to your home? You clean your house, tidy it, and maybe even add minor decorations. No one seems to be bothered to clean up our island home. We have to work fast. How?<br><br>It's easier to build children than repair adults. Children need to know what it is like to pick up litter others carelessly chuck aside. They should be made to pick up litter around their neighbourhood as part of their National Education (NE).<br><br>During NE lessons, children can discuss with their teachers what can be done to deter people from littering. After all, National Education is about loving Singapore and if we love Singapore, we'll definitely want to keep it clean, right?<br><br>P. Mirnalini (Ms)<br><br></div>
