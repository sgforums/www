            <div class='col-md body'>Who's that out way past her bedtime? You and your Sultry Look are no strangers to the nightlife. Chances are very good that you'll be caught wearing something that shows off your figure but still keeps 'em guessing. Decked out in dark mascara, deep ruby lipstick, and the most daring of dos, you're cutting loose and capable of causing the best kind of trouble. It's ladies like you who know how to take sexy right to the edge and back again. Like your celebrity soul sisters, Jennifer Lopez, Charlize Theron, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, you've got no problem showing off your assets for the crowd and letting them know just how beautiful you can be. After all, when you know how to work it, why not use it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your celeb look is inspired by Mysterious Look<br><br>Who can say what goes on behind that Mysterious Look? No one for sure, because you love to keep them guessing. Your secretive ways are as intriguing as your exotic beauty. Maybe it's your deep, dreamy eyes, or maybe it's that elusive smile that hides something more. As a nonconformist by nature, you tend to fuse different fashions into unique combinations that express the real youÂ—marrying the vintage with the modern or the classic with the eclectic. Like your celebrity counterparts, Winona Ryder and Juliette Binoche, you're always open to intelligent discussion and experimental jewelry and makeup. By playing up your intense features with deep lipsticks and an alluring eye shadow, you're both captivating and unpredictable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your celeb look is inspired by Romantic Look<br><br>With the eyes of a Botticelli and the smile of a DaVinci, you're the latest embodiment of the Romantic Look. It's your fascinating combo of dreamy innocence and smoldering desire that always keeps 'em guessing. Your tender, inner nature comes out in the soft colors and flowing fabrics of your clothes. But just because you can pull off the pastel eye shadows, pouty glossed lips, and the wide-eyed look of a kitten, everyone knows that you're no angel. Once you slip into something sexy for the evening and dab a little fragrance behind the ear, you're capable of just about anything. Mysterious as a cat, you share the same romantic allure as Nicole Kidman, Penelope Cruz, and Andie MacDowell. And just like them, your sincere, inner beauty always manages to shine just as brightly as your striking appearance.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your celeb look is inspired by Classic Look<br>FUN QUIZ: What's Your Celeb Look?<br>MY RESULT: Classic Look<br><br>Tennis, anyone? How about a weekend in the country? Just slip on those tortoise-shell sunglasses and your khaki skirt, and you've got the Classic Look down. With your somewhat preppy lifestyle and a wardrobe filled with things that'll never go out of style, your look spells out your trust in the enduring values. As the queen of classic attire, you've got a relaxed style, colored with a little bit of conservative money. Cotton and wool are your standards, and they beautifully set off your sun-kissed tan glow, just as if you stepped off the boat from Hyannis Port. When getting dressed up, you prefer to keep it simpleÂ—spruce it up with some pearls, some shell pink nail polish, and just a touch of lipstick. Like your celebrity prep sisters, Gwyneth Paltrow, Julia Roberts, and Grace Kelly, your look is timeless, American, and oh-so-tasteful.</div>
