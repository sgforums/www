            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Harry Goes To Hell</strong><br><br>Well, one day, Harry Lee found out he wasn't immortal, because he died and went straight to Hell.<br><br>He was met by his old friend, the Devil, who reminded him of his pact. Harry tried to argue, but the Devil had much better legal skills and unfortunately the part in the contract about selling one's soul in order to rule a country was air-tight and binding.<br><br>So the Devil made Harry a concession. "Well I have to put you through Eternal Torment, but since you're an old friend and someone after my own heart, I'll allow you your choice of punishment. Come see what your political rivals are going through."<br><br>He took him to the first cell, where Chee Soon Juan was starving away, chained up, just inches away from a sumptuous banquet.<br><br>"That'll teach him for going on hunger strikes," grinned Harry, but declined this punishment.<br><br>The next cell had Chiam See Tong strapped to a table with his mouth open while a wild goose above walked around, crapping.<br><br>"Serves him right, but not for me," said Harry.<br><br>The Devil opened the door to the last cell. J B Jeyaretnam was naked, chained to a post, while a Catherine Lim in leathers was forced to perform fellatio on him.<br><br>"What kind of punishment is that?" ejaculated Harry, "But in any case, I'll take it!"<br><br>"Sure?" asked the Devil.<br><br>"Absolutely," replied the former Senior Minister of a tiny island.<br><br>"OK, in you go," ordered the Devil, as a few henchmen started to strap Harry Lee and bring him into the cell.<br><br>Looking into the cell, the Devil shouted, "Right, Catherine, we've found your replacement, you can come out now!"<br><br><strong>Please, show some... what is that thing called?</strong><br><br>An American tourist was visiting a temple in Singapore when he noticed two statues of a man and a woman by the altar.<br><br>He asked the monk what was the significance of the two. The monk explained that in the Chinese system of yin and yang, positives must always be balanced by negatives, and having the two statues ensured that the universal balance was maintained.<br><br>"This statue of the woman is the Goddess of Mercy, Kuan-Yin."<br><br>"What about the other one?" asked the tourist.<br><br>In a hushed voice, the monk said, "This one is the God of No Mercy, Kuan-Yew."<br><br><strong>What to call the hall?</strong><br><br>As with Sheares Hall and Yusof Hall, NUS has just named one of its halls after former president Devan Nair.<br>It's called Alco Hall.<br><br><strong>How about N.A.I.R.?</strong><br><br>No alcohol, I resign.<br><br><strong>What does D.E.V.A.N stand for?</strong><br><br>Don't ever vote another Nair<br><br><strong>I asked for a hot toddy, but this is ridiculous</strong><br><br>Do you know why Singaporeans dial 995 in the event of fire? Well, this dates back to when Devan Nair was still President. One day, he was sitting alone in his study at the Istana drinking his tea, when a huge commotion breaks out in the kitchen.<br><br>He hears a scream and sees his wife running out of the kitchen amidst licking flames and billowing smoke. She looks hysterically at Devan Nair and shouts, "Nair, Nair, Fire!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Special Delivery</strong><br><br>One day at the Istana, Mr Devan Nair's son wanted to borrow the Presidential Rolls for a night out on the town. So Devan reluctantly agreed, saying that it should be back by midnight.<br><br>Midnight came and went and still no car. 2 am and still no car. So Devan hops on his son's motorcycle and goes out in search of his son and the car. He goes all over town but can't find it.<br><br>Finally, at 6am he gives up and comes putt-putting back to the Istana. The guard looks at him and says, "Eh, Thambi, how come today no Straits Times?"<br><br><strong>Just expressing my... whatÂ’s that again?</strong><br><br>A Russian, an Ethiopian and a Singaporean were being surveyed by the World Bank. The question was "What is your opinion on how much money you spend on food?"<br><br>The Ethiopian asked, "What is food?"<br><br>The Russian asked, "What is money?"<br><br>The Singaporean asked, "What is an opinion?"<br><br><strong>Talking Cock Only</strong><br><br>Why did the Singaporean chicken cross the road?<br><br>Tang Liang Hong  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  The chicken crossed the road because it was running for its life from a gang of vultures!<br>Philip Yeo  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  The chickens have a MORAL responsibility to cross the road. If they don't, we'll name them in the newspapers.<br>Lee Kuan Yew  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  Every chicken should be given the opportunity to realise its full potential to cross the road. The brightest chickens should lead.<br>Richard Hu  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  DON'T PANIC. We'll monitor the situation and start worrying if the chickens get run down while crossing the road.<br>Admiral Teo Chee Hean  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  We have put in the necessary infrastructure and will teach the chickens to think for themselves so that they cross the road in the most effective way.<br>Mah Bow Tan  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  The chickens must pay before they use the roads. Preferably, they should buy a LTC (License To Cross) for each trip.<br>BG George Yeo  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  In this age of information and technology, it is inevitable that the chickens get to cross the road.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hot Harry</strong><br><br>Our beloved Senior Minister died and went to the afterlife. St. Peter said, "Well, we can't let you into Heaven straight away as you've done some stuff that's a little questionable. So you're going to have to spend a bit of time in Hell first before ascending."<br><br>And so our Senior Minister was sent to Hell. After a few months, Satan phones God up: "Eh, can you faster take him up or not? A short while down here and he's already managed to get an air-con installed!"<br><br><strong>What does S.R. NATHAN stand for?</strong><br><br>Sinda Requests Non-Alcoholic Thambi Hero After Nair<br><br><strong>It's All in the Name</strong><br><br>During an official visit to Thailand, DPM Tony Tan, DPM BG Lee Hsien Loong and opposition MP Chiam See Tong went to visit the notorious red light district Patpong. Soon enough, a pretty prostitute beckoned to the three politicians. As they all moved towards her, BG Lee halted them.<br><br>He told Tony Tan, "Tony, tan." ("Tan" in Hokkien is "wait".)<br><br>He then told Chiam See Tong, "Chiam see tong." (Hokkien for "temporarily hold on".)<br><br>He then pointed at himself and said, "Lee, hsien loong." ("Hsien loong" sounds like Hokkien for "bang first".)<br><br><strong>Do we have to spell it out for you?</strong><br><br>Once upon a time, the Singapore media industry was free to report just about anything. That is why they were called RTS, as the reporters were free to Roam The Street and Report True Stories.<br><br>However, under the leadership of Mr. LEE (Loves Editing Everything), RTS became SBC (Script By Censorship). Soon, most of the reporters quit while those who stayed behind had to work under Si Bay Chum conditions.<br><br>Since these reporters could not roam the streets or report true stories, they had to fabricate Si Beh Choon ('choon' is Cantonese for 'stupid') stories that nobody wants to know.<br><br>Only the students from NUS (Nothing Up Stair) thought the reports were Si Beh Cheem.<br><br>Then SBC started to employ these students as reporters. As there was nothing that could be freely reported, SBC changed its name to TCS (Totally Censored Station) and become a Talk Cock Station only.<br><br>Hopefully, TCS will not change its name again to NCS (No Choice Station).<br><br>*copy and pasted from <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com" rel="nofollow">www.talkingcock.com</a></div>
