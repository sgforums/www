I  understand the despair and the worries that ur gf is going thru... ... Sometimes even though we practise lotsa times, we will still screw up on the test day cos we are too nervous...<br><br>The best is advise her to just take the test as another practice lesson... Let the tester know this is her 6th attempt... As long as she does not mount kerb or strike down any pole in the circuit (cos all the rest are watching mah), she will have a high chance of passing...</div>
