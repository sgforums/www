            <div class='col-md body'>Aiya, when we are 16 - 19 our definition of love is different mah.<br><br>When we are at that age, we have no responsibilities (besides being a good student), no need to bring the bread home, friendships are very pure, love is also very pure. All we care is that other person treat us well and that's enuff liao.<br><br>But when you grow older, after army, into Uni and work, you'll realise that your requirements of your partner change liao. Now you want pple who are more mature, stable, sensitive, easy to get along with (not only with you but with your frens and your FAMILY), can give you freedom/space etc etc. Your requirements all changed liao, of course you will have to change your partner also lor.<br><br>But there are cases where couples who fell in love during their schooling days got married in the end. I have 2 of such frens. And it has been so many years, but they are still as loving as before *sweet*.<br><br>Two of my teachers in my college were couples when they were studying in this same college, and now ? They are married and teaching there !<br><br>Well, some people just meet their right ones early, some just meet them late.</div>
