            <div class='col-md body'>I have my second personal major breakthrough for myself today. I just found out the one most super-interesting Â“thingÂ” in my life. I am so touch and impress of myself when I first realise it. As a person who believes in Astrology, as a person who has who has the Sun in Gemini AND the Moon in Gemini, I am aware that I am a person that is all based on avid curiosity, on finding things out and then quickly moving on to something else.<br><br>My mental cycle has always come and go this way:<br><br>1. Â“This is so boring, time to find something new, something interesting.Â”<br><br>When I have something interesting:<br><br>2. Â“Aha, I have found something interesting, lets spend sometime to see      what it is all about.Â”<br><br>After spending some time analysing what is so interesting, I will definitely go back to stage one again in a short period of time. This mental cycle of mine keeps repeating itself in a loop. Thus finding something very interesting has always been an ongoing effort for me. And finally, after 24 years of human life, I have Â“discoveredÂ” it. And this super-interesting Â‘thingÂ” that I have discovered is something which everyone of us has and everyone will be interested in throughout your entire life regardless of any other external and interesting events happening around you.<br><br>For those who have not Â“discoveredÂ” it yet, this super-interesting Â“thingÂ” is actually yourself (or your own mind to be more exact, NOT YOUR PHYSICAL BODY). I am coming up with some questions just to explain why:<br><br>Start asking yourself some questions:<br><br>How much do you know about yourself?<br>Very little.<br><br>How much time do you spend analysing and studying yourself?<br>Very little.<br><br>You mean you spend many hours, many days, many months, many years studying, learning and working with people, languages, business, science, arts, technology e.t.c and you fail to spend time analysing and studying yourself?<br>Yes, that is exactly what I have doing for the past XX years of my life.<br><br>So what can be a more interesting topic to study, research and analyse other than yourself? What can be more interesting to explore and analyse other than yourself?<br>(spend sometime to think about it)Â… Â… Â… Â…<br><br>If your answer is: Â“There is absolutely nothing more interesting other than myself!!!Â”, then you have just discovered what I have just discovered. Otherwise, you may have a long way ahead to go before you finally pay more attention to yourself.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks....quite interesting.....<br><br>But it is difficult to study oneself.<br><br>Perhaps that is why we have psychiatrists and psychologists, or also social workers etc, people who can observe us and study us from outside. It is very difficult to study oneself u know?<br><br>Maybe one method is Buddhism, that is one teaching where we examine ourselves and our minds. Or other forms of meditation etc, but I still think it's very difficult.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>so, de mirror is my best fren??</blockquote>The mirror is quite useless for it cannot see deep into a person's mind.<br><br><blockquote>so ur point is that u found urself the most interesting thing?</blockquote>Yes that is exactly the point. Our minds are actually plain pure simple, yet at some times, so damn complex.<br><br>For example, when you are sleeping, 100% unconscious, you have absolute zero awareness of what is happening around your body. When your mind is at this stagnant stage, time, self-identity, emotions, power, rank, status, money (or maybe I should say absolutely everything) has no substance or meaning to you (your mind).<br><br>And when you wake up, suddenly, the concept of time, self-identity, emotions, power, rank, status, money and everything else starts to flood into your mind.<br><br>Don't you find that your mind is so ever super interesting?<br>At the stagnant stage, everything has no meaning to your mind.<br>At the active stage, everything you think, feel or do has have a meaning to it.<br><br>So everyday (assuming you sleep and wake up everyday), your mind will go in this cycle:<br>everything has no meaning -&gt; everything has a meaning -&gt; everything has no meaning -&gt; everything has a meaning -&gt; everything has no meaning -&gt; everything has a meaning....... (and so on, infinite loop)<br><br>Then, suddenly one day, a big question<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">will pop up in your mind? Why is my mind behaving such a interesting way???<br><br>To me, it is quite obvious to me that our mind is always around, whether we are 100% unconscious or 100% conscious, or half-conscious, our minds are always around, just that we rarely pay attention to it or even notice it.<br><br><blockquote>But it is difficult to study oneself.</blockquote>Yes, I agree it is difficult to study oneself. But then again, I cannot see any reason why we should not be studying ourself. Most of the time I spend studying oneself is during my bedtime. So saying no time to study oneself is a poor excuse to me since you can even do it while lying on your bed every night.</div>
