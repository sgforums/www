No ill intentions, but it's like even for foreigners who travel to singapore, there are reminders that drugs are strictly forbidden here and the offence is punishable by death.<br><br>Yet we still have people trying to smuggle drugs into singapore. a good example is the australian-born vietnamese who was hanged some time back. shall not go into details.<br><br>a rarer case is the illegal possession and discharge of firearms. self explanatory. example will be the one-eyed-dragon.<br><br>so, point here is; know the country's law well enough. if you get caught you can't claim ignorance. live by the law. if not suffer from the consequences.<br><br>btw, you can check out the Singapore Penal Code. It lists the offences that are punishable by death.</div>

I guess those who commit a death penalty will realise their mistake while they are on the way to hang, but nt while they are doing it... just like u and me won't know the feeling of death until we reach the day.<br>I got a fren of mine who behaved wilfully since young, like to abuse drugs and drives a car after high... ended up in an car accident and nearly die but luckly he survived.<br>After tis incident he change to another person, behave in a well manner and start to counsel those young drugs offender.. seeing him change totally to another person as a fren i happy for him,and i did ask him wat makes u change ?<br>The ans he gave me was "when i'm near death then i realise tat wat i hv done was wrong,thinking tat if  got a chance to survive i will not wan to behave in tis manner anymore...<br><br>If u did something wrong would u want ppl to give u a chance or just wan them to mark u forever?<br><br>Just my point of view. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

In fact I just read that most of the countries which have no capital punishment have a lower crime rate than those which do. Further more just read in wikipedia than more wrongful execution is also possible. For example, there  is at least one person who has exonerated due to DNA evidence from the death penalty every year since 1992. There may countless others who may have been wrongly executed. Thus capital punishment should never exist. Thats my opinion</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well from what i have seen in videos where pple are strangled or hanged , the body will jerk n squirm involuntarily some will keep kicking their legs till it stops , some will jerk their body till the very last breath then the body becomes soft in the case of guys i don't know if special knots have to be used but even in olden days , it is known that man when they are hanged will ejaculate due to certain natural reaction .   In the case of beheading , the face will still be able to move for a few more seconds due to the blood still inside the head before flowing out of the head , the body will jerk and move as in the video that i see the body was tied up and after the head was chopped of by a guilotine , the body will squirm and can see the hands appearing to be trying to grab something and the legs will also jerk and squirm for quite sometime untill most of the blood had left the body then it becomes motionless due to reflex or whatever reactions by the nerves and tendons . As for electric chair , some of the victims will have blood flowing out of their eyes , nose mouth ears before they actually die and even after they die , there will be a stench of burned flesh in the air .  For the czase of gunshot to the head , it is most horrible as the bullet will pierce through the head n make a big splatter of the brain behind it and the whole head is most of the time is cracked open by 1 quarter . So most likely you can see a quarter of the skull on the floor and the brain bits on the ground or wall behind it . Some countries esp china even after giving them a shot to their heart , they will go to the body n give another shot to the head if they suspect the prisoner haven die or may not die . So my conclusion is if you want to die with a " proper " body , i think hanging is still the best as in the case of lethal injection , poison are known to turn their bone black in colour and i don't know if it will affect the appearance the rest of the body anot .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>nah.. capital punishment isnt as effective as most of us think it is..<br><br>death isn't our number 1 fear... lol...<br><br>Method 1:<br>I would rather punish offenders by making them work as slaves and contribute to society.<br><br>- Make them work at factories or manufacturing plants 20 hours a day for their entire life. Place tremendous amount of stress on them by telling them that they will face the death sentence if they fail to work 20 hours a day.<br><br>90% of what they earn goes to the victim's family/charity, 10% goes to the society.<br><br>Imagine the million of work hours they can contribute to society in their life time.<br><br>OR<br><br>Method 2:<br>Analyse the offenders, find their number 1 fear.<br>- e.g.<br>If the offender is claustrophobic (most people are), confine him in a small space with a strap-jacket in total darkness for 10 hours everyday.<br><br>------------------------<br>I don't think anyone would dare to commit crimes with such punishments in place.  Even if they do so, good for us... Method 2 isn't used because it would probably violate international human right laws. I think Saddam had used them b4. lol..</div>
