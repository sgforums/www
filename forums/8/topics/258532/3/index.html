It is my belief that if I were to be the judge/government/ruler of any country. I will make sure that my citizens are safe from harm from within the country. It is my liability to ensure them that their trust in my safety is correctly placed.<br><br>How many will turn over a new leaf and live a better life? How can you ensure that? How can you repay the lives destroyed by his/her hands? And also, such strict laws are there to reduce the amount of people committing such crimes. If death penalty is not there, the rates of such hideous crimes to be committed will increase tremendously. And since such law is there and it so happens that someone breaks it, it's only right for us to punish them.<br><br>Those who are Chinese might have heard of this saying, sa1 ji1 xia4 hou2.

            <div class='col-md body'>I still support firing squad instead of hanging bcos the bullet will shatter in the brain and cause instant death. It is not to the torso like in computer games but to the back of the head. The mess can easily be wiped up or they can execute in the field and dig a hole first in front of them and then bury them as they fall in dead. How clean and efficient. The govt can easily pay for the bullets bcos why they collect taxpayer's money for? Hanging is still one of the most cruel forms of execution. I would like to hear from those who are working in the execution room of our police. I heard no criminal could walk straight upon seeing the noose. Why subject them to such great fright? In the case of firing squad, it's not so fearful i think cos the gun fires from the back not front and it's fast. I still think hanging is  to scare and i must admit it really scares would be criminals. You hear many movie characters say "yi qiang bi le wo" - one shot to kill me. That's all it takes-one shot! How happy! People even kill lame horses etc with one shot to the head to minimise its suffering. I also support lethal injection bcos i think doctors will be there to inject some anaethesia but i could be wrong.</div>

In judicial hanging there is a fracture of the second cervival vertebra (bilateral fractures of the pedicles), tearing of the ligaments and with distraction (separation) between the the first and second cervical vertebrae.  The cervical spinal cord is severed.<br><br>There is no compression of the trachea (windpipe) possible for a simple reason, the fracture is too high and roughly corresponds  to the level of the larynx, which is above the trachea.
