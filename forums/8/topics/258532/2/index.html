Your senses would have been in overload.. you won't feel anything.<br><br>Likewse if someone walks up to you and without warning swings a punch at your face - you will similarly black out and awake on the ground not knowing what happened.<br><br>Best execution is; tell the condemned person that he's free to go, as he turns around and walk away in great relief, shoot his head off.<br><br>Not knowing anything is the fastest, and most "painless" way.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there was one article i read during the time where vietnamese drug trafficker was going to hang - it describes how the hangman goes about preparing the death sentence in Singapore, very chilling - they describe every detail including the thickness of rope, how long is the noose and also the weight to use, all based on a formula - to make sure the condemmed really die.<br><br>I think the death penalty is neccessary, otherwise Singapore will be crawling with drug peddlars who won't think twice to bring more harm to the victims.  Although harsh but it serve as a stern warning to all to be offenders to think twice.<br><br>I heard if you face a firing squad and you din die, you are free to go?  Is it true?</div>

Yes, it is called the Death Sentence - not Painful-death Sentence, or Excruciating-death Penalty.<br><br>If Death equals to Justice, it should only be DEATH brought upon the criminal swiftly. Not slowly and excruciatingly. To maintain that insufferable pain and discomfort be incorporated purposefully, society is no better than the condemned criminal. It becomes REVENGE. Not Justice.<br><br>If we are humans, we should always endeavor to remain HUMANE. As far as I am concerned, the taking away of one's life, is punishment enough.
