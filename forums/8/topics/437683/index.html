              <p><strong>8 Aug</strong> – She may not be a celebrity of any sort but a pub 
              singer from Mainland China has managed to get quoted by a China Press report for 
              her declaration that Singaporean men are "arrogant, short and ugly" but she 
              would still "marry one of them for their money".</p>
              <p>The daily quoted The New Paper report which interviewed a Zhang Miao Yu, 26, 
              from Zi'an, Mainland China, who has been working in the Southeast Asian republic 
              for the past five months, currently at Shanghai Dolly.</p>
              <p>Zhang was quoted as saying that felt Singaporean men were "arrogant and 
              short" and "not as handsome as men from China" but she said she still wanted to 
              marry a Singaporean.</p>
              <p>She felt the men might be workaholics but they would "compensate" her by 
              giving lavish gifts and take her out in expensive cars.</p>
              <p>The source further elaborated that dating service intel revealed that foreign 
              women would criticise Singaporean men but they would still marry one because of 
              the financial stability such a union offered them.</p>
              <p>It is said that many women did not mind being mistresses as long as the men 
              were rich.</p>

              <p>Feminists are not necessarily anti-male. They are, however, anti-macho -- just like me.</p>
              <p>Machismo is that irrational code of society that abuses children by mandating that "girls be protected" while "boys be tough". Feminists and I agree with the opinion that "children should be treated in a genderless manner".</p>

              'Radical' Feminists are at odds with Moderate Feminists because 'Radical' feminists are very open and public about being anti-men while thier moderate counterparts may reject publicly but privately endorse the radicalism. One thing is for sure.. they do not hold men in high regard and view the institutions of today a result of patriachial oppresion on them.
              
              So... unless you have a degree hatred to men.. I dont see why u are a 'radical' feminist..
              
              I get the whole Machoism thingy.. but still... u know. Its like saying you are a Radical Christian but u dont believe in Jesus, but a  Creator. Hence U can't really say you are a Christian. So I am just a bit confused.

              <p>1. I'm radically feminist in the sense that I believe in treating children in a genderless manner at all costs.</p>
              <p>2. There is something I REALLY hate about the men of society: they treat girls "better" than boys.</p>
              <p>Read below.</p>
              <p>'Pro-girl sexism' = society forces males of all ages to treat a
                                      girl-child "better" than boy-child of the same age and provide this
                                      treatment solely on the basis on gender.</p>
              <p>"Better" = the following:</p>
              <p>1. More compassion<br> 2. More sympathy<br> 3. More respect<br> 4. More gentleness<br> 5. More easiness<br> 6. More empathy<br> 7. More cleanliness<br> 8. More protection<br> 9. More luxury<br> 10. More personal space<br> 11. More privacy<br> 12. More security<br> 13. More freedom<br> 14. More modesty<br> 15. More decency</p>
              <p>... along with *less* physical contact.</p>
              <p>This 'pro-girl sexism' causes sweet boys [like Chen] to suffer
                                      in the hands of bitter girls [like Xinyi] and evil men [like
                                      Xinyi's father].</p>
              <p>On average, the adult woman:<br> <br> 1. Is physically weaker than the adult man<br> 2. Is more emotional than the adult man<br> 3. Is better behaved than the adult man<br> 4. Is far more likely to be a victim of opposite-gender violence
                                      [e.g. violence may be sexual, domestic, or spousal abuse] than the
                                      adult man<br> 5. Can get or be pregnant whereas the adult man can't<br> 6. Is physically more delicate than the adult man</p>
              <p>Also, it is likely natural for a man to want to treat an adult
                                      woman partially over an adult man -- this is seen in many mammalian
                                      species. For example in many species of large mammals -- such as
                                      bison --, the adult males are rough with each other but tender with
                                      the adult females.</p>
              <p>Due to this, I believe males of all ages should treat adult
                                      women "better" than adult men. However, NO male -- of any age --
                                      should *ever* be socially-mandated to treat girl-children better
                                      than boy-children because this will cause boys to develop an
                                      intense and life-long hatred for young girls and a hatred for the
                                      macho men who teach these boys to defer to girls. This sexism
                                      against boy children will likely cause boys to also despise society
                                      and it's irrational norms. In addition, it is *not* innate/instinctive for a male -- of any age -- to treat girls "better" than boys.</p>
              <p>In addition, science has already proven that average girl-child
                                      is NOT *innately*:</p>
              <p>1. Weaker<br> 2. More sensitive<br> 3. More delicate<br> 4. Lower-IQed<br> 5. Slower<br> 6. Less energetic<br> 7. Less aggresive<br> 8. Less violent<br> 9. Less cold-hearted [or more hot-hearted]<br> 10. Less openly abusive to members of the opposite gender<br> 11. Less openly sexist against members of the opposite gender<br> 12. More tense<br> 13. More emotional<br> 14. Less emotionally-stable<br> 15. More compassionate<br> 16. More mature in personality</p>
              <p>... than the average boy-child of the same age.</p>
              <p>Boy = male under 18 years of age = child</p>
              <p>Girl = female under 18 years of age = child</p>
              <p>Woman = female who is 18 years of age or older = adult</p>
              <p>Man = male who is 18 years of age or older = adult</p>

              How do explain why boy child are more naughty than girl child ? Why treat both the same when there are obvious differences in them ? I can understand how you see the psychological implications of such mandating on girl-child. But as u noticed, our institutions did not treat women any better in the begining of time. It is through eventual activism. Now, we still see feminists movemenst springing up all over. How sure are you that being genderless may in the end may be better off ?
              
              It's not easy to be truly objective. Its like trying to distinguish between objective true fact and subjective opinion.

              <p>If a boy-child is more naughty than a girl-child, it is because of the psychological trauma he experiences by being subjected to society's evil gender roles. *Innately*, a boy is no more mischevious than a girl of the same age.</p>
              <p>Gender stereotypes are detrimental to children. Kids need to be protected against them.</p>
              <p>This 'pro-girl sexism' I speak off has been there in all cultures ever since humans formed a society. From ancient times, the men of society have usually -- at least
                                      in public -- treated girl-children "better" than boy-children. This 'pro-girl sexism' is [and always was] *far* more intense in
                                      non-western cultures -- including that of Singapore -- than in
                                      western cultures.</p>
              <p>Here is my list of examples of non-western cultures:</p>
              <p>1. Natives American "Indian" cultures<br> 2. Latino cultures<br> 3. Russia<br> 4. All of Asia<br> 5. Turkey<br> 6. Kazakstan<br> 7. Nations run by Islamic fundamentalists<br> 8. All of Africa<br> 9. Eastern Europe<br> 10. All of what used to be in the Soviet Union location<br> 11. Romania<br> 12. South and Central Americas</p>
              <p>Please note: I'm not racist, after all, my ancestors are from
                                      Singapore. I'm of Tamilian descent but I was born and raised in
                                      USA. I can understand Tamil but I can't speak or write it.</p>
              <p>Here is how 'pro-girl sexism' started:<br> <br> It most likely started more than thousands of years ago with a
                                      small gang of strong macho men [the only male homo-sapien humans
                                      existing at the time] who decided that they would treat girls
                                      "better" than boys. The gang singled out male individuals and
                                      forced them to follow and enforce this rule -- they left the
                                      females alone. These male individuals joined the gang and -- out of
                                      extreme fear -- began following and enforcing the gang's pro-girl,
                                      anti-boy rules. More and more male individuals began joining this
                                      gang -- out of fear for their own safety -- and submitting to their
                                      oppressive anti-boy regime. This is how the anti-boy, pro-girl gang
                                      got bigger. Members of this gang began teaching their boy-children
                                      -- likely through extreme corporal punishments -- to follow these
                                      sexist rules and pass these rules onto the next generation of
                                      children. Fathers who didn't teach their boy-children to follow
                                      this sexism were singled out by the gang [which was now big enough
                                      to be considered a society] and horrifyingly mistreated along with
                                      their helpless sons.<br> <br> This is my theory as to why 'pro-girl sexism' exists. It exists for
                                      the same reason many other irrational, un-natural societal norms
                                      exists -- they are followed and enforced out of fear of facing
                                      social condemnation.<br> <br> This historical gang of humans I describe pretty much had similar
                                      rules of most of today's street gangs. If they want you, they force
                                      you to join, and if you try to leave, they torture and kill you. If
                                      they see you and don't want you, they torture and kill you
                                      regardless of your actions.</p>
              <p>Once again, 'pro-girl sexism' is not at all innate or instinctive. It is an
                                      example of learned behavior that is practiced out of fear and
                                      shame.</p>
