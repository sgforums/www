If a child is not what they want, then, personally, I really think abortion is the best thing to do, or rather, the least harmful method.<br><br>If they both want the child, keep it. Better to have a child grow up in a stable environment then bring it up in a family which doesn't welcome it.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, abortion is not pleasant. Its not to be taken lightly.

The only solution in our conservative Asian society is to marry her! I don't condone abortion but unless it is REALLY necessary (eg, both mother and child in danger, etc.) one shouldn't even think of it as a complete solution for teen pregnancy.<br><br>I've met a gal who's rather beautiful, she's already had a bf when I met her and my dream was never fulfilled. Anyway, the last time I heard, she was pregnant (at the age of 1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and got married to her bf (underground I think). Quit her studies and all that. Sigh... she's quite smart and ruined her bright future for just 15 minutes of pleasure  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> I don't really know the whole thing but if it's really just for the pleasure, I'd say she's really dumb.<br><br>DON'T DO IT! IF U MUST, WEAR A CONDOM!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, the status of abortion is less than 28 weeks in singapore legally. So if anyone is thinking of doing it..it should be way before the baby grows to that size ok?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u must really think very very carefully....<br>whether you settle down or to go for abortion...abortion does mean the relationship will fall apart tho high chances they will....but is it too silly to get into a marriage when you can't even afford to support yourself, so expect you to support your wife and child?? it is tough man...i dun like the idea of abortion coz it shows how irresponsible you can be but have to be practical at times too...if got marry and have a kid and the marriage falls apart.. it will bring great misery to 3 of you....at least I know a friend choose to marry his gf...and luckily he sign on in the army before so I guess he can manage to afford to have a babyt......really think twice before making the final decision.... do remember that aborting is bad for the gal too .... it will affect the chances of getting pregnent in future too...<br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But I'm a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
