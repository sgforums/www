It's because the grandmother suffers from dementia and also that the parents are both working. So rather then employing a maid to look after her, it's better for her to stay at the home where medical facilities are available.<br><br>And the fact that they visited her every weekend goes to show that their intention to send her there is not to dump her in the first place.</div>
