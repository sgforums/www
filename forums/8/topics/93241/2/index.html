I am not dissing him.<br><br>I am analyzing why most girls here would not want him to be their bf, coz they have only experienced him as a product by looks, not as a person, how many ppl have honestly met the guy??? Nil. Our info on him is 2nd hand, thus that minuses away the attraction factor. Jesus don't take everything with offence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interview with William Hung<br><br>Sarvas: Well William. First I'd like to congratulate you on your success.<br><br>Hung: Thank you. I am still sort of shocked, it is very weird. For example, being interviewed, I am just a very normal person, yet I have thousands of people who love me for my music.<br><br>Sarvas: I wouldn't quite say that. The only reason you're famous is because you're the punch line of a big Chink joke. You know that, right?<br><br>Hung: Well I never thought about it that way but I got lots of respect for my performance whether good or bad they like it. If they believe that... or don't believe... see, I am... well but not really... [mumbling]<br><br>Sarvas: Look buddy, you're going to have to speak English if we're going to do this. Now what the fuck did you just say?<br><br>Hung: What do you mean? I speak English well. I've lived in America for...<br><br>Sarvas: Yeah, I'd like to talk about that too. What the hell is a Chinese guy doing on a show called "American Idol?" Shouldn't you be on "Lip Sync Chink" or something?"<br><br>Hung: Look, if you are going to just make fun of me and my Chinese heritage, I do not want to do this interview.<br><br>Sarvas: Okay, sorry man. I apologize. How old are you?<br><br>Hung: I am twenty years old.<br><br>Sarvas: Wow, you look 12 or 13.<br><br>Hung: I get that a lot. I do not know why [laughs].<br><br>Sarvas: That's not funny. So you're a big Ricky Martin fan?<br><br>Hung: Yes, I am. He was my idol for the whole time growing up.<br><br>Sarvas: Oh. That explains why you suck so much.<br><br>Hung: I guess if I needed an excuse, that would be it. [laughter]<br><br>Sarvas: No seriously, you are a terrible singer. Your act is a joke. People don't like you for your talent. It's like retarded people, they're only funny because they take themselves seriously and we don't. Get it?<br><br>Hung: Again, I repeat what I said before. I try my best and get appreciated for it and people love me and that is all that really matters to me right now.<br><br>Sarvas: I see, and now you dropped out of College?<br><br>Hung: Yes I did. I must focus on my music career but I still like Engineering a lot.<br><br>Sarvas: Bad idea. Since you can't sing, the "Will Hung" fad will pass over just like all the other no-talent one hit media smashes out there. The "She Bangs" impact will dry up and you'll be left with no education and no career. That's how America works, don't you know?<br><br>Hung: No, hopefully that won't happen because I am really not all that bad of a singer and I do think that people will start to see that when I release my album. The performance on the American Idol was just...<br><br>Sarvas: Whatever. You blow. You aren't even worth my time anymore. Good bye.<br><br>Hung: Okay, talk to you later. Good interview.<br><br>Sarvas: No, actually it sucked.<br><br>Hung: Well I did my best and answered your questions to the best of my ability and I have no regrets at all.<br><br>Sarvas: Oh yeah? Well you can't sing, you can't dance, and you definately can't interview. So what are you going to say? [laughter]<br><br>Hung: You know, I have no professional training in interviews [laughter].<br><br>Sarvas: Har har, good one, Chink. Man, you're ugly. I don't know why any girls would want to marry you. Just look at your teeth and that scronny, prepubescent body. Yuck.<br><br>Hung: Why do you have to be like that? It makes no sense to be mean or prejudice at all, just like you are doing. I thought this was going to be an interview about me and my career. Not you giving me advice and insulting me like this.<br><br>Sarvas: Sorry, I got too nice and needed to balance it out with some good old fashioned racism.<br><br>Hung: I do not understand.<br><br>Sarvas: Whatever man. Good luck being eaten up and shit out by the American media monster. When you're a has-been wreck in 2 years, you can come back and tell me I was right.<br><br>Hung: This is not cool. You are not a nice person, I am done here. Good bye.<br><br>Sarvas: Go fuck yourself, Chink bastard.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Nelstaer:</div><div class="quote_body">Interview with William Hung<br><br>Sarvas: Well William. First I'd like to congratulate you on your success.<br><br>Hung: Thank you. I am still sort of shocked, it is very weird. For example, being interviewed, I am just a very normal person, yet I have thousands of people who love me for my music.<br><br>Sarvas: I wouldn't quite say that. The only reason you're famous is because you're the punch line of a big Chink joke. You know that, right?<br><br>Hung: Well I never thought about it that way but I got lots of respect for my performance whether good or bad they like it. If they believe that... or don't believe... see, I am... well but not really... [mumbling]<br><br>Sarvas: Look buddy, you're going to have to speak English if we're going to do this. Now what the fuck did you just say?<br><br>Hung: What do you mean? I speak English well. I've lived in America for...<br><br>Sarvas: Yeah, I'd like to talk about that too. What the hell is a Chinese guy doing on a show called "American Idol?" Shouldn't you be on "Lip Sync Chink" or something?"<br><br>Hung: Look, if you are going to just make fun of me and my Chinese heritage, I do not want to do this interview.<br><br>Sarvas: Okay, sorry man. I apologize. How old are you?<br><br>Hung: I am twenty years old.<br><br>Sarvas: Wow, you look 12 or 13.<br><br>Hung: I get that a lot. I do not know why [laughs].<br><br>Sarvas: That's not funny. So you're a big Ricky Martin fan?<br><br>Hung: Yes, I am. He was my idol for the whole time growing up.<br><br>Sarvas: Oh. That explains why you suck so much.<br><br>Hung: I guess if I needed an excuse, that would be it. [laughter]<br><br>Sarvas: No seriously, you are a terrible singer. Your act is a joke. People don't like you for your talent. It's like retarded people, they're only funny because they take themselves seriously and we don't. Get it?<br><br>Hung: Again, I repeat what I said before. I try my best and get appreciated for it and people love me and that is all that really matters to me right now.<br><br>Sarvas: I see, and now you dropped out of College?<br><br>Hung: Yes I did. I must focus on my music career but I still like Engineering a lot.<br><br>Sarvas: Bad idea. Since you can't sing, the "Will Hung" fad will pass over just like all the other no-talent one hit media smashes out there. The "She Bangs" impact will dry up and you'll be left with no education and no career. That's how America works, don't you know?<br><br>Hung: No, hopefully that won't happen because I am really not all that bad of a singer and I do think that people will start to see that when I release my album. The performance on the American Idol was just...<br><br>Sarvas: Whatever. You blow. You aren't even worth my time anymore. Good bye.<br><br>Hung: Okay, talk to you later. Good interview.<br><br>Sarvas: No, actually it sucked.<br><br>Hung: Well I did my best and answered your questions to the best of my ability and I have no regrets at all.<br><br>Sarvas: Oh yeah? Well you can't sing, you can't dance, and you definately can't interview. So what are you going to say? [laughter]<br><br>Hung: You know, I have no professional training in interviews [laughter].<br><br>Sarvas: Har har, good one, Chink. Man, you're ugly. I don't know why any girls would want to marry you. Just look at your teeth and that scronny, prepubescent body. Yuck.<br><br>Hung: Why do you have to be like that? It makes no sense to be mean or prejudice at all, just like you are doing. I thought this was going to be an interview about me and my career. Not you giving me advice and insulting me like this.<br><br>Sarvas: Sorry, I got too nice and needed to balance it out with some good old fashioned racism.<br><br>Hung: I do not understand.<br><br>Sarvas: Whatever man. Good luck being eaten up and shit out by the American media monster. When you're a has-been wreck in 2 years, you can come back and tell me I was right.<br><br>Hung: This is not cool. You are not a nice person, I am done here. Good bye.<br><br>Sarvas: Go fuck yourself, Chink bastard.<br></div></blockquote>Seriously? I wouldn;t be surprised if they did that. Its like the whites to do so.</div>
