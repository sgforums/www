            <div class='col-md body'>Parents wan us to live in certain ways not because they want to control us but becos they love us, albeit in a wrong way. We must understand this if we want to live for ourselves. If we resent our parents for trying to control our lives, then the starting point is all wrong. MY parents use to control me but i guess i keep reminding myself that they love me and care for me, thats why they would wan to choose what they think is best, if they dun care, they wud just leave me to die.<br><br>But yet i wanted certain things in life and guess what i did? Simplest thing in life, communicate. Not once, weeks or months, It took years where finally my parents just say, ok go do what u wan, as long you dun committ a crime.<br><br>The fact is that most of us dun and shouldnt live for ourselves. Anyone who have parents and live just for themselves are irresponsible and should be shot. We need to support our parents and be sensitive to their feelings in every action we take. If they are not happy, communicate, we cannot say this is my life, i am grown up, you are not in my plans.<br><br>For me, I live for my loved ones so that I can have the peace of mind to live for myself.</div>

We must understand this if we want to live for ourselves. If we resent our parents for trying to control our lives, then the starting point is all wrong. MY parents use to control me but i guess i keep reminding myself that they love me and care for me, thats why they would wan to choose what they think is best, if they dun care, they wud just leave me to die.<br><br>But yet i wanted certain things in life and guess what i did? Simplest thing in life, communicate. Not once, weeks or months, It took years where finally my parents just say, ok go do what u wan, as long you dun committ a crime.<br><br>The fact is that most of us dun and shouldnt live for ourselves. Anyone who have parents and live just for themselves are irresponsible and should be shot. We need to support our parents and be sensitive to their feelings in every action we take. If they are not happy, communicate, we cannot say this is my life, i am grown up, you are not in my plans.<br><br>For me, I live for my loved ones so that I can have the peace of mind to live for myself.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well.. i think i am very lucky to haf parents who r very understanding and leaves alot of things to me... well.. mabbe its oso cos whenever they tried to control too much of me i would start to stonewall on them. since my choosing of secondary school, i haf been given a lot of freedom to do things as i wish. im grateful cos it makes me independent as i am now. and o cos i think it takes a piece of stress away from them too cos they wont need to worry for me and decide for me oso. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i hate to be dictated but i can't deny tt parents eat salt more than we eat rice......<br>i do listen to them and then analyse for myself.......but im the one who make the ultimate decision whether i wanna do it onot......<br><br>if the issue is about getting a degree.....it's more of societal pressure rather than their own "expectations".....singapore is a bery pragmatic place......and parents will want us to be able to survive in this competitive environment.....<br></div>
