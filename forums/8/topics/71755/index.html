Just feel proud that you're earning your own keep and not begging for money...<br><br>as for the not clicking with friends part... since you two just started a few months ago... take the time to go out on your own... just the two of you. Build on that relationship first before friends come into the picture. This is supposed to be your time to establish a foundation to your relationship, so talk to your gf and get her to understand why it's more important to just spend time with each other rather than in a big group of friends. One benefit of this is after you have better understood each other and the relationship is more stable, there is less room for conflict because your partner will understand your feelings when you are out with her friends. In a way, try to get her to stand on your side first. If she understands how awful you feel, she may be able to talk to her friends or do something to make it less uncomfortable for you when you meet her friends. And vice versa.<br><br>Ultimately, the relationship is between the two of you... so for the moment, date just each other... not yours or her friends.</div>
