            <div class='col-md body'>Im currently a student in ITE Clementi taking E Commerce. I took my O levels in 2000 and 2001. Initially I intended to take my O levels again last year, but I was 2 months late. Now I think that I would like to retake my o levels again in a private school, say YMCA, but my parents will sure not allow. The reason why I dun have any hopes for carrying on my E commerce studies is because I think that I aint learning much and I wish to complete my studies as soon as possible and go into the army. After Army I would like to go to TP. However, I will be aniticipating alot of criticism and scoldings from alot of ppl. The reason is because I have a chance to study, but now Im giving it up, taking some risk to have something better.</div>
