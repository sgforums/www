            <div class='col-md body'>Taking off is a great experience.  To be thrown against ur seat, speeding down the runway and finally breaking out of the clutches of gravity.  But its not always the case. 1 experience was particularly.... scary.<br><br>I was on a flight back to singapore taking off from bogota's airport.  The plane was an old 737 or 767, cant remember.  There were tonnes of ppl onboard, and lots of overweight luggages.  Hence it was an overweight flight.  2ndly, bogota is seated on top of a plateau, hence air is a bit thinner.  So there i was in my window seat.<br><br>As we sped down the runway, i felt the pilot pitch up the aircraft midway thru.  The rumbling stopped for a while, as the wheels lost contact with the earth, then... BUMP, we were rumbling again... we didn manage to take off.  With only half the runway ahead of us, i thot we'd turn around and try again. But no, the pilot wacked full throttle and tried again, failing... i estimated about 3/4 of the runway remaining.  I thot, maybe now he'd turn around...  NO.  He continued all the way and finally he brought the aircraft into the air... and barely a sec as we lifted off, I saw the runway threshold flash past.... TOO CLOSE for my comfort.<br><br>2nd experience, flying over my fav shithole.  Tekong.  Was seated behind some jap tourist.  Who spoke excellent english by the way.   And as we were coming in on final approach, we'd zoom past p.tekong.  She pointed out "THAT" island... and asked, "wow... its beautiful... is that an island resort or something?? "  I sniggered and answered... haha yeap... its "shangri La tekong."   But i finally explained that it was our BMT training island.  Which impressed a bunch of tourist, to some extent.</div>

To be thrown against ur seat, speeding down the runway and finally breaking out of the clutches of gravity.

There were tonnes of ppl onboard, and lots of overweight luggages.  Hence it was an overweight flight.  2ndly, bogota is seated on top of a plateau, hence air is a bit thinner.
