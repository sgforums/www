              <p><strong>Tajikistan Moves to Ban Russian Language</strong></p>
              <p>DUSHANBE, July 23 (RIA Novosti) - Tajikistan's
                      president has proposed banning the Russian language from being used in
                      public institutions and official documents, a move he said would
                      promote the development of Tajik and bolster patriotism in the country.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br></strong>
              </span></span></p><h1><strong>"The
                      dignity of a nation is determined, above all, by how people preserve
                      and respect their language," Emomali Rakhmon said in a televised
                      address late on Wednesday.</strong></h1>
              <strong><br><br>Rakhmon urged a new language law to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> amend 1989 legislation that defined Tajik as the official language and
                      Russian as a language of "interethnic communication," which gave the
                      latter a de facto official status allowing people to use it in dealing
                      with authorities, and receive information and documents in Tajik or
                      Russian.</span><br><br>The new draft law proposed by the president and
                      submitted to parliament obliges all nationals to know Tajik and speak
                      it in official situations and public workplaces.<br><br>The president
                      criticized newspaper journalists for a poor knowledge of Tajik, for
                      using clumsy or misleading phrases and terminology, and even making
                      spelling mistakes.</strong><p></p>
              <p><strong>In the Soviet period, Russian was the lingua franca
                      among the various ethnic groups in Tajikistan and other ex-Soviet
                      republics. Many ethnic Russians have fled Tajikistan since the breakup
                      of the Soviet Union and the ensuing civil war, but Russian is still
                      spoken by much of the native population.<br><br>Russian is still an
                      official language in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and it is also
                      widely spoken in Ukraine and some other parts of the former Soviet
                      Union.</strong></p>

              <p><br>no, from young, i lost my mother, so i do alot of washing cloth, floor and plates myself, cos grandma and grandpa still have to tends to business and Dad was a spoilt son then, who like to flirt around. Therefore at a very young age, i already do washing and learned the hard knock of life, whereas most singaporeans of my age will be happily having maids and enjoying young life, cos their parents rich mah, can give them generation of funds also can.</p>

              <p>therefore at this tender age, and as a gal, i know what is right and what is wrong. Uncle, you must alway remember these two words in chinese, heaven and earth, or Tien Sia...for the sake of all peoples, let him be, dun mess up a civil war and all of us will suffer. So, please have heart within, i know who you are and why you hate him, but life is not about hatre and revengeful, it got more meaning to it.</p>
