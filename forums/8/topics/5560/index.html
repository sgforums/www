            <div class='col-md body'>If u want to be clinical about it, there are a couple types.<br><br>1. Love: An act or action to show someone else or something that u care for it...ie...hugs, kiss, petting..etc..etc...<br><br>2. love: The act of having sex but calling it "love" for the girls sake so she does what u want. :-)  I'm sure to recieve a beat-down for this.<br><br>3. love: The feeling that is shared between two people who care about each other beyond the platonic sense.  Baiscally it's a feeling.<br><br>Doubtless, u are talking about the 3rd meaning.  That's the short edited version of love.  Then there are different levels of love within this category.<br><br>I don't know, but for me, love can be anyhting from a feeling that a couple mutually share that somehow, they have known each other forever, even though they only recently just met.  Or it can be a love grown from the appreciation and understanding of a person and acceptance of his/her ways.<br><br>I don't know, it's just so many things  I don't think that u can list them down or explain it.<br><br>I guess that's why so many people "love" other people in accordance with the number 2 definition.   :-)<br><br>I'm sure I haven't, but i hope it gave u something to think about...:-)<br><br>Happy hunting</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Love in its purest form, is certainly without lust.<br>It's about giving wholeheartedly and not seeking anything in return. If it's reciprocated, it's a blessing.<br>However, the "love" that existed in our society these days is "conditional love", that is there's always conditions attached to loving someone. "I love you, and hence you must love me back." "I love you, but you don't love me anymore, and hence I won't love you too. If necessary, I'll hate you."<br>I used to be amazed that how can someone love another so deeply before, and yet lose all his/her feelings so quickly, and turned to hate his/her former lover.<br>Perhaps, they don't really love the other, they love themselves too much, and hence when they are hurt(by the rejection), unkind words/feelings are directed at the other party. It's sad, but I've seen too many cases.<br>"I love you." People have been abusing these words to achieve their personal aims, whatever it might be. To me, I think there isn't much value left in them, if you really love someone, show it with actions. Saying it and making empty promises makes you a hypocrite.<br>But then, seems that people r really gullible, they like to fall for jerks instead of those who really care for others but are just too shy and/or too inarticulate to express their feelings. I feel sorry for all the nice guys/gals out there who are left in the cold. Perhaps that's life.<br>I wonder why so many people are concerned about the exterior shell, what's the point if the internal is rotting? Looks don't last.<br>I often wonder how many couples really understand each other? How many can communicate by just looking into each other's eyes? And how many failed to understand simple hand gestures from each other?<br>Many seemed to be seeking prefection in their partners, but what actually matters is that they are prefect for each other. People are often disappointed when they discover inprefection, many failed to understand that to love means to accept each other's flaws.<br>I also noted that many people start a relationship before they really understand each other. It seems that it's like a trial test, if it works, that's great. If it isn't, then the experience is bitter.<br><br>This brings about another question, do platonic friendship ever exist?<br><br>Things to ponder about...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Love can't be defined? I disagree. Why people can't define it is probably because the word's been so warped and used and abused and thrown around that nobody can recognise it when it pops up and mistakes everything else for it.<br><br>Love is NOT eros. You can love your girlfriend/boyfriend, you can love your mother you can love your best buddy, you can love your next-door neighbor, you can love the stranger on the MRT. Heck, if you're a good enough person, you could even love the guy who stabbed you in the back at work the day before.<br><br>Love is everything that is good. It's not a <span style="font-style: italic;">feeling</span> or an euphoric rush, it's a labour and a service. Good doesn't mean "good for you" it means good for everyone else. Loving because it will ultimately benefit you ISN'T love, it's selfishness. Patience, kindness, temperance, humility, goodness, forgiveness, not seeking repayment... these are some of the characteristics of love and anything that isn't these isn't love.<br><br>It's about sacrifice, and in today's selfish, "it's all about me" world, the real meaning of love has been replaced by a selfish, relationship-based eros and the true meaning and practise of it has been lost to the new generation(s). Imagine if everyone could really selflessly do the things mentioned above! It would turn the world upside down, for the better. So WHY DON'T WE???<br><br>I guess it all comes down to us not being humble enough, not being brave enough, not being wise enough, not being selfless enough to show some love. HRC kinda got some of it right - "Love all, serve all." To love is to be the lowest servant indeed.

This is the most complicated form of love. However, this is also the "biggest" love topic that people are always talking about.

I never read it before but it almost cost me my relationship with someone. She quotes too much things from there and it is not too good.

            <div class='col-md body'>What's love???<br>At the age of 23, I still don't understand it... or feel any of it... what I mean is, is it just physical attraction or some other stuffs...? I can like anybody ... anyone who's pretty and accept their flaws... If that's the case, anybody can be my possible<br>partner. So, which is the right one?<br>I believe in fate...and doesn't believe in<br>going all out chasing that some of the guys did... They said that you got to put in effort in chasing, waiting near "their targets" home setting up opportunities...<br>Gals get touched by their sincerity after sometime, fall in love with them??? Is it more of a feeling of sympathy or is it true love? It takes two hands to clap, so why should gals play hard to catch? If you like someone, call them...isn't it so?<br>I have a friend who recently fall out with his gal... she said that his future is still uncertain cos he doesn't have a career as he's still in NS. What crap is that???<br>I see it as a poor excuse, yes the future is<br>uncertain but isn't that what couples do...<br>going though thick and thin, standing by each other? Now, I'm confused... with the meaning<br>of true love in our modern society... gals getting materialistic and such...<br>Not that I'm that bad looking (in fact I'm quite alright, phew  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
