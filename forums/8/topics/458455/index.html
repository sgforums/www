Let's say a condo 5rm is abt 900k and located out of town but near basic amenities like mrt station and shopping centre. If rent, I can stay anywhere loh- city area or near my workplace for easy commute plus I don't need 5 rms anyway. (I assume that I'm single my whole life for simplicity sake. I know this might not be possible, but just assume that this is the fact here.) renting would be 3-5k for 1rm with good location and ulitilty bills. If its 5k, then I can live in great rented conditions for 180 months or 15 years which is not bad. And to think that all the bills other people will "help" me settle, I live near town so commute has less stress and I can work more effectively&amp; so earn more kacchhhing! Maybe the downside is that even after graduating, I must get a job that earns more than 5k (dam tough I know) though not all jobs need you to stay-out (live in your own home). And also the fact that most of my salary will be channeled to paying rent.  But also true that I might not love in a rented home 24/7 and I can get a rented apartment as and when I like. Renting seems good leh... Very tempting - so do you people still think it makes sense to buy your own house or just go ahead and rent one apartment? To those who are living in rented apartments now, what's your rationale for staying in rented apartments rather than buying and owning your own home? </p></div>

              <p><br>u must be a stinkin cheena - only cheap labor have this type of mentality. others the category of sgrans wanting to rent a place other than their homes are U-students who find cost of hostels too high over any possible rental. for your problem - no one wants to know actuallly.</p>

              <p>if u paid for a bought 3room flat or even a "castle" in spore,once u need to move out overseas,default all payments or sell it u get what u paid in return,but the losses if u rent cant be recovered .not a cent.</p>

              <p>i think hdb could have made laws forbidding same treatment on pr with subsidised gov flats meant for sporeans due to shortage of flats.so that could explain the rental stigma.i have never come across where any country lets pr get all acceess to gov subsidised homes or education even.they all need to be paid.</p>

              <p>army21, I'm in NS now so I've got the luxury of time to think and plan for this stuff. As a Singaporean like most of us here, we would the find cost of living high and planning is a great way to get ahead. The premium we pay for nearly everything is in exchange for the peace and security we get as well as the close proximity of ammenities we have in our neighbourhoods. Apart from the patriotism, I want to stay here in Singapore. </p>
              <p>I wish I could be that 1mil chinaman and pay for the HDB upfront. Don't we all.</p>
