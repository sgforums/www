Sender will be given a tracking code.  Ask for the tracking code and the post office can find it with ease.  Don't think the sender has placed insufficient postage though.  If the sender indicated a return address, it will go back to him if the recieving address is wrong.  But if both addresses are wrong then we know where it goes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
