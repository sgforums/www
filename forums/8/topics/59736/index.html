And they gave up since 2001/2002 probably they received too much criticism.</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The Asia-Pac region is too diverse to rank fairly Â– East Asia (East plus SE Asia), South Asia and Australia/NZ Unis <strong>are organized and run quite differently, quite like comparing puppies and birds</strong>.  <strong>South Asian unis can score amazingly high in Â‘exclusivityÂ’ </strong>since too many students fighting to enter limited unis / places - but exclusivity was given not much pointsÂ…..(anyone heard the amazing IIT?).<br><br><strong>Aust/NZ, like many Western unis, score better than East &amp; South Asian unis in Â‘international researchÂ’ </strong><strong>but this criteria was given very little credit/points; contrary to most other international ranking of unis e.g. in UK or North America.   </strong><br><br>Next unfairness is<strong> NOT considering Â‘MONEY from?Â’</strong>. <strong> It donÂ’t account for the fact that some are govt-linked / govt helped unis that got money pumped into them in ALL AREAs without much effort from Unis e.g. NUS, NTU in Singapore and ANU in Australia</strong>.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>These government funds/$$ give HUGE ADVANTAGES to those unis <strong>and help them in ALL CRITERIAS considered by the ranking Â– helping them directly via improving branding/prestige, research funds, $$ for good staff etc.  </strong> There could be other similar unis too e.g. those in China, HK and Japan. (I just mentioning a few)<br><br>Another STUPID criteria is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one significant percentage (20 or 30%) of the total score is based on </span>Â‘<strong>General ExpenditureÂ’ </strong>Â– i.e. <strong>the more u spend, the higher ranked u are!!!,</strong> <span style="font-style: italic;">so unis chiefs can leave all lights and machines on at night to boost their ranking!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><strong>Internet connectivity is included but not other more important criterias</strong>. </span><br><br>The worst of all this having a Â‘<strong>TECHNOLOGICAL uniÂ’ category to give Â‘new birdÂ’ techno unis  artificially high ranking opportunity by Â‘protectingÂ’ them from NORMAL/comprehensive unis</strong>. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is how <strong>Curtin, RMIT, Queensland U of Tech </strong>can slip into the ranking tableÂ…..under the Â‘technological unisÂ’</span>.<br><br>The <strong>IRONY is that most of these 'techno' unis' local and overseas students are enrolled under their  COMMERCE/BIZ faculties </strong>(similar or even more than normal/comprehensive unis), <strong>not engineering/science/technology </strong>as should be expected under Â‘technoÂ’ unis. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>These fake Â‘Top UnisÂ’ from TECHNO category <strong>also advertise overseas OR have EXTERNAL DEGRESS on their BUSINESS COURSES, NOT TECHNOLOGICAL COURSES</strong>Â….

However, I think that the grounds for distinction meed more clarification.<br><br>Agreed, the postgrad unis have more funding for research, but the question would be why this is so.  I put it to you that the research function takes much more time and effort to build up than the teaching function, mainly because research funding is in great part influenced by the reputation of the research organization and of the researchers themselves.  Even if you assembled a group of reputable researchers, the reputation of the group itself would take time to build up.<br><br>The implication of this, then, is that an undergraduate uni can eventually Â“growÂ” into a postgrad uni, but this process is of course not automatic.  The other factor influencing the process is the culture of the uni.  This is reflected in the amount of time the academics spend on class contact hours and on research Â– those from the undergrad unis spend much more time in classes and consultations with undergrad students than those from postgrad unis.  With less time spent on research, the process of building up a research reputation slows down significantly.  Yes, at all unis, the academics need to maintain a specific publication rate to maintain their tenures, but this is only a baseline requirement.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong>Many Tech or relatively newer unis try to differentiate and market themselves - claiming that their students are 'more analytical', better in 'some ways' compared to more 'nerdy', 'straight' and 'advantaged' students who scored better during entry exams (whatever it may be) - [b]u c, SMU in S'pore is doing the same as newer Unis tried b4 in Australia and UK... </strong> [/b]</blockquote>Then again, some of the Tech uni departments have entry standards that match those of the more established unis.  SwinburneÂ’s Psychology undergraduate course had a TER requirement of 96 (out of 100) the last time I checked.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong>another Â‘marketing strategyÂ’ by newer / technological unis is spreaded via word of mouth <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is that more established unis "are only good in research,....the people there don't give a damn if u are undergrad ....teaching are no good since lectureres have no time to bother teaching as their attention is only on research...."  </span>My cousin who graduated from an Â‘oldÂ’ Australia uni from [b]said that she found undergrad teaching there to be fine and no Â‘undergraduate neglectÂ’ as mentioned by those critics of more established unis</strong>. [/b]</blockquote>Oh, sure, the teaching is fine.  University courses go through an accreditation process regularly.  IÂ’m not sure what the standard is for other departments, but the Australian Psychological Society conducts reviews for each university once every three years, so certain standards have to be maintained.<br><br>What IÂ’m talking about is the extra mile.  SwinburneÂ’s undergraduate Psych degree placed what could be seen as an excessive amount of emphasis on the statistics component.  This did not really have much effect on the undergraduates, but it made a marked difference for those who went on to do postgrad studies.  The same thing happened with research methods.  SwinburneÂ’s lecturers and tutors went into much more detail about the finer points of research design and method, compared to Melbourne Uni Â– MelbourneÂ’s assignments could pretty much be completed using only the materials provided in classes, while Swinburne required their students to go out and independently collect research materials.  I had one classmate in Honours who had done her basic degree at UCLA, and for the whole year she did not stop bitching about how much work we were made to do.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong>You have your experience but I find it [b]<span style="font-style: italic;">quite truly hard to believe any average Swinburne undergraduate will outperform the average honours student from Melbourne in basic analytical/research skills</span></strong>.  [/b]</blockquote>This is a trick question, isnÂ’t it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Given that the Top 5 percent of undergrad students get into Honours (notwithstanding the fact that Honours is itself undergraduate), you are comparing the 50th percentile from Swinburne with the 97.5th percentile from Melbourne.  Hardly a fair comparison even if they were in the same uni, eh? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>IÂ’ll compare Honours students from both Unis instead, based upon my experience (which is admittedly anecdotal).  Right at the start of the thesis, I get my students to describe the subject matter of their thesis, and to define their research questions.  From that point, I take them through the process of designing their methodology and the statistical analysis methods they need to use.  The Swinburne students keep up with me easily enough, because they have been taught all of that before.  The Melbourne students (who went through Melbourne undergrad) give me a befuddled Â“Huh?Â”, and I have to explain everything to them from scratch.  Then theyÂ’ll often protest, Â“But this isnÂ’t what the books said!Â”, and then IÂ’ll take them through some real-life examples.  The brighter ones get the point after a while.<br><br>The material I am working with, be it from Melbourne or Swinburne, is essentially the same.  In fact, if your argument holds, the Swinburne students should be less capable.  What makes all the difference is the quality of the teaching they received in the three years before they got to me, and I would happily place my bets on Swinburne.<br><br>Another thing to note is the intake process for postgrad courses Â– postgrad unis do not necessarily employ an affiliation scheme for the selection process.  In my doctorate, for example, there were 1500 applications from Honours students, both locally and internationally, from which 12 were selected.  Of the 12, 5 were from Melbourne, 3 from Monash, and one each from Deakin, LaTrobe, Edinburgh and Swinburne.  All of the five from Melbourne were influenced by one particular lecturer who had a reputation for being a taskmaster, and she spent hardly any of her time with undergraduates, only Honours and above.<br><br>Continued in next postÂ…..<br></div>

Every year, the foundation classes from the different streams (media, business, engineering etc.) have a debate series, and I ended up being the unofficial coach for the Media team.  When it came to the finals, they were up against the team from Business, and things did not look good.  Each of the Business students had an individual coach, while the Media students had one tutor between them, plus yours truly, and their tutor hardly knew anything about debating.  On top of that, the motion of the debate (for the life of me I cannot remember what it was) was weighted in the Business teamÂ’s favour both logically and emotively.  If you take note of most debate motionsÂ’ structures, the logic usually goes to one side and the emotion to the other.  I covered everything from structure to presentation styles, and by the end of it the team could have done it in their sleep, but my expectation was that the Media team would come out a strong second.

            <div class='col-md body'>No offence taken at all - of all people, i would have to know that you need to be a bit nuts every once in a while to do this job.  Actually, to stay at university for eight years, you'd have to be a lot nuts.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> I was just being anal retentive and making the distinction between a PhD and a DPsych.<br><br>As for Go8, I was slow in making the connection - we don't usually use the term within the postgrad circles here.<br><br>It looks like you may have misrepresented the ranking criteria - are you saying that the Uni of the Year is based solely upon their intake of minorities and disadvantaged students?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I would not underrate some criteria by their face value.  For example, I placed a high level of emphasis on networks and PC connections because I needed a lot of information in real time, and whenever systems went down, the IT department would be sure to know that I was not happy.<br><br>As for the teaching standards, I would again say that you may have misrepresented the situation.  As I mentioned earlier, the courses are subject to review and endorement by the relevant professional bodies, so it is not necessarily just a case of lowering assessment standards.<br><br>Also when it comes to graduates and postgraduate students, we do tend to be outspoken about things that we are not satisfied with - I would not underrate this as a valuable source of information.</div>
