            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I ever faced a customer screaming at me and my colleagues until the whole store looked.<br><br>Something like:<br><br>We've got a stack of delivery boxes behind my service counter. Inside these delivery boxes are 3 decorative boxes, with the products inside.<br><br>So this guy came "EH, FRIEND! HOW MUCH FOR THIS?", slapping at the delivery box. So I told him, inside got 3 boxes. He repeated his qns, so I rephrased my answer. Next, he asked how much, I sad $XX for each box, but he said he wanted that delivery box, so bobian I said $XX x3 for the goods in that box, then he started screaming.... Finally he wanted to buy, I said pay at cashier, show us receipt and redeem the goods (store policy, which I have no say in). Then he started screaming again, want to see manager, supervisor, wanna complain or what, so I followed him to cashier counter, which he started screaming again, then the chief cashier (supervisor) came out, and talked to him. Then he thanked me and my colleagues for 'good service' and scolded my other colleague for 'bad service'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I get very pissed by this type of thing.<br><br>When the promoter serves the wine they usually lingered and have a short exchange with the customers. Perhaps the promoter did not do the same to the guy, that's why he try to be funny.<br><br>Sometimes I pity sales people (the ethical honest kind only). In this case, I'm sure the promoter do not truly want to speak to everyone in the lounge, but has to do so to sell the wine. They may already had a bad day, had problems in their personal life, but yet they have to smile smile and say how are you today....<br><br>...AND, they get unreasonable customers like this who have no respect.<br><br>I remembered Metro, a few years back, started a "Treat the Service Staff like Kings too" kind of campaign, supposely to run for a month. Immediately it was shot down so fast by people writing to straits times. There were even people trying to organise a boycott. Metro stopped a campaign after 10 days. Guess their sales was suffering....<br><br>How can we be respectful to others? Like say in the UK...guess there's no answers, looking at how some of the younger generation treat even the bus drivers.</div>
