              <p>Part One<br><br>Hello everyone . This is just another story of love between me and someone . Just waste pointless minutes of your life to read this thread by a student (me) . Real names shall not be used . 
                                  
                                                 <br>The first music lesson of the year . With the marvelous teacher , Ms Nat , "Class bring out your pens and paper and wright down your favorite genre of music . " Well , from the outside i was a quiet , but inside , my life is filled with songs from the genre rock . Loud gores and meaningful lyrics were in my mind all the time . We (Class and teachers) discuss about the genres . " Who likes metal ? " . Only one person raised up her hand . I wanted to but i was shy . I looked at her . My heart beats like the drummer from the band , "Slipknot" 
                                  In my mind , "Oh my god , someone that likes metal ? ! . And not only that but that someone is a girl . " Than that was the day i falled for her . 
                                  
                                  
                                  <br><br>This story will continue when there is at least one reader .<br>I want to catch some Z's<br><br>__________________<br><br>Part two<br><br>Wow , "alot" of people commented . =.=<br> <br> So , after my music lessons , my conscience said i should not talk
                                                  to her , just ignore , as i do not want to smash her into pieces .
                                                  I got advice from someone that girls have different feelings about
                                                  love . But instead , i foolishly went for it . About one week or so
                                                  , i got her msn . The first conversation i had with her was about
                                                  we having the same taste of genre . Than i found out she was in my
                                                  Geography group . Now , whenever its geography period , i would get
                                                  nervous , my palms will sweat , i will be so nervous that i could
                                                  not even wright anything on paper . It was so intense . There was
                                                  once Geography lesson , when i looked eye to eye , that particular
                                                  moment was filled with fireworks . Back to the msn part , i told
                                                  her i think i like her . So , no misunderstandings , she said i was
                                                  daring . Than she went to tell her friend , Vanessa , suddenly the
                                                  whole class got to know , one of my good friends told me that
                                                  Majenta did not like me , so  i panicked . I resorted to a
                                                  well written immatured apology . Than after that , i started to
                                                  feel i was hated by her when i told her i really like her.<br> <br> want more ?<br>________________<br>Part Three<br><br>Guilt starts to flash in my mind , i do not know what to do . Im not like other guys in my school , they are all the types of people that "know what to do" everytime . This is situation is going off - course .<br><br>_______________<br>Part Four <br><br>Oh Yeah btw , the eye to eye thing was just bullshit . hahax <br>and also this story is about emo people . Like my classmates and all . This story is frm one of my classmates .<br><br><br>Still remember the day she said she would go out with me . What the fuck , who to hell wants to go out with an angry nerd like me , i was not even matured back then , i thinked like an asshole , jerky idiot . I was fucking damn smashed into fucking pieces when i heard that she had a fucking boyfriend , i was fucking slashing my wrist until i had to go to the hospital to stop my fcking bleeding hands , i cried until i cannot cry anymore , i lost hope <br><br>__________________<br>Part Five <br><br>Every single fucking night i fucking dream about her . I was getting FUCKING FRUSTRATED ! OH FUCK ! . I would not even dare to talk to her , or even look at her . At that moment , i got so stressed up that i got a girlfriend who i dont even love .  Now that is horrible , i dont know what the fucking hell was i thinking getting my bestfriend's ex- .. I felt so cruel after the break up . What should i do ?<br><br><br>Reply about his situation . Sry for the fucks , i was just thinking about the famous line from snakes on the plane and epic movie "Enough is enough , im tired of this mother fucking snakes on the mother fucking plane " .. so funny ! Oh yeah , this is not a fucking ass shity romantic drama , its a true love story of a guy .</p>

              <p>I recently had a new girlfriend. She tells me about how freaky the boy in her geography group is. She tells me she is really scared of him and told him she would go out with him because she was scared he might harm her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My girlfriend said he was a psychotic classmate who fell in love with her when she did some stretching by raising her arms. She even told me he slashed his wrists and cried everyday. But she told me that she doesn't care about him because he is a loser and an emo kid just like the other classmates, just worse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He claims he had broken off with her but they weren't even together in the first place. I told her not to worry because I am going to make sure that she is safe and that emo kid can cut his hand off for all I care because he speaks funny and looks to be eligible for America's Funniest Video.</p>
