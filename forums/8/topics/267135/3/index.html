            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder why many people against creative and say its not good. From my experience, i've used a Creative Muvo and Zen for years, and recently got an Ipod but have decided to go back to creative.<br><br>IMO, Creative's products are definitely more value for money. I got rid of my ipod and went back. Creative has much more functions for same quality and cheaper price. Such as the Zen Neeon 2, i would say reasonable competitor to the iPod nano, the Neeon 2 costs somewhat cheaper than the ipod but with many more functions. It has video playback and fm recording which Ipods cannot. Furthermore, my Muvo and Zen have dropped five to six times, and never spoiled but my iPod, after dropping once, had to be reset. Another example would be the Zen Stone Plus, competitor to Ipod Shuffle for $99 instead of $140, you can get 2GB worth of memory space, with an OLED display and fm radio which you cannot find in an iPod.<br><br>So, i really don't understand why many people against Creative. Most importantly, Creative, as a LOCAL product, should have the backing of Singaporeans... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is my brief summary of the long-term battle between Apple's iPod and Creative's MP3 players.<br><br>1) <span style="color: purple;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STYLING</span></strong></span><br>Apple's iPods (30/60GB video, 1/2/4/8GB Nano, 1GB Shuffle) definitely looks sleeker and nicer than Creative's usually bulky and hefty MP3 players. Of course, Creative also have very small and light MP3 players in the form of Neeon 2, Nano/Nano Plus and the recent Zen Stone/Zen Stone Plus.

When it comes to features, I honestly think Creative and Apple are even too. But there's something that Creative will forever trump over the Apple's iPods, and that's RADIO. Well of course you can get FM radio on iPods too by buying an aftermarket adapter that plugs into the iPod's dock and lets the iPod receive FM signals. The aftermarket FM radio adapter is very expensive though. So in the 'features' stake, I would say Creative and Apple are about equal except for a slight edge the Creative has over Apple and that's radio.<br><br>4) <span style="color: purple;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOUND QUALITY</span></strong></span><br>In terms of sound quality, Creative wins the Apple, period. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Added: 5) <span style="color: purple;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PRICE, VALUE FOR MONEY, BANG FOR BUCKS, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT.</span></strong></span><br>For this segment, Creative wins the Apple hands down. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>So here is my summary.

If that device conks out on you after warranty, and you think you can send it in for repair, THINK AGAIN.<br><br>That happened to my last ipod nano.  The said, "We do not service ipods.  We only replace.  Replacing one without warranty is equivalent to buying a new one, unless you want a refurbished set."<br><br>Ipod ain't as good either.<br><br>CHECK servicing options BEFORE making a decision to buy, regardless of brands.</div>
