I've used Zen Micro, Zen Neon and others. Gamepad, webcam, wireless keyboard. Yes, I'm a creative member. Never had major problems, but I helped a friend change a cracked LCD once, can't remember how long the usage but still under warranty.<br><br>They changed entire mp3 for her, maybe because it wasn't zen micro. Back then, I thought maybe since it's produced locally, it's easier to replace. Yet to hear about that happen for ipod, maybe there is but I don't know about it. My friend was able to sell the mp3 2 years after intiail purchase with only surface scratches. Maybe coz it's not the type with hard disk.<br><br>I'm not saying anything bad about you, just relating my own experiences. I do have horrible luck with sony handphones though, hence I only buy Nokia or Samsung now.<br><br></div>

It is quite far though in Jurong. Ipod is at Wheelock place? Not sure, I don't own an ipod neither will it be anytime soon.<br><br>Creative would give you a lower price for similiar function and capability compared  to ipod. LCD screen for ipod would be more visually appealing too. Menu design/software is also better, I think because the touchpad design is patented.<br><br>Ultimately, depends on what you are looking for. If you want design, it's just simply ipod. And I don't just mean initial design, there's a much wider range of accessories that you could get for an ipod. An ipod is more than an mp3 player, it's a fashion statement as well. Loads of fashion items out there are designed for ipods even if the item itself is not made by apple.<br><br>You want better value for money, go for creative.<br><br>Sony's a good buy too, sound quality has improved.<br><br>Iriver if you just want a simple mp3 player and if you don't mind a less outstanding design.<br><br>Samsung for a nice LCD.<br><br>But coming back to Creative and Apple, depends on what you want. Design? Ipod.</div>

Apple's not getting complacent anytime soon (unlike Creative) and they were the ones who lost the edge to them in the first place anyway.<br><br>Still, design wise, they shouldn't just copy ipod. They should continue to set themselves apart as a brand. However, it would help to have something (especially design) that could give them the same kind of boost that the design of ipod gave apple.<br><br>Olympus once had an mp3 (maybe the first Olympus mp3) player that had very similar design to ipod.
