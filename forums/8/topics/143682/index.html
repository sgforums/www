            <div class='col-md body'>i am thinking of some ideas and would like to listen to the views of anybody as long as they are constructive........<br><br>i am like thinking of the idea of having a standing-only bus, as the name suggests there will be no seat so the passengers will have to stand. i think that this might solve the problem of over-crowding during peak hours. these buses will also operate in the other hours of the day as well so as to maximise revenue.<br><br>i would like to listen to views on these, new ideas are welcome.<br><br></div>

Already i see people readily giving up seats on buses and trains. Of course there are those fair number who suffer from sudden and instant attacks of the Z-monster and ignore the old and pregnant.<br><br>We have to push forward and accept that along the way, a minority of ungracious buffoons will undoubtly slow us down.<br><br></div>
