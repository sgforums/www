              <p>My my, I didn't realise that people need to bring their IC to attend birthday parties. Or even that 6 people are representative of the entire Singaporean population!<br><br><a href="http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Asian%2BOpinions/Story/A1Story20100525-218301.html"><span style="color: #462c75;">http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne...25-218301.html</span></a><br><br></p>

Of the six invitees, only two of their mothers responded with text messages, confirming that their children would attend.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">Another two children replied to my son at school.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">The fifth child's father had to be contacted by telephone. He said that he would drop the boy off, before curtly ending the call without a word of thanks.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">The last child? Well, suffice to say that, in the end, we lost all hope of getting any kind of reply from him or his parents.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">As the day drew near, games were planned, goodie bags were assembled, food was prepared, a super-duper cake was ordered, balloons were blown and banners strung up. But on the night before the party, my mobile phone went mad.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">One of the mothers who had replied earlier that her son would attend said that he would turn up late - practically at the end of the party.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">She explained that he had an enrichment class to attend - a fact that she should have known when she replied previously.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">Another child said that he would not be coming after all because his mother did not know the way.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">She presumably could not be bothered to look up directions, despite the fact that a map had been included with the invitation.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">Yet another parent messaged to boldly ask me - without even a "please" or "thank you" - to drive across the island to ferry her child to and from the party, because she could not be bothered to do so.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">Apparently, I was to find some time in between getting ready for the party and attending to my own children in order to look after her child.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">If not for my son, I would have cancelled the party out of frustration at the other parents' lack of consideration.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">The big day dawned and the guests started arriving.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">Without exception, each parent thrust a child at me and quickly turned to carry out the next item on their agendas, without even greeting us or asking our names, let alone wishing my son a happy birthday.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">In one case, I even had to run after a father, shouting for his name and mobile number in case of an emergency.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">I could have sold off all their children for all they knew (and I was tempted to do so at one point, when the little darlings were running around and screaming like wild animals).</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">None of the birthday presents came with a card or even a hastily scribbled message to the birthday boy.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">I doubt that the parents who purchased the gifts even knew the recipient's name.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">After the party, predictably, not a single parent or child wrote, called or messaged to say "thank you".</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">My conclusion? Singaporeans are, on the surface, well-trained to survive the rat race at school and in the working world.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">But scratch the surface and we may find a nation shockingly deficient in the finer arts of civility, hospitality, social intercourse and politesse.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">In case you're thinking that this is a problem of the dialect- speaking, less-educated segment of the population, let me tell you that this is not the case.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">These children and their parents are firmly located in the upper middle-class, Lexus-driving, condo-living, "successful" end of the demographic.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">Therein, perhaps, lies the problem.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">To paraphrase a good teacher, how does it benefit Singaporeans to gain the world if we lose our ability to relate to each other as human beings?</span><br></blockquote></div>

              <p>But your argument to the article published by Asiaone that Singaporeans are (i quote) deficient in manners &amp; civility is that....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That reasoning borders on the moronic. If yer butt hurt I'm sorry. But it was utterly shocking to realize that you could be that dumb. I sincerely apologise for my outburst of emotions but in the circumstances I'm sure you would concur that it was reasonable.</p>

              <p>I'm pretty surprised at what she experienced. It's incredible that educated Sgporeans who belong to the upper middle income class, would "thrust the kids to her" w/o saying happy bday and then help themselves to the food.</p>

              <p>You all missed the message of the long letter by Leona Boey.</p>
              <p>The birthday party events are support for her statement: </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">To paraphrase a good teacher, how does it benefit Singaporeans to gain the world if we lose our ability to relate to each other as human beings?</span></span></p>
              <p>Singaporean behaviour and manners sucks. Big time. And we have all have known it for a long time. Snatches of courtesy and civility  here and there are often  used to mask the lack of such civility.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span>It doesn't augur well to blame the government for personal behaviours and mannerism, but the government of Singapore controls and directs the population in almost every facet of their lives. This led to the heavy emphasis on acquiring economic sciences than humanity sciences.</p>
              <p>In my primary school days,  four hours per week is allocated to Ethics. This lesson period we were told is about learning manners and how to conduct ourselves. I recall only one teacher taught us manners, and how to reply, and respond to common courtesies, and once only. The rest of the year that class was used by other teachers to mark books, us to do our own reading, and sometimes even pulling grass that has over grown into the drains. Anything but  Ethics.</p>
              <p>Singapore has lost its soul, this can be seen through successive generations of citizens. The untutored brats are now  parents, and are the yuppies with children.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans engineered by the government are very deficient in the finer arts of civility, hospility, social intercourse and politeness.</p>
