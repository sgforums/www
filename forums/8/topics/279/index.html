            <div class='col-md body'>13 June 2002, 22:17 Seoul - Tokyo<br><br>Mexico and Italy both confirmed their presence in the second round with a hard-fought draw in Oita, Japan, as a goal five minutes from time by Alessandro Del Piero dramatically equalised Jared BorgettiÂ’s tremendous first half header.<br><br>Mexico were minutes away from recording their first ever victory over the Italians, but the desperate Europeans poured on the pressure until the goal came their way thanks to Del Piero, who had come on the field only minutes before.<br><br>Filippo Inzaghi had the first chance of the game, but his ambitious volley from 25 metres was taken in by Mexico goalkeeper Oscar Perez (8Â’). Inzaghi beat Perez on a second chance from the top of the penalty area, but was ruled offside (13Â’).<br><br>Match facts<br>Mexico enjoyed an edge in possession over the first quarter hour, but their patient attack did not produce any shots until Gerardo TorradoÂ’s 25-metre chance sailed well over the crossbar (17Â’).<br><br>Italy were unlucky again when Francesco Totti missed wide from 12 metres with only Perez in the way. Inzaghi dribbled through a crowd at the edge of the penalty area and fed Totti at the left side of the box. The AS Roma striker had time to settle the ball but curled his shot outside the far post (19Â’).<br><br>Christian Vieri, who had scored each of ItalyÂ’s three finals goals entering the match, followed with a volley from 18 metres that was saved by Perez (22Â’).<br><br>Some strong defence and a little luck were with Mexico and when their possession game had seemed to lull Italy to sleep, Cuauhtemoc Blanco laid a beautiful chip to the near post onto the head of Jared Borgetti, who spun in the air and flicked a header past Gianluigi Buffon, who never moved (1:0, 35Â’).<br><br>Gianluca Zambrotta had another great chance for Italy as he ran onto a drop-pass from Vieri 16 metres out but fired well wide (40Â’). And when the half ended, the Azzurri only had a deficit and several near misses to their credit.<br><br>Italy continued to come at Mexico as the second half began, and it was Inzaghi who nearly pulled his side level when he was sent in alone on goal. Perez was able to disrupt the run when he sprawled to get a hand on the ball as Inzaghi tried to dribble past him (51Â’).<br><br>A clinical one-two by Jesus Arellano and Blanco nearly concluded with Arellano netting the second for the Tricolores, but Buffon got a hand on the shot and his defence cleared the rebound (54Â’).<br><br>ItalyÂ’s growing frustration at not finding the net became evident when Zambrotta and Vincenzo Montella were each cautioned in the space of two minutes.<br><br>Mexico followed with a shot from the left of the area by Ramon Morales that sailed high (57Â’) and a chance from Joahan Rodriguez that drifted just wide (61Â’).<br><br>As they had in the first half, Italy found the back of the net again when Montella lobbed over a charging Perez, but for a second time, the assistant refereeÂ’s flag had been raised, signalling offside (64Â’).<br><br>Perez and his outstretched frame were vital again for Mexico when Vieri was sent in from 25 metres. The Inter Milan forward tried to settle the ball and direct a shot toward goal, but Perez slid in and parried the ball out for a corner kick (72Â’).<br><br>When Rafael Garcia fouled Zambrotta just outside the area, Italy were presented with another opportunity, but MontellaÂ’s free kick did not clear the wall (83Â’).<br><br>A throw-in on the left side turned into the equaliser for Italy when Montella played a sharp cross over his shoulder into the area and late substitute Alessandro Del Piero raced in unmarked to head past Perez (1:1, 85Â’).<br><br>Taken from:FIFAworldcup.com<br><br>------------------<br><blockquote>Let us not look back in anger or forward in fear but around in awareness.<br>-James Thurber</blockquote></div>
