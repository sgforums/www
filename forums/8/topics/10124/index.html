            <div class='col-md body'>This thread is poised more towards the Singaporeans in North America who have been following the US presidential elections.<br><br>I was just wondering how fair the this election process has been, isn't america's system of democracy "By the people for the people"?<br><br>I'm amazed by the fact that even when Al Gore has won the popular vote by a margin of 200,000++ ballots, because of the Electoral College this race is going to come down to the key votes of a few thousand in the state of Florida.<br><br>How can the votes of a few thousand people outweigh the votes of hundreds of thousands? This is ridiculous, does that mean that some people's votes are more important than others? I think the Electoral College in this case is extremely unfair for Gore  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Any opinions?<br>p.s I'm just blowing off steam, i hate the fact that Bush looks like he's going to win even with the bloody recount.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, would rather Bush wins. Hehehe...... it is a close fight between both of them lah, with people's decisions based more on who they don't like rather than who they like. Anyway, popularity votes mean nothing what. So a vote for Bushy for me, and nothing for Gory. (Corny, I know.)<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>
