But there are one point from it that I think is worth noting - evolution is not abiogenesis. Evolution requires a life form to begin with, so I was thinking of a possibility along the lines of creationism, that that basic life form required, which could be a single-cell organism or whatsoever, is a creation of God. Of course, that's up to the biologists to prove, but doesn't that mean both theories of evolution and creationism can co-exist?<br></div>
