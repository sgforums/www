            <div class='col-md body'>"ID is a "God of the gaps" theory, inserting a supposition of the need for supernatural intervention in places that its proponents claim science cannot explain. Various cultures have traditionally tried to ascribe to God various natural phenomena that the science of the day had been unable to sort out - whether a solar eclipse or the beauty of a flower.<br><br>But these theories have a dismal history. Advances in science ultimately fill in those gaps, to the dismay of those who had attached their faith to them. Ultimately a "God of the gaps" religion runs a huge risk of simply discrediting faith."<br><br>- Quoted from Francis S.Collins, Christian Biologist, Head of the Genome Project from his book The Language of God.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
