In the bible, they tell believers not to listen to non believers, they are fools, they deserve to go to hell, they r evil and followers of devil and believers should massacre them.Religions segregate people. Tat is why there is inquisition, crusades and terrorism. And yes, there r a lot of conflicts caused by terrorism and it is due to difference in religion. In the past perhaps more than 99% of the people in europe r christians or muslim or jews. Why is tat period one the most chaotic and brutal period in history ?<br><br>Religion also teaches u to throw away rationality and against inquiry. Tis is because with science, part of the scripture seemed to be contradictory to found fact. Tat is why science like evolution is not believed by people simply because their religion teaches them so. When u come to a question about religion which no ne can answer, wat is their answer they give ? God works in mysterious way. Men is too foolish to know god. Then all inquiry ends here, at the assumption.<br><br>U see, nothing in tis world tell people to be wary of good science. It is always promoted and it is the best form of knowledge men have and it is proven to work. Only religion tell people science is wrong. Why is tat so?

He want people to believe him or not believe him ? If he do not appear, people have ample good reasons not to believe in him. And god send them to hell ?!?! Why did he want to play such a game with people ?
