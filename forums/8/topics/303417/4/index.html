Hence they can never be supported with Scientific tools.<br><br>THere are an infinite of crazy imaginable things. It is save to say that 99.9999...% of them are non-existant. There is no good reason other than for our emotional needs that we delude ourselves to believe in some of them.<br><br>Certain things, its ok to go with it even without any rational proofs.<br><br>But of those thing that have a big impact in our lifes (i.e. having to spend so much time per week devoted to worshipping some invisible being) we ought to have a well founded reason to believe in them. Do not trust any religious figures, or scriptures just simply because they say so. The so-called "Common sense" is not a good tool to use as it can be emotionally biased. The default mode is always to doubt first for supernatural claims until you yourselfs have seen it.<br><br>I have no good reason to believe in any types of gods at this point, hence I can't help but disbelieve in any of them. If it so happens that a certain God does exists and it wants to burn and torture me for eternality for my disbelieve, then I would say that this god is unjust and evil. The 'devil' would be a more accurate term for it then.<br></div>
