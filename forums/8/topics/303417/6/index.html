So, instead of argueing among ourselves and start protecting each own rights and believes, we should perhap respect each others school of thoughts, otherwise, it will be very foolish to argue on a subject that had science and religion in it. As a scientist, he/she is trained to be more objective in regard to science, and as a holy person, he/she will be more focus on divine creation.<br><br>Like it or not, there are many others in this world who dun really care about what religions or who created this and that, they only believe in one thing, that is money, and sad as it might be, this believe is ever growing among our young generation.</div>
