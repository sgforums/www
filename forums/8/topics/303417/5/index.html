            <div class='col-md body'>Religion demands people to believe in certain claims without proof. I.e. the bible says so.<br><br>Science requires a skeptical mind, where there's no room for ABSOLUTE believe in anything. Even a well deviced model to describe the world around us can only be taken as a good approximation to the universe. THere's always a chance that in future, a new and more precise model will be developed. Nothing is static, and final. What seems to be right might one day be replaced with another better theory that gives us an even deeper insight of our world. I seriously doubt the questions would ever end.

Using the same manner as how you concluded that religion was bad, I had concluded science is just as bad and possibly worst.<br><br>In reality, science and religion are just tools created by man; science being the more powerful of the 2. The problem was always how man try to bend and use these tools for satisfying their greed and fear. Take away science and religion and you will still see these 2 characteristics of man still exhibited using other ways, but in much lesser magnitudes.<br><br>In my course of life, I realise that chasing after science is often an endless race to satisfy my own insatiable greed and fear. In fact, it results in more unhappiness. Chasing after the knowledge of science without any purpose also felt very empty. All living things somehow need a purpose to live and religion attempts to do that. Science just doesn't explain why.<br><br>More often than not, we simply use science to grow and manifest our greed and fear and think of the world as simply survival of the fittest. Religion attempts to curb this characteristics and it will make a person a more happy and satisfied. It also makes a person a more loving and harmonious person. This is how I understood when I read the Einstein quote "Science without religion is lame". The other part of Einstein's quote "Religion without Science is blind" is easier understood and I shall not elaborate.<br><br>We are lucky to have these 2 tools, science and religion. How you use it is a matter of choice and a realisation of oneself. All of us have the ability to do little things and a few of us have the ability to do great things. And for the latter, I do wish you will have the courage to help shape science and religion to build a more peaceful and loving world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find your reasoning a bit funny..<br><br>U think religion is man made. However u still believe in it and think it gives u a purpose in life. If religion is man made, then it is false and the things it told u r wrong. Why believe the purpose it promise when it is wrong ?<br><br>Secondly, purpose in life do not have to come from religion  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> If I am a scientist, I will find purpose in researching science when it can help people or when it can make my names be remembered. As for the purpose in life, I find it to be simply finding happiness, which has nothing to do with religion. I do the things I enjoy and tat bring me happiness. I work hard so I can worry less about money and tat will give me happiness. U don't need religion. U just need a change of attitude. U r master of your own life.<br><br>In fact I think religion give a very depressing purpose in life. Your life is controlled at a being which u can never understand. If he wanna make u a loser filled with pain, no matter how hard u try u r always a loser and always in pain. His plans for u is simply to become his obedient slave forever or be tortured forever.<br><br>About morals and helping others, people without religion do help out others too and r loving too. They do it because they know wat is like to be living in society and do good deeds because they sincerely wanna hep others. People in religion do good deeds simply because they expect a reward.</div>
