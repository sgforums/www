            <div class='col-md body'>9 easy step to cook a bowl of instant noodle:<br><br>1. First you need to locate your kitchen; you will be able to identify it by the amount of cooking utensils and appliances available there.<br><br>2. Then you need to locate the necessary ingredients like a packet of instant noodle, some amount of water. You can be a bit more creative by adding an egg or some luncheon meat, which will make it taste better.<br><br>3. You can usually find instant noodle in your kitchen cabinets; they usually come in yellow packages and have the brand name Maggi printed on it. If you are lucky you should be able to find a can of luncheon meat lying around the same corner too, they usually come in box tin and have the brand name Spam printed on it.<br><br>4. Now that you have most of the ingredients, the only thing left is to get some water. It can easily be obtain from a basin nearby which is around the height of your waist, do not get any water from basin that is around your knee height.<br><br>5. You will need a container to contain and boil the water; my best recommendation will be a cooking pot. It is usually silver in color with a black plastic handle.<br><br>6. Got it? Good, now you are all set to cook your bowl of instant noodle. Turn on the strove and place the pot of water on the flame to let it boil. While you are waiting for that, you can proceed on to open the can of luncheon meat and cut it into small bitable pieces.<br><br>7. How do you cut it? You will need to locate a knife; it is usually silver in color with a brown wooden handle. Good, now you can start cutting the luncheon meat. If you feel pain in your palm and saw blood dripping from your hand, you have probably held the knife at the wrong end. Do not panic at this moment, cause it is critical for your to place it gently back on the table to avoid dropping it on your feet to cause further injuries. If you succeed in doing so, you can proceed to find a first aid box so that your can get some bandage to dress your wound. They usually have a big red color cross printed on the outside of the box. If not, gently pull the knife out from your feet, place it back on the table and drag yourself to locate the first aid box.<br><br>8. After finish dressing your wounds, you should proceed back to the kitchen to check whether the water has boiled or not. If you smell gas and didnÂ’t saw any flame at the strove, the water must have probably boil over and put off the flame. Do not try to relight the strove at this moment as it will surely cause an explosion to take place, instead you should switch off the strove and open all the windows to ventilate the kitchen.<br><br>9. If you are still conscious after the explosion, try your best to reach for the phone to call for an ambulance. If not, just lay still and hope that your neighbors will notice the explosion and send help to you instead. Smile, although you did not succeed in cooking a bowl of instant noodle, but you did succeed to survive another day right?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

First you need to locate your kitchen; you will be able to identify it by the amount of cooking utensils and appliances available there.<br><br>2. Then you need to locate the necessary ingredients like a packet of instant noodle, some amount of water. You can be a bit more creative by adding an egg or some luncheon meat, which will make it taste better.<br><br>3. You can usually find instant noodle in your kitchen cabinets; they usually come in yellow packages and have the brand name Maggi printed on it. If you are lucky you should be able to find a can of luncheon meat lying around the same corner too, they usually come in box tin and have the brand name Spam printed on it.<br><br>4. Now that you have most of the ingredients, the only thing left is to get some water. It can easily be obtain from a basin nearby which is around the height of your waist, do not get any water from basin that is around your knee height.<br><br>5. You will need a container to contain and boil the water; my best recommendation will be a cooking pot. It is usually silver in color with a black plastic handle.<br><br>6. Got it? Good, now you are all set to cook your bowl of instant noodle. Turn on the strove and place the pot of water on the flame to let it boil. While you are waiting for that, you can proceed on to open the can of luncheon meat and cut it into small bitable pieces.<br><br>7. How do you cut it? You will need to locate a knife; it is usually silver in color with a brown wooden handle. Good, now you can start cutting the luncheon meat. If you feel pain in your palm and saw blood dripping from your hand, you have probably held the knife at the wrong end. Do not panic at this moment, cause it is critical for your to place it gently back on the table to avoid dropping it on your feet to cause further injuries. If you succeed in doing so, you can proceed to find a first aid box so that your can get some bandage to dress your wound. They usually have a big red color cross printed on the outside of the box. If not, gently pull the knife out from your feet, place it back on the table and drag yourself to locate the first aid box.<br><br>8. After finish dressing your wounds, you should proceed back to the kitchen to check whether the water has boiled or not. If you smell gas and didnÂ’t saw any flame at the strove, the water must have probably boil over and put off the flame. Do not try to relight the strove at this moment as it will surely cause an explosion to take place, instead you should switch off the strove and open all the windows to ventilate the kitchen.<br><br>9. If you are still conscious after the explosion, try your best to reach for the phone to call for an ambulance. If not, just lay still and hope that your neighbors will notice the explosion and send help to you instead. Smile, although you did not succeed in cooking a bowl of instant noodle, but you did succeed to survive another day right?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>go out eat lah wtf</div>
