            <div class='col-md body'>haha found another post on friendster regarding PW!<br>Check it out!<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>Project work is a project whereby JC1 students spend their already limited time on research and evaluation, just so to come out with a decent proposal and report to submit to the MOE of Singapore.<br><br>Its overemphasis on structure and rules to follow clearly contradict the 'creative thinking' motion the education system is working towards. Although detractors might argue that these skills are relevant in university and working life, JC students are simply busy enough, even in year 1, to cope with so much stuff.<br><br>Imagine just staying up to complete minutes or reports which seem remotely useful to you and your future..and the worse thing is, this compulsory evil takes up a hefty 10% of you final A levels, which is not funny at all.<br><br>Even if you initially had a huge interest in whatever topic you are doing, the whole energy sapping, rigid and boring process kills whatever interest you had in the first place. So what's the point?<br><br>The government might argue once again, in their stance on the principle of pragmatism, that useful measures, however unpopular, must be implemented.<br><br>But ask yourself, how in the crap does project work ever help you? All these skills in project work are best learnt in real life and more practical projects, not in structured and rigid formats like this!!<br><br>It is in the former, where students really get the chance to learn and enjoy their research, and not through a 'forced' system.<br><br>Project work has also brought about the most evil side of many, causing people to hanker over their own contributions during meetings and discussions, so their supervising tutors know they are contributing a lot(hence, better grades)..<br><br>PW has also taught us to fake minutes and any other documents, and when it comes to filling in the learning checklist, you cannot do anything else but write stereotypical, full proof, cliche &amp; safe answers(so you would not get into trouble)like 'I learnt a lot from...', where in actual fact, you can't wait to scribble 'PW SUCKS' on the paper.<br></span></div>

All this makes the teacher believe that you are EE material.... oh my god get a life.<br><br>You cant even win an acaemy award with that kinda performance it just defeats the real,original, true purpose of PW so why have it? PW is useless.I suppose that students now are becoming more creative as they lie towards themselves and their teachers.<br><br>i propose that PW should be deleted from the education world.Only<br>then students can nurture<br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is my tale..<br><br>I did my PW in 2001.Back then , it was not counted towards the final A-Level score.My group did a report titled "Biological Terrorism : Vulnerabilities Of Urban Centers".From the very first day, we had a rough ride due to the fact that some of my teachers were quite unhappy with our title and wanted us to change it to something pretty much cliched like, divorce or homosexuality.Ease of marking I suppose.But that defeats the purpose isn't it?Oh yes, they insisted on surveys and market research as a form of original data collection.This was done to make us give up our topic..(How the hell do you go to town and ask people about vectors and delivery agents?)<br><br>Realistically,you can only take interviews of infectious diseases experts off the Internet and dissect them. But as we were still very much interested in the subject, we perservered.Until presentation day, I got the worst insult, from none other than my principal who happened to sit in.She and my GP tutor asked me whether this is of any use in our local context?I told them, yes, because we are heavily built up.She then proceeded to attack my presentation for being out of touch and unrealistic so on etc...<br><br>I got my last laugh when the anthrax attacks occured in late 2001 in USA.We happened to be having a debate about that in class..Then I merely asked my GP tutor if she remembered my project work topic..she replied in the affirmative.I simply asked her, do you think it's far-fetched now?Please do not put down a piece of work just because you do not have the ability nor the time to find out more and understand.I learnt that many people in this world are ignorant fools and they refuse to see the sensible side of things most of the time.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Minutes are stupid. When it is time to submit the GPFs for checking, you have a hell of time trying to fake something. And a lot of papers wasted when you print and reprint minutes, WRs, sources evaluation etc. so may trees cut down, what a sin!    Next year PW gonna be revamped. No need for minutes. So good for them! Reason why it is not scrapped is the fear of protests  by current JC 1 and 2 students.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Meh PW is hard to score, me only got a B, but prolly coz my team mates couldn;t answer questions prolly. Which sucks. Me prefers to work alone.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LazerLordz:</div><div class="quote_body">This is my tale..<br><br>I did my PW in 2001.Back then , it was not counted towards the final A-Level score.My group did a report titled "Biological Terrorism : Vulnerabilities Of Urban Centers".From the very first day, we had a rough ride due to the fact that some of my teachers were quite unhappy with our title and wanted us to change it to something pretty much cliched like, divorce or homosexuality.Ease of marking I suppose.But that defeats the purpose isn't it?Oh yes, they insisted on surveys and market research as a form of original data collection.This was done to make us give up our topic..(How the hell do you go to town and ask people about vectors and delivery agents?)<br><br>Realistically,you can only take interviews of infectious diseases experts off the Internet and dissect them. But as we were still very much interested in the subject, we perservered.Until presentation day, I got the worst insult, from none other than my principal who happened to sit in.She and my GP tutor asked me whether this is of any use in our local context?I told them, yes, because we are heavily built up.She then proceeded to attack my presentation for being out of touch and unrealistic so on etc...<br><br>I got my last laugh when the anthrax attacks occured in late 2001 in USA.We happened to be having a debate about that in class..Then I merely asked my GP tutor if she remembered my project work topic..she replied in the affirmative.I simply asked her, do you think it's far-fetched now?Please do not put down a piece of work just because you do not have the ability nor the time to find out more and understand.I learnt that many people in this world are ignorant fools and they refuse to see the sensible side of things most of the time.<br></div></blockquote>Wooot!!

Its almost like the JC students are starting to whine about it.<br><br>In polytechnics, every semester has at least 2 projects, and these projects are by no means minor ones, reports can run up to a hundred pages, and the final product. No one complains about them in public. Its just taken as part and parcel of education.<br><br>I wonder if this shows the difference in attitude and mindset between JC and Poly students.</div></blockquote>You can say things easily bcoz as you said, its part of your subject. Which means, its a form of assessment based on what you are studying.<br><br>But for us, its a NEW SUBJECT. Or should i put it this way, an ADDITIONAL subject?<br><br>Already JC syllabus is so tough and rushed. An additional subject makes it worse.<br><br>Everything has to be completed in the 2 years. If you take away 1st intake and holidays, its less than that. By Aug the following year, syllabus would have been completed.<br><br>If i have to do project work based on my existing subject, i don think its that bad.<br><br></div>
