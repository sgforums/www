I can achieve that by many other ways.<br>Eventually by coming forth, I know that it will all come with social responsibilities.<br>There will be expectations for me to behave a certain way as a role model or public person.<br><br>I do it for more cancer awareness.<br>Perhaps someone is going thru a similar situation and they can relate to my story.<br>If I can positively influence or inspire someone in any way, then I feel I am doing a good thing.<br></blockquote></div>

(I'm Not Joking)<br>I need 2 tabs a day, so that's $500 a day.<br>Do your maths and you'll know that it'll cost me $15,000 a month.<br>Multiply that by 6 months and you'll have $90,000.<br><br>$90K for a drug just to clean up the lung infection....... or my life.......<br>My MSW (Medical Social Worker) is not confident that LLF is gonna cover such a huge amount.<br>LLF has helped me last year with $32K and another $30K this year so far...<br>That's already more than $60K.<br>We've put in another application for the upcoming 2nd transplant and that's still pending approval.<br>LLF has already helped me a lot but they also have other patients to help too.<br><br>There are also issues about pharmaceutical companies producing a drug like Voriconazole that has such a small demand.<br>Only a very select number of patients need these drugs.<br>Therefore only small quantities are produced.<br>But they need to cover the costs of Research &amp; Development that goes into it.<br>Panadol.. is a different story altogether.<br>It is produced in large quantities cos there is a high demand for it all the time.<br>You can buy a whole strip of tabs off the counter for like.. a dollar or so.<br>And everyone consumes them &amp; they have surplus stored in their drug kit just in case.<br>Its all about supply &amp; demand.<br><br>My other option is to look for generic drugs by other pharmaceutical companies that may be cheaper alternatives.<br>I was told by a friend that some generic drugs in Bangkok or Malaysia can be cheaper by almost half of the original.<br>Its like.... you buy a $2500 Chanel handbag but you find the same thing in say...Zara for about $250.<br>(You get the idea)<br>These generic drugs are not fakes. Its still the real deal though only God knows if they work as well as the original.<br>Just like paracetemol is manufactured under many different brand names.<br>Panadol may be the preferred choice of most, but we can still get cheaper alternatives by Guardian, Watsons or watever.<br><br>At this point, I am being tested to the extreme<br>- physically, emotionally, financially, spiritually.<br>Morale has dipped a bit &amp; I've become battle weary.<br>(Though I know there's still a fighter in me. One who still wants to live Life. One who still believes he will get healed)<br>God knows how long this whole ordeal is gonna last....<br>I really don't know what God's plans are for me.<br>But I only know that His plans are always best.<br>Each day, each moment... (It's not easy but) I try to continue to trust in my God.<br>His word says "My Grace is sufficient for you"<br>and He says He will provide.<br>I Amen to that!<br><br></blockquote></div>

You wipe out the old, bad guys.. &amp; put in the new, good guys!" LOL)<br>I have a rest day on the 18th, though they will need to install a line on my neck for the infusion.<br>Transplant Day is on 19th of April.<br><br>They made me sign a contract (standard protocol again) stating that I've been explained the procedure, side effects, all the risks involved &amp; that my Life may be 'at risk',..... 'at stake',.......... 'on the line'........<br><br>Oh heck.... (spell it out in black &amp; white).......there is a possibility I may lose my Life.<br><br>This is the statistics of stem cell / bone marrow transplant.<br>10% don't make it...<br>and most of them from allogenic (donor) transplants due to cell rejection.<br>(Autologous transplants are very straight forward. Though there are also risks, its very different from allogenic transplants)<br><br>To me these are NOT just statistics!<br>Coincidentally there are 10 rooms in the High Dependency Transplant ward.<br>Every 2 to 3 weeks, a new patient gets transplanted.<br>Each one represents ONE Life!<br>These statistics tell me that... every 2 to 3 wks, out of these 10 ppl, ONE doesn't make it out of here alive!!<br>I've walked these doors myself and I get to know some of these patients.<br>And sadly, I personally knew these ppl.... who never walked OUT of those doors..... *sobs*<br><br>(Do you 'SEE' thru my eyes?)<br><br>To ME, these are NOT just numbers!.... that you read about in the papers...<br>They are Lifes!!<br></blockquote></div>
