Free of charge...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>There's this little child who knew that life is precious... Born with either no talent or intelligent... This child works and learns... If the child has time to study, the child study... if the child has time to work, the child work... In the end, the child manages to work and study at the same time despite diffculties... Not enough sleep or enough time with the child's loved ones... the child didn't grumble... cos the child learns that being human being is actually full of weakness and strength and one should never ever take things for granted or to feel tired of life... the child didn't dwell on the weakness but instead on the strength that the child possess... Eventually, the child sees the light at the end of the tunnel... that is the child's hard works and efforts have finally paid off... the child has become resilient and sensible... thus, the morale of the story is never give up on life cos u never ever know what u gonna get...<br>...The End...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Meaning of Life<br><br>One question many people inadvertently ask at one stage in their lives, is Â“what is the meaning of life?Â” Each person is created unique, hence different people have different answers.  As Albert Camus, a French philosopher, wrote: Â“I see many people die because they judge that life is not worth living. I see others paradoxically getting killed for the ideas and illusions that give them a reason for living.Â” From this very true statement, we see that different people have different reasons for living, and thus the question about what the meaning of our lives is is a rather important question.<br><br>Philosophers, being philosophers, have long debated on this topic as well. In this essay I would like to cover two branches of philosophical thought that talk about the meaning of life, and they are existentialism and nihilism.<br><br>Existentialism is a philosophical thought that views the individual, the self, the individual's experience, and the uniqueness within a person as the basis for understanding the nature of human existence, and it believes the person himself defines the meaning of life. The French philosopher, Jean-Paul Sartre, talked about the belief of the freedom of the individual, in which we have no choice but to create our own values. By doing so, we are hence laying down the basis of our life, the reason of our existence. He also said that existence precedes essence, and the essence of who we are is determined by our actions and thoughts, rather than by our own existence. Hence the power to choose is at the forefront of most existentialistsÂ’ beliefs, and most do not believe in fate or destiny.<br><br>One of the most prominent concepts in Existentialism is individual freedom. The main idea of existentialism depends on individual freedom, and this concept forms the foundation of existentialism. Only when we act on our own completely free will can we be held responsible for our existence.<br><br>Nihilism is a philosophical view that the world, together with and especially human existence, is without any meaning, purpose, comprehensible truth, or essential value. Nihilism is most often associated with Friedrich Nietzsche, due to the fact that he mentioned that Â“God is DeadÂ”. Nietzsche defined nihilism as any philosophy that rejects the real world and our physical existence and this would result in an apathy toward life. He describes it as "the will to nothingness", the desire to destroy meaning, knowledge, and value.<br><br>Nietzsche proposed a remedy to counter the destructive effects of nihilism, and this is the ubermensch. To be an ubermensch, one must give value to their existence by behaving as if one's very existence were a work of art. Nietzsche believed that being ubermensch would be a necessity for human survival in the post-religious era, which he claimed we are living in right now, when he said that Â“God is DeadÂ”. Another way Nietzsche proposed to remedy nihilism is that we go through a revaluation of our morals.<br><br>Now it comes to the point where I have to give my personal views on the topic. I probably can be said to have an existentialistÂ’s stand when I say that the meaning of a personÂ’s life is dictated by the person himself/herself. As I wrote earlier, the French philosopher Albus Camus saw many people dying because they themselves judge that life is not worth living. He also said that he saw others getting killed for the ideas and illusions that give them a reason for living. What Camus observed are two extremes of a Â‘meaning of lifeÂ’ spectrum.<br><br>We as humans were created mostly alike, with slight differences in build, intelligence, et cetera, we were mostly created equal. However, people would be brought up in different environments, and this would result in vast differences in thinking, and hence, their perceptions of their meaning of life. The first group that Camus talked about, are people who find no meaning in life, and are similar to nihilists. These people can be loosely classified into two groups, people who once had an earthly possession or dream that they lost, hence they lose their meaning of life, and the other group is the true nihilists, and people who have come to a conclusion, logically, that life has no meaning.<br><br>On the other side of the Â‘meaning of lifeÂ’ spectrum, lies the successful existentialist. This group consists of idealists, rebels with a cause, and people who live life to the fullest. Sometimes, these people even give their lives for what they think their sole purpose of existence is, people such as religious extremists, martyrs, separatists or political activists with strong attachments to their cause. In a way, these people let their meaning of life dictate the way they use their lives.<br><br>Arguably, there would be some people who would subscribe to a biological point of view, where they see humans being one of the many species in the world, and our main purpose, no different from the other animals, are to survive, procreate and pass on their genes. This can be seen in a certain peoplesÂ’ behaviour, where all they care about is becoming successful (survival of the fittest) getting married and starting a family.<br><br>Personally, I feel that ideally, a person should fall in the middle of this spectrum, and I would say that I believe in a combination of theism (God giving our lives meaning) and existentialism. Being a Christian, I would feel that the meaning of my life would be to serve and obey GodÂ’s commandments, and that He has a purpose for creating us. Our purpose in life is therefore to develop a personal relationship with God, which would be more important than any other worldly aims or ambitions, which we see as temporal.<br><br>Certain existentialist aspects of my life still come into play, as long as it does not conflict with the teachings of the Bible. I do have my dreams and my ambitions, and that, together with God, gives me a reason to strive for certain things, gives my life meaning and a lot to hope for, both in the near future, and in the realm of the eternal.<br><br>To conclude, I would like to say that secularly speaking, I take an existentialist standpoint, and that the meaning of life would be different from person to person. However, it would be up to the individual to give meaning to his/her own life, and live it to the best that he/she can. I totally disagree with a nihilistic standpoint that life has no purpose or meaning. I would say that theistic existentialism, or even existentialism in itself would be enough to give a meaning to life if you try hard enough.</div>
