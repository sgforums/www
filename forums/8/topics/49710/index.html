Da "standard" lifestyle of "How a child grows up to be a useful person" modelled in da mind of da parents. Unfortunately in many cases, it back fired. Like rebellion, truancy, lying, act of disobedience, some even to extreme cases of madness hidden in a normal person until forced out.<br><br>Da pressure given to da children r too great dat I pity them instead. Both children &amp; da parents. Making $$$ is important, BUT grooming da child da CORRECT &amp; better wae is far more important than dat. Giving them HP &amp; more $$$ is not gonna help.<br><br>Wat da children need is QUALITY time wif da family, more communication &amp; understanding btwn them. Da parents have gone thru childhood, so they shld noe wats best for them. But they oso muz take note dat da child is NOT them. so cannot follow all exactly...<br><br>But in dis reality, how many parents can actually do dat? Can really have quality time wif their family instead of work, work, work?</div>

BUT sometimes there muz be a line btwn wats good for them &amp; wats not. There r times when as parents, BOPIAN have to reprimand OR beat da child for their own good.
