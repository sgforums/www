            <div class='col-md body'>just wondering. i dunno if guys know this but girls usually are pretty ok with gays and much less likely to be homophobic. in fact, they often find men who are homophobic a turn off because it seems that those men aren't secure in their own sexuality which is why they feel the need to "hate" people of another sexuality. Maybe u dun know it but being homophobic can screw your chances of getting with a girl. Just letting u know.</div>

And it appears that the 2 type of gays u refer to are the ones who are naturally coded to be gay, and those people who are naturally coded straight, who try to be gay. now we all know that ultimately the straight people who try to be gay will end up being frustrated, and that its better to accept they are straight.
