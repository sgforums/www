Even the evil spirits begged Jesus not to send them back into Hell, but into the pigs instead.<br><br>Anyway one more thing I should add. The kind of "war" that happened in Heaven, with Lucifer against Michael is not a physical war. But rather a spiritual one. As angels are celestial beings, they do not have a body that bleeds. The kind of battle that happened then, and now, and in the future will be the fight for souls.<br><br>I'm not sure if anyone does understand. Satan is the accuser of our brothers Day and Night. He is like the prosecutor in court. What is the kind of "weapon" a prosecutor in court has against the accused? The dirty laundries, the darkest secret, will be exposed and blame after blame, layer after layer like kuey lapis, will Satan accuse the person, of reason how he/she has fallen from grace in Adam, and the right for them to be sentenced to eternal damnation in Hell.<br><br>And there Michael stood, the defendant of God's people. Defending the souls of God's people. ok shan't go too deep into it ; j<br><br>Hell is not just a place deprived of God's presence or blessing. Now, where does the Bible describe hell as a torture chamber? Well, actually it doesn't. It's not Dante's Inferno with Devils poking people with pitchforks. God is not into torturing people himself either (neither is the devil, or the fallen angels as they will be in torment too). Those who go there choose to go in rejection of God's love, and the agony they will have is self inflicted as a direct, and deliberate decision to go away from Him because they hate His authority. They do not want his rulership over their lives. It is like a child not listening to its parent who tells them not to go near the stove when its hot, they don't listen and get burned. God doesn't want anyone to go there and has done what He can to keep people from going there but they have exercised the choice not to listen.<br><br>For those who have rejected the Lord, there will be no more people to frustrate them, they won't be around them anymore. What is hell going to be like? One thing for sure Hell is not a place of eternal sunburn. The Bible describes it as darkness, loneliness, thirst, torment.<br><br>A place where we would not want even our enemies to go to. </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>satan is a representation of the general human tendency to look out for oneself 1st.<br><br>According to the Church of Satan, there is no supreme powerful being named Satan. Instead, Satan is a representation of many things, as can be seen from the 9 satanic statements written in the satanic bible.<br><br>The Nine Satanic Statements<br><br>The Satanic Bible, Â©1969<br><br>by Anton Szandor LaVey<br><br>1. Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence!<br><br>2. Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams!<br><br>3. Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit!<br><br>4. Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on ingrates!<br><br>5. Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek!<br><br>6. Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic vampires!<br><br>7. Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his Â“divine spiritual and intellectual development,Â” has become the most vicious animal of all!<br><br>8. Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!<br><br>9. Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as He has kept it in business all these years!<br></div>
