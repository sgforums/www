People who got there either drink or smoke. What is the intention of most guys going there? I dare to say is to get a hot chicks and try to bed them..<br><br>As for ladies,some go there just for outing,some for the dancing environment,some wants to get some hunk...<br><br>Wouldn't u be worry that yr ger goes clubbing? Stepping into a place full of wolf? Trying to rub yr ass when dancing? Trying to take advantage of yr ger when she is drunk? Worst,spike yr ger drink when she is not aware?<br><br>Why u want to get yrself into a place full of danger?? Just like stepping into Malaysia,fully knowing the danger in there! She may have good intention of just going there for the music and dance. But does the wolf around her have the same mentality in pub?<br><br>Some people say leave it to fate! U go other places might also meet bad guy. But I ask u why u want to increase yr lvl of danger for yrself?? If u really don't agree. Then u go ride bike everyday and risk yr life. Wear a rolex watch and go JB everyweek since u think fate of yr life plays a more important part than the choices u take.<br><br>Can I say if u don't go JB and dont ride bike,will yr chances of getting killed gets lower?<br><br>Just like gals chance of getting take advanatge will gets lower if u don go clubbing???</div></blockquote>the whole things very simple..<br>if guy can go clubbing ..<br>so can girls..<br><br>if u dun like girl go clubbing.<br>too bad.</div>
