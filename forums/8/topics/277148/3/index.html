            <div class='col-md body'>such stuff is like terrorist attacks. rape too. so the same goes for molestation and being taken advantage. males can be the target of assault and theft too.<br><br>if we minimize it, we have already occured some form of damage or loss. however, preparation and prevention is ideal. the best is definitely prevention of visiting such places.<br><br>the 2nd option is risk avoidance. e.g not messing with strangers, not going secluded spot. that would be the 2nd option.<br><br>thirdly in the event of such an occurence, mitigation is the final and last resort.<br><br>we never wan to mitigate any sudden events or emergency because they involve some form of loss. therefore, we try to eliminate them. if some people feel there is certainly a need to go, we seek the second option.<br><br>however, some people tend to see these as out of the question and therefore do not take such risks into consideration.<br><br>remember no option is right or wrong. its all up to an individual. it is not my right to condemn.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok....<br><br>I'm admit... I partied a lot, i enjoy drinking with my frenz guys or gals.<br><br>Dressing: Gals are can be quite competitive even when they are with a group of gal frenz, r concerned about ppl's opinion when it comes to their outlook. When ur groups of frenz dresses up for party, would you like to dress sloppily? When gals dresses up, it boost our confidence. Even when we look into the mirror, at least it's also more pleasant to our own eyes. I dun understand what's everyone's definition of wearing too sexy? a spagetti top and a pair of skinny jeans might be too sexy for 1, but is normal for the other.<br><br>Clubbing: For me, I like to dance to the music, like the atmosphere when everyone is dancing to the music that they like, especially when 1 hit single is playing and you see those who are sitting down stand up and groove together. It doesn't mean dat we gals go clubbing to find new guys. Come on... do u really think we gals need any guys now? Gals without sex won't die... Of coz, it's flattering when guys come up and chat us up, it boost our ego too.. but doesn't mean we have to be real frenz with every guy that comes up to us. Yeah.. i do see if there's any hot guys around when i'm clubbing, but i just ogle, at least i know that there are still good looking guys around. So what, it's just pleasure to my eyes. I might flirt with a guy that pleasing to my eyes on that night, dance together, but that's just it lo. ( thats when i'm single)<br><br>PLEASE STOP ALL THOSE THINKING THAT GALS WHO LIKE TO PARTY LIKES TO SLEEP AROUND! THAT'S STEROTYPING!<br><br></div>
