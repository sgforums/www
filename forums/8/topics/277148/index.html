For some single girls I understand - they go to see guys, increase the probability of getting attached.<br><br>Some go to party with their girls, meet friends from different groups all under one house.<br><br>For those that already have boyfriends why do they still club? Is twice a week considered excessive? Sure they want to party with their girls, network, etc. But is clubbing with one other female friend any fun at all?<br><br>And even then what's the point of wearing revealing outfits with plunging necklines if not to attract members of the opposite sex. And I'm talking about those who already have boyfriends. By all means dance crazily with your girlfriends, but why the need for such revealing outfits. I don't understand.<br><br>Can someone enlighten me. Is it worthwhile dating a girl who likes to club? </div></blockquote>I think it's up to the guys to decide if they really wanna date the girl in the first place. Girls don't go clubbing and paste a signboard on their forehead saying "DATE ME PLS".<br><br>And it doesn't really matter if either gender feels like showing off their sexiness to the other gender if they are feeling sexy on that day.<br><br>We should be allowed to show off as much as we can whenever we're entitled to do so. Else, what's the quality difference between us and the rest? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>
