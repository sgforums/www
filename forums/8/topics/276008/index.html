            <div class='col-md body'>I remember last year my friend booked a chalet in Changi where we could see sea view at the back of it. I was the 2nd to arrive near mid night and the rest of them were still on the way. When the 3rd person arrived was a friend who was a regular in police force, he told me that there was a person who died in that chalet because of commited sucide, and pointed the spot where the decease was lying. It was located directly at the bottom of the stair case.<br><br>He said that he used a piece of broken glass and stabbed into his own chest for no known reason.He told me he knew it because he was one of the policeman who arrived the scene at that time. So every time in the 3 days whenever i was passing the spot where the man had died, i had a picture of a dead man covering in a pool of blood in my mind.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by redstone:</div><div class="quote_body">I camped at Pasir Ris park before.. nothing. What happened?</div></blockquote>Ok, my grammar's not good, so please excuse me for any mistakes i made.<br><br>Let's name her Jane. It happened at about 4 am like that.I was just sleeping beside her. Initially, i dont know anything cause still sleeping as i just returned from kopitiam after watching Germany VS Poland during last year's World Cup you see... Then i was woken up by few of my friends alert me what was happening. They all looked damn shocked and scared, so i turned to where they are all looking at. Jane suddenly shook very strongly like tio "yang dian feng" like that.  One of my female friend stuffed her fingers in her mouth preventing Jane bitting her own tongue.<br><br>Jane kept screaming in very high pitch non-stop. Few guys tried to press her, but she's too strong(took about 5 -6 mins or more). She then managed to get up, resisting all my friend's force, and ran out of the room, took 3 light large steps down the stairs, lost her balance, and land on the ground floor. I then rushed down and hold her up, then she ok liao, as she recognized me. Ambulance then came and took her away for check ups. Few friends accompanied her, while the rest of us packed and left (since just nice, it's the third day already).<br><br>Yang dian feng will not scream one right? Don't even mention geting up and run la. She dont have any past medical record of yang dian feng before at all. After few weeks, she went to seek help from a Taoist, and the taoist told her something was following her, which is xiao gui(little ghost, not from yu le bai fen bai). The xiao gui was then removed.<br><br>And there's a part 2 for this story. This happened after that incident and before she seek for that taoist( i believe).<br><br>One Malay friend of mine, who knows nothing about the chalet incident at all saw something. During recess one day, he sent his gf back to her class(which was Jane's class too) about 5 mins before the bell goes off. He then starts walking back to his class located on the same level which is located only beside the stairs. Half way back, he sense someone was looking at her from a distance. He turned and took a look. It was Jane looking at him, motionlessly with no expression from outside her class, which is already abit far from him already. He waved at her as he knows her. Jane, still stood motionless, looking at him from her class.<br><br>He then ignore her and turned his back and continued walking back to his class. He reached outside his class, and to his surprise, he saw Jane and her friends just returned back from the recess coming up by the stairs beside his class. It was only seconds ago Jane stood outside her class looking at him.<br><br>He then stunned for a moment, motionlessly, and pull one of his classmates who was nearest to him into the class and told him everything.<br><br>All this happened last year, but this second part of the story was only discovered this year after i shared the 1st part with some friends.<br><br>It was Paris Si Ri's Costa Sand. and the chalet was located at a conner of the row, which is know likely for ghost to be living in.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Got 2: Once i was in a car with one guy and two other girls. We were supposed to check out this chalet for our FOC and it was at around 2.30am. Don't know why when we came to a dark stretch of road along this few chalets, the four of us don't dare to step out of the car. We feel overpowered by some dark, mysterious force. Then the day after, my two female friends kenna blue black on their legs.. don't know how they got them.. Maybe while eating supper at there famous market place.. Anyway, the market place isn't there clean.<br><br>The second one happens to one of the two female friends. She was the last one to leave the second floor of the chalet.. and i think she saw a child ghost.. and yeah heard running footsteps around.<br><br></div>
