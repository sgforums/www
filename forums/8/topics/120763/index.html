            <div class='col-md body'>Got my final 3 wisdom teeth removed - 2 upper and the right lower wisdom teeth.<br><br>The two upper teeth, which I self considered were the most problematic ones . They were growing into my cheek and I had 2 holes of an ulcer on each side to show for it. The right lower wisdom tooth was non problematic - never did me any harm. It is amazing how murphy's law kicked in while under sedation.<br><br>In my highly sedated state and locally anaesthetized mouth , I could feel the oral-maxillofacial surgeon digging and popping out the upper teeth like he was picking flowers  .<br><br>Finally the last right lower tooth , the seemingly least troublesome one , gave the surgeon a run for his money. He probed , he pushed , he scrapped - I woke up alert and frightened, from all the discomfort that was travelling through all my pain receptors.<br><br>I heard him talking to the nurse : "Give me the damn drill"<br>He drilled - I started screaming - the pressure was overwhelming .<br>He stopped and looked at me<br>I went " duh pen fal"( my clogged up version of damn painful)<br>He said to his nurse " probably disorientated" and continued<br>I went " nur nur , duhhhh pen fal" (no no , damn painful)<br>He said " let's drill again" while I was screaming Nooo but it came out incoherently to the version of OoOoOOoOoo<br>After a whole eternity of screaming and crying in the dental chair with poor reflexes ( no thanks to the sedation) - I could feel him digging into my jaw ( yes my jaw ). I could see him all shadowy under my tears - he seemed to be in what i call a heave ho posture  - heaving and hoing like european sailors of the old and the pressure was building immensely ....then he said "finally , damn stubborn tooth you have there".<br>I went like ."eeerrrwwww" (oooooouch)<br>He gave me his image perfect pearly teeth of a smile, and said " you are all done and no more teeth to pop out anymore"<br>I would have said "wow what perfect teeth you have " but under the current circumstances I would rather opt to take out his teeth with his drill without LA for HIM.<br><br>Now I knew why my previous oral maxillofacial surgeon did my wisdom tooth removal under general anaesthesia - the first resulted in a hairline fracture of the jaw on the left in an unconscious state<br>Now the second - another hairline facture of the lower jaw on the right in a conscious state .<br><br>However I am an optimist. Now I am looking forward to slimming down a few more kilos because I am having liquid diet like some overzealous dieting anorexic supermodel with a difference - out of necessity. Come to think of it , I will be saving on my telephone bills for the next 2 weeks.  NOW DAMN IT WHERE IS MY CODEINE!</div>

Muahaahhaha<br>Been there done that!<br>However mine is rather complex for some stupid genetic reason - my roots are extremely long. I looked at my wisdom teeth and I was like " Oh hell they are that long?" My lower shattered-into-pieces tooth still has some cartilage thingy attached to it.<br><br>I think the 2 upper roots are about 2cm long. The roots of the lower about 1.5cm to 2cm as well. I think it narrowly missed the nerve , yesterday the swelling started the compression on the nerve and I was drooling like a baby when it was about eat. Just like my other left lower .
