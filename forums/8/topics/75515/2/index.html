            <div class='col-md body'>I Agree to China people's comment (but they should speak nicely).<br><br>Singapore has a lot of problem:<br><br>- Mother language: Singapore is the only country in the world do not seriously use their mother language especially Chinese. Politicians should find out more from American human research how important about mother language.<br><br>- Law are outdated especially women charter:<br>- Why women got hand and leg but cannot work ?<br>- Why the couple agree oral sex but law not allow ?<br>- Why the couple agree marriage agreement but law not allow ?<br><br>- Other:<br><br>PAP should listen to people more and make Feed Back Unit more open and Live.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMO,<br><br>1) The govt. brings in "foreign talents" into Sg because Sg needs them to fill up job vacancies in the future because there are just too few Singaporeans to do so. The only way of us ever getting rid of the "foreign talents" is to increase our birth rate, but Singaporeans are juz too hyped up about their work to pay attention to this simple fact. If our birth rate continues declining, Sg MIGHT just become part of another country so that there won't be an aging population.<br><br>2) It's not enough for the govt. to employ adult "foreign talents" 'cuz ultimately, the SG govt. hopes that they will settle down in Sg and raise a family here, therefore increasin' our birth rate and in the long-run, allowing more jobs to be occupied. So the best way is to "recruit" those young "foreign talents" so as to try to psycho them that Sg rAwKz. (Lol...)  [You can't deny that there ARE PRCs who are psycho-ed, can you?]<br><br>3) Also, with PRCs in Sg, don't you think that Singaporeans will feel more compelled to work harder so as not to lose to them? PpleZ in my sch are, and i think that isn't a bad idea. The reasoning is simple: You don't like them, u diss them by doin' better den them. What's the point of getting all flared up about it?? It'll only affect ur work and then our govt. will feel even more need to "recruit" the young PRCs.
