            <div class='col-md body'>There was some Deejay mocking SG Idol over the air last week.<br><br>Honestly? We try too hard to mimic the Americans by cloning their variety shows. Asia Bagus was already good, so why must we sell the idol concept? Stinks of bootlicking and a lack of creativity in our one-tv-station called MEDIACORP.<br><br>And they continue to restrict access to satellite TV. Even cable TV is heavily constrained.<br><br>This entire wildcard thingy was a farce from the start. With Joan Lee withdrawing, it only confirms the lack of committment to the competition by the participants and its low standing among locals.</div>
