He's a great teacher, advisor and counsellor and will give good advice even if it's a bit conventional in spirit. He can represent the feeling of having one's creativity stifled and is not the favourite card of the deck for the more maverick and unconventional of us.<br><br>External Meaning: Religious influence.

Trust in inner voice.<br>Suspension, change, reversal, boredom, abandonment, sacrifice, readjustment, improvement, rebirth<br>He usually represents a time of feeling in limbo, being stuck or being prevented from moving forward. He's usually depicted hanging upside down with his hands tied - that's just what it feels like! We need to remain flexible and willing to let go of things, it's probably a time for sacrifice. Like the man in this card from the Murciano Tarot, don't sweat it, take some time out and be patient.<br>The Hanged Man - External Meaning: Spiritual awareness and the happiness and assuredness it brings. Sacrificing for a noble purpose. Reveral of one's current way of life. Inner peace. Developed intuition and prophecy. Esoteric Meaning: The spirit of the mighty waters. Reversing false images. Sacrifice. Energys: Water<br></div>
