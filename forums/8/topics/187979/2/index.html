Very Happy see .... all the world class countries more or less have porn industries so how can we claim to be mature and developed like them when we shrink from even thinking about having one.</blockquote>KNN! leave my SG girls alone hor! open country? sure, but not at the expense of vice.<br>i certainly hate to see drunken girls spewing vomit on the streets at night while some males go behind them and start the ****ing in public.<br><br>actually, we all have sexual desires and drive, myself also. but doing it to our own girls i don't agree with you. KNN.....western countries and japan got a lot already.....how the folks in those countries want to play with their girls, even if it's like animals, i don't care, but SG girls cannot touch.<br>the idea is : go abroad for sex-related activities and go as wild as you want, behave like a sex-starved animal who ****s 50 japanese girls in a harem setting or whatever. that's cool.<br>but SG is a clean place for living and healthy stuff; u perform these acts in other countries and leave the sh*t there. that's how it goes.<br><br><blockquote>I'm seriously comtemplating about joining the porn industry or at least have a hand in building it up. I intend to call my company Buck Fitch Productions you see it rhymes Buck Fitch --- &gt; Fuc_ _itch good ah Mr. Green</blockquote>the interracial genres, the car/ship/bus genres and the SM-type genres are over-saturated already. story genres will bore people after a while, trust me. the best is to go for special genres that are direct and to the core : like 1 man on 10 girls in a row, one after another that kind. this will ignite the hunter-predator primeval instinct in all males &amp; u get $$$$.<br><br><blockquote>I have abt $2000 enough to buy a small video cam and some tape then we can rock and roll, next I'll need at least 6 very talented actresses dun need very pretty but must have some experience though it can be learnt on the job but more important must be daring to try different outrageous things</blockquote>don't find sg girls lah. they not very suitable for porn industry, cos' their personality more reserved, hold-back and not-sure-what-to-do in bed that kind; thus their reactions won't be natural enough.<br>go to Japan; there got a lot. the laws there really lax like anything.<br>brazil, europe......whatever.<br><br><blockquote>But bear in mind whatever we do as actors and actresses we do it not for profit but artistic value ...<br>WE ARE ARTIST MAN!!!</blockquote>rubbish; porn means porn. i never believe in those nude painting or whatever crap. if u want your company to do well, don't hold back : go full-force. be yourself and let your wild instincts take over during the filming process.<br>then, host the thing on a professional web site and hola!<br><br>just remember : DO NOT DO SG GIRLS.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore porn industry will not be economically viable. How will you compete with the Western productions with their bigger assets and internet distribution?<br><br>Perhaps if you wait for the new Singapore optical broadband network, EDB may be willing to consider your films to fill the bandwidth. A more viable route could be to produce short films or commercials and sell them to the 3G service providers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good thinking but Singapore's sencorship board is a big problem. It will cut your film till it look like some cheap RA show you get in Princess cinema.<br><br>Don't look at the US or Japan, their sencorship board are less strict with things. In fact, some NC16 and M18 shows here are only rated NC14 in Japan and the States allows most movies to show to people 17 and above</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It has been brought to my attention through private email and some forums that the above named girl is a PROSTITUTE and residing in #02 Blk 411 Pandan Garden.<br><br>I wont go into a story of what has happened to these brothers but if you happen to have any FL approaching you, ask her where she stay. This Poh Li Zhu studies in Simei ITE for your info.<br><br>This is a matter of Public Policy. As a citizen of Singapore, I have the right and DUTY to warn guys to steer clear of prostitutes who are out to get guys into trouble.<br><br>If you have sons around, the last thing you want is for a prostitute to hook up and seduce your son and then cry rape, isnt it? Guys and fellow Singaporeans, you have been warned. This is my duty to inform all of you.<br><br>I dont care if the girl or any brudders here ask if I am afriad of being sued for defamation. I have all the necessary evidence to vindicate my allegation that this girl is a Prostitute and a Congenial LIAR.. There is no harm in stating the FACTS. I will be like the old man Lee Kuan Yew who, with all the evidence, challenge opposition to sue him for calling them LIARs etc.<br><br>I am more concerned for brudders here who may be involved in these prostitutes.. it is the same as meeting Sherine the Hulk.<br><br>Guys, you are warned. Please remember this girl.</div>
