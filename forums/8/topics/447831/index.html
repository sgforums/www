              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>May I ask you this silly question 'cause I am an expat and I don't know well about Singaporean culture. If a Singaporean man wears a ring on his right ring finger, does it mean he is married/engaged/has a gf?</p>
              <p>If it's that for men, the wedding/engagement ring is supposed to wear, not on the right, but the left ring finger, do Singaporean men wear ring on the right ring finger for fashion purpose?</p>
              <p>I am confused because there is this man with a ring on his right hand fourth finger one day approaching me to introduce himself and showed his interest in me ever since. And I am very sure he is not a flirty person at all plus the first time he approached me, there were many of our acquaintances around. I surely never have the guts to ask him straight away :(</p>
              <p>Appreciate any thoughts. Thanks</p>

              <p>I wanted to check him out secretly before giving back some signals. I am reluctant to have any other involved, not to mention myself and them are not that close to question about his private life. If the ring he wears does symbolise his marital status, I would then never bother giving it a chance at all.</p>
              <p>So, may you please advise straight to my question about wedding ring culture in Singapore, do I have even a slight hope that he might wear it for other reasons, say habitural preference for beauty? haha</p>

              <p>Married men wear ring on the fourth finger of the left hand, married women wear it on the fourth finger of their left hand. If men wear it on their right, meaning still single and available, same goes to women, if they wear it on the left, mean they are still single and waiting for partner.</p>

              <p>THese days I see people wearing rings in their middle
              finger-pinkie-thumb-fourth finger-index finger. I am confused.</p>
              <p>Ok for me - I am making a mental note. Next time when courting
              ladies - don't wear a ring !</p>

              <p>And yes, you better off leaving your fingers bare!</p>
