              <p>Your friend should  make the trip to the Singapore Abbatoirs to see how they slaughter animals there.(A)First the pig is being electrocuted and (B)then hang upside down by the hind legs where a butcher would cut the throat to let the blood drain (C) the carcass is then lowered to a couldren of boiling water (D) pig is is fully boiled and color turns pink (E) go through a machine that shaves it (F) skilled butcher guts out the pig (G) carcass is being weigh &amp; stamped.</p>

              <p>It's in their Quran which in part contains what I think the whole old testament of the Christian bible which originated in the Jewish Torah.</p>
              <p>Since I only ever read the bible there is a passage in the old testament that forbids the Jews from eating pork. The Christians are not observing this rule since Jesus said what goes out of your mouth is more important than what goes in. So the Christians use that as a basis that nothing is spiritually unclean to be eaten.</p>

              <p>well, I used to wonder, why no english subtitles for malay channels but for other channels, we need to have english, chinese and I once cheeze off a malay friend when I asked is it possible for them to change religion.</p>

              <p>wah suddenly the pseudo muslims appear <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Muslims can keep and touch dogs provided they have their abolution after touching them at all times.</p>
              <p>Haram foods were ruled unacceptable in revelations to the Prophet Moses, one of the line of prophets revered in Islam which includes Prophet Abraham and Prophet Jesus. The laws as they were revealed to Prophet Moses, along with other hints on health are set out in the Book of Leviticus in the Old Testament. However, they were further clarified in the final Revelation to the Prophet Muhammad pbuh which is documented in the Quran, the foremost of Islam's holy books.</p>
              <p>In view of these later clarifications, there were some differences between Muslim dietary practices and those still followed by the Jews which are kosher. The story of the Revelation of the dietary laws to Prophet Moses pbuh and Prophet Muhammad pbuh and the practical benefits they have conferred on millions of people ever since are still present in the world today.</p>
              <p>After Prophet Moses led the exodus from Egypt, he was given dietary laws that would preserve the health and integrity of the tribe. The meat of pigs and some other animals was ruled unacceptable, removing a substantial risk of disease. Carrion, and birds that feed on carrion (like vultures) were not to be eaten. The same is true of birds that hunt prey, and certain insects and other creatures that are associated with filth. Donkeys (coincidentally work animals) were not to be killed for meat.</p>
              <p>Same goes to alcohol...Drinks that intoxicates you and disable you of any of the five senses whether coherent of alcohol or not such as fermented liquid are haram.</p>
