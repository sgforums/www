              <p>For Normal Heterosexual guys,</p>
              <p>How would you react if someone calls you gay.</p>
              <p>I have many guy friends whom sometime i joke that they are gay. Yet they laugh and ignore it and deny it of course.</p>
              <p>But there is this one guy friend, when i called him gay, he was so angry till now he hold a grudge towards me. Is he unknowingly gay, that he himself is afraid to question? Coz since young, he has been very over-sensitive over the issue of someone being gay.</p>
              <p>He's kinda feminine. When I asked the people that knew us both about it, many wasnt suprised if he's gay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What do you guys think?</p>

              <p>kinda sums it all up.</p>
              <p>being insulted when called a gay does not mean anything. he might have had a tragic past involving a gay, etc. you wouldn't know and you don't have to know.</p>

              <p><br>i think you shouldn't look at it or so call make fun of it, whether he is gay or guy, if he is your friend, understand him and dun agitate him, same goes to you, you also got your bad points, what if someone say bad about you infront of you or things that you dun want to hear as a friend, sure you get angry ya. Be mature ya, i find sg guy lack of maturity and many still sucking milk in their late 20s.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gay, guy or gal, have friends, friend dun look at each other weakness to tease each other ya. Sometime, a gay is a better friend than a normal person. They are more caring and understanding. We have to accept them, afterall, most are born to be, not their fault, even if you dun like them, respect the parents who born them ya.</p>

              <p>Reminds me of one time i got really pissed when a good bro keep saying i gay. I think that time was too highly intoxicated and not in good mood, thats why reacted a little more then i should have.</p>
              <p>But anyways la, some people may be more sensitive ma. Its like calling a short guy a dwarf. He will definately react a little more then ur average person that is NOT short.</p>
              <p>If u are tall.. n ppl call u a dwarf, no doubt ur reactions will be much less then that of a short person who has been called a dwarf most of his life. Did i just repeat myself? hahaha</p>

              <p>And its usually the really gay fellas in deniel, will try to call other people gay.</p>
              <p>Or in TS case, keep using it to joke about.</p>
              <p>Its a somewhat psycho matter to try to justify joking about others are gay, when one sunconsiously wanted to be gay.</p>

              <p><br>Well, the answer you seek lies on the reaction that your feminine guy friend reaction. What are you trying to prove? That he is not normal and gay???</p>
              <p>If you are feminine in nature and your friend say you are gay... don't you think it is more like an insult?</p>
