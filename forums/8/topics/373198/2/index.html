              <p>This is what I was thinking too.</p>
              <p><strong>If it's not true, then why be so freaking upset? Similarly to the example, if you're tall, you wont be upset if someone calls you a dwarf. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>That's my point here.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S. I have nothing agains homosexuals whatsoever. I prefer comments from heterosexual guys since they would be 'in the position' of knowing about this reaction more.</p>
              <p>I am girl who jokes around. So, I do call &amp; joke most of my guy friends by saying, 'Maybe you're gay' . And they brush it off. Except for this person.</p>

              <p>I suspect that's he's gay cause all his he added his fb unknown friends who ARE gay and take photos half naked with other men. And from his reaction about the gay community. In addition, from his reaction of holding a grudge for a long time because of this.</p>
