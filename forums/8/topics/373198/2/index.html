              <p>This is what I was thinking too.</p>
              <p><strong>If it's not true, then why be so freaking upset? Similarly to the example, if you're tall, you wont be upset if someone calls you a dwarf. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>That's my point here.</strong></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>P.S. I have nothing agains homosexuals whatsoever. I prefer comments from heterosexual guys since they would be 'in the position' of knowing about this reaction more.</p>
              <p>I am girl who jokes around. So, I do call &amp; joke most of my guy friends by saying, 'Maybe you're gay' . And they brush it off. Except for this person.</p>
