              <p><br>Stop assuming and stereotyping me.</p>
              <p>It seems that you and him have a lot of similarity. As I have mentioned many times, I too have joked or call my other male(feminine or not) gay, and they didnt hold a grudge like he did. He's the ONLY one who reacted that way.</p>
              <p>I have mentioned this too, I dont mind gay friends.</p>
              <p>And you're assuming this person is LIKE you. FIY, he's not comfortable with the gay community. It seems that he hates them too much. I wonder why? Being uneasy or discomfort is one thing, but hating the gay community? He did mention to me that he MIGHT be gay.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>P.S. why are you so defensive about this. I merely asking an opinion is he's gay or not from his reaction.</p>

              <p>How would you react if someone calls you gay.</p>
              <p>I have many guy friends whom sometime i joke that they are gay. Yet they laugh and ignore it and deny it of course.</p>
              <p>But there is this one guy friend, when i called him gay, he was so angry till now he hold a grudge towards me. Is he unknowingly gay, that he himself is afraid to question? Coz since young, he has been very over-sensitive over the issue of someone being gay.</p>
              <p>He's kinda feminine. When I asked the people that knew us both about it, many wasnt suprised if he's gay.</p>
