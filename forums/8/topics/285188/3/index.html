Yet she did. To this old twit, this is now an open challenge, and it is a revenge which this old twit would want to settle because simply his ego does not allow him to swallow it.<br><br>So i say damn this wretched attacker, and SHAME on his family for still siding with him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you to the samatarian who decided to go to the chinese printed press on this issue. Though this thought has not crossed my mind yet.<br><br>Nonetheless, thank you for your righteous act. I believe in a gentlemen way of retaliatinig to this attacker, to this brutal assault on the way of life; the right to earn a decent living.<br><br>Through the power of media, (be it online forum or printed press), together justice will reign and this mental lease, this public condemation will hopefully keep this old twit in check and eliminate any thoughts of touching my mum.<br><br>Let it be said here, that if anything bad should further happen to my mum now within this period, i will attribute it to the revenge act of this attacker since he now has the biggest motive. The rule of law and the civic consciousness of our media friends; and online forum friends will ensure there is no room for such tyrants to continue to breath in Singapore.<br><br>Let it be said that from today onwards, if the attacker were to even heave a further word of vulgarity to my mum, or do any further acts of intimidation, or even just the simple act of showing within my mum's sight, while she is making her delivery, then i can assure that the attacker will face the full might of the law.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm just wanna give you people an update. I accompanied my mum to the attacker's floor, and she did her normal routine of delivering her cultured milk products. As i walk past the attacker's unit, i finally had a good look  at the attacker, his son and his wife.<br><br>Well, thankfully, the attacker was visibly subdued and quiet and he did not make any noise when my mum walked past his unit. So..i guess the police stern warning and the press report did the trick.<br><br>Nonetheless, initially my mum hesitated and wanted to postpone the delivery to the 10th floor. But i disagreed because to give in and not deliver the products would imply that we are afraid of that tyrannt; and it is also bad customer service to the other residents in level 10 who have ordered the cultured milk from her. More importantly, i told her that she MUST walk past the attacker's unit.. and do her normal routine. otherwise this fear will eat into her. and haunt her for the rest of her life.<br><br>Well, i was prepared when i went up. If the attacker were to as much as to utter one word of vulgarity , or step out of the house, i would call the police. Because this is sufficent reason to believe that the attacker would be hostile. This rule of engagement will persist and remain for my mum; and i have told her to adhere to this rule of engagement.<br><br>Of course, my mother and i hope for a peaceful and gentlemanly closure to this issue. I will keep you people updated; especially if there is repeat of the 2nd incident.<br><br>Thank you all for your advice. Appreciated it very much.</div>
