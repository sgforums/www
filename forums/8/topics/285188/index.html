            <div class='col-md body'>I am sure you have heard of the latest campaign on prevention of violence to SBS bus drivers since there was a spike in cases of drivers being assaulted by bus passengers. I believe there is also a need now to launch a campaign to prevent cultured milk delivery ladies from violence. My mum works as a cultured milk home delivery lady and she delivers the cultured milk to the residents in the Bedok North St 3 neighborhood. She has a mega-fitted bicycle with has 2 boxes to hold and transport the cultured milks to residentsÂ’ home.<br><br>On 11th October 2007 (Thursday) at 945pm at Blk 535 Bedok North Street 3, level 10, she was nearly beaten up. The contentious point is that the attacker (a Chinese man in his 50s) had previously mopped and cleaned the common corridor in front of his house. But because both of his neighbors had ordered the cultured milk from my mum; thus she is forced to push the bicycle across the attackerÂ’s front corridor. The attacker was very pissed that my mumÂ’s bicycle stained his cleaned corridor floor and thus hurled vulgarities at my mum, calling her in essence in Hokkien, meaning, Â“you wretched old loose, torn c*u*n*tÂ”.<br><br>And then the attacker stopped her in her path and demanded that my mum wipe up his stained corridor. She refused because the corridor is common property and beside it was a legitimate reason as she was delivering the cultured milk to customers. It is not as if this was done by some prankster kids. Nonetheless, when my mum refused, this attacker charged up to my mum, and nearly punched my mother. Luckily the attacker was stopped by his son and friend. I was deeply convinced that had the attacker not been stopped, my mum would suffer sever facial and even dental injuries.<br><br>A police report was made and yeah we are considering taking civil suit action on this attacker. Hmm in this case, because my mum has not been beaten yet, hence the police could not arrest the attacker but merely went up to the unit to issue stern warning to the attacker. Just to consult you guys (especially lawyers or current legal students), though I really want to pursue justice, I am a bit concerned about the legal and lawyer fees. In such a case, what are the odds of us winning the case and ensuring that the attacker is made to pay all the legal fees?<br><br>Thank you really appreciate your advice and yeah condemnation for that attacker is welcomed too.<br></div>

The attacker was very pissed that my mumÂ’s bicycle stained his cleaned corridor floor and thus hurled vulgarities at my mum, calling her in essence in Hokkien, meaning, Â“you wretched old loose, torn c*u*n*tÂ”.<br><br>And then the attacker stopped her in her path and demanded that my mum wipe up his stained corridor. She refused because the corridor is common property and beside it was a legitimate reason as she was delivering the cultured milk to customers. It is not as if this was done by some prankster kids. Nonetheless, when my mum refused, this attacker charged up to my mum, and nearly punched my mother. Luckily the attacker was stopped by his son and friend. I was deeply convinced that had the attacker not been stopped, my mum would suffer sever facial and even dental injuries.<br><br>A police report was made and yeah we are considering taking civil suit action on this attacker. Hmm in this case, because my mum has not been beaten yet, hence the police could not arrest the attacker but merely went up to the unit to issue stern warning to the attacker. Just to consult you guys (especially lawyers or current legal students), though I really want to pursue justice, I am a bit concerned about the legal and lawyer fees. In such a case, what are the odds of us winning the case and ensuring that the attacker is made to pay all the legal fees?<br><br>Thank you really appreciate your advice and yeah condemnation for that attacker is welcomed too.<br></div></blockquote>So in essence, no harm has been done. But you want to stir shit up?<br><br>Not going to get any help from me I'm afraid.</div>
