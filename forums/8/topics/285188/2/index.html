Are you hoping that it happens again, and then you would take action? I certainly hope not. Why would anybody hope that their love ones have to go through mental, if not physical anguish, at the hands of ruffians as such, just to prove a point. As you have already stated, if the 'abuser/attacker' was not held back by his companions, he would have striked your mother. What are you waiting for? To make enquiries now on what would be your next step is better than hoping the man strikes your mother in the future. If a civil suit is what you are looking at, then do some homework now. Your mother is not a punching bag! We live in a civilised society, or I hope so in-essence. We should not have to tolerate such behaviour and neither do we ought to give these lowlifes a second chance.</div>

I believe there is also a need now to launch a campaign to prevent cultured milk delivery ladies from violence. My mum works as a cultured milk home delivery lady and she delivers the cultured milk to the residents in the Bedok North St 3 neighborhood. She has a mega-fitted bicycle with has 2 boxes to hold and transport the cultured milks to residentsÂ’ home.<br><br>On 11th October 2007 (Thursday) at 945pm at Blk 535 Bedok North Street 3, level 10, she was nearly beaten up. The contentious point is that the attacker (a Chinese man in his 50s) had previously mopped and cleaned the common corridor in front of his house. But because both of his neighbors had ordered the cultured milk from my mum; thus she is forced to push the bicycle across the attackerÂ’s front corridor. The attacker was very pissed that my mumÂ’s bicycle stained his cleaned corridor floor and thus hurled vulgarities at my mum, calling her in essence in Hokkien, meaning, Â“you wretched old loose, torn c*u*n*tÂ”.<br><br>And then the attacker stopped her in her path and demanded that my mum wipe up his stained corridor. She refused because the corridor is common property and beside it was a legitimate reason as she was delivering the cultured milk to customers. It is not as if this was done by some prankster kids. Nonetheless, when my mum refused, this attacker charged up to my mum, and nearly punched my mother. Luckily the attacker was stopped by his son and friend. I was deeply convinced that had the attacker not been stopped, my mum would suffer sever facial and even dental injuries.<br><br>A police report was made and yeah we are considering taking civil suit action on this attacker. Hmm in this case, because my mum has not been beaten yet, hence the police could not arrest the attacker but merely went up to the unit to issue stern warning to the attacker. Just to consult you guys (especially lawyers or current legal students), though I really want to pursue justice, I am a bit concerned about the legal and lawyer fees. In such a case, what are the odds of us winning the case and ensuring that the attacker is made to pay all the legal fees?<br><br>Thank you really appreciate your advice and yeah condemnation for that attacker is welcomed too.<br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by New Creation:</div><div class="quote_body">I am sure you have heard of the latest campaign on prevention of violence to SBS bus drivers since there was a spike in cases of drivers being assaulted by bus passengers. I believe there is also a need now to launch a campaign to prevent cultured milk delivery ladies from violence. My mum works as a cultured milk home delivery lady and she delivers the cultured milk to the residents in the Bedok North St 3 neighborhood. She has a mega-fitted bicycle with has 2 boxes to hold and transport the cultured milks to residentsÂ’ home.<br><br>On 11th October 2007 (Thursday) at 945pm at Blk 535 Bedok North Street 3, level 10, she was nearly beaten up. The contentious point is that the attacker (a Chinese man in his 50s) had previously mopped and cleaned the common corridor in front of his house. But because both of his neighbors had ordered the cultured milk from my mum; thus she is forced to push the bicycle across the attackerÂ’s front corridor. The attacker was very pissed that my mumÂ’s bicycle stained his cleaned corridor floor and thus hurled vulgarities at my mum, calling her in essence in Hokkien, meaning, Â“you wretched old loose, torn c*u*n*tÂ”.<br><br>And then the attacker stopped her in her path and demanded that my mum wipe up his stained corridor. She refused because the corridor is common property and beside it was a legitimate reason as she was delivering the cultured milk to customers. It is not as if this was done by some prankster kids. Nonetheless, when my mum refused, this attacker charged up to my mum, and nearly punched my mother. Luckily the attacker was stopped by his son and friend. I was deeply convinced that had the attacker not been stopped, my mum would suffer sever facial and even dental injuries.<br><br>A police report was made and yeah we are considering taking civil suit action on this attacker. Hmm in this case, because my mum has not been beaten yet, hence the police could not arrest the attacker but merely went up to the unit to issue stern warning to the attacker. Just to consult you guys (especially lawyers or current legal students), though I really want to pursue justice, I am a bit concerned about the legal and lawyer fees. In such a case, what are the odds of us winning the case and ensuring that the attacker is made to pay all the legal fees?<br><br>Thank you really appreciate your advice and yeah condemnation for that attacker is welcomed too.<br></div></blockquote>you filed police report already right? check with the inverstigator in-charge for the case classification, and then ask him for what you can do should you want further action to be taken. depending on case classification, either police will initiate investigation, or they will need your help to file a magistrate's complaint.<br><br>filing magistrate's complaint should be foc. you need not pay to engage your own counsel yet. your case will be heard before a magistrate, who will then decide whether or not the police should initiate proceedings. if not, he will either summon the guy who ebat your mum to court for a mediation session, or he will suggest you take legal action yourself. but all this will be decided by the magistrate, and after you have filed the magistrate's complaint.<br><br>check with the investigator first, and see what he advises you to do. hope your mom gets better soon. =)</div>

He would have hit my mum, if not for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>quick reflexes </strong></span>of the attacker's son and friend in stopping him. So you see, the attacker had the innate desire to beat up my mum. So i really cant put it as a small matter. No peace...<br><br>Because my mum would have to frequent this blk because she has a lot of other customers in this block; the worst thing is, no matter what , she still has to walk past this attacker's unit to deliver the cultured milk to the attacker's neighbours. There is no knowing when the attacker could suddenly sprung out, launch a covert surprise assault on my mum.<br><br>We are talking about an aggressive attacker in his 50s+, burly, uncivilized, possibly with little education, rash, vulgar, and with a vengance; who will not easily let matters to rest. In fact, i believe this dude's temper is not appeased yet (it is hard for such a person with such a profile).<br><br>I hope that the residents living in Blk 535 could lend an assistance and an watchful eye to my mum, in the event if you witness her being assaulted by this attacker living in level 10.</div>

But the consideration then is. she will have to carry by hand the cultured milk products which is quite heavy.<br><br>And i think the issue has come to a point where the old twit is no longer sore at my mum's bicycle, but he has gone to person-specific, i.e. targetting my mum. So it makes no difference now, as long as he nw sees my mum, with or without the bicycle, he will lose it and attempt to attack her.<br><br>The problem is.. i checked with the investigation officer and he said.. cant file personal protection order against strangers. so yeah our hands are abit tight..</div>
