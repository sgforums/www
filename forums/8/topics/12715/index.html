            <div class='col-md body'>It is not that guys mind being the lead and all. Maybe some girls find that offensive, like our nice Miss Fireice here. There is the emergence of the new lady. Take that advertisement 'The Men don't get it'.. It implies that the attitudes of women are gradually changing, whether we like it or not. They want to be independent. They ARE becoming more independent. They can support themselves. They are no longer the weaker sex when come to relationships. They no longer have to relly on men.<br><br>Men can agree with this, with the few exceptions. We can put down our egos and put our hands to work. Household chores can be shared in a certain percentage. Both parents can take care of the newborn equally. We can understand if you want to pursue your career. We can keep you full support without any qualms.<br><br>But what we are disgrunted about is not the emergence of the 'independent' woman. We are disgrunted with society, its inability to reflect the uprising of such a woman. Laws still support the old native notion of women being the weaker sex, being the one who has to follow the husband. The woman is the one considered to take care of the child, they get long after birth leave compared to fathers.<br><br>It is not as if we dun give a damn to how you women feel. It is just that society makes it hard for us to do so!<br><br>------------------<br><strong>I consider myself an Expert tomato gardener since all of my friends tell me I have the most colourful and sweetest tomatoes.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm<br>interesting thoughts<br>for me personally, i welcome the idea of going dutch now, and i also won't mind sharing the household chores next time too. The financially independent woman is a good thing too, not only because i dun have to pay so much, but also that she can like have more freedom too...<br>i wouldnt really know what subserviant women really are because i live in a family where the women are really very 'strong' minded and all. So i guess from a young age i already wish for an idealogically strong woman to be my companion.<br>I must agree with dot and cross on that society still is structured such that men are advantaged in certain ways, like scholarship quotas(this one i know for sure).<br>I'm not really sure if income tax also got play a part, those paying, does it?<br><br>However i guess the bright side is that people are now recognizing that the woman is as strong as a man when it comes to contributiuons to society and maybe that next time osciety as a whole will change to become more equal to the female sex.</div>
