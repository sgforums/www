            <div class='col-md body'>Independent gals are becoming a reality in our modern,practical society today in Singapore loh...whether we(guys) like it or not.<br><br>Personally independent gals r not bad coz they r more suited to survive in this world liao haha, unlike in e past where they would stick to their BF and expect him to help them out in almost everything.<br>Nowadays gals have more choice and authority to make their decisions liao so we r oso seeing more and more gals remaining single(scary sia)<br>But one thing worrying is that, these kind of gals when it comes to looking for a stead hor, they might want one guy that is much more independent than them(to b able to impress them) but at the same time muz not be too male chauvinst(or else it would restrict their independence). hiaz...it's such a complicated world we're living in man.<br>so shld we guys be more 'manly' or be more like the new term "S.N.A.G"?</div>

We are disgrunted with society, its inability to reflect the uprising of such a woman. Laws still support the old native notion of women being the weaker sex, being the one who has to follow the husband. The woman is the one considered to take care of the child, they get long after birth leave compared to fathers.<br><br>It is not as if we dun give a damn to how you women feel. It is just that society makes it hard for us to do so!<br><br></div></blockquote>alright..since u mentioned this..i mighht as well add to my comments..<br><br>in a way..the Law is protecting women..we have the Women's Charter as well as the Muslim Law Act...<br>but we are following the British's system...<br>we take a walk into history..and we can see tt our pre-generations view women as "low status" and a child-breeding machine...<br>the fight for "equality" arised partly due to policies and international concerns abt the fast-growing populations...esp after WW2..there is a need to give women a "right" to be able to control their lives..and from there..able to control population (lowering fertility)...<br>in the past...a women has to perform the duties of a wife (bearing children and taking care of them)..and thus baring them from working outside...and due to religious reasons...contraception is a sin...("every child is a god-sent")..so women is the "suppressed sex" (i wun say "the weaker sex")...so..when population policies surfaced..women are liberalised..they can make their own decisions and have a say in wat they want to do in their life(definitely not a child-breeding machine and a glorified Maria at home)...<br>and the trickle-down effect is clearly seen in today's society..althought the "controlling population aspect" is undermined oredi..<br>women delay marriage...or married oredi but postpone child-bearing...the rise of working-class wives...<br>as we advance..there are bout to have over-flows from the past mixed with new ideals..<br><br>we could not change the society but have to adapt our ever-changing world..<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The only thing that is constant in this world is change</span><br></div>
