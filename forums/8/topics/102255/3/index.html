            <div class='col-md body'>first things first.. star wars univers mixes politics, war, a bit of religion.. and of course theories and scientific fiction... this is an interesting blend in ANY film available ( though none has it). Its actually split into alot of parts as the story progresses.<br><br>1. Luke skywalker finds his identity (episode 4), then goes on to challenge it (5) and finds out his sibling and fought against his father who wanted him to join the dark side (6). The final battle in episode 6 meant alot.. it tells of the bond btwn the father and son and their ironic relationship.<br><br>2. Leia brought up as a politician in alderaan not knowing her true identity. She has to convince her OWN planet to take up arms and fight againstr THE EMPIRE (the ruling governtment in episode 4, 5 and half of 6). She spearheads the REBELS against the governtment.. trying to restore the REPUBLIC rule. She finds her brother in episode 4 unknowingly and fought alongside him.. mistaking him as her love. but in episode 5, she started to fall in love wif han solo ( smuggler turned hero). In episode 6 she finds out tt LuKe is her brother and this was when the final battle against the EMPIRE begins (Battle of Endor)<br><br>3. Han solo was dragged into the war when he took up a deal to smuggle LUKE and OBI-WAN out of tatooine in episode 4 and stayed in the rebellion because of his love for LEIA. He became a hero after he lead the GROUND BATTLE in endor to victory.<br><br>4. The Final battle was the most enticing.. the SPACE BATTLE LANDO led in against the EMPIRE fleet. The GROUND BATTLE which HAN SOLO and LEIA led in to sabotage the shield covering DEATH STAR 2. And lastly the private battle between LUKE, DARTH VADER and THE EMPEROR ( ONE SKILFULL JEDI CAN TURN THE TIDES OF A WAR in STar wars and if luke lost so was the republic)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by bastion:</div><div class="quote_body">first things first.. star wars univers mixes politics, war, a bit of religion.. and of course theories and scientific fiction... this is an interesting blend in ANY film available ( though none has it). Its actually split into alot of parts as the story progresses.<br><br>1. Luke skywalker finds his identity (episode 4), then goes on to challenge it (5) and finds out his sibling and fought against his father who wanted him to join the dark side (6). The final battle in episode 6 meant alot.. it tells of the bond btwn the father and son and their ironic relationship.<br><br>2. Leia brought up as a politician in alderaan not knowing her true identity. She has to convince her OWN planet to take up arms and fight againstr THE EMPIRE (the ruling governtment in episode 4, 5 and half of 6). She spearheads the REBELS against the governtment.. trying to restore the REPUBLIC rule. She finds her brother in episode 4 unknowingly and fought alongside him.. <span style="color: red;"><span class="large">mistaking him as her love</span></span>. but in episode 5, she started to fall in love wif han solo ( smuggler turned hero). In episode 6 she finds out tt LuKe is her brother and this was when the final battle against the EMPIRE begins (Battle of Endor)<br><br>3. Han solo was dragged into the war when he took up a deal to smuggle LUKE and OBI-WAN out of tatooine in episode 4 and stayed in the rebellion because of his love for LEIA. He became a hero after he lead the GROUND BATTLE in endor to victory.<br><br>4. The Final battle was the most enticing.. the SPACE BATTLE LANDO led in against the EMPIRE fleet. The GROUND BATTLE which HAN SOLO and LEIA led in to sabotage the shield covering DEATH STAR 2. And lastly the private battle between LUKE, DARTH VADER and THE EMPEROR ( ONE SKILFULL JEDI CAN TURN THE TIDES OF A WAR in STar wars and if luke lost so was the republic)</div></blockquote>Bo lah.<br><br>Luke was attracted to Leia's beauty right from the beginning, without knowing that's his sister.  Leia and Han established a love hate relation from Ep 4 and in Ep 5 Leia always used Luke to make Han jealous.  Only towards the end of Ep 5, Leia and Han expressed their feelings to each other, cuz they thought they were not going to see each other again (Han was about to be frozen &amp; sent to Jabba).<br><br>Han was a bit jealous of Luke, especially he thought there was something going on between Leia and Luke (there was NEVER); and that Leia and Luke were always able to have telepathic communications with each other (cuz they were twins and jedis).  Eg1. Leia heard Luke calling for help after he was defeated &amp; injured by Darthvader, though they were many miles apart. Eg2. When Luke won the battle in Ep 6, Leia was the first one to sense it.</div>
