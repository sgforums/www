It was kinda interesting there cos I met an old man who told us about his experience of the war. And then I had so much trouble communicating with those who couldn't speak Mandarin/English and in the end it was a whole lot of mess  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm in uni now... on top of the 80 hours of community service that we got to fulfill, we need to volunteer our services to non-profit organizations as our projects in certain courses<br><br>for example, some groups will set up a library or computer corner in homes, bring some old folks out, organize trips to the SPCA, conduct art classes, promote family bonding... all sorts of activities lah<br><br>even on top of these, there are certain CCAs that are devoted to volunteerism work as well, like the LEO club and BP-mentoring scheme... for the leo club they organize activities such as home visits, flag days and donation drives... and for the BP mentoring scheme student mentors go to a school every week to coach the students there and provide counselling services.. in other words, be a friend to those who need them<br><br>it's really interesting in a way.. and sometimes we all need a push in volunteering ourselves.. and i agree with wat mooku said.. it's an exposure  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>
