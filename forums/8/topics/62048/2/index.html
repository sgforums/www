[/b]</blockquote>yah that's true.. like we have the annual NKF show etc.. there are many more smaller organizations and they do not have the capital to organize such big charity events.. dat's y usually they work with schools to get students to go over for home visits or flag day.. some organizations don't even have such activities<br><br>i feel that in those shows where celebrities perform stuns in order to gain more donations.. no point lor.. and lucky draws?? it's very sad to think that s'poreans will only donate if it will benefit them...<br></div>
