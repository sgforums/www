            <div class='col-md body'>Another to share:<br><br><img src="http://members.aol.com/ttelracs/Tara4.jpg"><br><br>This is Scarlett's home in Tara<br><br>Gerald (Scarlett's father)<br><br>With the deep hunger of an Irishman who has been a tenant on the lands his people once had owned and hunted, Gerald O'Hara wanted to see his own acres stretching green before his eyes. His mind was made up that he was not going to spend all of days, like his brothers, in bargaining, or all his nights, by candlelight, over long columns of figures. Gerald wanted to be a planter. But having that ambition and bringing it to realization were two different matters, he discovered as time went by. Coastal Georgia was too firmly held by an entrenched aristocracy for him ever to hope to win the place he intended to have. Then the hand of Fate and a hand of poker combined to give him the plantation which he afterwards called Tara.<br><br>Ellen (Scarlett's mother)<br><br>She would have been a strikingly beautiful woman had there been any glow in her eyes, any responsive warmth in her smaile or any spontaneity in her voice that fell with gentle melody on the ears of her family and her servants. he spoke in the soft slurring voice of the coastal Georgian, liquid of vowels, kind of consonants and with the barest trace of French accent. It was a voice never raised in command to a servant or reproof to a child but a voice that was obeyed instantly at Tara, where her husband's blustering and roaring were quietly disregarded.<br><br>Scarlett<br><br>Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom realized it when caught by her charm as the Tarleton twins were. Her eyes were green without a touch of hazel, starred with briskly black lashes and slightly tilted at the ends. But for all the modesty of her spreading skirts, the demureness of hair netted smoothly into a chignon and the quietness if small white hands folded in her lap, her true self was poorly concealed. The green eyes in the carefully sweet face were turbulent, willful, lusty with life, distinctly at variance with her decorous demeanor. Her manners had been imposed upon her by her mother's gentle admonitions and the sterner discipline of her mammy; her eyes were her own.<br><br>Hope this is useful!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>When I first saw you, I saw love.
