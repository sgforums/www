No doubt that schools should always be situated in convenient locations, but take a look at SIM and PSB, i do not feel that their venues are centrally located either.<br><br>2) Poor scheduling: The fact is before you enrol for a course, there is explaination about the course schedules and frequency. If you still decide to sign up, whose fault is that anyway?<br><br>3) Cheapskates: MDIS does provide notes and highly recommend students to buy supplementary textbooks.

            <div class='col-md body'>We have to be very careful in signing up for courses in private schools.  It's best to do some research and ask around.  Talk to those who have taken similar courses before and see what they say about the school, the certificate or degree and etc.<br><br>I worked in a private school (shall not mention the name) before and I know some of the business owners can be very dishonest one.  I was tasked to market a certain degree course (degree is supposed to be awarded by an Aust uni).   Managed to get lotsa students to start the course.  Also got lecturers to teach.  Arranged for training for the lecturers.  Did the course scheduling... everything all by myself.  By then, I was very proud of what I did.<br><br>But but but.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>Because my mom was sick (had an op that time and could not walk for weeks) , I had to resign to take care of her full time for a few months.<br><br>After I tendered the resignation and when I was serving towards the end of my one month's notice, I was shocked to find out that the school that I worked for did not have an agreement with the Aust Uni to start this course.  All this while, my employer has been lying to me about this.<br><br>I left after serving one month's notice and I really dared not think what happened to the students.  I called up my poor colleagues who took over this mess.  He said that the students could not get their refund because it is not stated in the contract that they could get it.<br><br>Before this, the school did something similar.  It was an MBA course awarded by a famous uni in Aust.  This one, they did have an agreement to run this course.  But half way through the course (ie. students already paid in full and that was a few thousand dollars), the course was terminated by the uni because the school didn't pay the uni.  When I first joined this company, I was tasked to clear this mess.  I did this by transferring the students to another private school that offered similar subjects - this will ensure that the same uni will still award them the MBA cert that the students had paid for.  But still, life was not so easy.  I had angry students that called me up and threatened me, scolded me.  Of course I didn't blame them.<br><br>I'm glad that I left this company.  If I stay on, I might get hit by lightning  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>So you see.  It can be a nightmare if you are not careful.<br><br>Things to note/do when you sign up a course:<br>1) Find out about the university that is awarding the certificate, diploma or degree.  The ranking is not that important as ranking is very subjective (business magazines, organisations, schools - each has its own way of ranking the uni).  But it's impt that the uni is recognised in its own country.<br><br>2) Get info from those who have already taken this course.  Get their feedback.<br><br>3) Find out about the school.  (reputation and stuff)<br><br>4) Find out how long the school has been running this course.  It is more risky if you are among the first few intakes.</div>
