            <div class='col-md body'>Yo-hummers...<br><br>Just as often as I turn to the Straits Times for news, the national newspapers often reward me with chuckles and amusement ; at it's un-selfconscious writing, at the participant's logic-turning grasp of "quickie" PR terms and at the amazing lack of self-awareness at reportage.<br><br>Just as an example here's an extract,<br><br>"Need a smoke? Pay it back<br><br>BY GENEVIEVE JIANG and HONG XINYI<br>Feb 10, 2000<br><br>Said an NTUC Income spokesman: "We think it is only fair.<br><br>"If an employee wishes to spend office time to smoke, it is acceptable that he or she should clock in and out. They are not required to do so if they wish to smoke on their own time.<br><br>"Our intention is to discourage the habit by making it inconvenient for smokers, not to penalise them in any way."<br><br>But the company doesn't force it down anyone's throat. It is open about staff who don't stick to the rules.<br><br>"The logbook is simply a deterrent and reminder. We don't force anyone to clock in against their will," said the spokesman."<br><br>Hahahaha.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> "But the company does not force it down anyone's throats" Then what the heck is the logbook system compulsory then?<br><br>And that TNP just reports this without an objective commentary? i.e. Flaws in the argument. This is the lack of selfawareness I was talking abt.<br><br>Does anyone share similar taste in toilet reading? Hahaha.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>This guy walks into a bar with a duck on his head.<br>The bartender, who's seen just about everything says, "what can I get you?"<br><br>To which the duck replies "you can start by getting this guy off my ass."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah, a fellow ST mocker.<br><br>I have about half a dozen pet theories on the nature ST as an institution but I wonÂ’t bore you guys with them. First of all, ST is an Ideological State Apparatus in the Althusserian sense. Regardless of their mantra about straddling the boats of dissemination of government policies and a critical outlook, they often fail in the latter. The level of critique is tied to the fact that SPH is a government body. And unlike the dialectic present in say, the UK, between partisan papers like the Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, The Times and at the lower end, The Sun, The Mirror and The Daily Express, all jostling with concepts from a political bias, we lack the culture of confrontational coverage associated with the culture of critique. Bland bland blandÂ…worse still, very unself-conscious.<br><br>Secondly, there seems to be a generic ideological form of presentation ST adheres to. Whether its to simplify complex issues for Â‘harmonyÂ’ or obfuscating PAP politics with civic and judicial and legislating institutions, this generic presentation endeavours to create mass objectification Â– which of course makes us easy-to-control automatons. For generic presentation to be possible, there must of course be (sub)conscious de-intellectualisation. Which is why we get bimbos like Sumiko Tan writing articles about how she brushes her teeth and deals with wolf-whistles. All in all, it would be very very funny if the consequences werenÂ’t so detrimental to the intellectual health of the reading public.<br><br>As for TNP, itÂ’s a joke. I stopped reading it after sec 3.<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Bar,<br><br>I was browsing through the ST webpage today and came across some strange letters in the Forum section. A couple of S'pore US students reclaiming S'pore as 'home', 'missing CNY celebrations' and all. I wonder why ST published them. To reinforce the retainment of talent drive? Tell me what you think.<br><br>cheers</div>
