              <p>So there was this singtel prepaid card number that called my mum first, saying he was from singapore power and and he was checking on the gas pipes. He asked if my mum's address was still the same and other not important stuff. Then he called me, at this point I was not aware that he had already called my mum. So I picked up and he said he was from DHL and he needed to deliver goods for my father. He said my father's name. I wasn't surprised that DHL would need to do this as my father regularly orders goods for his job, so I cooperated with the person. The call went on for quite long as I was playing video games and wasn't paying attention, so the person had to repeat himself several times. But basically, the whole thign went like this. </p>
              <p>I picked up, he said he was from dhl and he is delivering goods for &lt;father's name&gt;. He says out my father's phone number and ask if that is my father or not, for "Security purposes". I said yes that is correct. Then, he said out my house phone number and ask if that is correct or not. The number was correct but I just said the phone number not working already(at this point i already suspicious but I was focused on the game). Then, he asks if anyone is at home. I said I'm at home. <strong>He then ask what time I will be home until because the delivery will be late. I said I'm not going out today. </strong>Then he said out my FULL address, EXCEPT the unit number. Then he said please repeat your unit number for "security purposes". I thought that even if this was a scam of some sort, he already know so much information about my family, what harm can unit number do? So I just gave, he said thank you, my colleague will call you when he is there. Few hours later I foudn out he called my mum also, so I called back just for fun. Turns out the phone was off and the number is prepaid.</p>
              <p>He also called my mum's office desk number. <strong>Even I don't know my mum's office number.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This thing really got me curious. He put in so much effort, he found out my address and phone numbers, but what can he do with this information? I don't see how knowing phone numbers and addresses can harm us. I'm not rich either so I doubt anyone would wanna rob/kidnap me.</p>
              <p> Anyone has any idea what this guy is planning or what he could do with the information he has?</p>
              <p>Any advice or just entertaining comments would be appreciated!</p>

              <p>I highly recommend you to a keep a lookout on your family's bank account (including you), just in case. Watch out for any weird, unknown transactions for the next few days (if there is any). Just to be safe than sorry. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>Could be a possible scam.....or a conman working to target potential victims. Are your parent's names and contact number available on yellow pages? Its been awhile since I opened up a Yellow Pages book, but I'm pretty sure there are some information available there, such as names and estate areas.</p>
              <p>It could also be a conman in action to know if an elderly person would be alone at home, and they would come over on the pretence of being a PUB staff to check some pipings in the unit etc, and then theft would take place..... this has happened to many elderly folks in older estates where the conmen plan this style of potential sieving of victims, and then they will strike.</p>
              <p>Better to be on the safe side report it and ask mata to patrol there more often.</p>

              <p>Make police report, and ensure that your house gate is locked at
              all times. If got ppl want to come in for delivery, check for
              dengue, or whatever, say that the owner of the house not at home.
              NEVER open the door to strangers, not even policemen.</p>

              <p>Well Police Officers generally have to obtain a warrant to enter a premise, UNLESS there are certain reasons that permits them to enter WITHOUT the need of a warrant, for example, the rank of a ASP, or ANY officer believes that there is a crime that requires to be investigated and hence requesting the premise owner to grant access to the officer.</p>
              <p>That point aside, speaking about Police Officers, since the start of this month, ALL Police officers are issued with new warrant cards.</p>

              <p>If you ask me, some project officer in the senior management wanted a new branding of the SPF, and that he/she must be a Anime fan.</p>
              <p>The new SPF logos OMG. CMI.</p>
