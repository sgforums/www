You cannot confront her because that fella has got powerful backings and you also do not want to make matter worse.<br><br>Most importantly, the people she spreads the rumour to believes her and starts to look at you from a different view. What would you do?<br><br>Also, the girl have got powerful backings in the sense of a lot of brother bengs and sister lians who have got mouths thats very destructive. What will you do to stop the person from further hurting you? And is it true that teenagers would rather believe rumour than the pure truth?<br><br>This happen to one of my friend and is it convenient for me to help her or should i just let her settle herself?</div>
