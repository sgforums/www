            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmm, this thought came to my mind a few days ago....strictly a topic to dicuss and not directed at any couples in this forum. By the way, they are encouraged to join in this discussion since it involved them intimately  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>ok, i know that outings between u forumites (at least the regular ones)are on a regular basis. What i would really like to know is...<br>a) is the outings for singles<br>b) for everybody in the forum to participate.<br>c) mixed kind of social outings<br><br>ok, bear with me for a moment, this might looks like it's leading to nowhere....<br>thing is, if u have a b/f or g/f, would u still go to this kind of outing???<br>What does ur respective b/f or g/f have to say abt this issue???<br>For the singles in the outing, does it disappoint u that the outings littered with attached ppl...., or worse, full of couples?!?!<br><br>(this Qn is directed at the singles)U know a gorgeous girl or delicious hunk who fequented these outings.However, they are attached.<br>Would u still consider them as potential targets and woo them in the meantime???<br><br>(this Qn is for the those's attached) If u know a hunk/babe frequent the outings, would ur heart and loyalties waver??? if so, will this makes u more inclined to attend those outings, regardless of ur respective b/f or g/f's opinion???<br><br>(this Qn is open to the public) If u know that ur other half does not take too kindly to the idea of u attending these kind of irc outings, would u still insist or defer???<br><br>A story to bear in mind:<br>My friend John used to have a perfect relationship with Jane. They have been together for close to 6 years, stretching from secondary school to his N.S....until she started ircing in her free time. Gradually, she began to get more and more involved in it. Soon, she went on outings organised by the chatroom. Thru the outing, she was exposed to the world of buayas and the intoxicating power of being single and desirable. Guys who go all their way out to humour and pamper her...nautrally, she lapped in all those attention. Poor John was unaware of all these, thinking that it's just a normal social outing. Needless to say, they broke up (her choice) within a few months after she began those outings.<br>Who do u blame??? The outings, Jane, John, irc, the net or the guys/buayas???<br>And that is someting to ponder about  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>P.S With the increase in the usage of internet among the youths of today, the scenario described above is fast becoming the norm than the exception.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mr Hata San<br><br>I won't speculate why some get defensive over this.  Similarly, I can't say anything for Tet&amp;bf because I don't know them that well.  Let's just speak about me, shall we? (hahahaha, such longwinded way to excuse me blabbering about my fave topic, i.e. me, again)<br><br>I have a boyfriend.  He hasn't been in the forums so he must have missed my exchanges with Terence.  Truthfully I am a little afraid that he might not like it but the rest of me think that he will know enough to realize that it won't change what we have with each other.  I've told him and I'll tell him again anytime he wants me to that the only man I want in the world is him.<br><br>I have gone with him to an outing.  According to Callan I looked a bit restrained then.  Well, yeah, i'll have to restrain myself cause he is around.  I can't touch Lex so much and I can't flirt like mad the way I usually do it.  However I do not think I am being dishonest because everyone assumes a certain behaviour when his/her g/b f is around.<br><br>And yeah, I've enjoyed the whatever attention i get from the other forumnites, it's fun but I know it can't compare with the real thing I have with him.  Have you ever heard of this saying, letting goof a bird in hand to chase the ones flying in the sky?  Firstly, he's already in my hand, secondly, I honestly think I can't find anyone more perfect for me than him.<br><br>Lastly, he too have his friends from Austnet.  I've met them and they're cool.  I'm very sure about his devotion, too =)<br><br>------------------<br>Sticks and stones may break my bones....<br>but whips and chains excite me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to maya,<br>thanks   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> i luv ur candid views on this issue.Not everybody is as clear headed as u.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Makes me wonder too. yes, why let go of a perfectly sound relationship for the thrills and excitement of another...<br>however, not everyones shared the same views or convictions as u. Again, i must mention this, why put oneself at temptation when one noe very well that one is not a person of ernomous willpower. Ahhh, u must have thought that i m a puritan, insisting on forum outings being a harmful thing for happy couples. That is never my view however,... each to his/her own.<br><br>For singles like me, of course i would love to come to this kind of social outings, esp. when i know that gorgeous babes are a fixture of these meetings. However,surely u will be disappointed to know that most of them are attached? Me, most likely trying my luck at the one i have eyes on, regardless of her status. Maybe i m the more suitable one for her, who's to say no? At least i m honest with my views.<br><br>i can imagine the flaming i m going to recieve from this thread. However, the truth must be told. I have no biasness against couples frequenting outing (with or without their partners)and as maya can testify, i have no malice or hidden agendas here.<br>U might find it an invasion of privacy by posting to this thread....all i m doing is asking for ur views and NOT wether it's morally wrong for couples to go on outings or singles to hanker after the attached. Pls, i beg of u guys, do not come in with ur defense mechanism up high.<br><br>have a nice day   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mr Hata-san (edited 05 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everyone is welcome to join in the outings. People just differ in what they hope to achieve.<br><br>As far as attached people are concerned, those that I have seen so far are frank enough to reveal that they are attached, and very happily so. Not that that helps in beating the suitors off, because they are all so delectable.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>They are also lucky to have understanding partners who "allow" them to do this. I say that because I can understand the risk of letting your bf/gf go to those outings without you. Lets not kid ourselves of the potential risks to the relationship that these outings can present. So, good for them to be able to strike a balance. We are all jealous of this.<br><br>I have heard, although not seen, some people who are attached hide the fact that they are spoken for, and actively flirt with other people. This does not only happen in outings such as ours, but in all types of social situations in life as well. I have no idea what their aims are, but I see this as being unfaithful. Seems to me that they are toying with other people's feelings.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>pacman:  no temptation yet, unless maybe if yummy terence jumped in, hehe.  anyone can be extremely appealing during courtship.  being desirable is something one can learn.  but how many will stay that way after the girl is won?  sad to say, i've only found one and i know that he is rare like that.<br><br>------------------<br>Sticks and stones may break my bones....<br>but whips and chains excite me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mayajade:<br>Awwww comeon, is it really that bad? Not even a tingle? Guys, work harder leh.<br><br>I agree that being desirable can be learnt. But some have it far easier than others. I'm not going to name names.<br><br>I'm assuming that you were also talking about people not putting in the effort in keeping the relationship exciting after they have become a couple. Well, good point. I guess thats why some people who are attached hide the fact that they are so, and seek excitement elsewhere.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Tet,<br>hmmm,i can see ur point. It is a good place, outing, to know more friends. Point is, is everybodys' motive the same as urs??? I guess to u, being attached is not that final rite. Pardon my english,why i m trying to say is that to u, being attached means that u can still accept wooing and that it's o'rite for attached ppl to woo others?<br>well, it's fine by me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>kinna pragmatic...but cruel<br><br>To Pacman;<br>i noe what u mean.These sorts of outing can be such temptation. Guys going out of their mind at the sight of babes, girls wavering at their knees at the sight of a hunk or a buaya with a witty and "tian" mouth  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">Well, tis good they babes like Maya and Tet can strike a balance...point is, can u accept their behaviour and thinking if u r their boyfriends.<br>Ok, time to be harsh here, pac. It's so easy to tell me u r a SNAG and that u don't mind all this new age fem. behaviour...well, as a male, i can tell u that it can be quite trying on us. Imagine ur girl being surronded by crocodiles....worse, u girl loves to swim in these exotic crocodile-infested lake. Me?!?1 i find it hard to swallow, to say the truth...<br><br>To Maya:<br>true true...the thrills always in the chasing...when u got the trophy...most likely u dump it at the altar and let it collect dust while u went in search of another competition with bigger silverware  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To tet:<br>wowww, i sense some hostility in ur reply. I m sorry if my replies caused u discomfort or otherwise. My thread is in no way another slight on ur character and morals...<br>yes, i should not be getting personal in this thread. Supporting something might not necessary means that u urself practises it. For example, i do not condemn homosexuality does not mean that i PRACTISE it. ok, tet might condone attached personnel wooing and being wooed, HOWEVER, she will not indulge in such behaviour. Is this what u are trying to get, tet?

Its the best way to make girls ignore you at this day and age.<br><br>I think I'm a possessive person by nature. What I was trying to say was that I can understand how difficult it is. Thats it.<br><br>I just hope I can give my future gf the freedom that she deserves. But I suspect I'll tag along to every event that she goes to try to hamtam anyone coming near her even if they are just asking for the time. But, I'll try not to do that, I promise. But I AM NO SNAG!<br><br>Since you are honest, I'll reciprocate. I'll agree that its hard for us guys too, with girls being so friendly. Its hard for some guys to react, especially when you are relatively inexperienced. You never know when they are being friendly or really interested. You learn after a few times you are burnt, but the learning process is a painful one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mr. Hata-San and Pacman<br><br>Never realized how strongly guys may feel about their girls being "so friendly".  This may sound like a feminist talking, but is it because<br>1: they want the girls to keep their friendliness just for the bfs<br>2: they know what other guys are like when faced with such friendliness and they want to protect the girls<br>3: both of them<br><br>please be careful when considering your answer.  To you the first two may appear the same but from my point of view they are quite unrelated.<br><br>Then, if you feel that way and you know how girls feel about this, too, i.e. we know where we stand and this is just for fun, do you feel a compulsion to stop her from going out so much by herself?  hat do you do to check this urge?<br><br>------------------<br>Sticks and stones may break my bones....<br>but whips and chains excite me.</div>
