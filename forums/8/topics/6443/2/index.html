No lah, I have large pockets which I carry my metal baseball bat anywhere I go. Still, I think SNAGs are passe. But perhaps my ideas of SNAGs are different from yours. I guess we each have our stereotypes.<br><br>Mayajade:<br><br>I'm speaking for myself of course, but I don't think I'm that selfless as to consider any of the issues 1, 2 or 3. Its purely SELFISH. I feel strongly only because I have placed myself in a position stemming from wrong judgements and wrong assessments. I have come to realize that thats how some people relate to other people (i.e. being friendly,) and to intepret it as anything other than courtesy.... well, lets not go into that.<br><br>As to your question on how I would curb myself from putting pressure on a girl.... I have no idea. Never been tested under such circumstances before.<br><br>Mind not working again.

            <div class='col-md body'>To Maya:<br>the answer to ur questions would be... the last option. For me, i rather prefer to have all the friendliness of my girl to myself. Well, it would be a different thing ifd she's gregarious by nature. However, i believe that being friendly with her friends is one thing, being OVER friendly is another. As to what constitute over friendliness...sigh, thats' a bit hard to say.No guys would like to see their girlfriends chatting and joking so happily with another guy, the green eye monster just poop out naturally, regardless of how well u caged it up.<br>Perhaps i might be a wee bit paranoia, thinking that there are lots of crocodiles infesting all those outings. Well, i can't help but think this way when i saw all those declarations of crushes and flirting going around here in this forum. True, it might be just all a virtual kind of thing, and that in reality, NO way r u going to habour any thoughts abt him/her...but then again, it's a very thin line between whats virtual and whats not...moreover regarding the affairs of the heart.<br><br>For me, i will not stop my girl from frequenting these sort of outings. If she can be swayed so easily by all these things, well, there will be other opportunities for her to leave me too (eg. school or workplace), no matter how hard i try to "protect" or "shield" her. Humans are not birds to be caged up and admired. they have their own free wills and trust me, nothing can hold them back when they decides to soar!<br>i hope i answer ur qns to ur satisfaction Maya, thats how i viewed such things...and maybe if i can be so impundent, i guess ur bf follow the same thread of thoughts too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To Audlenelee:<br>hey welcome to the forum newbies  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> A lot of ppl lacked self esteem too! thats why u see so many green eyed monsters running wild out on the streets  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">Well, perhaps u will have less prob. by toking over this issue with ur bf...for example, does he tok the same way to other girls in the irc as he does u? I believe he need his friends (males or females)too, so dont worry too much over this issue. Like our dear Pac says, u can always insist on tagging along to those outings <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> LOL<br><br>To Pac:<br>hahaha, so i m wrong in my guesses...yeah, i noe what u mean, if my mental bat was to materialise everytime i feel like using it, my murder tally will hit 1000 easily  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">Hmmm, so tell me, since u said we have diff. definitions of SNAG, how do U define one?<br>Mine is<br>SNAG = sensitive (whatever the hell that means?!?!)<br>Funny<br>Witty<br>Generous (as in giving out money and giving in when arguing)<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My stereotype of a SNAG: a weak person. I am having difficulty elaborating on the "weak," sorry. But I'll have to say it does not include effeminate guys, soft spoken guys, quiet guys, shy guys, bespecticled guys. Well, you get the idea. Looks like I'm getting further away in trying to make a point.<br><br>I do realize that its my own stereotype, and maybe I shouldn't have used SNAG in this case, but let me formulate my thoughts properly and perhaps I might come up with something worth arguing about.<br><br>Or perhaps people cannot be stereotyped anyway, because they tend to react differently in different circumstances. E.g. behave (as opposed to act) in a sensitive manner around a gf, and being an ah beng around others.<br><br>I would also like to add that, as far as the thin line governing the virtual and real world, some people handle it so well that I am jeolous. I think the problems arise when one party can handle it and the other party misunderstands.<br><br>Meanwhile, I'm not sure if you read the recent thread on SNAGs. I gave up after the first 10 because it became too technical.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 09 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yo pacman:<br>Oh, that was me.<br><br>I just realized something. We have been whinging about how much problems we have with regards to the girls. But, I think we need to take time to realize that its not easy for the ladies as well.<br><br>I've seen and heard girls getting distressed about something as normal as being friendly bringing about unwanted advances. As someone once said in a post, it ain't pleasant rejecting people.<br><br>Its quite sad to me to hear that some actually have to tone down their vibrant and charismatic behaviour for the fear of leading on the wrong people.

I noe by what u mean weak...let me give u an example that i have been thru. Once, a female friend of mine called me up at around 12 plus (on a working day somemore), say she very depresss and wants to go East Coast. I was at West Coast...took a bus back home(northen area), took my car, drive to her place, took her to E.C., hear her whine till morning, drove her back, go to work looking like i been thru hell and back. My male friends say i weak, silly, crazy..take ur pick. Weak...perhaps, looks like being a SNAG means being being submissible to women  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>hmmm, i noe it's quite hard on the females too..being friendly and not giving the guys ideas at the same time.<br>Any females wish to comment on that???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.  What you and pacman answered make sense but I see that you realize that maybe the girl does know which is real and which is play and that maybe the problem happens when you the other party misunderstands the situation.<br><br>Like Mr. Hata said, if she's not strong enough to hold on to you, it doesn't matter whether you lose her in internet outings or  in anything else, you still lose her anyway.  If you can accept that, the next thing to tackle is the misunderstanding.<br><br>I know the other party isn't you and there's no way you know all her feelings and thoughts and how she really is.  But you can learn to trust if she has earned it by sticking with you through thick or thin.  Sometimes the barrier between real and virtual is thin but when one has something real before her, it gets quite easy to tell that the rest are fakes.<br><br>As for SNAG, I don't think men will ever understand.  What we mean by SNAG is someone whose actions prompt other girls to say how sweet!  They say it out of admiration really and when a guy is sweet to you he makes you happy.  SNAG doesn't have to adhere to rules, there are no rules governing SNAGDOM.  I wonder who coin the term anyway, it's so restrictive.  I don't go around labelling people as SNAG's and brutes.<br><br>Conclusion:  the SNAG the girls want are those who show them that they care in ways that make the girls pleased (!not by pulling their pony tails!).  If you love someone and you can express it in many actions and words and the person feel loved, then you are that sweet person, the ones they insist on calling a SNAG<br><br>------------------<br>Chase me, I'll catch you.</div>

I would love to be your SNAG...<br><br>Hata-san:<br><br>See, another flirty love declaration....but does it meant that I want Maya to be my gf so much that I would killhr bf just to have her? (Excuse me maya, for using such a bad example) Well, I suppose you would not get jealous, if Maya is your gf in this case, more like, "hahaha, another one". I personally, flirt alot if you do not already know, and I know the limits(and I hope I am right). But personally, I would trust my gf on that matter, if it is just such honey coated words that can win her heart, then I am sorry, next please. Like you said, if she wants to have a change of heart, it could be anywhere, the outings are just another channel or chance for it to happen, and it does not add value to the many there are around. So why should I worry? she is having her flirty fun, and I am having mine, but deep down inside we both would know that we are still so much in love with one another, and that is the basis a r/s should base on. As for the green eye monster, I suppose it should rear it's ugly head when the time is right, not anytime she laughs at another man's joke. If it is so, I might as well, cut her ears off, and communicate in sign language, the chances of guys who are able to tell a joke with sign language is a lot lesser. *laffs* (no offense to the hearing impaired.) I am a possesive man, and Iadmit to that, but in another way, I want her to share those flirtings with me, and laugh it out loud together with her, not keep it to herself and be scared that I will know. If she tells me of such events it only oes to show how well, she understand me, and knows that I would not mind. That is my type of possessiveness. A want to share her life wiht mine, just like I share it with her. Not many people want it this way I guess, but I am one of those few.<br><br>and no, I do not want to go into defining a SNAG...for it is too tedious a task for a imbecile like me. But I do like to point out that to understand a woman needs and wants is a very important thing. Woman and man are different in thoughts fundamentally, so thus the need. And woman need to understand man too. but I truly am beginning to like you, hata-san, for what you did for your friend is truly admirable, and what I would do, and have done many a times. By doing that, you have already show that you know what a woman needs, a listening ear, but you jst do not know that you know yet.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U see Maya, every evolutionist say we have to adopt a certain kind of behavoir to so called be the "survival of the fittest"...since being frenly earned affection or attachment...it is so called a reinforcement to be frenly so as to yield postive response..but now...it does not seems so..cos there might turned out to be misunderstandings and as such....so I was wondering if being frenly is now an adaption for survival or to actually  stray away from Mankind if there are so many complications...<br><br>------------------<br>When you can feel light in your life, you have found Hope.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa, yeah, agree on that.  It's my default mode for interaction with men.  It's fun and at the same time launch us straight to a stage well after the awkwards hi's and how are you's.<br><br>about misunderstanding, i think since men are expected by many to make the first move, they have the right to make guesses whether women who are friendly fancy them personally or not.  Every woman has a different degree of friendliness so it is really hard to tell.  I know it feels bad to reject men, but it's part of parcels of life, just like they know when they pop the question that they may be rejected.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maya<br>I think you mean those man esp in clubs and on streets...yes...they can be such a hassle actually cos I never always knew out to reject outright.But since I have been trained to be a good sales personnel, my frenliness seems to be put into default mode to frenly becos I dun think it is wrong to approach someone they dun even knoe...as long they are not out to harm them in anyway...<br><br>But some of them can be really intimidating and giving excuses never seems to put them off..these are the men that I will shun...but till date, I have met a few good ones who actually are my good frens though they never succeeded in making me fall for them...<br><br>I believe U too have met some of those and the end of the day..as long u made yourself clear ur stand especially you have a bf..the rest is really up to them... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>When you can feel light in your life, you have found Hope.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Tet:<br>"Trained by girlfriends"?!?! haha,u make it sound like those guys are lions and u girls are the beast-tamer who's trying to teach them how to sip tea from a tea-cup  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>s for SNAG-like behaviour...yeah, i guess everybody got diff. perception as to what they expected from guys.<br>ok, this is a side issue...so did u train ur bf to be a SNAG?!?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To Callan:<br>A listening ear???, perhaps i have, things is, friends have remarked to me that.."she's not even ur girlfriend, why go thru all those troubles. Only got trouble then come look for u" Can u see the dilemma?<br>mmmm, not alot of ppl would think the same way as u. True, having the green-eye monster rearing his head does tend to be a very tiring thing that serves no purpose,but ahhh, it's an emotion that we men are really not quite capable of mastering. Man are by right fiercely territorial and they usually considered their girlfriends as their "property" and when they discover that their "goods" are being stalked, hehe, thats when u see all their primitive nature coming to the fore...namely possesiveness.<br>Lastly, i m quite an easy going kind of guy, so i usually find it hard to reject a girl's invitation or request.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To Rinoa:<br>I beieve in moderation in everything, but when it comes to socialising with the oppo. sex, where's the benchmark? Everybody have diff. ideas of when a person is being friendly or aloof.<br>It's rather interesting that u linked friendliness to survival of the fittest. I can see ur point...but if females really want to "survive", they would do much better horning their flirting skills right? That way, the results are surer and faster.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To Maya:<br>sigh...so sad hor. U dont want to be seen as unfriendly but at the same time u don't want to give out wrong "signal" to the other parties...so catch 22. But at least now i know when a girl smile and tok to me in pubs or discos, it does not mean that she wants to bed me as soon as possible.
