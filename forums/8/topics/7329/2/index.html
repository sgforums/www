            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha!!!<br><br>Oh pls... Zouk is passe no matter what they do to the interior and how much advertising they do. Zoukettes are people of one kind too. Ask anyone who frequents nightspots and they'll tell u what. Who was the one who mentioned that Zouk is no longer dat happening since 1996? Yup, u've juz got that right.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>F&amp;U : Hahaha!!! Me also duno what time they play what song! FYI, MW n SOS play the same song. Kaoz... were u the one who said MW not nice n then SOS gd? Although SOS is another brainchild of Peter Wong and it was given much more publicity, it never take off the way MW did or rather does. Sure, it started off with a big bang... but in the end, it received so many poor reviews. Those who went b4 knows that SOS is not really dat great. Dos who still hang out there, it's either that ur previous haunt really sux or dat SOS is ur virgin venture into clubbing. Start exploring for other alernatives, will ya?<br><br>If u r still not convinced...<br><br>1) Ppl from all walks of life hang out there.<br><br>Sure, they do. But did u notice how dead the ppl there r. I've seen some people who looked like they ought to be at home n sleeping at dos hour. Few seems to be interested in dancing, some juz shake shake turn here turn there for the sake of it. Some juz make u want to squat down n laff. It's juz so dead n sian.... *sigh*<br><br>2) Excuse me, where's the dance floor?<br><br>It's all over the place and no one uses it. For first timer, betta be careful when u go there. U may drop into it any time. It's obstructing the way. At one side, u have to climb into the dance floor to get to the other side.<br><br>3) Seats.<br><br>As usual... all over the place. Get ready for this... in the dance floor too. Ya, u may luff. Go ahead. It's so ridiculous, izzit it? It's oladi so isolated at the dance floor, they should do something to it. N placing some seats n tables to conceal the emptiness is the last thing they should do.<br><br>4) Washroom<br><br>I duno abt the gents, neither did i try to ask my guy friends. Coz i want to avoid mentioning abt the ladies. Some of the girls there are really a disgrace. U should have seen how the toilet papers n paper towels are strewn all over the basins. There are two sides of basins, 3-5 on a side i tink, can't really remember; it's connected with a ledge. There's all these rubbish on all available space u can c, wet or dry. N all those dry pieces really piles up to such a height u know! Where's the cleaners? Dun they have any? Clubs' toilets are usually not dat pleasant with all the vomits n drunks wetting the bowls n floors but can they try to clean up the papers which those brats use for wiping their hands??!! N i tot MW ladies are the worst i've seen!<br><br>5) Queues<br><br>Sick of all those waiting. If u c a long q, u'll make it fast. Make sense, doesn't it? Duno what's wrg wif SOS, the q doesn't even seems to move. For the few times i went, we have to get in thru the members' door, if not, i duno how long we'll be stuck there. Shit.<br><br>6) Bars<br><br>Y make it so big n accessible when the barmen are so scarce?<br><br>7)Waiting staffs are nowhere to be seen too.<br><br>They are nowhere in sight and so inefficent. I'm not saying they r loafing or wat but y can't they hire more staff to cope with the crowd? They took so long to send your drinks.. and it seemed like forever b4 they serve u if u happened to open bottle. Still remember the fuck up service they gave us once. We placed our order at the members' room coz we knew how difficult it'll be to catch hold of waiting staffs. They have the nervess and guts to give us the bottles n ice buckets at the doorstep! Si bei hot ah! I'm not dos kind of difficult customer! People all work to earn for a living! But i juz wun condone this type of fuck up service! Wanted to flare up liao but frds tried to cool me down. We made our way to the disco section. Fuck. No seats. No staff offered to find us a seat evn though our hands were full. Managed to find someone who so kindly shared wif us. CB!!! We still have to go get our own glasses!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Cigars<br><br>They boost abt having cigars. Dun be fooled, it's not in-house; forget abt asking the waiters to get it, u have to go and buy it urself. It's juz a shop next to it. I duno whether SOS has any stake in it, but it's definitely not exclusive. N who wants to enjoy a cigar beside a pool table, in the centre of the room, with all the players smoking ciggies like chimmeys and with the drowning dance music coming from next door? The management dun make sense lah... u want to attract that kind of ppl, u'll have to create the kind of ambience n atmosphere for them lah.<br><br>That's all for the time being... the rest if i remember then say lah.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Also, the shared membership btw MW n SOS and the provided transport btw these 2 places juz can't help but make one tink that the management is trying to pull the crowd, which is way too big for it to accommodate, (although it's spore's biggest pub. hahaha!!!) from MW to the big-but-empty-and-going-downhill-SOS. U may argue that it it's under same management and that it's juz a distance away. Sure, y not. Maybe Nova Entertainment should do dat for it's Fire n Sparks outlets to boost their businness too.  :p<br><br>N Venom is doomed... but kudos to them for still being able to uphold their image in front of the gullibles n sua gus. With the launch of The Red Room, limited membership of 500, stoopid criteria 4 approval and the slow website, it's time they retire.<br><br>------------------<br>ming4 zhong1 ruo4 you3 zhong1 xu1 you3<br>ming4 zhong1 ruo4 wu2 mo4 qiang2 qiu2</div>
