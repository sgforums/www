Its as if we have become obligated to help people all the time when we are asked to do so.. you know we'ver become automatic liao. Maybe its all those charity shows.<br>'Was told that in China, even if you fall down and car run you down, no one will help you. So i think to these foreign chinese and indians when they come here and see the soft hearted people. They saw an opportunity to take advanatge and use scatter shot method and ask as many people for $ as possible. They can get quite a lot of $ if they keep at it and move places. Anyways, they have nothing to lose and there is no point to force people to give money since they can approach the next person to get the next $.
