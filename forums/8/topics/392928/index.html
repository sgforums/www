              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This story is about a guy called Lenny who's in his early twenties, currently studying in a local uni. He's a skinny n small sized boy, with a baby face, always polite n smiling. With his simple n decent appearance, he looks a like a nice guy who could get along well with anybody.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">His steady girlfriend of 1 year plus, fiona, was a pretty chiobu which any other sinky boy who die for. She was tall, slim, tanned n had a beautiful face, the perfect making for a super model. She came from a well to do family n was pampered in every way. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">How Lenny n Fiona got together was a surprise, they had met in school, on the first day during orientation. Lenny was teased by the orientation group leaders for being a 'wimp' n 'scaredy cat', n Fiona came to his rescue n defended him. Every since, they had been together everyday, during lectures n classes. He was the envy of other guys in school, as everybody thought how could a nerd be compatible with a hot sexy babe?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In January this year, she was invited by her cousin Cindy, who's in Australia, to attend her wedding n make preparations. She was to spend a week in Brisbane. Lenny was not going, he was to remain in Lioncity so he can help to take down notes during lectures. Fiona would be going with her mum.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Before she left, she had visited a famous seamstress to tailor made a cheongsam, which she wanted to wear during the wedding. Unfortunately, the seamstress was striken with dengue fever which made her stay in bed for a few days. By the time she had completed the cheongsam, a week had already passed, n Fiona was already flew off to Australia a day ago.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">So she asked her sweetheart to ship the cheongsam over by international courier. Lenny visited the seamstress to collect the dress n hurriedly went to DHL to ship it off by the fastest overnight freight. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">On the second day, Fiona n her cousin n friends went to the beach to surf on the waves. Unfortunately, in a freak accident, Fiona was swept away by a huge wave. Being an inexperienced surfer n swimmer, she had difficulty swimming in the choppy waters. By the time lifeguards rescued her, she had been in the water for too long, n drowned.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">On hearing this, her mum n relatives was grieve strickened. Her dad flew over to Melbourne immediately. The next day, the courier with cheongsam packaged had arrive at Fiona's cousin house, but her mum was extremely upset, n did not sign for the package n told the courier man to 'RETURN TO SENDER'</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Meanwhile, Lenny had not known of this, as Fiona's parents had not made intentions to inform him about this yet, perhaps only until after they returned back to Singapore to settle the funeral arrangments. That night, he had messaged n called her, but there was no answer. He thought she might be busy spending time with her cousins, but in actual fact Fiona was already dead.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The next day, when he got home from school, he saw the cheongsam package which was returned back to him. He wondered how come Fiona rejected it? Once again, he called her up, but her handphone was off. Many calls were made, but none got through. So that night, he called up her home, wanting to ask Fiona's dad for the phone number of her australian cousin. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Her maid answered n said Fiona had drowned in Australia. He could not believe his ears, n so he asked for her dad's number, n after he made the call, the cruel truth sunk it. He cried hard that night in his bedroom n fell asleep. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">At 2:18am, he awoke after having a dream about Fiona. In his dream, he saw Fiona waving to him from a huge mansion on a hill top, she was wet n naked, n she was asking for her cheongsam. Then she said she wanted to put on that cheongsam but had to leave for a faraway place, n asked Lenny to wear it on her behalf. She said she would like to see Lenny in a cheongsam as it would be kinky, n besides, Lenny was a skinny guy who could easily fit into her clothes.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Confused by the dream, n still upset with grieve, Lenny decided to wear the sexy high slit cheongsam. He prepared his body by putting on a silicon padded pushup bra n padded panties, from his 'crossdressing hobby stash' </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It was a tight fit on his skinny body. Now he was in a woman's dress, with the right curves n bulges thanks to the artificial enhancements. Then he put on a wig n some makeup, n finally a pair of red high heel shoes. The red cheongsam went well with his shoes.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">He ran out of the house, n heard voices coming from the jungle. (Lenny lived near bukit timah, near the nature reserve). He bashed into the jungle, believing it was Fiona calling out to him, although it was all in his head, just his hallucinations.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It was pitched dark, he lost his footing, n rolled down the slope. The steep slope lead to a quarry lake, n so Lenny plunged into the cold n dark water. He was disorientated n giddy from the fall, n he trashed about in the water. Although he could swim n tread water, the darkness n after effects from the fall made him panic. Plus with the tight cheongsam he had on, he could not kick his legs. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">He trashed about n screamed for help, but no one could hear him. He tried to swim towards shore, but felt something pulling his body down. Believing it was Fiona, he dived into the water. There, he saw Fiona, n he had embraced her in a long kiss n hug....until he was out of breath n breathed his last.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">After 2 days, the police had found Lenny's body in the Jungle's quarry lake, it was said to be trapped in a mass of thick water weeds, and they could not explain why it was in such a manner. His body was seem to be hugging on to the thick clump of water weeds.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Till this day, residents around that area reported seeing a hazy image of a woman in a cheongsam crying out for 'Fionaaa...... where are you???.....' during 3 am, in the jungle behind their backyards.</span></p>

              <p>Leonard was an otaku boy of 17 years old, studying in a local poly. Since his teenage years, he was obsessed with Japanese anime, manga, Japanese TV shows, movies, n music. Basically everything japanese. Plus he could speak n write a little Japanese, a third language skill which he picked up a year ago after his O level exams.</p>
              <p>Recently, he had been surfing Ebay, looking to buy a Japanese schoolgirl uniform outfit, as he wanted to dress up like a kawaii Japanese schoolgirl. He had always longed to do that, n now that he finally gotten his own Debit card, he could go online shopping. Now he is going to fulfill his deepest desire.</p>
              <p>After surfing through all the Ebay listings, all he came across was cosplay style Japanese schoolgirl uniform, Made in China, non authentic ones. He wanted an authentic piece from Japan, but there was none for sale.</p>
              <p>He thought if he really wanted to get the real stuff, he would have to get it from Japan. In the big cities, there are fetish shops selling used schoolgirl uniform, panties, and all kinds of miscellaneous things you can think up of. (Burusera Shops) Many weird fetishes in Japan you know? Schoolgirls n girls would sell their treasures in return for money, n these items would be worth lots in the black market of fetish goods. Its a profitable trade.</p>
              <p>Poor Lenny, he could hardly afford an air ticket to Japan. His parents worked hard all day long in a noodle stall, they earn just enough to pay for expenses n school fees for him n his sibling.</p>
              <p>The next morning, after logging on to Ebay, he found an authentic Japanese schoolgirl uniform for sale! It was from a seller, with zero feedback rating, who only had that item to offer. It was a high school uniform set, there was a white shirt, skirt, blazer, high socks, leather loafter shoes n satchel bag. It was a worn set of uniform from a real japanese girl, this item hailed from the Land of the Rising Sun. He can't believe his luck.</p>
              <p>Over the course of 3 days, he monitored the auction, n at the end of it, he emerged the top bidder at US$347.</p>
              <p>He paid for it with his debit card linked to his bank savings, just barely enough.</p>
              <p>5 days later, the package came from Japan. He went to his bedroom n excited opened it up. He quickly put it on, the entire outfit, including the blazer, high socks, loafer shoes, even a pair of white panties!. The uniform still had the scent of a Japanese girl, as it was probably unwashed.</p>
              <p>The uniform fitted him nicely as Lenny was a petite small sized boy. After completing the Japanese Schoolgirl look with his cute bob hair wig, he admired himself in the mirror.</p>
              <p>He look kinda like a Japanese Schoolgirl, so kawaii, he fell in love with himself in the mirror. He practiced speaking a few japanese phrases in a false girl voice, with their signature high pitched giggles. He also set up a tripod camera in his living room (his parents were at work, n brother in NS), to video himself acting like a kawaii schoolgirl. Plus camwhore with V handsign.</p>
              <p>Exhausted with all that, he lay down on the sofa, n heard a faint phone ringing. It was not his ringtone, it came from his bedroom. It was from the schoolbag, which he have not yet opened up to see what was inside.</p>
              <p>He unzipped it, there was a notebook, class notes, textbooks, stationery case, other stuffs, n even a purse containing Japanese Yen!. It looked so real, he wondered if this bag was stolen from someone?</p>
              <p>He picked up the mobile phone, it was a female voice who spoke something in Japanese, in a creepy manner. He couldn't make out what it was. The line was cut off, n when he checked the phone, he realized it was off, n he couldn't get it to power up as the battery was dead.</p>
              <p>Strange, but he didn't bother. Now he was hungry, he wanted to make some sushi to eat. So he went to the kitchen, n set up his video camera, as he demonstrated how to make a sushi. His own cooking show, with him in the cute japanese schoolgirl outfit. He spoke some broken Japanese n Japanese accented Engrish, n he acted like a total cute girl, giggling here n there n with all the kawaii pose. He intended to upload the video to youtube later, entitled 'HOW TO MAKE SUSHI, JAPANESE SCHOOLGIRL STYLE' but first he had to eat first.</p>
              <p>He went back to explore the schoolbag, n found a DVD-R. So he inserted into the DVD player, n it was all static. Suddenly, long black hair like jack-the-beanstalk vines started to shoot out of his 50 inch SONY plasma TV, n was coming straight for him..</p>
              <p>He said 'OH SH1T...MAA NANTE KOTO NANDA!!!' (oh my god in japanese). Then fell backwards, n the long hair started to wrap n strangled every part of his body.</p>
              <p>The thick rope like hair was slowy tightening n cutting off his breath, much like an anaconda coiling around a helpless animal. He screamed n begged for whatever entity to stop hurting him. A female voice spoke to him n it said something like 'RETURN ME MY STUFFS!!', based on his understanding of basic japanese language.</p>
              <p>Lenny remembered he still had his LPT amulet on his neck, n so he chanted the katha n slowly he felt the grip loosen n all the hair disappeared, n the TV was back to normal. He was so frightened, he rushed out of the house, still in the uniform, n hailed a cab to the Thai temple in BK Merah to look for his Luang Phor.</p>
              <p>He confided in him, n the monk said the uniform n stuffs probably belonged to a dead japanese girl who had died in a violent death, n someone had sold her belongings against her will. Her spirit probably stayed inside her schoolbag, n became active when it was opened by him.</p>
              <p>Luang Phor adviced him to burn all the uniform, schoolbag, etc, n offer some joss sticks n japanese food, while asking for forgiveness n for the spirit of the dead girl to depart this earthly world. Lenny had to do this on his own, as only he could speak Japanese, n since he was the one who invoked the spirit, he should be the one to ask her to leave.</p>
              <p>The monk gave him an powerful Buddha amulet to protect him against the spirit. Back home, he removed the uniform, n dumped them back into the parcel box together with the schoolbags n other belongings.</p>
              <p>Then he went down to the joss paper bin, n burnt everything together with some petrol. He kneeled down, n lit 3 joss sticks, onto his own sushi as food offering, n spoke in japanese, to beg for forgiveness n to ask the spirit to leave this world to be in the Heavens.</p>
              <p>After that, he saw an image of a school girl rising from the ashes, n she was waving to him as she rose up to the skies...</p>
              <p>He went back, glad it was all over. Suddenly....he felt an extreme itch in his crotch... he realized that he had forgotten to remove the schoolgirl's panties!! OMG!</p>
              <p>THE END!</p>

              <p>Leonardo was bored one night. Currently, he had graduated from poly, n awaiting to enter NS in 3 months time. Too lazy to go look for a part time job, he spent his days sitting in front of the computer playing games n surfing the net for some mindless entertainment.</p>
              <p>He was feeling depressed for quite some time, as he was worried about NS. The MO had given him pes B, this was certainly bad news for him. He was a timid, frail n small sized boy, n the thought of NS n being cooped up in camp, with tough training n regimentation life, having to made him worried n depressed. The thought of the physically demanding runs, having to enter the jungle full of creepy crawlies, getting scolding from the Sergeants n officers, changing n showering with other guys, troubled him a lot.</p>
              <p>If only he could avoid NS n have a downgrade. Whenever Leo was depressed, he would turn to his naughty habit of crossdressing. He particularly like wearing female outfits n dressing up as a pretty girl, with makeup on his babyface. So tonight, currently 1:18 am, he took out his favourite female outfit, a tight pink baby teeshirt, a pair of tiny white shorts, padded bra, hello kitty panties, n a pair of sandals studded with crystals.</p>
              <p>He excited put them on, n finally wearing a long hair wig n dusting some light makeup on his face, he was all set n looked very feminine. His small body frame n cute face made him a perfect young teenaged 'girl'. Most people could not tell that he was a guy when he crossdressed.</p>
              <p>So he quietly left his house (his parents were asleep, brother in camp coz of NS), n at this late hour, there was hardly anybody around his neighbourhood blocks. He hailed a cab to changi village, n alighted at the hawker centre, n went to order his favourite lasi lemak for supper.</p>
              <p>Leo met other 'sisters' there, but they did not know him, n they did not know he was also like one of them. He thanked his naturally cute looks which made him look feminine, unlike the other tall n huge transvetites with masculine facial features n horrible makeup.</p>
              <p>After his meal, he took a walk by the quiet beach, while pondering about the purpose in life. Suddenly, he saw something fly over his head, it looked like a batman? He got scared, n before he could run off in the opposite direction, a hand with long sharp fingernails held his shoulders, n the other grabbed hold of his chest. He panicked n scream loudly 'HELP!! FUG OFF DUN TOUCH MEEE!', n suddenly that thing let go n he saw it flew off into the jungle.</p>
              <p>It looked like a pontianak! It probably thought he was a virgin girl, but after hearing his scream, it realized it had made a mistake n flew off.</p>
              <p>Thank god Lenny was alright. He quickly got a cab home, n swear never to go to Changi Village in his crossdressed self.</p>

              <p>Late one night at 11:45pm, Leo was hungry, because he had an early dinner earlier on. He went to his kitchen but there was nothing good to eat, except instant noodles, some old bread, n leftover food n cold rice in the fridge.</p>
              <p>Since he was lazy to cook, n was craving some roti prata, he decided to get out of the house. There was a 24 hour famous roti prata shop nearby, along Upper Thomson Road. It was a 10 minutes walk there from his terrace house. As usual, he was wearing a skimpy FBT shorts n singlet, his usual home wear.</p>
              <p>There was quite a number of people at the prata shop, got many chiobus also, with their ah beng boyfriend, with their zhnged Lancer n Honda Civic cars parked by the roadside. Some of the Ah Bengs n their Ah lians stared at Leo, because he was dressed so skimpy, n probably thinking what an ah gua he was, or probably jealous of his nice, slim, n smooth legs in his short FBT shorts. Leo retaliated by staring at the Ah Lian's half ball longkangs lor.</p>
              <p>Leo ordered 2 kosong pratas n 1 Vadai, takeaway. He walked back home, n he had to pass by a dark pavement with thick trees by the side, as he lived near the Peirce Reservoir.</p>
              <p>He heard scurrying noises behind him, n when he turned around, he saw nothing, followed by a rustling noise of the leaves. Maybe it was a monkey, he thought to himself, as the reservoirs was always full of monkeys.</p>
              <p>Then he heard the scurrying n a tiny growling voice said "saya mau makan sikit!!” (I WANT TO EAT SOME!). He quickly turned round n saw a dark gnome like creature of less than half a metre tall! It was probably a toyol (a child spirit)! He got frightened n quickly ran back home without looking back.</p>
              <p>When he reached home, he was breathing heavily. He ate his supper n said a prayer to his Buddha altar. Thankfully he ran back fast or else that creature could've hurt him, although it probably just wanted some food to eat n sounded harmless.</p>
