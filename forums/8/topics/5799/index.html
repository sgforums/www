            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes I wonder if the pirated industry is really 'undefeatable'. I don't think the authorities intend to kill it altogether. I feel that the growth of the IT industry depends on it to a certain extent. If the government wanted to stem out pirated software, I am sure that it'd be 'dead' long ago.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Y'know what I dun get abt the issues against piracy? Well, it's the inflated figures they usually cite when accompanied by a 4" x 4" pixelated photo of BSA officials deploring our disregard for intellectual copyrights.<br><br>Well, if non-Microsoft-aligned companies lose $16 million (approx 1997) a year in Singapore in terms of OS sales, they should realistically scale back their figures to the levels of the actual consumption of their software in a pirate-free environment. Those who can afford $500-600 for the latest copy of Adobe Photoshop will still purchase their originals ; and those who can't won't. They cannot possibly generate that $16 mill in gross revenue.<br><br>The central problem with piracy is still not addressed. Intellectual copyrights are easy to maintain if you can meet your consumers halfway. Frankly MS has done a better job at this as I feel that at $100 per copy of Win98 (promo price with PC), it has actually promoted more legal copies than it would have been when I rem Win95 was released at $250 or thereabouts.<br><br>If you think very hard abt the piracy issue at Sim Lim, you will notice a certain parallel to the promotion of IT in Singapore. To ask a rhetorical question, do you think Singapore can be wired up by 2010 (liveware and hardware-wise, with an IT-savvy population, without the "easy availiability" of software (for the purpose of education)? *Mark Snow comes in at an appropriate time*<br><br>cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm of 2 thoughts about piracy. In a way, its good, since it offers a cheaper alternative to those who can't afford it. (That's like, maybe 92% of the population.) As Barclay put it aptly, who has the kinda finances to purchase O/Ses, or Utilities, which normally go at a coupla hundred dollars each ???<br><br>Yet, pirates normally have in their library, dozens of software/games that you can't seem to find in conventional stores. (Granted that some are beta versions...) As a friend has shown me a coupla days back, they're selling stuff like ROMs, 286/386 age DOS based games, MP3s, even the adult stuff. Now, think of it in terms of the average person. Just to download MP3s, ROMs alone on the conventional 33.6 kbps can take literally forever.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> *Drool*) I'd go to pirates for some of these reasons alone.<br><br>Not to mention that if you're really interested in games, you can always just pick the pirate version up, play it, and if you like it, sell/throw the pirate copy away, and get the original.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> For VCDs, its minus the censorship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm...interesting topic<br>as for games,pirated versions would be a "cheap" alternative for singaporeans as original ones are  just too expensive.but the good thing about orinals are that they will surely work when you've installed them.<br>Not to say i support piracy, i think the originals should make competition and lower prices. I think this matter was in the forum page in the newspapers recently? as for movies, no use buying a VCD if you are the only one wanting to watch a movie.<br>--------------------<br>Smile!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry to disappoint you Altrex, Bleem! (the PSX emulator for the PC) works like a dream ... NOT! More like a nightmare. Although the publishers claim 100% compatibility with listed games at their website, the jury is still out on the "QUALITY" of such an assertion.<br><br>Difficulties of getting the game to run smoothly (oh yes it will eventually work, but not with hair-pulling instances), the major grouse is that the sound-output is not in sync with game play. I personally ran RidgeRacer Type 4 and I can tell u that if I'm marketing this Bleem!, I'll just take still shots of the gameplay, cos it looked GORGEOUS! But it just ran like crap. I'll pass.<br><br>(Incidently, I used an original copy of RR4 [black Sony disc] to test.

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe part of our drive for IT rely on availability of software.  With the cost of original software, not many people can afford it.  (The software companies obviously do not think so)  When are we going to achieve this?<br><br>A lot of time, you just want to check out the features on some software.  Pirated copies offer such option.  You do not need to pay for the sky for it and feel the pinch if you don't like it and throw it aside.  Frankly, how many of you really use the software you own for more than a month?  Sometime it's only for a project.  I don't even use my original MS Office for more than 2 times in a month.  May be the software companies should re-model their pricing policy.  We should only need to pay for software usage rather that own it.  In this case, we can still get technical support when needed.<br><br>Without piracy, some of us would never even know if such a software exist in the first place. With the recent raids on sites, a lot of the pirated software is out dated, old version.  Their business is obviously greatly affected.<br><br>With pirated VCD, it provides you the avenue to check out the movies before deciding on whether to get the original in DVD format later.  With the price of DVD disk, how many can you afford in a month?<br><br>With the rate of piracy and these companies are still making tons of money, have they ever consider lowering the price of their products?  Do consumer really gain at the end?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, for games I'm willing to buy the original product if it contains more than 2 CDs (such as Baldur's Gate/Planescape:Torment) or if having an original is required (like Starcraft). [Can't wait for Diablo 2, game taking too darn long =(] The only thing I can't stand in buying an original game is that most of the time the box contains 'air'. Where are the good 'ol game manuals from yester years? Hell, at least the Starcraft box had a nice manual, poster and a writing pad.<br><br>For utility software I'd rather buy the pirated ones. As for music CDs, I'm not particular, although most of the time I buy originals since I rarely purchase one. I don't buy VCDs although my dad does.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It IS rather difficult is ppl have to keep following the lastest softwares if they cost $500 - $10,000. In fact it is ludicrous.<br><br>I believe only official companies have to buy official software... home users don't give two hoots about legal copyright issues cause they aren't scrutinised over it.. it's mostly for personal use.<br><br>Original games are pretty affordable still at $30-$60, and yes, I would buy them, esp. stuff like Baldur's Gate and those games I would really like to keep and ensure they run smoothly.<br><br>But if piracy spreads at the rate it does, we HAVE to realise that soon game companies and movie directors will not want to produce if their market dwindles to a pathetic state. So in the end, we may enjoy a few years of cheap games, but eventually there won't be any cool games left to pirate... same goes for cool movies...<br><br>Unfortunately, man is selfish and we just wanna get a cheap deal for ourselves.....<br><br>------------------<br>Is it cold in here, or is it just me?<br></div>

(So we may treasure what we buy.)<br><br>But I will never know anyway.<br>Though I'm into gaming, I don't need to play all the game on the market or watch all the movies in cinema.<br>So I wouldn't know what it feels like to be coughing up money for every single game or every single movie.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Note : A lot of people are a lot richer (and can afford piracy) than me but still prefer to buy pirated so they may safe the extra cash on other stuff.<br><br>Just my 2 cents</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess if I had a choice I would rather purchase the authentic copy. The feeling of owning an original, and the guarantee behind the product is unmatched. Trouble is, authentic software are usually too expensive for the general public.<br><br>I have the same sentiments as some other users in this forum. Piracy does have a significant impact on the advancement of Information Technology in Singapore. And the fact that those who won't be able to afford authentic releases wouldn't buy them even if piracy is completely inexistant, is undoubtly, true.<br><br>I'm not particularly well off, if piracy never existed, I would not be using, or have used, the following software before:<br><br>-Office 95, 97, 2000<br>-Windows 95 (my current windows98 was OEM  bundled)<br>-Corel Draw, photo-paint, dream 3D<br>-Adobe premiere, after effects<br>-Visual Basic 4,5,6<br><br>These are what I use almost everyday, and deem essential to me. I learnt quite alot from the usage of these software. And I would never have been able to get a chance to use them, if I had waited till I had enough savings to purchase the authentic versions. Imagine spending enough money for software that could buy you a new state-of-the-art system!!<br><br>The same goes for many other people, if piracy never existed, would most singaporean be able to get a feel of the actual industry, of what it takes to use industrial tools??<br><br>And another thing, reading from the BSA website, many of us commits piracy without even knowing it. Simple senario: You bought a new PC, but without an OS. You took a copy of the authentic Win98 OS bundled with your first PC, and installed it on the second computer. Wham! You're pirating.<br><br>If the big software companies really wishes piracy rates to decrease, they should consider dropping the rates. Do they really spend millions and millions of dollars in R&amp;D each and every year? Why are essential software prices so high?? Shouldn't someone starts thinking not of profit, but of the end-user instead?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the main reason why this industry is undefeatable is bcos the REAL BOSSES never get caught...so eben the stalls kena raided...they can always employ other ppl to take over...<br><br>oso...i just found out tt the cost price of a pirated disc is only abt $1 (including shipping and packaging)...and they are selling 5 for $20...tt means $4 each...just look at their profits!!!<br><br>and u think $4 apiece is damn cheap huh...<br><br>------------------<br>The best way to predict the future is to create it...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason in the North America, Priracy is not successful becos ppl here have their own CD burners...They burnt their own cds...means they have the duplicates of the original by burning it....So there is no need to buy pirated cds cos they are pirators themselves...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">:  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 28 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>It's not true that piracy don't exist in the north america.  It is just that the activities are not in the open.  If you have ever access hotline system, you will be able to get tons of application software, games and etc.  Just like SIM LIM square.  Some of the site have even the most updated version of all software. Better than SIM LIM square.<br><br>On the internet, you can even get priated software burn on CD-ROM, ready for delivery.<br><br>All people are the same.  No one will pay for software at such high price.  If that is the only way you get your software, you will not even want to use it.  Stop saying that the loss of revenue due to piracy is .....  If the price don't come down, people will just ignore it.</div>
