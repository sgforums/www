            <div class='col-md body'>To a certain extent I do agree with codename4 that ITE graduates are the last vestiges in the Singapore education system.<br><br>But you must also remember society in terms of wealth, education and success is pyramid shaped. There is always more not-so-well-educated ITE grads in comparison to those at the top.<br><br>Saying all these, you cannot look down on them. They have a role and place in society. They should also be able to have decent lifestyle and be happy. Although everyone would say yes, they want to live in villas and drive SLKs, but in fact many are happy and can be contented with a simpler lifestyle.<br><br>Nobody wants their kids to go ITE. They would expect them to go to the polytechnics at the very least. That is a fact. But whether ITE grads are looked down or not depends on each individual perspective. I would feel sad if your objective is to frame ITE grads as the lowest form in society.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Are ITE students happier? No one knows because as far as I know, nobody did research on this.<br><br>2. ITE girls who sell themselves, what percentage? Nobody knows.<br><br>3. Are those girls happier people? Nobody knows.<br><br>4. Is the next person whom you meet who studied in ITE and have only an ITE cert a happier or unhappier than the norm?

Did you really ask and check all the ITE students and honestly know that none can actually migrate overseas because they are not allowed to do so due to their ITE qualifications? Is there a law or rule that says ITE students cannot migrate?<br><br>From your statements alone, it speaks volume about the weight (or lack of) on your statements. So how can I trust that you're telling the truth on your future posts when it's obvious that you don't even know what you're blubbering about?

I could even pass you the url but here's a summary... It alone is proof that you have very limited thinking and I suspect even with proof presented in front of you, you will still choose not to believe in it. Fine by all means, but I've just proved that you are someone who don't know what you're talking about, and yet want to be taken as if someone of higher intelligence.
