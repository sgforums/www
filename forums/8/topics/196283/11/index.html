Anyway, there is no way for them to climb to the top unlike the girls stand at geylang loh. If not, it will be impossible. </div></blockquote>Maybe you deserve more to remain at the bottom? Some people, whether ITE or poly, still can work their way to the top. These are the people I am referring to. You say I start to preach stuffs and adopt a holier-than-thou attitude right, let me tell you, some ITE grads do have the ability to do well, at least do better than you.<br><br>You think you have a good attitude? Your I-am-better-than-ITE-people attitude is just bloody stinky. You think you will never require help from them someday? One day if you decide to go into business, an ex-ITE grad may just be investing partner that you need. By then, you tell him, "Sorry ah, ITE grads must all remain at the bottom of the pile. I do not need your money ah."<br><br>I must say that I am not perfect and can learn positively from others, including some people from ITE whom I know. They might not be able to be smart book-wise, but they certainly have another insight into society which we have overlooked for so long.<br><br>No doubt most of the experiences you might have with them are negative, but it must not forgotten that there are bad eggs in every pile. If you were to judge a group of people based on limited, bias experiences, maybe you need to relook your myopic judgement a bit?</div>
