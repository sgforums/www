You did a poll before ah?<br><br>And I am so sorry that you have lost your 50 bucks to me, cos I have diploma holder and my gf is not from ITE. But I guess that you did not have 50 to pay me as you had spent it on those uni gals to just to go out with you. Nvm, I am not short of the 50 also.<br><br>And I wonder why are there blind and stupid people like you.

Those stupid eilte like you are so locked up in their" I can break the law and I would not be caught" mindset and nobody can change it.
