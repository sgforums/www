Your judgement is clouded, let me assure u.

Do u really think all birds of the same kind flock together? Birds, yes. Humans, no. Unless ur saying that we have bird brains.<br><br>Secondly, a person's worth is not measured by his qualifications. In the govt sector, yes. In the private sector, no. Even if the govt measures success by qualifications, that's their point of view and it's shallow. A lot of us are the brainwash of the system. How many uni grads actually enter uni because they wana learn how to be entrepreneurs? Show me a subject which says, "How to make money." Money making knowledge comes from "social universities". A number of ITE grads can beat degree holders flat here.<br><br>Really really no offence but ur thinking is limited.
