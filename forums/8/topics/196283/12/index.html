            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it's kinda true that ppl who goes ITE are condemned. I mean look at how ppl here keep emphasizing how bad ITE is. I mean..why are they like this?<br><br>Simple. The school/rules/society brainwashes us.<br><br>take for example, my ex classmate who was from ITE came back to visit the school, the teachers there were giving her the 'i-look-down-on-you' looks. She is a very nice girl unlike some ppl. And also, there was once my teacher likes to degrade ppl by telling them to go ITE and forget abt studying. I mean Singapore is so realistic, you see magazines featuring ppl from high institute e.g raffles etc. never from ITE/private schools. I mean..our education system is always abt book smarts (they place it first among others) so ppl tend to not look towards ppl who are academically weaker. I still remember a paragraph in the mag saying that one ITE wanted to offer some kind of award to an A star actress but she declined. Ashame? Sigh, that's how sg works..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what to do? There are pple from ITE who likes to console themselves by saying ITE is good mah. So we should ask ministers kids to enrol in ITE loh.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jam on a bread:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, it's kinda true that ppl who goes ITE are condemned. I mean look at how ppl here keep emphasizing how bad ITE is. I mean..why are they like this?<br><br>Simple. The school/rules/society brainwashes us.<br><br>take for example, my ex classmate who was from ITE came back to visit the school, the teachers there were giving her the 'i-look-down-on-you' looks. She is a very nice girl unlike some ppl. And also, there was once my teacher likes to degrade ppl by telling them to go ITE and forget abt studying. I mean Singapore is so realistic, you see magazines featuring ppl from high institute e.g raffles etc. never from ITE/private schools. I mean..our education system is always abt book smarts (they place it first among others) so ppl tend to not look towards ppl who are academically weaker. I still remember a paragraph in the mag saying that one ITE wanted to offer some kind of award to an A star actress but she declined. Ashame? Sigh, that's how sg works..</div></blockquote></div>
