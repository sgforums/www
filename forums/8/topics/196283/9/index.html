(Eg RabbitRoseRune and some others)<br><br>Then Codename4, UberMagical etc etc take this opportunity to slam ITE grads. Downright condescending. We are all born of the same blood and flesh, no one shd ever look down on anyone.<br><br>If one ever looks down on anyone, let me assure that person that he will also feel looked down upon by others. I'm absolutely, definitely and positively sure. It's a vicious cycle.<br><br>And there are also those who supported XXP in the previous election simply because they are brainwashed products and not due to an independent thinking mind.<br><br>I am also sick of engaging those who do not have a clear cognitive mind, insisting that black is white and vice versa perpetually.<br><br>Quality of the forum is lowered somewhat by the above (Personal opinion)<br><br>Well, enough said.

            <div class='col-md body'>Before I start, I guess some of you know that I am a ITE student from Clementi, I retook my O levels Maths and make it to Poly. I can go in any poly and take up a engineering or IT courses but choose to take a Business as my interest lies in there.<br><br>My COP couldn't make it (L1R4 19pts haha...considered quite satisfactory when I did not study) thus I went to MI, planning to take up 3 years A-level in Commerce but I guess I will not be able to handle the A-Level Stress, so left after a week and went to Republic Polytechnic for Diploma in Business Applications.<br><br>I find it hard to accept their PBL method and to my horror the course offered a very different version of Banking and Finance as a module. So i thought of going back to ITE...my Course manager have ask me if I wanted to come back cos I did very well for the End Semester exam, with a GPA of 3.48, to my surprise...so I decided to do away with RP and re-enter ITE....I got 0% return in school fees, my parents were very worried for my decsion. But I realli wanted to make use of my ITE cert to enter poly for Banking and Finance Course, a future a place I know I should be going.....I<br><br>After reading Codename4's "explanation" and the fact that he keep using the phrase "name a ITE grad who make it up to CEO of a MNC" obiviously tells u tat he's trying to be sacrastic and step his foot on ITE's name, a behaviour, as a Christian, should be ashamed of, and even more so when he make use of his religion to "reinforce" his view that is "god-sanctioned".<br><br>The "ITE Sins", from what he said, meant that as long as a person is highly educated, so would meant possessing high "moral" values and civility. From this sentence one could see how narrow-minded such person can be. Thus, all polytechnic and JC students are "saints-like"<br><br>Anyway, he did not mentioned those increase numbers of ITE grads, who make it to poly, then University. If his given statement is true, then all of these pple, regardless of where they have went into <strong>(I have read of a article about this ex-ITE student now studying for masters in a foreign Univeristy)</strong> is usless and will never make it anywhere, just because he or she was an ex-ITE student?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ITE, Poly, JC or Uni cert, 70 years down the road, you think you can bring your cert with you into the coffin? Does a Uni degree make sure you enter heaven? A ITE cert enters you to hell? What matters most is how you live your life to the fullest and without regret. Even a degree holder can make mistakes. A few weeks ago, hasnt a newpaper reported on a medical student who took drugs and was caught and sentence to jail.<br><br>Uni is to teach you on how to think smart.<br>Poly is to teach you on how to work smart.<br>ITE is to teach you on how to be skill smart.<br><br>Each level has their own usefulness in the world. Different kind of work require a different kind of skill.<br><br>Regarding the $1000 job, I will choose the ITE student. Why? Do you think the Uni student will stay with you for long for that kind of pay?</div>
