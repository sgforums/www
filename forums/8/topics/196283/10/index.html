            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyoh, why all the slamming and counter-slamming all flying around the place?<br><br>Plx, for heaven's sake, just stop squabbling over minor things like that. No matter how much you say about your point of view, actions speak louder than words.<br><br>I am a firm believer that one can succeed as long as one is willing to work for success regardless of one's background, education etc. Education is just a tool. Schools should never be used as an indication of status. It does not make you a better person when you are in JC or Poly or ITE. Ultimately, it is your actions throughout your life that you are going to be judged on or going to be mentioned in your eulogy.<br><br>There are just some thickheads around here who refuse to believe or can't accept that some people who were once below them in the social strata ladder is now above them. Sometimes, it is just better to ignore them. Your life is much better without them anyway. So, if you were from ITE before and now earning a higher than average income, I salute you and commend you for your efforts and  being able to show that being in ITE does not mean an end to dreams of success. Just get on with your normal life and just disregard all those naysayers. They are just sore losers. They have no right to ask for your attention anyway since they refuse to shed age-old social immobility mindsets.</div>
