            <div class='col-md body'>oki, i'm new user here i might not know some of the forums rules but all i have and need to say after reading on that is well not everyone who goes to ITE is a bad person. There are a lot of them who wanna study hard and excel in life. It is just a manner of spending i'd say extra 2 years there building up a foundation. It is an institution to provide help and education to provide help to those weaker students and morever, they have received the SQA award which non of the schools or any polytechnics have it. (So respect them equally)<br><br>The students are street-smart and for those people who said "sux, or whatever about them," sorry u're so narrow-minded. Many of a  reason that caused students to go ITE, first of all maybe due to family problems, bad peers?, addicted to games, spending too much time outings? and others. All these various factors, so please for that ah pek saying all that reflects on U, u're well-being and shows how low u're.<br><br>And for ur sister tell her dun let those words affect her, move on with her studies and proceed to a next level of education, no one can changed ur mindset except for urself live life happily and to the fullest.</div>
