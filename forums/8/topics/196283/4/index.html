            <div class='col-md body'><br>Why are people stereotyping ITE students? Funny because I've known some friends whom only obtain like "O" levels and apparently they are more street smart than most degree students, probably due to the apparently "harsher" real life experience, you know, the survival skills. The thing is, there are many "O" level bosses, mostly from private companies because government companies, as many already know, only look at grades and qualifications. I mean if the world works like government companies, there would be no Bill Gates, he drop out of university last time. There will be no alot of things, such as planes because people laugh at the Wright brothers. Is ITE qualification lower than "O" levels? I mean if "O" level people can be boss of companies where degree students are trying to get their job in, why can't you guys give ITE students a chance in life?<br><br>ITE students already had a hard time coping with the demands from parents, the unfair criticism flying from all corners, besides, does anyone here still believe in the old saying, study hard and you will get a good job and therefore you will live a great life? Have you people read, at least in Singapore, that degree students driving cab for a living, or highly educated people rotting at home coz they can't get a job for months?<br><br>I'm not saying education is not good, in fact it's encouraged to study as much as possible, to promote lifelong learning, but to unfairly apply your personal ideals on how ITE students should be, are, and behave is definitely not right.</div>
