(Pls reflect on ur 2nd paragraph)<br><br>U have flouted this principle, "there are bad hats everywhere" and adopted the "birds of the same kind flock together" mentality. Do u really think all birds of the same kind flock together? Birds, yes. Humans, no. Unless ur saying that we have bird brains.<br><br>Secondly, a person's worth is not measured by his qualifications. In the govt sector, yes. In the private sector, no. Even if the govt measures success by qualifications, that's their point of view and it's shallow. A lot of us are the brainwash of the system. How many uni grads actually enter uni because they wana learn how to be entrepreneurs? Show me a subject which says, "How to make money." Money making knowledge comes from "social universities". A number of ITE grads can beat degree holders flat here.<br><br>Really really no offence but ur thinking is limited.

            <div class='col-md body'>look, when u are staying in a country like Singapore, what can u do about it? ITE graduate or NUS graduate? Which will u choose for $1000?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rock^Star:</div><div class="quote_body">Brudder brudder, ur view is certainly biased. Your judgement is clouded, let me assure u. (Pls reflect on ur 2nd paragraph)<br><br>U have flouted this principle, "there are bad hats everywhere" and adopted the "birds of the same kind flock together" mentality. Do u really think all birds of the same kind flock together? Birds, yes. Humans, no. Unless ur saying that we have bird brains.<br><br>Secondly, a person's worth is not measured by his qualifications. In the govt sector, yes. In the private sector, no. Even if the govt measures success by qualifications, that's their point of view and it's shallow. A lot of us are the brainwash of the system. How many uni grads actually enter uni because they wana learn how to be entrepreneurs? Show me a subject which says, "How to make money." Money making knowledge comes from "social universities". A number of ITE grads can beat degree holders flat here.<br><br>Really really no offence but ur thinking is limited. I believe u r one person who doesn't feel he can achieve much in life unless one has gd qualifications.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
