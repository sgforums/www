            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes the problem is not as simple as giving the person the attention, affection etc. etc. because some of these suicidal people have, kind of, twisted mind. No matter how much the people around them try to help to alleviate the pain or problems that are bugging them, they always manage to twist this around and think that these people actually hate them. Therefore, I guess it comes back to the person himself. If he keeps thinking that the world is against him, it will be very hard if not impossible to reach out to him and offer some help.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Believe it or not, the idea of suicide was once came to me last year, when I lost my ex-gf.. Living thru months of hell with my own rationality and happiness lost in the process... However, at the end of the day, I have to tell myself to live again but in a different way which I once did.... They say that after some bad things happened, there is a part of people which died. I would agree with that, you don't have to commit suicide sometimes, because a part of you dies with something taken away from you...

It is to believe that there exists miracles in this world, and I really tried very hard  to fight back for the r/s then, and it is just not within my control.<br><br>Btw, I wish to be serious this once : it is not funny. When you realize that you have no one to depend on, and then you realize that you have to carry on with no more attachments  (not even my family would mean anything to me now) in where you are born and grown up once, you would understand how I feel... It is not easy to be a prodigal....<br><br>Tet :<br>I would not spend anytime to kill u if I ever want to kill myself. However, since I am not going to kill myself, therefore, it would be a nonsensical inference to think about killing you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My classmate commited suicide last yr. during the very start of the June holidays..when my friends and i first heard of the news, most of us thought that it was a joke. However..it proved not to be the case. A lot of us did not know how to react..basically we were just too shocked to think anything clearly.<br>The next night, we all went to Singapore Casket to bid our last goodbyes to him. It was a very saddening scene. One which i hope i will not experience it again within the near future. Our principal plus some of our teachers were present as well. So many of us guys cried there..if there are pple out there who think that guys don't/shouldn't cry ..then you are wrong.<br>The sad thing is this friend of mine left behind his mother alone to pick up the pieces, his father died long ago and this friend of mine is an only child. I really don't know how his mother is going to cope with the rest of her life. Till now we still do not know why my classmate commited suicide but we never thought of condemning him or something. Everyone has their own reasons for doing something be it good or bad.<br>My advice to pple who wishes to commit suicide, think VERY VERY CLEARLY before u decide to do so. Is commiting suicide truly the only way out??? Do you realise how many broken hearts you will leave behind should you commit suicide? Your friends, your parents, your relatives, your siblings etc..<br>I don't wish to say too much about this already...its starting to remind me too much of that incident.<br></div>
