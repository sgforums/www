            <div class='col-md body'>Internet filtering services are available from service providers, but parents are slow to use them.<br><br>Parents want Internet service providers (ISPs) to make the Internet a safer place for their children. But they are not taking up filtering services - even when it is free - to block out pornographic and other undesirable websites.<br><br>According to the three ISPs here, parents either don't know such tools exist or they are unwilling to compromise on their surfing experience by adding a filter which will slow down their connection.<br><br>Less than five per cent of SingNet's 164,000 dial-up subscribers have signed up for its filtering service. <strong>The service is free for dial-up customers. For broadband users, it costs $3 a month. </strong><br><br>'There is a lot of education needed when it comes to such services,' said Mr Joseph Tan, SingTel's director of consumer products, broadband.<br><br>Filtering services offered by ISPs are more effective than software installed on a PC because the filters reside at the ISPs' servers and are difficult for a child to tamper with.<br><br>At Pacific Internet, only about 300 out of 130,000 dial-up subscribers are hooked up to its Cyberguard Family service. StarHub too has few takers for its filtering service, according to its spokesman.<br><br>The poor take-up is surprising, considering that parents here want ISPs to make the Net a safer place for children to surf. Over 54 per cent of parents think that ISPs should be responsible for regulating the Internet, according to a study that the Parents' Advisory Group for the Internet (Pagi) released on Monday. It surveyed 1,500 parents and 1,124 students, aged between 12 and 17, on attitudes and habits on the Net.<br><br>Dr Angeline Khoo, one of the researchers involved in the study, said that while parents want to find out what their children are doing online, they often lack the know-how.<br><br>Dr Khoo also warned that <strong>chatrooms- which nearly eight in 10 youths have visited - are a more serious threat than undesirable websites. </strong><br><br>These <strong>online meeting places are where sexual predators can often take advantage of the anonymity of the Internet to lure young children to meet them in person</strong>, she said.<br><br>About nine per cent of students said they have met an adult who pretended to be a child in the chatroom. About 44 per cent of students who went to a chatroom - particularly 14-year-old girls - have been asked for their phone numbers.<br><br>Openness may be one way to counter the dangers of the Net. Housewife Yap Swee Lan, 40, and a mother of four, places the PC in the living room so that she knows what her children are doing online.<br><br>Plus, she keeps the password to the dial-up Internet account. Ms Yap didn't know of the filtering service, but is now keen to sign up for it. 'Perhaps you need more publicity on such things,' she said.<br><br><strong>KEY FINDINGS OF THE PAGI STUDY </strong><br><br><strong>53.5 per cent of students accidentally receive pornography, for example, when they type a wrong Web address</strong><br><strong>12.2 per cent surf porn on purpose</strong><br>18 per cent visit violent and gory sites<br>79 per cent of students have been to a chatroom<br><strong>20.4 per cent of those who use chatrooms have met someone they first met online</strong><br>44.6 per cent of students, especially 14-year-old girls, have been asked for their phone numbers<br><br>-- CT<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>are you one of the statistics?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
