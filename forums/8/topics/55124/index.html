But you must also need to perform well in your work to show your potential.</div></blockquote>of cos.......but this is not the point i'm making here<br>it is definitely easier to study then to work, especially for certain professions/fields, so if u can't even show any sort of potential or flair in your studies, do u think u'll be a good employee?<br>and to show potential/flair in your studies, definitely good results are the best proof of that. it is true that certain ppl have better working attitude than others, but GENERALLY ppl's work attitude when it comes to the real working society can't be too unacceptable<br></div>
