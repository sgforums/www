You are likely to be much wiser and much clearer by then.<br><br>Also, dun wait until you ord then decide what u wanna do... there may be a tendency to be lost after army to civi conversion. There will times on the weekend u will be free in NS, take some time to chk out the courses etc.<br><br>All the best in ya final yr and make the best out of it.</div>
