            <div class='col-md body'>Oh maybe what i have posted is not very clear. What i mean is that hackers are trying to use Trojan horse programs in a attempt to gain access to my computer.Not that i have any valuable information that they can take but just would like to find out a bit more on such security measures. Being getting hundreds of such attks everyday so wondering if this is normal for most broadband users who leave their computer on for most of the day.</div>

Even if you do not have valuable information for them to take, it may also results in some other nasty things if they are malicious.(which i think most are not,most just do such things to test their skills for fun).Basically if they find a way it, they can do almost everything on it as if they are the owner.<br><br>Eg, they are able to install something in your computer to make it do works for them, eg being suddenly your computer is being used to host porns. For certain things like stealing information, they can either get it directly from your hard drive if u store the info there or they can install programs like key loggers that will be able to remember every key stoke u key in on the computer. Example if u use internet banking often ,u will need to key in passwords, that program will be able to remember all your keystoke and send a report back to that intruder. Based on that, they are able to analysis that data and get your passwords, user ID and so on.<br><br>Basically the longer you keep your pc and your internet connection on, the more time they have to keep on trying to break into your system.If so a firewall is your first line of defense against them. To use a firewall does not really require you to be that computer savvy, that goes for me too. I just brought the program, put in the CD, install it and it will automatically go to work. Of course it works 2 way, protect people from intruding and also to prevent your computer from sending out info to other parties. Thus your program may prompt u on what kind of connection u will allow to other parties. To check if there are intruders, just just have to open up that program again and it will show u how many blocked intrusions there are that day.<br><br>I m using a norton firewall program, if u want to have more info on it ,u can refer to the link below.

I assume u r using singnet broadband so it's using dynamic IP address<br>(i.e not fixed). So ur IP address changes often. The port scanner detects a new IP address and scans it again for open ports so maybe thats the reason you get alot of intrustion attempts even though there might not be alot of ppl trying to hack in...<br><br>As to whether ur PC has been breached, there's really no way to tell unless u read the logfile(which is not easy to understand!) or use some trojan scanner to see if a backdoor has been left on ur PC... hope it helps <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
