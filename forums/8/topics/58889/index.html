Beggars or minstrels can earn a good tidy sum in Singapore given Singaporeans' generousity, regardless if the vocation is illegal. All one has to do is to act act a bit and be pitiful and stay long enough in the begging scene and one would reap the profits.<br><br>Why would you think there are more and more students selling flags on Saturdays??? Charities obviously see it as a low capital (don't have to pay students even) and lucrative business. - Pardon for being blunt but I'm a darn pragmatic person)<br><br>I've a cousin who imitated the flag selling thingy with her own piggybank tin many years back (She was a little primary school girl who didn't know any better. So she emulated the flag selling she saw on the streets on weekends loh).<br><br>She was short of pocket money and had wanted to buy something she like but don't dare to ask money from parents. So she just took her own tin and go around asking people to donate to her for one day without informing anyone. (She is the gungho type one but also very sweet, cute cute and chubby chubby, so people just donate to her when she approached them loh)<br><br>She got a good sum which allow her to buy what she wants and still got extra to spare. She was so happy then!  But when she found out it was illegal later, she was shocked and dare not try again! (I got to know about it months later but they are good childhood memories for her despite the illegality of things!)<br><br>So you see how rich and generous SIngaporeans are????<br><br>So for that 24 yr old guy, I admire his courage to beg in Singapore. hehehe.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> He got nothing to lose anyway. *clap clap*</div>
