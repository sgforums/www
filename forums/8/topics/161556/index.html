If it is confirmed, it would be China's first known human death from the lethal and virulent H5N1 strain of bird flu, which has <strong>killed at least 62 people across Southeast Asia</strong>.<br><br>There have been four outbreaks of the bird flu among poultry in China in the past three weeks.<br><br>Three people living in central China's Hunan province came down with pneumonia from unknown causes last month following an outbreak of the H5N1 strain among local poultry, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.<br><br>The girl, He Yin, died three days after developing a high fever on Oct. 13. She had had "close contact with sick birds," Xinhua said. Her 9-year-old brother was also hospitalized with similar symptoms but recovered.<br><br>The third victim was a 36-year-old middle school teacher who reportedly cut raw chicken while he had a minor injury on his hand and later fell ill, Xinhua said. He was identified only by his surname, Song.<br><br>All three lived in or near Wantang, a village where the government says 545 chickens and ducks died of bird flu last month.<br><br>Chinese officials initially said the girl and her brother had tested negative for the bird flu virus.<br><br>However on Sunday, Xinhua reported that experts "cannot rule out the possibility of human transmission of H5N1 bird flu. The specific cause needs further laboratory tests."<br><br>Roy Wadia, a spokesman for the WHO in Beijing, confirmed that China had asked the organization for help last week.<br><br>"This is a reiteration of how much of a public health threat bird flu really is," said Wadia. "Sometimes it takes a human case or a suspected human case to raise the alarm, to remind us that no country, whether China or anywhere else, can afford to be complacent."<br><br>Xinhua said China has asked the WHO for help in testing the blood and throat swabs from the three victims.<br><br>Since late 2003, the H5N1 strain of bird flu has ravaged poultry stocks and jumped from birds to humans. Most of the human deaths have been linked to close contact with infected birds. But experts fear the virus could mutate into a form easily passed among humans and possibly spark a worldwide pandemic.<br><br>China, which was heavily criticized during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome for initially covering up the illness, has pledged it will be more open about reporting on bird flu.<br><br>Wadia said he did not think China had delayed its announcement of the suspected cases but that instead it was trying to be thorough before going public.<br><br>"I think the information they have shared with us has been shared as soon as they can corroborate it," he said.<br><br>Also Sunday, 1,700 officials and 100 police finished culling about 370,000 birds in northern China's Liaoning province after bird flu killed 8,940 chickens there.<br><br>The outbreak in Liaoning's Badaohao village, east of Beijing, was China's fourth reported outbreak in three weeks.<br><br>State television news on Sunday showed dozens of officials in white face masks and blue protective suits spraying disinfectant on empty poultry cages and the wheels of vehicles.<br><br>Xinhua said late Saturday that Badaohai lies along a route used by migratory birds heading from East Asia to Australia, contributing to fears that wild birds could spread the disease.<br><br>More than 20 magpies and other migratory birds had been spotted in the area, it said.<br><br>Chinese authorities have said they are concerned wild birds might spread the virus, particularly following an outbreak last spring that killed more than 6,000 migratory geese and gulls at northwestern China's Qinghai Lake.<br><br>The State Forestry Bureau said last month it was activating a reporting network to detect outbreaks among wild birds.<br><br>New regulations went into effect in Beijing on Sunday that allow detention for up to 15 days and fines of up to 200 yuan ($25) for anyone who fails to immunize their birds, the Beijing Morning Post reported.<br><br>The rules, announced jointly by the Beijing Agricultural Bureau and the Beijing Public Security Bureau, are aimed at ensuring a 100 percent bird vaccination rate in the capital, the newspaper said.<br><br></blockquote>can human beings rest without the fear of bird flu, sars killer viruses diseases all kinds of weird fetishes foods dogs pigs tiger penises from one particular community? are the human beings asking for too much from that community?<br><br>nobody deserves to die of these weird diseases.<br><br></div>
