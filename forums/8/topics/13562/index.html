            <div class='col-md body'>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.<br><br>1. Ha Mim.<br><br>2. The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Mighty, the<br>Knowing,<br><br>3. The Forgiver of the faults and the Acceptor of<br>repentance, Severe to punish, Lord of bounty; there is no<br>god but He; to Him is the eventual coming.<br><br>4. None dispute concerning the communications of Allah but<br>those who disbelieve, therefore let not their going to and<br>fro in the cities deceive you.<br><br>5. The people of Nuh and the parties after them rejected<br>(prophets) before them, and every nation purposed against<br>their apostle to destroy him, and they disputed by means of<br>the falsehood that they might thereby render null the truth,<br>therefore I destroyed them; how was then My retribution!<br><br>6. And thus did the word of your Lord prove true against<br>those who disbelieved that they are the inmates of the fire.<br><br>7. Those who bear the power and those around Him celebrate<br>the praise of their Lord and believe in Him and ask<br>protection for those who believe: Our Lord! Thou embracest<br>all things in mercy and knowledge, therefore grant<br>protection to those who turn (to Thee) and follow Thy way,<br>and save them from the punishment of the hell:<br><br>8. Our Lord! and make them enter the gardens of perpetuity<br>which Thou hast promised to them and those who do good of<br>their fathers and their wives and their offspring, surely<br>Thou are the Mighty, the Wise.<br><br>9. And keep them from evil deeds, and whom Thou keepest from<br>evil deeds this day, indeed Thou hast mercy on him, and that<br>is the mighty achievement.<br><br>10. Surely those who disbelieve shall be cried out to:<br>Certainly Allah's hatred (of you) when you were called upon<br>to the faith and you rejected, is much greater than your<br>hatred of yourselves.<br><br>11. They shall say: Our Lord! twice didst Thou make us<br>subject to death, and twice hast Thou given us life, so we<br>do confess our faults; is there then a way to get out?<br><br>12. That is because when Allah alone was called upon, you<br>disbelieved, and when associates were given to Him, you<br>believed; so judgment belongs to Allah, the High, the Great.<br><br>13. He it is Who shows you His signs and sends down for you<br>sustenance from heaven, and none minds but he who turns (to<br>Him) again and again.<br><br>14. Therefore call upon Allah, being sincere to Him in<br>obedience, though the unbelievers are averse:<br><br>15. Possessor of the highest rank, Lord of power: He makes<br>the inspiration to light by His command upon whom He pleases<br>of His servants, that he may warn (men) of the day of<br>meeting.<br><br>16. (Of) the day when they shall come forth, nothing<br>concerning them remains hidden to Allah. To whom belongs the<br>kingdom this day? To Allah, the One, the Subduer (of all).<br><br>17. This day every soul shall be rewarded for what it has<br>earned; no injustice (shall be done) this day; surely Allah<br>is quick in reckoning.<br><br>18. And warn them of the day that draws near, when hearts<br>shall rise up to the throats, grieving inwardly; the unjust<br>shall not have any compassionate friend nor any intercessor<br>who should be obeyed.<br><br>19. He knows the stealthy looks and that which the breasts<br>conceal.<br><br>20. And Allah judges with the truth; and those whom they<br>call upon besides Him cannot judge aught; surely Allah is<br>the Hearing, the Seeing.<br><br>21. Have they not travelled in the earth and seen how was<br>the end of those who were before them? Mightier than these<br>were they in strength-- and in fortifications in the land, but<br>Allah destroyed them for their sins; and there was not for<br>them any defender against Allah.<br><br>22. That was because there came to them their apostles with<br>clear arguments, but they rejected (them), therefore Allah<br>destroyed them; surely He is Strong, Severe in retribution.<br><br>23. And certainly We sent Musa with Our communications and<br>clear authority,<br><br>24. To Firon and Haman and Qaroun, but they said: A lying<br>magician.<br><br>25. So when he brought to them the truth from Us, they said:<br>Slay the sons of those who believe with him and keep their<br>women alive; and the struggle of the unbelievers will only<br>come to a state of perdition.<br><br>26. And Firon said: Let me alone that I may slay Musa and<br>let him call upon his Lord; surely I fear that he will<br>change your religion or that he will make mischief to appear<br>in the land.<br><br>27. And Musa said: Surely I take refuge with my Lord and--<br>your Lord from every proud one who does not believe in the<br>day of reckoning.<br><br>28. And a believing man of Firon's people who hid his faith<br>said: What! will you slay a man because he says: My Lord is<br>Allah, and indeed he has brought to you clear arguments from<br>your Lord? And if he be a liar, on him will be his lie, and<br>if he be truthful, there will befall you some of that which<br>he threatens you (with); surely Allah does not guide him who<br>is extravagant, a liar:<br><br>29. O my people! yours is the kingdom this day, being<br>masters in the land, but who will help us against the<br>punishment of Allah if it come to us? Firon said: I do not<br>show you aught but that which I see (myself), and I do not<br>make you follow any but the right way.<br><br>30. And he who believed said: O my people! surely I fear for<br>you the like of what befell the parties:<br><br>31. The like of what befell the people of Nuh and Ad and<br>Samood and those after them, and Allah does not desire<br>injustice for (His) servants;<br><br>32. And, O my people! I fear for you the day of calling out,<br><br>33. The day on which you will turn back retreating; there<br>shall be no savior for you from Allah, and whomsoever Allah<br>causes to err, there is no guide for him:<br><br>34. And certainly Yusuf came to you before with clear<br>arguments, but you ever remained in doubt as to what he<br>brought; until when he died, you said: Allah will never<br>raise an apostle after him. Thus does Allah cause him to err<br>who is extravagant, a doubter<br><br>35. Those who dispute concerning the communications of Allah<br>without any authority that He has given them; greatly hated<br>is it by Allah and by-those who believe. Thus does Allah set<br>a seal over the heart of every proud, haughty one.<br><br>36. And Firon said: O Haman! build for me a tower that I may<br>attain the means of access,<br><br>37. The means of access to the heavens, then reach the God<br>of Musa, and I surely think him to be a liar. And thus the<br>evil of his deed was made fairseeming to Firon, and he was<br>turned away from the way; and the struggle of Firon was not<br>(to end) in aught but destruction.<br><br>38. And he who believed said: O my people! follow me, I will<br>guide you to the right course;<br><br>39. O my people! this life of the world is only a (passing)<br>enjoyment, and surely the hereafter is the abode to settle;<br><br>40. Whoever does an evil, he shall not be recompensed (with<br>aught) but the like of it, and whoever does good, whether<br>male or female, and he is a believer, these shall enter the<br>garden, in which they shall be given sustenance without<br>measure.<br><br>41. And, O my people! how is it that I call you to salvation<br>and you call me to the fire?<br><br>42. You call on me that I should disbelieve in Allah and<br>associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge, and I<br>call you to the Mighty, the most Forgiving;<br><br>43. No doubt that what you call me to has no title to be<br>called to in this world, nor in the hereafter, and that our<br>turning back is to Allah, and that the extravagant are the<br>inmates of the fire;<br><br>44. So you shall remember what I say to you, and I entrust<br>my affair to Allah, Surely Allah sees the servants.<br><br>45. So Allah protected him from the evil (consequences) of<br>what they planned, and the most evil punishment overtook<br>Firon's people:<br><br>46. The fire; they shall be brought before it (every)<br>morning and evening and on the day when the hour shall come<br>to pass: Make Firon's people enter the severest<br>chastisement.<br><br>47. And when they shall contend one with another in the<br>fire, then the weak shall say to those who were proud:<br>Surely we were your followers; will you then avert from us a<br>portion of the fire?<br><br>48. Those who were proud shall say: Surely we are all in it:<br>surely Allah has judged between the servants.<br><br>49. And those who are in the fire shall say to the keepers<br>of hell: Call upon your Lord that He may lighten to us one<br>day of the punishment.<br><br>50. They shall say: Did not your apostles come to you with<br>clear arguments? They shall say: Yea. They shall say: Then<br>call. And the call of the unbelievers is only in error.<br><br>51 . Most surely We help Our apostles, and those who<br>believe, in this world's life and on the day when the<br>witnesses shall stand<br><br>52. The day on which their excuse shall not benefit the<br>unjust, and for them is curse and for them is the evil<br>abode.<br><br>53. And certainly We gave Musa the guidance, and We made the<br>children of Israel inherit the Book,<br><br>54. A guidance and a reminder to the men of understanding.<br><br>55. Therefore be patient; surely the promise of Allah is<br>true; and ask protection for your fault and sing the praise<br>of your Lord in the evening and the morning.<br><br>56. Surely (as for) those who dispute about the<br>communications of Allah without any authority that has come<br>to them, there is naught in their breasts but (a desire) to<br>become great which they shall never attain to; Therefore<br>seek refuge in Allah, surely He is the Hearing, the Seeing.<br><br>57. Certainly the creation of the heavens and the earth is<br>greater than the creation of the men, but most people do not<br>know<br><br>58. And the blind and the seeing are not alike, nor those<br>who believe and do good and the evil-doer; little is it that<br>you are mindful.<br><br>59. Most surely the hour is coming, there is no doubt<br>therein, but most people do not believe.<br><br>60. And your Lord says: Call upon Me, I will answer you;<br>surely those who are too proud for My service shall soon<br>enter hell abased.<br><br>61. Allah is He Who made for you the night that you may rest<br>therein and the day to see; most surely Allah is Gracious to<br>men, but most men do not give thanks.<br><br>62. That is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of everything;<br>there is no God but He; whence are you then turned away?<br><br>63. Thus were turned away those who denied the<br>communications of Allah.<br><br>64. Allah is He Who made the earth a resting-place for you<br>and the heaven a canopy, and He formed you, then made goodly<br>your forms, and He provided you with goodly things; that is<br>Allah, your Lord; blessed then is Allah, the Lord of the<br>worlds.<br><br>65. He is the Living, there is no god but He, therefore call<br>on Him, being sincere to Him in obedience; (all) praise is<br>due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.<br><br>66. Say: I am forbidden to serve those whom you call upon<br>besides Allah when clear arguments have come to me from my<br>Lord, and I am commanded that I should submit to the Lord of<br>the worlds.<br><br>67. He it is Who created you from dust, then from a small<br>lifegerm, then from a clot, then He brings you forth as a<br>child, then that you may attain your maturity, then that you<br>may be old-- and of you there are some who are caused to die<br>before-- and that you may reach an appointed term, and that<br>you may understand.<br><br>68. He it is Who gives life and brings death, so when He<br>decrees an affair, He only says to it: Be, and it is.<br><br>69. Have you not seen those who dispute with respect to the<br>communications of Allah: how are they turned away?<br><br>70. Those who reject the Book and that with which We have<br>sent Our Apostle; but they shall soon come to know,<br><br>71. When the fetters and the chains shall be on their necks;<br>they shall be dragged 72. Into boiling water, then in the<br>fire shall they be burned;<br><br>73. Then shall it be said to them: Where is that which you<br>used to set up<br><br>74. Besides Allah? They shall say: They are gone away from<br>us, nay, we used not to call upon anything before. Thus does<br>Allah confound the unbelievers.<br><br>75. That is because you exulted in the land unjustly and<br>because you behaved insolently.<br><br>76. Enter the gates of hell to abide therein, evil then is<br>the abode of the proud.<br><br>77. So be patient, surely the promise of Allah is true. So<br>should We make you see part of what We threaten them with,<br>or should We cause you to die, to Us shall they be returned.<br><br>78. And certainly We sent apostles before you: there are<br>some of them that We have mentioned to you and there are<br>others whom We have not mentioned to you, and it was not<br>meet for an apostle that he should bring a sign except with<br>Allah's permission, but when the command of Allah came,<br>judgment was given with truth, and those who treated (it) as<br>a lie were lost.<br><br>79. Allah is He Who made the cattle for you that you may<br>ride on some of them, and some of them you eat.<br><br>80. And there are advantages for you in them, and that you<br>may attain thereon a want which is in your breasts, and upon<br>them and upon the ships you are borne.<br><br>81. And He shows you His signs: which then of Allah's signs<br>will you deny?<br><br>82. Have they not then journeyed in the land and seen how<br>was the end of those before them? They were more (in<br>numbers) than these and greater in strength and in<br>fortifications in the land, but what they earned did not<br>avail them.<br><br>83. Then when their apostles came to them with clear<br>arguments, they exulted in what they had with them of<br>knowledge, and there beset them that which they used to<br>mock.<br><br>84. But when they saw Our punishment, they said: We believe<br>in Allah alone and we deny what we used to associate with<br>Him.<br><br>85. But their belief was not going to profit them when they<br>had seen Our punishment; (this is) Allah's law, which has<br>indeed obtained in the matter of His servants, and there the<br>unbelievers are lost.<br>�<br>Chapter 40, Koran</div>
