            <div class='col-md body'>character ....gosh, let me think.  like i said b4, he should be an intelligent conversationalist (intelligent! not brillant!  i don't need a nuclear scientist!), possess a sense of humour (must be able to "tahan" my corny jokes), and most importantly, adore me (i.e. give me his attention and his time).<br><br>alas, fate sometimes like to deal a cruel hand.  wat we wish for is often wat we can't get.  ;Ãž<br><br>rinoa: a very thought-provoking thread indeed.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I like guys who are easygoing. Angsty moody ones scare me off. At the same time, the guy must know his mind. I can't stand wishy washy guys who can't even decide where to go for dinner!<br><br>And the guy must be able to hold a good conversation. I find that a lot of Singaporean guys are very self-absorbed.(Of course, the same thing can be said about the girls too) They don't care about anything outside their school/work, family, and friends. Some don't even read the newspapers or think much about life in general! Find it hard to talk to them. Not expecting to have an in-depth discussion about politics or economy, just hoping to find some interesting observations or thoughtfulness. Is this too much to ask for?<br><br>Of course, these are only some qualities I look for in a date. Before I get attached, I look for more....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa..<br>Well, what a mind proding question you got there. BTW, is there any hidden meaning in asking about preference of physical and character on your part?? Are you trying to find someone whom you feel matches what you are looking for?? I think it shouldn't be too tough for you, since there are so many available guys (nice too??) here.<br><br>Back to your current thread, well to me, I hope that she (whoever she might be) would offer me intellectual challenges, witty, loving, and horny (depend on ocassion of coz). There might be more, but currently too stress up.. lots of problems. Cheers!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Secrets<br>I do agree with u that some guys are quite shallow interms of coming up with topics to talk about.They are mostly interested in what they like rather than what u like...just like what purr has said, nothing but work, their own interests (e.g soccer) and not much of a variety.(sad to say)<br><br>Purr<br>I thinkthe guys you go out with might not be your kind then.Cos I think most guys in SG would like to talk about economy and political issues (unless they are like me, nothing but arts and music)I think tryingn to know each other's interest is important rather than self-centeredness.As for me, I can talk about issues of all kinds as long they are not too corny.(Can't stand guys who always talk about girls and sex)<br><br>Luf<br>Well...most of my threads are actually a way of understanding ppl's maturity and thoughts.I like to analayse ppl cos they things they say roughly tell me what kind of a character this person is, which I have somewhat figure it out.<br><br>Hmm..looks like the girl u are looking for may exist in this thread since all of the gals will be voicing their views so stay tuned to this thread!<br><br>Thanks for giving me the credit for "provoking" your brain cells!Drink more essence of chicken for more of my brain evoking threads!ha!<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sukii...<br>I understand...it is like asking a guy to tell you all the names of the players in the football game and all the rules of how the game is all about. And while the game is on, you dun understand how come the player is out. And he will say in a fit of anger,"Why you got so many questions??U dun know how to see hah?"(Just an analogy)<br><br>So, I think the point might be of different environmental background and the tone the guy talks to u. I think he is trying to belittle u, showing his superiority rather than teachine u.

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with you Rinoa on Sukii's response. Well, it's a human to human communication thingy. If you know something but if the way you convey it to the other party is kinda threatening him/her, they wouldn't get the whole picture, so what's the point. To be successful, one should be able to communicate well and share your knowledge. You are trying to teach someone, not to make the person fearful of you. Perhaps this is a point all teachers should take note.</div>

It's driving me nuts. I won't even mind talking about politics and economics even though I'm not really interested in them. How to talk about interests with people when they don't have any (other than how to get more 'A's)? BTW, I'm in the local U, the place where intellectuals supposedly congregate.

            <div class='col-md body'>I like people who are quite lively but can treat everyone with respect, which means that they are not up themselves. Also, I look for integrity and loyality in a friend/ partner.<br><br>I read many people saying that they like people they can talk to, and I agree to a certain extent. I think when you find someone that is compatible you will be able to communicate as much or as little as you want. But, you can only talk so much. Wouldn't it get boring discussing about politics or arts or philosophy all the time? It does get a bit tedious if you try to be serious all the time. If you do that all the time it actually becomes stressful, and where would the fun in the relationship be then? I'm sure there will be times when you simply enjoy the company of you significant other.<br><br>Hey Rinoa, you managed to ask something similar to what I wanted to post. I was curious as to what people think of the compatibility of people with different personalities, like, would a relationship between an extroverted and introverted person work out? Since you obviously display mucho pulling power, can I suggest you post that later on?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi!  I'm new to this forum, so hopefully I can bring some good vibes (so to speak)<br><br>there are 2 aspects in my opinion that i look for in a girl<br>1) this will sound like the biggest cliche ever, but the most attractive aspect of a girl in my case would have to be a compatible sense of humor.  i'd like to think i'm a bit of a comic, but if the girl don't get my jokes, then it gets really hard for me to be myself.  i mean, if she's totally clueless about the jokes i tell, then what's the point?  cuz it really tells a lot aobut the girl itself.  if she doesn't appreciate the jokes, then she wouldn't really appreciate my characteristics.  i'm not asking for a Ellen de Generes comedian type of chick, but someone who has a funny bone in a working order would do me just fine.<br><br>2) i adore a girl who doesn't sit on the fence, what i mean is, someone who has an opinion of her own.  doesn't matter if it clashes with mine sometimes.  in fact, it's better.  i admit that it brings a lot of arguments to the table, but my last gf was like that, and we had a really great time...even though we spent most of our times cracking jokes and arguing on little things.<br>opposites attract, i mean, imagine going to a movie, then you both come out and you say "that was a good movie, don't you think?" and she replies "yeah, it was good"  HOW BORING!!<br>a good exchange of opinion is really healthy, just as long as it's not about whether women should stay at home and pump out babies...hehehe...i stil remember the bruises i got after that one...<br><br>anyway, you all probably think i'm weird, but that's my 2 cents.<br><br>cheers!<br><br>------------------<br>Underneath the Southern Cross I stand...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the most attractive character of a person is the willingness to listen &amp; understand. Understanding a person is never an easy task. It takes a lot of patience &amp; a heart which can really feel. How many people out there can do this?<br><br>------------------<br>Even if I have a pair of wings on my back, I cannot fly because I haven't flown for a long time. Because I haven't flown for a long time, I may already lost the courage to fly. If I try to fly again, I may not survive the flight. Then again, maybe I did not fly before in the first place. Even if my wings are broken, I'll still try to fly. Until I can meet up with you.<br></div>
