It takes time to really understand ur likes, dislikes, and also the expectations u want from a girl. Look around u and see...observe and try to evaluate.Listen and learn from ppl' experience rather than going thru the pain ur own.This is how i grow up.<br><br>Finger...<br>I think interests between two individual is the most important cos as long the character of the person is not entirely opposite,, both can learn the strength and weaknesses of each other and improve on it. A good and healthy relationship includes making the one u love, a better individual and accepting their weaknesses and strengths at the same time.Sharing happiness and sorrow together and not just alone...it takes two to make a relationship strong.<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I love Yutaka's explaination- willingness to listen and understand. In this world of instant gratification, I find this lacking, even in myself sometimes. Okie, I will keep this to my heart and try to practice it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I think some difference in opinion is sexy. No, not disagreeing for the sake of disagreeing. It's about keeping an open mind, and the willingness to learn from one another, even if you don't agree.<br><br>I think tact is very important when you're arguing, both for guys and for gals. I remember I once had a huge argument with a friend over something. I told him to do something but he kept putting it off. In the end, he got us into trouble (nearly) because he didn't do what I told him to. I had to really resist gloating, "I told you so". Instead, I tried to be symapthetic and help him out. It was VERY difficult though.<br><br>Even if you disagree, I think it is still very important to have some respect for the other person.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ummm....perhaps the notion of opposites attract don't really apply to some people, but although i firmly believe in that vie point, i have to acknowledge the fact that compatibility also counts for the relationship.  of course it would be really nice to have a companion with the same interests and as purr put it, "wavelength".<br>and for some, it's the basis of a relationship itself.  eg. two people who met through a particular convention for example, which shows a common denominator between the two.<br>but on the other hand, coming back to the opposites attracts argument, it gets a bit boring to have someone who is a carbon copy of yourself, it's like dating yourself.<br>but i suppose there are a myriad of other suggestions, but i forgot to mention this, a trait which really attracts me to a girl is the defenseless nature of them.  when i say that, i don't mean damsels in distress, but one whom i can take under my wing and protect from the harm around her.  it really emphasizes the role of the male in the relationship (imagine married to Xena, the warrior princess...the guy won't be getting her out of a jam, SHE will get the guy out of trouble...)<br>Rinoa will probably think it's only male chauvinism, but i think lots of other guys would agree with me.  what do you reckon?<br><br>------------------<br>Underneath the Southern Cross I stand...</div>
