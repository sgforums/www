            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm ya I agree with TS. I am a victim of bully too. Not those small words like 'you're ugly' those kind..I can accept it. But..it's those physical &amp; the constant mental torture &amp; taking away your beloved crush those kind of bullying..making ppl feel that they are trash..really feel that they did not respect you at all.<br><br>I agree maybe your heart will heal somehow...but somewhere inside, you are not really normal. You sometimes feel the pain every now &amp; then..how can you be completely cured..when say, you suffered the same crap for like..over 3-4yrs? or maybe 20 yrs of your life? They say that the environment mould a person..which I agree. If you thrive in these kind of environment, you think you would be confident enough to say that you alright 100% in your heart..I don't think so..nt even a 80 or 90..most not even a 50..like the saying goes, "everyone puts up a mask' probably they tasted some sort of bullying before. Betrayal or otherwise.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Contrary to many believes... that victim of bully face problems etc in later life...<br><br>perhaps it somehow affect their inferiority complex... but often these people appear to be more persistance and deter in life later... these stronger attributes will contributes to their success in life later. Few examples are like Bill Gates and many great man in history. if they survive the childhood. There are those who commited sucide too.<br><br>And those who in their teens who been a bully... I will probably luff at them in life later... just like more than not statistically ah bengs wouldn't do very well in life later.</div>
