            <div class='col-md body'>SAAA backs down after $1-million compensation demand<br>New contract for throwers after duo's parents make a scene in S'pore<br><br>By Peh Shing Huei<br><br>FACED with a demand for $1 million in compensation, the Singapore Amateur Athletic Association backtracked on its decision to drop two of its China-born throwers yesterday.<br><br>Athletes Luan Wei (left) and E Xiaoxu.<br><br>A month after dumping Luan Wei and E Xiaoxu from its Foreign Sports Talent scheme, the association, urged by the Singapore Sports Council, did a U-turn, and surprisingly offered the pair a new contract each for a year.<br><br>But this was not before some table-thumping by the athletes' parents, who flew here about a fortnight ago to demand compensation.<br><br>They wanted $500,000 for each of the throwers, citing 'loss of youth' as the main reason.<br><br>Luan and E, both 20, came here five years ago, but unlike team-mates Du Xianhui and Zhang Guirong, who went on to win South-east Asia Games golds, they have not impressed.<br><br>Though Luan and E became Singapore permanent residents in February last year, their chances of obtaining citizenship were slim because they failed to meet the SAAA's targets.<br><br>Luan's target was 17.50 metres for the men's shot put, while E's was 52m in the women's hammer throw. His best effort was only 16.31m, recorded last month, while E fared no better with 43.94m.<br><br>The new contracts were offered at a meeting last night at the SAAA headquarters in the National Stadium. It was attended by SAAA president Tang Weng Fei, director-general Eric Song and the SSC's chief of high performance, Toh Kian Lam.<br><br>Said Toh: 'The SSC's role is to facilitate meetings and discussions between the SAAA, the throwers and their parents for a win-win situation for Singapore sports.'<br><br>The meeting was closed to the media and Timesport was shooed away by the parents last night, with one of the mothers yelling at the photographer: 'Don't you dare take my picture.'<br><br>The throwers have until tomorrow to accept or reject the contracts, which stipulate that they must meet the targets in a year, and they must also take English lessons and do part-time work.<br><br>It will cost the SAAA about $60,000 to keep the pair over the next year.<br><br>Explained Tang: 'It's a holistic package, so if they can't make it as athletes, they can do something else.'<br><br>But the SAAA insists it is not bowing to pressure from the athletes and their parents.<br><br>'Not at all,' said Tang. 'We are maintaining that they must achieve the targets. We are just giving them extra time to do it. It is a good gesture on our part.'<br><br>In a separate matter, the SAAA also seems to be going out of its way to satisfy another Chinese national - national throws coach Li Hongqi.<br><br>He suffers from deep vein thrombosis (DVT), more commonly known as Economy Class Syndrome, a serious condition where the flow of blood is restricted in a vein, and a clot forms. DVT sufferers may experience sharp chest pains, shortness of breath and cough up blood.<br><br>The 62-year-old Li collapsed during the Philippines Open Track and Field Championships in Manila in July and had to be hospitalised under intensive care.<br><br>Cardiologist Dr Melvin Tan and the association's medical commission chairman, Dr Janice Khoo, then certified Li as medically unfit to carry on his duties.<br><br>But the SAAA will not accept the opinions of these two doctors, with Tang saying that he is 'trying to be fair to the man and give him the benefit of a second, third and fourth opinion'.<br><br>Li is the personal coach of national shot put record-holder Zhang.<br><br>After his collapse in Manila, she stayed in the Philippine capital for 10 days to take care of him, suspending her preparations for the Athens Olympics in August.<br><br>In Greece, she managed a dismal 16.58m, a far cry from the 18.37m new national mark she achieved last month.<br><br>(WHO'S NEXT TO 'RE-THINK' OR MAKE A U-TURN?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> )</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup i totally agreed, and worse of all they got so much benefits from our govtn and still dare to complain about we singaporean being rude, KiaSu, not friendly, no service etc....<br><br>I find they are so rude and disgusting to comment our country when they are in our country.  If they dislike our country so much, they jolly well scam back to their country and don't stay here.<br><br></div>
