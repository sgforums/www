            <div class='col-md body'>The government is dabating whether to allow SAF to have to privellege of give deserving soldiers extra points to get to local universities. Saying that the performance soldiers gave during their NS libilities, would reflect their abilities and adaptabilities when they study in local university in future.<br><br>I can see two imediate problems:<br><br>Firstly: Does that means soldiers are aready limited of their points after their BMT (first 3 months in SAF)??? ie. officers get full marks, specialists get lesser, men get the least???<br><br>Secondly: Does that means soldiers have to start boot-licking their superiors, back-stabbing their peers, and make use of their subordinates. All these, just to get their superiors' attention when the day comes for their evaluation???<br><br>In the end, what will SAF stands to gain???<br><br>Please feel free to give your comments...<br><br>[This message has been edited by mingming (edited 08 March 2001).]</div>

Coz officers are usually saddled with the burden of leadership. Therefore, to the company, an officer may be someone who is better at managing people.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>
