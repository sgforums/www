Not go into class and tell students "today we will learn differentiaton .. flip to textbook .."<br><br>If educators cannot grasp this simple fact, no use espousing on "teach less learn more" and the use of IT.<br><br>Another part is to help students see the relationship between diff Maths topics. Those familiar with mathematical history will no doubt marvel at the insight in relating algebra and geometry (is this the correct term? skyfoo pls confirm). Descartes linked algebra to geometry. Fermat linked geometry (the cartesian graph) to algebra.</div>
