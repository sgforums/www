              <p>It is up to individual to believe. I also don't pray during 7th month. What I understand is they are praying for safety not just during the 7th month but for the whole year.

              <p>I stepped on it accidentally for many times nothing happened. Why i step on it?</p>
              <p>u blame those ppl who do the offering. They put at road side and the grassy areas, no wonder we step on it accidentally.</p>
              <p>I respect other ppl's beliefs so i wont go and step on it intentionally but sometimes i do step on it accidentally.</p>
              <p>If i step on it accidentally i pray to God for protection. If God is for me, who can be against me.</p>

              <p>Those people with 3rd eye said 7th month is different from other month because the gate of hell will be open and therefore there are many ghosts, not just the earthly ghosts and these ghosts from hell are fiecer than the earthly ghosts.

              <p>I heard from people with 3rd eye that if they see a ghostly figure waiting at the junction, there sure to have a fatal accident around there. It is up to individual to believe.</p>

              <p>Your friends are one of the few who don't believe in ghosts. There are many people in this world believe their existence. Wait till he sees one, he will definitely drop from his computer chair.</p>

              <p>I do belief and pray during the 7th month. But really, my pet peeve is that some people just can't burn in the bins provided. Then burn all around the walk way. Want to walk one time, have to hop like some monkey from one place to the other -.- </p>
              <p>After all, before burn got write name, sure will go to the person intended ma. Still want to separate. Kao. During 7th month, so many ppl scared till want to die liao, still put so many traps around for people to step. Stupid ppl! &gt;=[</p>
