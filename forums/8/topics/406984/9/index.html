              <p><br>the lady very silly and foolish. so many guys out there for her to choose. anyway she is now a ghost, but the show didnt show her suffering as a ghost. for those who committed suicide, once every 7 days, the person will relive the scene of the suicide. ghosts also suffer from cold and heat. 1 day in human world is 1 month in their ghost realm. ghosts lifespan can range from hundreds to thousands of years old.</p>
