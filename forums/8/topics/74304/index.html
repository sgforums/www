            <div class='col-md body'>Most students aspiring to enter planned school must have good grades as it will prepare them for tough academic exams<br><br>By Jane Ng and Lynn Lee<br><br>STUDENTS talented in the arts but who are not in the Express stream will be admitted to a planned school for the arts here only on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>The ruling on admission criteria for the 200 to be taken in each year echoes that of the new sports school and is expected to raise as much flak.<br><br>The chairman of the committee set up to examine the feasibility of such a school, Mr Lee Tzu Yang, chairman of oil giant Shell, explained at a press briefing yesterday that the school would emphasise academic grades.<br><strong><br>According to sources, students at the secondary school will need very good grades because they will have to sit for the rigorous International Baccalaureate diploma at the end of a six-year integrated programme.<br></strong><br>He said: 'In the Singapore context, we all strive for excellence, whether it's academic or artistic. This school I would see as also striving for excellence in both areas.'<br><br>It was deja vu for some artists and parents, who said this thinking does little to encourage those who are good in art, drama, dance and music but run-of-the-mill academically.<br><br>One of Singapore's best contemporary artists, Vincent Leow, 42, said he would certainly not qualify for the school, which was given the green light by Parliament a fortnight ago. He was from the technical stream.<br><br>Nor would Cultural Medallion winner Chua Ek Kay. The president of Lasalle-SIA College of the Arts, Professor Robert Ely, noted that Chua, who was admitted with 'hardly any qualifications', now holds a master's degree in visual arts from the University of Western Sydney, Australia.<br><br>About one-fifth of the 500 or so students that enter Lasalle-SIA do not have the required four O-level credits and one pass, including English. They are accepted based on interviews and their portfolio.<br><br>The artistic director of Malay theatre company Teater Ekamatra, Mr Noor Effendy Ibrahim, 31, said the criteria 'places too much expectations on the child'. 'Are we nurturing artists or creating an audience to critique the artists in future?'<br><br>Madam Sophia Tan, 42, a businesswoman with a 10-year-old son, Evan Lim, who draws well but who scrapes through other subjects, said: 'It doesn't seem very fair when you're recruiting for an arts school.'<br><br>Similar sentiments were expressed when the sports school, which offers a four- and five-year O-level track, announced it would take in only Express stream students.<br><br>It eventually also admitted 28 normal stream students, including Singapore's top badminton prospect, Ng Zhong Ren, and talented footballer Muhammad Safuwan Baharudin, both 12.<br><br>The new arts school is scheduled to open in 2007 and will be in the Waterloo arts district. The Singapore Art Museum and schools like the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts are located in the area.<br><br>The committee estimates it would cost around $80 million to develop the arts school, excluding land, and about $18 million a year to run it. It will have a total of 1,200 students.<br><br>RECOMMENDATIONS:<br>FOUR DISCIPLINES<br><br>STUDENTS receive training in four disciplines, but specialise in at least one area. Seventy places each for music and the visual arts, 30 each for theatre and dance, for each year of enrolment. No more than 25 in a class. Singaporeans pay $500 a month in fees; foreigners, $1,000.<br><br>Â• MUSIC. Covers theory and history of music, composition, harmony, counterpoint. Student must master a chosen instrument; will be trained to perform solo, and in ensembles and orchestras. Computers used to train in music technology.<br><br>Â• THEATRE. Covers acting, production, movement, voice. Plus classes in theatre history, forms, methods and theories; and lessons on how to deal with auditions.<br><br>Â• DANCE. Training in classical ballet, plus other Western and Asian dance forms. Lessons covering dance technique, history of dance, basic choreography, Pilates, nutrition.<br><br>Â• VISUAL ARTS. Training in drawing and a range of mediums.<br><br>NOTE: Details to be fixed later by principal and heads of department<br><br>[/quote]<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?!<br><br>oh.. this is an ARTS school, but no, u need to be good in maths, science, geography, history, literature, english, chinese..... in order to get in!<br><br>so wats the diff with other so-called elite schools like RI and RGS?<br><br>the diff is its called an ARTS school!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
