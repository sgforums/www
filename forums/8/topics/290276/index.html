After every module, they will ask for feedback. Initially, we tell them what we think are things need 2 improve. And guess what? Nothing changes.<br><br>The library is not that big either. SIM has a library more than twice the size of MDIS. Trust me, I had been a student of SIM, and I am currently studying in MDIS, so I know.<br><br>And as for the swimming pool, erm, that's a public swimming pool, the way u wrote it, people thought that MDIS owns a swimming pool <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I guess u have read the papers that my school plans to have a 3rd campus site soon, and that we want around 15,000 students by next year. I am not sure which day u went to our Unicampus, but i can assure u that it can be VERY overcrowded at times.  The school is expanding way beyond its ability to handle it.<br><br>The way I see it, u are better off at SIM, unless of course the course u want is avilable only at MDIS. You wanna talk about campus feel, SIM has a more "school" feel.<br><br>I may sound like whining, or that I am anti-MDIS, but I am just stating my opinion. I sincerely am thanking heavens I am graduating next year, and I would deifnitely take my Masters elsewhere.</div>

I'm from dragon babies batch so the whole world kinda look down on me and my peers. Then now thanks to us upping the popularity, MDIS suddenly became one of the best in SG and appear all the time in the newspaper and all the kids (1989 - 1990) started enrolling inside making it overrated.<br><br>Now MDIS is truly overrated. They think that by taking the unconventional path in a private sch like mdis, they are cooler than the cool kids from poly. I have a farking diploma I also never show off until like that.<br><br>And anyway, its not about studying there. The student culture there is to skip lessons as much as you can and only study when exams come. Cos papers are 70%, while attendance is 10%. 20% is for project works and presentations.<br><br>So alot of students there who are rich atas ah xia kias think that when exams come, just by reading the textbooks, they can secure at least 50% from the 70% and can jus heck care attendance and projects.<br><br>If you want to study there, make sure you dun get influenced by ppl there, I used to skip lessons BUT ONLY for those whcih i am very confident abt. Lesson starts at 9am, I and my friends slowly wake in at 9.19am, sign the file, and by 9.40am, we were already playing LAN at town. But I make sure I absorbed all the impt notes and knowledges before I attempt something like that, with my projects all done and submitted.<br><br></div></blockquote>Anna Oh? Or is it Clara Chua <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ?<br><br>Anyway, I guess u are now studying dip/advance dip only? I doubt you are studying degree course now because if u are, try doing what u are doing now during degree level when the lecturers are ang mohs, and you will definitely fail ur course no matter what. They are very very particular about your attendances.They expect you to have 90% attendance for lectures and tutorials. You cannot help people sign if they are late/not coming, u cannot sign in if u are late, and u die die must reach there by 9am.<br><br>And u are right, some people think private schools are cool because they finish their dip/adv dip/degree within 3 years, faster than their peers. Its wrong thinking. If anything, the 3 years are basic crash course. U squeeze what people learn in a sem in poly/Uni into 2-3 weeks only, and we are only touching the surface, learning the most basic of the basic. When we go out and work, we are the ones who suffer more because the more advanced stuff we didn't learn.<br><br></div>

Last year alone, we changed 3 course coordinators. Sometimes we need help but don't know who 2 approach. The new coordinator knows next-to-nothing because the previous one didn't say anything to her. And then the vicious cycle continues.<br><br>I always believe that our school is expanding too fast for our own good. They can't cope with the growth, and yet they want to grow even more. They ask us for feedback yet they don't take it seriously, by the fourth feedback session we simply give up. Its maddening.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Atfter attending 2 terms of studies there. I find the 'school' quite all right. Nothing much to expect from a priv instituition either, unlike local uni or poly. (But my main purpose is not there either, because i want to give myself another chance at studying) The lecturers are so far so good, the ones i met with are eligible to teach lar. but most importantly is they gave accurate if not close to accurate focus for the exam. =)<br><br>Many pretty girls around but most seems to come from china and some of them actually looks good, maybe its cuz of their dressing style? can't differientiate them nowdays unless they start talking. but likewise i have to admit they are indeed pretty looking.<br><br>The most intolerent of all is the Coordinator/service side at least my coordinator (Gundam SeeD?). Bad- very very Bad, it makes a good impression of the school into a very bad one. 'I missed 1 week of my lesson because he went for reservist. partly its also due to me not going down personally to the school to clear up the matter and trusting that they can be responsibile enough to inform me of the latest updates. I felt abit disgusted by his manner when i went down to meet him (face-to-face) he didn't even apologize and still act so calm and cool. (But its all right, im very patient) What a prick !! His irresponsibility didn't stop at there. On my examination day he actually forgot to add my name onto the list and i almost couldn't sit for my paper. luckily I went earlier on that day, but the one who helped me wasn't him cuz when i went down to service center, he wasn't around. (As expected) !! but consider lucky i manage to sit for my paper. Recently he has been taken over by another person, actually when i received his notification he will not be my coordinator anymore i felt abit sad for him. I wonder isit because he was a screwed-up person and they decided to switch him or he couldn;t take the stress of probably endless of complaints from students and want out but i still wish he will change his charecteristic for the better. if they had been more competent and RESPONSIBLE. Everything will turn out good right?<br><br>I just think the whole management must be real SUCK. its like the school just wants to focus on milking money MONEY esp from foreigners 'thats all. They couldn't care less about the students. But maybe thats a few black sheep among the incompetents who really does want to help students or they are just all the same?<br><br>Actually it is not really that scary or my words are meant to discourage anyone from going into priv schools. (Of course not many people will want to go to a priv schools if they can get into local schools right) Its just that its not the same as in local school eg sec or poly where there will be people to aid and guide you. Just that to be on the safer side you have to be motivated and take the initiative to find things out yourself. Sometimes don't think you can trust your classmates too, information that they gave might not turn out right. So far i find this school 'all right' because the lecturers (thats most important) i met are all good ones, they are experience and most of them are really sincere to assist u, and not forgetting another important factor is that all their focus is accurate.<br><br>But like most of the guys said, I guess I won't be furthering my studies there after I obtain this cert. But for now im very glad enough this school allowed me a place to study in. =)<br><br>Takopachi</div>
