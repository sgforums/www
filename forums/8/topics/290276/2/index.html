            <div class='col-md body'>all business or IT courses huh. Cos im looking at Biomedical courses. The reviews i heard from my friends are pretty decent. this is due to that the coordinator of the life science programme, he himself is enrolled in the biomedical programme. So if he screws up the time-table, he probably is screwing up himself too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
