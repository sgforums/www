            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys need help witht his internet activity... a level standard economics. Yeah it sounds simple i know, The reason I give a **** about this HW is because it is counted in my JC2 common test.<br>but I just have doubts if my answer is standard or not. ok this is the question:<br>. Go "Back" and locate the center column of the home page. There you will find various economic and social issues listed. Click on an issue that interests you. What is the position of the AFL-CIO on the issue? Is your position on the issue the same as the position of the AFL-CIO? Click here to submit your answer!<br><br>And here is the url of the article I chose: http://www.aflcio.org/yourjobeconomy/overtimepay/ns11222003.cfm<br><br>And here is my answer: I agree with the AFL-CIO being against the pay cut bill because it robs American workersÂ’ right to receive pay for whatever extra work they put into their job. It is morally unfair to allow workers to be exploited for extra work. Although Â“more than 40 hours a weekÂ” ( 5 hours a day) is peanuts compared to the amount we Singaporeans have to put up with in our jobs (11 hours a day), still to the American workers, it is a grave injustice to work such Â“longÂ” (subjective) hours without pay. No overtime pay would mean a smaller income for workers, which could drastically change lives and put people in poor houses.<br><br>On the other hand, BushÂ’s bills and policies all aim to raise funds for our war against terror. The war against terror will be a hard fight, which is why we need all the help (money) we can get. A limited time of no overtime pay (along with other unfair policies) in exchange for global peace from terrorism is a small price to pay.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sounds fine to me. I work 12 hours a day and I am in Singapore, the white schools make them work only 7 hours, 8 to 3 pm. Lolz is that a touch of sarcasm I see in you commenting how easy going American life is compared to Singapore? I like it! As for your answer, I don't know, I don't really think I care anymore, the depression is coming back.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have no idea how you got 'more than 40 hours a week' with (5 hours a day), unless there's a hidden variable somewhere.<br><br>your answer seems rather opinionated, since it's an economics question, the lecturer would be looking for an answer related to the subject.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah it is opinionated. But what else am I to write? The Question just asks, what is the position of the AFL-CIO on the issue? I gave the answer, the AFLCIO is against it period. Next part of the question, is your position the same as that of the AFLCIO? I gave the answer as yes and no... saying yes because it sucks to have overtime pay cut and is unfair... saying No because of my love for G.Bush.<br><br>Nismos, what would you suggest I write? Have you visited the article? There is not much there for me to work with in the 1st place.<br><br>So i am kind of scared because they will count this assignment in the test next yearlozzz... how?</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>hey you're the economics student, not me.<br><br>i suppose you're supposed to regurgitate what you've learnt in the previous year to support why you think AFL-CIO is right.<br><br>stuff like, cutting OT pay will give the company more money to spend elsewhere thus reviving the sluggish economy. "less pay for 10 creates jobs for 1!" stuff like that.<br><br>if it was me, i wouldn't adopt a right or wrong stance straight away. i'd list all the points out, argue over them, and finally conclude with a different opinion, maybe something like a middle ground for both sides, or maybe a totally different approach.<br><br>the lecturer wants to see 3 things. what you've learned, how you practise what you learn, and how good you've practised it. in this sense, agreeing or disagreeing isn't the point of the exercise. thinking it through is.</div>
