            <div class='col-md body'>I have a friend who seems to have a sexual problem. He is, like many men, attracted sexually to girls. However, he hates women a lot and he said he hates it when he is sexually attracted to them. He said he likes the many personalities of guys a lot and that he falls in love with guys more easily. Sometimes he says that he wish he can be a girl so that he can truly fall for guys.<br><br>He gets very frustrated when girls giggle, laugh or make noise. Sometimes he will reach out and hug me but I let him do that because he knows very well that I like girls a lot and not gay of course.He is never friendly to girls.<br><br>He is 18 now I think and still studying.<br><br>What do you think is his problems?

Not all gays like to touch here and there one...<br><br>It's natural that they're born like that. Not easy to change. Just like asking a ordinary male to like another male.</div>
