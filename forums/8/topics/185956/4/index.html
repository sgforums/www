They claimed that its not to their benefit to continue building the bridge due to the sand and airspace issue. This i am not very sure why its not to their benefit but one thing is for sure, why didn't they consider this before actually building the scenic bridge of theirs?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
