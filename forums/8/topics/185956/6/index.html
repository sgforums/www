They see it as a long term economical benefit down the road , supplying us with hardwares that they had developed themselves. Of course, the " software" that they supplied in 1967 , was priceless.</div>

As for country 2. and 4. , the enemy of my enemy is my friend theory, thats why we cooperated.  For country 1. and 3, they just wanna earn our $$, esp for 3. , so that they can sell us more hardware.<br><br>Its not a nice sight when you see the Airforce of the country that you blicker with, flying their planes over your airspace, esp when they know the state of their own AF and ours.

It wasn't the case at all for us. Granted, Israel needs the $$ etc to fight the 6 Day War then, but we are talking about the willingness to come forward to help a nation in her time of crisis. I bet even when we were willing to pay for the help then, no nation in our neighbourhood gave a damn.<br><br>If you read LKY's memoirs..it was mentioned that during those times, the bloody Brits tried to sell us outdated equipment at a high cost...they're still having the colonial mentality. The Israelis probably sold us their stuff (battle-tested, like the AMX-13 light tanks, soltam mortars etc) at a big discount for a newly independent nation who could not afford the high-priced items. Even the M16s with the pitted barrels (probably Vietnam War surplus) were used by the SAF then.<br><br>Remember, both SG, MY and Indonesia has been very closely linked - bilaterally, culturally etc for centuries.
