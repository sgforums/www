            <div class='col-md body'>CANCEROUS FOOD/PRODUCTS<br><br>SATAY LOVERS<br><br>If you all eat satay, don't ever forget to eat the cucumber, because  eating satay together with carbon after barbequing can cause cancer.<br><br>But we have a cure for that... Cucumber should be eaten after we eat the satay because satay has carsinogen (a cancer causing element) but<br>cucumber is anti-carsinogenic.<br><br>So don't forget to eat the cucumber the next time you have satays.<br><br>PRAWNS &amp; VIT C<br><br>DO NOT eat shrimp/Prawn if you have just taken VITAMIN C pills!!This will cause you to DIE in ARSENIC (As) toxication within HOURS!!<br><br>PORK AWARENESS<br><br>Try this and see whether the pork you bought has worms. There goes with  your "Bak Kut Teh" for those who love it. Most men love to eat this so  watch out before it's too late.<br><br>If you pours Coke (yes, the soda) on a slab of pork, wait a little while,  you will SEE WORMS crawl out of it.<br><br>A message from the Health Corporation of Singapore about the Bad effects  of pork consumption. Pig's bodies contain MANY TOXINS, WORMS and LATENT  DISEASES.<br><br>Although some of these infestations are harboured in other animals, modern veterinarians say that pigs are far MORE PREDISPOSED to these illnesses than other animals. This could be because PIGS like to SCAVENGE and will eat ANY kind of food, INCLUDING dead insects, worms, rotting carcasses, excreta including their own, garbage, and other pigs. INFLUENZA (flu) is one of the MOST famous illnesses which pigs share with humans.  This illness is haboured in the LUNGS of pigs during the summer months and tends to affect pigs and human in the cooler months.<br><br>Sausage contains bits of pigs' lungs, so those who EAT pork sausage tend to SUFFER MORE during EPIDEMICS of INFLUENZA. Pig meat contains EXCESSIVE<br>quantities of HISTAMINE and IMIDAZOLE compounds, which can lead to ITCHING and INFLAMMATION; GROWTH HORMONE which PROMOTES INFLAMMATION and growth; sulphur containing mesenchymal mucus which leads to SWELLING and deposits of MUCUS in tendons and cartilage, resulting in ATHRITIS, RHEUMATISM, etc.<br><br>Sulphur helps cause FIRM human tendons and ligaments to be replaced by the<br>pig's soft mesenchymal tissues, and degeneration of human cartilage.<br><br>Eating pork can also lead to GALLSTONES and OBESITY, probably due to its<br>HIGH CHOLESTEROL and SATURATED FAT content. The pig is the MAIN CARRIER of the TAENIE SOLIUM WORM, which is found in its flesh. These tapeworms are found in human intestines with greater frequency in nations where pigs are eaten. This type of tapeworm can pass through the intestines and affect many other organs, and is incurable once it reaches beyond a certain stage. One in six people in the US and Canada has RICHINOSIS from eating trichina worms, which are found in pork.<br><br>Many people have NO SYMPTOMS to warm them of this, and when they do, they  resemble symptoms of many other illnesses. These worms are NOT noticed during meat inspections.<br><br>SHAMPOO<br><br>Cancer-causing substance in Shampoo. Go home and check your shampoo.<br><br>Change before it's too late... Check the ingredients listed on your  shampoo bottle, and see they have a substance by the name of Sodium  Laureth Sulfate, or simply SLS. This substance is found in  most shampoos;  manufacturers use it because it produces a lot of foam and it is cheap.<br><br>BUT the fact is, SLS is used to scrub garage floors, and it is very  strong!!! It is also proven that it can cause cancer in the long run, and  this is no joke. Shampoos that contains SLS : Vo5, Palmolive, Paul  Mitchell, L'Oreal, the new Hemp Shampoo from Body Shop etc contain this  substance.<br><br>The first ingredient listed (which means it is the single most prevalent ingredient) in Clairol's Herbal Essences is Sodium Laureth Sulfate.<br><br>Therefore, I called one company, and I told them their product contains a  substance that will cause people to have cancer. They said, Yeah we knew  about it but there is nothing we can do about  it because we need that  substance to produce foam.<br><br>By the way Colgate toothpaste also contains the same substance to produce  the "bubbles". They said they are going to send me some information.<br><br>Research has shown that in the 1980s, the chance of getting cancer is 1  out of 8000 and now, in the 1990s, the chances of getting  cancer is 1 out  of 3, which is very serious. Therefore, I hope that you will take this  seriously and pass this on to all the people you know, and hopefully, we  can stop "giving" ourselves cancer-causing agents.<br><br>INSTANT NOODLES<br><br>Dear instant noodle lovers,<br><br>Make sure you break for at least 3 days after one session of instant  noodles before you eat your next packet!<br><br>Please read the info shared to me by a doctor. My family stopped eating instant noodles more than 5 years ago after hearing about the wax coating<br>the noodles - the wax is not just in the Styrofoam containers but it coats the noodles. This is why the instant noodles do not stick to each other when cooking.<br><br>If one were to examine the ordinary Chinese yellow noodles in the market,  one will notice that, in their uncooked state the noodles are oily. This  layer of oil prevents the noodles from sticking together.<br><br>Wantan noodles in their uncooked state have been dusted with flour to  prevent them sticking together. When the hawker cooks the noodles, notice  he cooks them in hot water and then rinses them in cold water before  cooking them in hot water again. This process is Repeated several times before the noodles are ready to be served. The  cooking and rinsing process prevents noodles from sticking together.<br><br>The hawker then "lowers the noodles in oil and sauce to prevent the  noodles from sticking if they are to be served dry.<br><br>Cooking instructions for spaghetti require oil or butter to be added in  the water when boiling the spaghetti to prevent the pasta from sticking  together. Otherwise, one gets a big clump of spaghetti!<br><br>There was an SBC (now TCS) actor some years ago, who at a busy time of his<br>career had no time to cook, resorted to eating instant noodles everyday. He got cancer later on. His doctor told him about the wax in instant noodles. The doctor told him that our body will need up to 2 days to clear the wax.<br><br>There was also an SIA steward who after moving out from his mother's house into his own house, did not cook but ate instant noodles almost every meal. He had cancer, and has since died from it.<br><br>Nowadays the instant noodles are referred as " cancer noodles".<br><br></div>
