            <div class='col-md body'>My friend bought a couple of jackets amounting to more than S$900/- in November last year, from a well-known boutique BL*M in the Raffles Place area.<br><br>Some jackets need to be amended, and they do amendments for free, so she left some with them for amendments. Subsequently, there were two jackets left for collection.<br><br>Before the end of the year, the boutique called her up to ask her to go down and collect the jackets, saying that they were ready. Upon reaching there, she realised only one is ready, but the amendment was done wrongly. They are still searching for the other jacket for her from overseas.<br><br>Till February 06, a lag of 4 months, both jackets are still not ready. Whatever is fashion has now become passe/vintage stuff. She called their HQ, but the staff were totally useless. She to ask to speak to the boss, a guy, without email, without phone number, without any form of contact, except for his name, Mr SPENC*R K*H, but in vain.<br><br>We have only been in contact with one supposedly top management (Mr NICHOL*S), and who, he claimed, is the only one who can solved my friend's problem. But no, again and again, he tried to drag the two jackets, and cannot give my friend a definite time for their arrival.<br><br>Since delivery of the goods cannot be confirmed still, my friend demanded for a refund for both jackets, as well as transporation fees to the outlet, as her patience ran out. Quarrelled over the phone many many times, and Mr NICHOL*S still cannot solve the problem. Finally, he reluctantly agreed to give my friend a refund for both jackets.<br><br>just want to issue a warning... this boutique, which is quite popular with brides and has several outlets in town (Citylink Mall, Raffles Place, etc) has no integrity and treats its customers like shit after you've paid for your purchases.<br><br>After-sales services and support are NIL. I've been to so much trouble since.. and am still trying to resolve my case with them.<br><br>Am thinking of shaming them in the newspapers after I've settled my case.
