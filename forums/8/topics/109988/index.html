If I've more than 1, I'm afraid that I cannot love both as much or equal and ended up not being a good mother.<br><br>Partly also I think with only 1, I can still travel as a family to overseas as both me and my husband loves to travel, more than a child will limit our distant to travel.<br><br>With only 1, I can provide him with better education and learning enviroment.<br><br>At first, I'm very sure and confirm tat I only need 1 child and I can save enough to provide for old age so tat he don't have to take care of us when we're old.<br><br>BUT, after meeting those mothers, they keep saying... No, its not enough, your boy will be very lonely and helpless if both of the parents are not around anymore. One of the mother even mentioned tat she herself is the only child and feel very stressful and helpless when her mother is sick... She alone have to take care of them and provide them financially. Its very tiring.... another mother added in, ya, my husband is the only child and I find him very poor thing... etc...<br><br>After hearing so much, I'm a bit shaken...<br><br>I would like to hear more from mothers out there and if anyone share the same thinking as me.<br><br>tks.<br><br></div></blockquote>If you want your child to experience the loneliness of being a single child, go ahead.<br><br>Your child's upbringing really affects his later life, including his social behaviour.<br><br>If you can afford it financially, I do not see any reason why you should not have more than one child.<br><br>Not to mention family holiday packages always come in "for four".<br><br>See what I mean?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think having more than 1 will be an added advantage. it allows a child to learn socialising skills and how to live harmoniously wif one that is going to receive equal (or almost equal) amount of love.. they will be able to learn how to share, care, take up responsibilities from a young age.. better still, they got a companion and will be less dependent on the parents...  as an only child, mostly grow up to be rather spoilt and they will find it hard to adapt when they get to sch as they are too used to being given the best of everything..  maybe u might think abt this?</div>
