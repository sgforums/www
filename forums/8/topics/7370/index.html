            <div class='col-md body'>This topic is a bit controversial, so please don't squash poor orange into orange juice! :p<br>Don't you think kids nowadays are too spoilt for their own good?  For instance, back during my time, to extract a loose baby tooth, I tied a string around it, fastened the other end to a door and Slam! Bang!  Goodbye tooth!  Nowadays, mummy and daddy have to bring precious little baby to the dentist, pay astronomical fees to get a loose tooth extracted.  And they still cry their heads off!!  Nest time grow up how to defend the country?  No need to fight also lose  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah mi gotta agree with that.Kids nowadays are mostly spoilt cos parents spare the rod too often. They give in most of the times.<br><br>Have u guys seen how kids behave in public places ie in cinemas, mrt trains, restaurants etc. Geez, how i wish i can give those ill-behaving kids a piece of my mind.<br><br>MAybe the government can consider starting a course for new parents to guide them on how NOT to spoil their children.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>u'll never CRAWL aLONe..<br>cos the FOOLS r there 2~~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Last time when we were  small,a big family is the normal,so naturally our parents don't have so much time and attention on lavish on us,so any small matter,we sure kena rotan,hahaha.But now with most families have only 1 or 2 kids,it is natural for them to shower upon their kids all the love and affection thus causing some kids to grow up to be spoilt brats,so i guess maybe the govt is indirectly to blame for this as they encourage us to have less kids mah,heheeheh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">PPPPP</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The main reason I believe kids are more spoilt now a days is because family have lesser kids. Parents tends to give them the best. Treat them with heartedly. Unlike in the past, every family have more than 10 kids, they don't really concern so much for individual like what parents do now.<br><br>[This message has been edited by millennium (edited 14 May 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, want you guys' opinion.........<br><br>Well, my mother helps her friend to look after this kid in the afternoon.<br><br>This kid is Pri 4 and yet has not the slightest idea of what angles are, always lies his way out of doing homework, and sometimes even hides his workbook to avoid doing homework. I tried teaching him but I gave up after one day, despite my vast tuition-giving experience(ok, ok) because (I hate to say this) he is so dumb and yet is not willing to put in even a pinch of effort to improve. So I always 'punish' him by not letting him watch cartoons.<br><br>Recently, he got bolder. Once he was snorting some unintelligible tunes on his recorder, which is highly irritating, so I asked him to stop and practise at home instead, but he refused. So after asking him to stop for about 10 times, I simply snatched the recorder away from him.<br><br>Am I being a big bully or busybody here?</div>
