            <div class='col-md body'>It is really not about if parents treat siblings EQUALLY, but FAIRLY. There is no way for "equal" treat as siblings are NOT clones and while I empathize with the previous replies where parents were deemed to be giving unequal treatement, there are also probably unstated/unexpressed issues at the background.<br>I have children that I not treat equally as they are very different, one child is more obedient while another is more challenging. So the treatment for them is base on fairness, meaning, it depends on the situation.<br>Of course all said and done, some parents will play favourite to some child and ignore the other child.<br>It is a personal decision that I'd made on the issue of fairness. Perhaps not all parents had considered this when treating their children.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
