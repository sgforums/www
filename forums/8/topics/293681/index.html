It is best you go to any polyclinic and don't mind the long wait and get the doctor to refer you over to SNEC or your prefered hospital as this way will be much cheaper. As for me I got refered by my MO when I was serving my NS. Can say that Im a regular at SNEC now. It's good to have your checkup soon when u feel there's something wrong.</div>

I had galucoma earlie this year right after my sugery, appearantly the doctor made a slight miscalculation and injectED too much steroids into my operated eye hence caused my eye pressure to shoot up real high, but thank god it was discovered earlier and he did his responsibility to solve the problem for me. I think since they ask you to go back to recheck next year it shouldn't be much of a worry there. But should you sense anything wrong with your eye, you should go get back to your doctor.<br><br>Just my 2 cents !</div>

My neighbour was referred by the polyclinic dr to go SNEC.   Went for ops, after ops she has side effect.   Was told the training doctor who did the op for her did not do a good job.   She was unlucky to have a lady doctor who is bad tempered take care of her.   She said the dr very fond of flaring temper to the patients, and the staff there are also aware of her behavious.<br><br>By the way, for your info, SNEC is operating on its own away from SGH.   SNEC "broke away" from SGH.    SNEC and SGH are reporting to SingHealth.<br><br>I went to a specialist at Mt E and he was good and professional.   He had so many patients that the clinic is always full.   Sorry I can't remember his full name, the only thing I can remember is his name has "ming" in it.  If I manage to recall the name, I will post here to let you know.<br><br>Meanwhile, do consider where you want to go.  It is important to get a good, commited, pleasant doctor with good skills to help you as eyes are really very important.</div>
