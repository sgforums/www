              <p>I had stayed in my condo for 7 years, and recently, my Management Office came to me to say that my ground floor neighbour had complained that my aircon is leaking water to his backyard.  In a way, it is a stupid design of the condo that the aircon units of each top floor is directly above his backyard. However, I went to the neighbour directly to try to resolve this.</p>
              <p>Suffice to say, I nearly vomit blood the few times I spoke to this man. He is an old man staying there with his wife. The first time I tried to understand the problem from him, he said (quote): "you should fix this nicely for me, or I will take actions".  WTF.  I went to three aircon servicing companies, all of them told me it is natural for the condenser unit to leak, especially on a hot day.  They said the solution is to put a tray, but that would run the risk of mosquito breeding, and is illegal. I tried to reason again with the neighbour that there might be nothing I could do... probably the most I could promise is to reduce my aircon usage (and save electricity in the process). He refused to reason with me, and insisted "something definitely can be done", "go fix the pipe".  When I explained it was not the pipe leaking, he told me "where is your professional knowledge?".  Want to vomit blood each time I speak to him la.  From day one, I gave him my contacts that if the leak worsen or happens, please contact me so I could take a look for myself. He didn't even call me a single time for the last 2 months, but complains to the Management office a few times. When I asked him when the leaks had started, he gave me vague answers like... "long time already!". </p>
              <p>Finally one aircon place suggested, maybe make the edge of the ledge where the condensers are sitting on, to be slightly higher, so the water should flow to side instead of the front.</p>
              <p>My question is... for this kind of issue, is it my responsibility to fix it?  Do I have to pay for everything, or is it reasonable to expect both parties to share the cost?  I have no legal knowledge on this (and yes, probably will go talk to a lawyer if it gets ugly), but I just want to settle this thing peacefully.  Only thing is this uncle very kanasai attitude, I really cannot stomach the "qi". </p>
              <p>Thanks for any advise.</p>

              <p>It's your aircon, I would think you need to pay for all the cost.</p>
              <p>Maybe you can site your condenser unit in another area.</p>
              <p>You could also consider improvising the tray, by securing a netting (ensure no gaps that mosquito can pass through) over the tray, so that the mosquitoes cannot pass through to lay eggs in the stagnant water.</p>
              <p>You have to check it frequently to ensure that no mosquito breeds, just incase the netting breaks.</p>
