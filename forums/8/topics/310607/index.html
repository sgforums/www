              <p>Vatican recently listed human cloning as a mortal sin and set the motion thinking are we repeating an old technology given to us by our creator eons ago that form our gene pool of modern human being today.</p>

                  Matthew Omaye Ajiake, author of Nephilim: The First Human Clones. Ajiake makes a case for the existence of human clones in Old Testament times in the form of the Nephilim, descendants of Cain, one of the sons of Adam. The Nephilim were referred to as giantsâ€� and the fallen onesâ€� â€“ unnatural and grotesque creatures.

              The first, and oldest, belief is that "the sons of God" were fallen angels who consorted with human women, producing giant offspring called nephilim. This view was widely held in the Judaic world of the first century, and was supported by many of the "Ante-Nicene Fathers," including Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Irenaeus, and Eusebius.
              
              The second view is one which was advocated by Saint Augustine, the Catholic Bishop of Hippo. He rejected the concept of the fallen host having committed fornication with women. In his early fifth century book The City of God, he advanced the theory that "the sons of God" simply referred to the genealogical line of Seth, who were committed to preserving the true worship of God. He interpreted Genesis 6 to mean that the offspring of Adam through Seth were "the sons of God," and the offspring of Adam through Cain were "the daughters of men." He wrote that the problem was that the family of Seth had interbred with the family of Cain, intermingling the bloodlines and corrupting the pure religion. This view has become the dominant one among most modern biblical scholars.
              
              The third view is that "the sons of God" were the sons of pre-Flood rulers or magistrates. This interpretation was advocated by two of the most respected Jewish rabbis of the Middle Ages, Rashi and Nachmanides, and became the standard explanation of rabbinical Judaism. However, it is not widely accepted by modern scholars.

              <p>...what?</p>
              <p>I'm not following most of you people's argument.</p>
              <p>IIRC, according to most christians against cloning/genetic/biological enginering :</p>
              <p>God created men, created other beings, refined them and what not. God is the one that did the cloning/g/b engineering. As such, only God should be allowed to do this.</p>
              <p>For human to do the same task as God will infringing on the realm of God. We are attempting to make ourselves equal, or better than God.</p>
              <p>So, the Christians ARE arguinging that cloning is an old technology (if you're calling it technology, perhaps it's magic, in Christian view?) but it is God's sole right.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I'm very much FOR g/b engineering. I believe that it is truly the only way for human to progress.</p>
              <p>Imagine this : If scientists discovers how to genetically engineer a being to be smarter than themselves (even if it's just marginally) then this new....human, will grow up and discover a better way of genetically engineering the next subject to be even smarter. This is known as technological singularity (further reading : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity</a>)</p>
              <p>So, in the end, you will have a being that is, by all means, omniscient. If this being decides to judge us Old Humans, well, then most religions' idea of apocalypese will come true, isn't it? A being that is as powerful as God will look at us and, based on how we have done, judge us and decide if we will live or die.</p>

              <p><br>That is what you believe. You belief that the Bible is a record of true events. I believe that it is pure fabrication and not worthy of any "research". What I do not understand is your contitutional inability to post this type of topics in a forum (like EH) where people who share your belief can indulge you in "researching" the Bible together with you.</p>
              <p>It is a win-win situation. You will get what you want; research into the Bible, rather than to have people belittling you.</p>

              <p>...what?</p>
              <p>I'm not following most of you people's argument.</p>
              <p>IIRC, according to most christians against cloning/genetic/biological enginering :</p>
              <p>God created men, created other beings, refined them and what not. God is the one that did the cloning/g/b engineering. As such, only God should be allowed to do this.</p>
              <p>For human to do the same task as God will infringing on the realm of God. We are attempting to make ourselves equal, or better than God.</p>
              <p><strong>So, the Christians ARE arguinging that cloning is an old technology (if you're calling it technology, perhaps it's magic, in Christian view?)</strong> but it is God's sole right.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I'm very much FOR g/b engineering. I believe that it is truly the only way for human to progress.</p>
              <p>Imagine this : If scientists discovers how to genetically engineer a being to be smarter than themselves (even if it's just marginally) then this new....human, will grow up and discover a better way of genetically engineering the next subject to be even smarter. This is known as technological singularity (further reading : <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity</a>)</p>
              <p>So, in the end, you will have a being that is, by all means, omniscient. If this being decides to judge us Old Humans, well, then most religions' idea of apocalypese will come true, isn't it? A being that is as powerful as God will look at us and, based on how we have done, judge us and decide if we will live or die.</p>

              <p>Eh? You sure it's call magic? Christians don't term it as magic. Magic to them or rather to some overly C... is evil, dark art and weaved only by the devil. So God don't use magic. It's call   M I R A C L E or work of nature by God's hand.</p>

              <p><br>Ah, yes. Wrong word. It is indeed.....'miracle'.</p>
              <p>Also, I think the Bible is a load of baloney as well. Well, not all. I believe Jesus existed and, for his time, was a wise man with great insight. Just saying.</p>
