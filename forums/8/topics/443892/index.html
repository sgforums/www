              <p>Depends on the age group. The ah ma, ah pek, they cannot speak any mandarin whatsoever. They only know their mother tongue dialects.</p>
              <p>Next generation who went to chinese schools, this group is the most fluent in usage of mandarin.</p>
              <p>Next generation who attended the half fuck english schools, some are good in mandarin but poor in english, some good in english but poor in mandarin, others both half fuck or singlish.</p>
              <p>Then you have the latest bananas, chinese who doesn't know mother tongue dialect or mandarin.</p>
              <p>Basically, the dominant language in this country is english not mandarin, so mandarin is not used officially or used in written form. Under such a system where people seldom use mandarin in written form, but use another alien language, there is a tendency for fluency of mandarin to decline.</p>

              <p>I propose after Lee Kuan Yew dies, change dominant language to mandarin and malay.</p>
              <p>This sick joke of 75% chinese but have to use alien and colonial language must end, before the local cultures are destroyed.</p>
              <p>But I don't know whether the peranakans in Singapore will support or oppose.</p>

              <p>Lee Kuan Yew is peranakan.</p>
              <p>Mandarin is not the mother tongue of peranakans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although the sinkeh dominated Singapore's population, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">it was the babas who dominated public decision-making.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In effect, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a baba minority captured sinkeh Singapore</span></strong>, and that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">minority's attitudes were more those of Victorian England</span></span></strong> than China.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was the babas who were the framers of Singapore's rules and institutions. Many of Singapore's most prominent Chinese have had baba backgrounds. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee Kuan Yew, who became prime minister of Singapore aged just 35, is the most obvious example.</span></span></strong> He claims a Hakka heritage, although his upbringing was that of a baba: at home, he spoke English with his parents and baba Malay to his grandparents. "Mandarin was totally alien to me and unconnected with my life," Lee said of his childhood.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Lee, Chineseness was an acquired skill and later a political necessity. He was not brought up as a Chinese with a focus on China, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">but as a baba who looked to England.</span></span></strong> He followed the conventional career path of a baba and went to London to study law. And so Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore became <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Harry Lee of Fitzwilliam College,</span></span></strong> Cambridge. His father had given him and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">two of his brothers English, as well as Chinese, names</span></span></strong>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did Lee run Singapore as a piece of Asia mired in Chinese ways?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He ran it in a manner to which a British colonial administrator would have aspired.</span></span></strong></p>

              <p>90% of what you write in school is in english, only 10% is in mandarin, so there appeared your problem.</p>
              <p>If 90% mandarin, 10% english, your problem will disappear.</p>

              <p>The problem is a systemic problem. </p>
              <p>Singaporeans go to half fuck schools. The end result will be half fuck. </p>
              <p>This is natural and has nothing whatsoever to do with the students.</p>
              <p>This irrational problem can only be resolved after Lee Kuan Yew is dead.</p>
              <p>Actually in the first place neither mandarin or english is the mother tongue of chinese singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Problem is their mother tongue dialects are also suppressed.</p>
              <p>The main troublemaker and instigator of all these language problems is Harry Lee Kuan Yew. Due to his insecurities and political agendas, he has been messing around with the languages of local Singaporeans for decades.</p>
              <p>The no.1 bastard in messing up local languages is Harry Lee Kuan Yew. I don't think anyone can really dispute that.</p>

              <p>Learning of an language is an individual thing.</p>
              <p>If the TS is looking for excuse on not investing effort in learning mandarin, it is just a lazy excuse of "the rest of singaporean are also lousy in mandarin".</p>
              <p>If TS is successful in his attempt, he can write a book to show the rest of singaporean on how he did it and make some money.</p>
              <p>As for the great old man, it does not matter whether he is alive or not.</p>
              <p>The cracks have already started in one of his first world class company.</p>
              <p>This is definitely not a "isolated" incidents and more worms will come out of the rest of his first world companies.</p>

              <p>Lee Kuan Yew is peranakan.</p>
              <p>Mandarin is not the mother tongue of peranakans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although the sinkeh dominated Singapore's
              population, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">it was the babas who dominated public
              decision-making.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In effect, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a baba minority captured sinkeh
              Singapore</span></strong>, and that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">minority's attitudes were more those of Victorian
              England</span></span></strong> than China.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was the babas who were the framers of Singapore's rules and
              institutions. Many of Singapore's most prominent Chinese have had
              baba backgrounds. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee
              Kuan Yew, who became prime minister of Singapore aged just 35, is
              the most obvious example.</span></span></strong> He claims a
              Hakka heritage, although his upbringing was that of a baba: at
              home, he spoke English with his parents and baba Malay to his
              grandparents. "Mandarin was totally alien to me and unconnected
              with my life," Lee said of his childhood.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Lee, Chineseness was an acquired skill and later a political
              necessity. He was not brought up as a Chinese with a focus on
              China, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">but as
              a baba who looked to England.</span></span></strong> He
              followed the conventional career path of a baba and went to London
              to study law. And so Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore
              became <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Harry
              Lee of Fitzwilliam College,</span></span></strong> Cambridge.
              His father had given him and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">two of
              his brothers English, as well as Chinese,
              names</span></span></strong>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did Lee run Singapore as a piece of Asia mired in Chinese
              ways?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He ran
              it in a manner to which a British colonial administrator would have
              aspired.</span></span></strong></p>
