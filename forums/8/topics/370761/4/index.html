              <p>huh??? i got no interest in bollywood stuff, and so far, usually
              when meeting my frens and chat around, we dunno who they are, but
              just make fun of them just like  someone act or
              dance funny, we will ask "u from bolloywood
              ar..hehhehehe". I  still think bollywood belongs to the
              indians, i respect that, but at the international  scene, it
              is not very appealing, tho they booast alots, u understand indians
              ya.</p>

              <p>And of all the stars and movies, my indian girl frens also
              told me all inside very corrupted. Old directors sex with young
              actresses like above and so on..and a slam dog millionaires beat

              <p>Eh how old are you ah? You sound like a typical frog in the well kinda ignorant person. I shall try to help you and open your eyes. In Singapore, there is a stigma associated with Bollywood. The people think that its all colorful and dancing around coconut trees. To some extent this was indeed true in the late 70s and more towards the South Indian movies. However things now have changed but the Singaporean people refuse to change and accept this. They are still unfortunately stuck with the stereotypical view of the Indian movies and missing out some of the best entertainment deals the world has seen in a long time.</p>
              <p>You think they are not famous? U do not know them doesn't mean they are not famous la. Get your facts right. You do not know them because you can't really be bothered about whats happening globally and you probably do not even read the newspapers or online publications. You are just being happy and jolly by living inside your own shell which has people with similar thinking.</p>

              <p>Ah.. you made a mistake stating that we think aryans are the best gene. apparently you do not know about dravidians. They are the darker people. Yet some of the most brilliant people. They are very well known for being smart. If you had to university, you would have seen most of your professors were indians. But, no offense, the way you speaking full of insensitiveness, it seems like u could do with a quick lesson on being well informed and in touch with the world.</p>
              <p>And u generalise by saying bollywood is not to "us". U r speakingo n behalf of who exactly my dear friend? I don't think Singaporeans have elected you to be their spokesperson lol.. Maybe your group of friends who have a similar mindset as you la..</p>
