              <p>i feel sorry for the non indians because they are missing out on many entertainment good stuff from India.</p>
              <p>one is AR Rahman's music. Its  a joy and privilege to listen to his music, Such hits like lagaan, Dil Se, ect</p>
              <p>If u listened to his songs before, u will discover that they have nice rhythms and sound effects..</p>
              <p>But the world got to listen to some of his stuff which has been remade into English songs like Shakalakka Baby.</p>
              <p>Another one u all are missing are movies from directors like Shankar and Maniratnam. Google their movies in youtube</p>

              <p>The "Chand Shifarish" song from "Fanaa" is many times played in Malay weddings.

              <p>I think I got the matching vid and sub! Still downloading the

              <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="icon_surprised.gif"> Man.. a bollywood trait is that the actors
              must also be able to dance. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>The "Chand Shifarish" song from "Fanaa" is many times played in
              Malay weddings. Funny to me because either the people seem
              oblivious or don't care that the song starts off recommending
              pre-marital sex. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Damn beautiful song. I even have the music
              vid in my psp. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I like "Mann" for an Aamir Khan movie. What movies you recommend
              ah. The latest I've watched is "Rock On!!". Disappointed slightly
              with it because it's not really rock, it's more pop than rock.</p>
