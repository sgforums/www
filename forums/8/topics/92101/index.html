            <div class='col-md body'>i understand how you feel, BestAgt. Sometimes, fate is like that.<br><br>Someone mentioned earlier that some people lead good lives, and some lead hard lives. It's karma, we just learn to accept it. There might have been things that happened in the past that you dunno about. Whatever it is, it dont matter now.<br><br>You mentioned that your grandma seemed happy even when she was not treated well by her sons. It could be that she had accepted her karma, and she's a tough old lady that would not let even that get her down. You should be proud that you had such a strong woman as your grandma.<br><br>If her apparent happiness was a front she put on when you were with her, then it was because she did not want you to feel sad as well. I think your grandma loved you. And if you love her, then her life meant something. It was not in vain. Cherish her memory, and she lives on in your heart. Okay?<br><br>Some people lead good lives, and some lead hard lives. It's impossible to assign some percentage of blame to one person, another percentage to someone else. Let it go. People say, ashes to ashes, dust to dust... let bygones be bygones.<br><br>I hope you've gained some knowledge from this. In life, we must treasure all the time we have with the people we love. Let them know you care. Let them know, because, why not? Your grandma will be happy if she knew you cared.</div>
