            <div class='col-md body'>Stress is something that we can't really avoid, it comes to u once in a while. How often &amp; how badly stress out will depends on how well the individual react to counter it. To a certain degree, u can actually relieve &amp; handle it well. It's all in the state of the mind. Sometimes it's not whether u can or cannot, it's more of the want or don't want to. Things u can try to do:<br><br>Listen to your favorite music, sing along to the tune,it will takes your mind off.<br><br>Talk to somebody, just anybody care to listen, to get it off your chest.<br><br>Go to a crowded place, better still go to a happy place &amp; watch the people goes by. Watch their moves &amp; it will make u smile.<br><br>Go to the new shooting gallery &amp; shoot all u want. You've conquered them.<br><br>Of coz, the best of all, if u can master it(it's not gonna be easy), is to learn to handle your emotions, reactions etc &amp; take things easy, relax, not to over-react, easy-going, smile &amp; be happy, stay contented etc but at the same time not to discard responsibilities. Life is to wonderful to waste your time getting stress out. Fight it &amp; remember, u only live once &amp; nobody is perfect. Everybody, do what u're doing, smile will bring a sunshine day.</div>
