            <div class='col-md body'>hi lexelle,<br><br>first let me apologize for putting your in the embarrassing position of having to turn me down on sending me pacman's picture, it was underhanded of me, i should have asked him for it myself. and thanks for declining, if not, i think it would have ruined things between you.<br><br>no mood to yoohoo for him today, if he sees this and decides to email me his pictures, great [er, what if he turns out ugly like sin, then hor, i'll be more depressed leh   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">], if he doesn't see it and doesn't send his pictures, then it doesn't matter.<br><br>you know, almost everyone in the family knows when to leave me alone when i start raising my voice and showing my "beautiful" face, but no, not her, she must have the last word (er, possible meh?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> jokes asides, i've held on to my temper and keep the hurts she has caused me over the past few months at bay, but no, she had to go on and on and on yesterday, until i can't stand it anymore and i just blew up). i admit i was at fault too, but you don't have a sister like mine, she takes the cake, i've nicknamed her the stray last night because she is SO different from the rest of the siblings that it's hard to believe we share the same parents.<br><br>i think what i dislike most is the guilt associated with the bad behaviour i personally displayed in the quarrels even though i was greatly provoked, trust me, i was greatly, greatly provoked. in real life, my tolerance for crap by the people i love far exceed my penchant for flaming in the forums.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> but then again hor, i may be wrong. hehehe ...<br><br>ah well, i am not going waste any more precious time to think about her any more and thanks for sharing.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 13 September 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi all,<br><br>thanks for the comments and advice.<br><br>i think the key to holding on to our temper also depends on the other party on not continually provoking us when we shows signs of wanting the quarrel to end by being quiet for a while and they have to learn to back off when we back off. wanting to have the last word is so destructive, maybe i just don't love her enough or maybe i've been too hurt to care anymore. but i care enough for myself that i want to change, i know i've a short fuse, i just didn't know how short.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>thanks everybody and well, if any of you have anymore ways of keeping anger in check, please share. er, counting to ten never works for me, walking away doesn't seem to work as their words will still float across the room, why can't they just keep quiet?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>and i apologize for not addressing each and every reply.<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 12 September 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Colette,<br><br>One of the ways which I used to vent out my anger in my college and uni days, is to walk to the squash court alone, and lock myself there, and just played squash till I dropped, running and hitting for every single ball without caring how tired I am, or run a long distance to be released of the anger.<br><br>Nowadays, I just take a long walk out there, and just let myself cool down. When I am angry with something, I will try to keep quiet by saying "Nevermind, forget it" so that my anger would not be released to anyone.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>colette,<br><br>I try not to get mad at people and when I do, I clamp down on it hard because I am afraid I will say some very mean things and no way I am going to apologize afterwards, I know myself as much.  However, when I really do get mad, I have difficulty controlling the anger or channeling it elsewhere.  It is like this black, hot thing that's corroding my skin from the inside and I am convinced that it is doing me more harm than the people I am mad with.<br><br>I wonder if I don't clamp down on my anger everytime it arises maybe I will have more practice at being angry.  Then I can be angry ...elegantly, shall I say?  When the black cloud come, just say what's on my mind, don't mind if you rough the other person a bit.  The one time I tried it I found the anger passed quite quickly.  Beside, once people know you as the tell-it-to-their-face kinda gal, their tolerance for your fits become higher.</div>

You should think about yourself too. I know that when you are family, words seems harder to say sometimes.
