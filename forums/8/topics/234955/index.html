            <div class='col-md body'>May i know how you guys feel towards the importance of school image.<br>Or rather, how impt school image is to the school.<br><br>I open my school handbook. Look at the rules in it.<br>80% of them has to do with the image of the school.<br>And now its getting absurb like.<br>GG to the school.<br><br>And recently my school has just enforced this "i dunnoe where it came from" rule.<br>"You cant wear slippers when you are wearing ur school uniform, even if you are outside of school" eg shopping, on your way home after school.<br>Cause it like some of the people in my school have been wearing slippers after they leave the school. Cause school shoes can get un-comfortable at times.<br>And now with this rule. IMO its total bullshit. I dont consider it morally wrong.<br>I do understand that in school. There is a need to have rules. But outside of the school? All this rules just clearly shows how much schools nowdays are trying to defend the "school image"<br><br>Now there are rules like.<br>"No wearing of ear studs/rings for guys"<br>"If you are caught tucking out your shirt outside/inside the school more then 4times you will be canned"<br>"We must look neat tidy presentable in our uniform at all times"<br><br>I am not the kind of ahbeng that got long hair, got ear studs. And tuck out of shirt act paikia. I complain simply for the sake that IMO school is defending their school image too much.<br><br>Views and opinions people. Thanks</div>
