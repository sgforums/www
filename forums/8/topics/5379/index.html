(That's thinking rationally of course...)<br><br>So to answer your qn, I think type 2 would be the one I'll 'prefer'... the looks shouldn't matter too much... as long as she's pleasant-looking....<br>But quite hard (maybe juz for me) to find anyone who can talk about everything with me...<br><br>I suppose u think you're Type 2?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

To show off to others that u got a good looking gf?<br><br>In addition, attitude is very essential.  When I was young in my teens and early twenties, I was trying to go for only good looking girls.  I guess at that time with my age, like most other guys, I was thinking with my penis; not my head.  I thought looks is the most important thing.  After chasing three good looking girls with tremendous lousy attitude which totally turned me right off, I realized that from there onwards look is not everything.<br><br>As I grow older and am getting married soon, I guess I am thinking more with my head than with my penis.  If I were to choose a girl (in my next life?), I would place personality as the no. 1 trait and brain as the no.2 trait in priority I would be looking for.  Of course, looks does count too.  But, it would definitely not be the no. 1 trait that I would be looking for.  Of course, it would sure be nice to have a gf with all those three traits (personality, brain and beauty). But then again, how many times do u see that kind of thing happens.  Where got?  Rarely!<br><br>From what I wrote, you can pretty much guess what type of girl my future wife belongs to.<br><br>Oh!

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that deep down inside all guys will always be choosing 1. Imagine how the guys will feel when other ppl commented how beautiful their gf is. But for a long-lasting relationship, having someone whom you can communicate with is the most important. If I just want people to comment how pretty my gf is (I am single now), I might just as well get a beautiful house and let ppl comment on that. At least the house serve a purpose. I am not saying that all beautiful gals are like that, only some who have let pride and ego get into their heads are. It takes time to understand someone, no-one can do that if there is no communication. Which is why gals who are your great friends and whom you dun feel any liking feelings in the first place always last the longest when you finally realised that she is the one. Having a beautiful gf is not all good, you always have to worry about the hordes of guys always wooing her or someday she will leave you for someone better. Although I would like the best of both worlds but I guess finding a diamond mine in Singapore is easier. One thing I found out in my past relationships, the gal whom you can communicate and love actually become the most beautiful gal in your eyes. Like what they always say, Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To me, having a beautiful gf is like soaking in a tub of hot water. The sensation is quite good. But after a while, it gets cold. Having an average looking gf is like taking a hot shower. It is not as nice as soaking in a hot tub, but then the water will remain warm.<br><br>Like all the people who posted their views here, I think I'd go with 2. Communication is very important. If you can't talk, I don't see the point of being together.</div>
