(e.g u too good amry even in yr reservist time want to send u for sniper cause but need to check your medical backgound while in service). yr future employer has no reason to request for that record of yours in the army unless your job has some relation to the force. employers conduct separate medical full screening checkups if need to in the private sector. if u hav mental illness u won't serve in the first place. as there are always pressure in the force, councilling will be conducted for those feeling pressurised or depressed but dun 'keng' coz if u r a nut case they will go all the way to prove it true...all in all u still have to serve...even ah gua serve in the army as clerks u know?<br><br>c9 or k9? u will know wen the day comes for u to serve...the army can giv u 100 good reason to serve an extra year and 100 good reason that u need not serve...it depends on the revised policy at the moment and the planning by the activities of the unit by the S3 or the utilization of manpower by the S1 haha.<br><br>if u r a performer better make sure u are a real big one with paperwork aplenty to support. once u are called up and have to book in to camp...sorru even god's law dun apply there...too long like lion's mane the guard/ BOSS can stop u from entering the camp unless u get a proper haircut or they send u straight to the barber from a trim paid from yyour own pockets.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
