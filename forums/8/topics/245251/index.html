            <div class='col-md body'>well, how's this for a story?<br><br>we were made to go to a "boot camp" for service training... (i'm sure a lot of people know what i'm talking about) and it was bloody expensive!<br><br>due to recall manning, i was delayed and went with people who were not from my organisation...<br><br>the trainers kept harping on "delighting the customers" and "going the extra mile" and all that...<br><br>i countered.. asking if we should delight EVERY customer (yes) and we should keep going the extra mile for each one (yes)<br><br>then i dropped it on them.. so, we train all the customers to expect better than necessary service and we go out of our way to serve them all.. in the meantime, the staff is doing a LOT of things, cutting into their margin, wasting time doing unnecessary things for customers... ultimately, the customer will expect that and anything less will not be delightful anymore.. the extra mile becomes the expected...<br><br>if you step down back to your normal service, the customers will not be happy... and you will LOSE that customer.. and worse, your people will not be happy being made to do all these things while the performance and productivity drops...<br><br>give them sufficient friendly service.. be professional.. and that's enough!!<br><br>they don't expect you delight them.. they're happy enough to be served efficiently.. that's what you do!!<br><br>the trainers were not happy, and LAPSED.. they started being terrible to us as the class started to rebel and question all the "delight" they tried to teach us... ultimately, the whole class rejected their teachings and said that to be polite, professional and efficient is the best service to their customers...<br><br>a couple of them actually said they would recommend their organisation never send anyone to the class again...<br><br>that's Singapore Customer Service in a nutshell..<br><br>those who usually teach it, don't know what the hell it truly is.. they teach stupid sycophancy... and all we want is polite professionalism..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow i also have this to share<br><br>i had to go to this service workshop (waiter that time)<br><br>den they taught us their way of service<br><br>but some of the things they taught dun make sense<br><br>for example opening of menu<br>i told them if we open the menu for them, the menu will just flip back coz its those soft cover one, unless the customer hold down the menu<br><br>so its not feasible unless ur menu is hard-cover one<br><br>another is shouting of greeting, i told them we are not a coffee shop. or jap restaurant, aniway i feel this is rude to shout hello, or goodbye when u are a mile away from the customer<br><br>u noe wad the trainer say<br><br>WE PAY U TO DO THIS, so Just follow our rules<br><br>i was so embrassed<br><br>damm<br><br>typical ppl cannot accept criticism one</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah.<br>I did a sale and it was suppose to be sent to the customer's place next week, but my company forgotten all about it.<br>I took a cab and sent it over myself at around 8.30 P.M. My time was supposed to be up at 9 P.M. but since its our fault i sent it over. The ang mor was really good. After i taught him all the functions, he offered me dinner and 100 bucks as a thank you, but i was feeling too paiseh to accept. We were late!<br><br>The worst was, i was standing at my counter trying to do demo of my espresso machine. A chinese male came over and expressed his interest. I did my best telling him everything and made a cup of latte for him. He went off. Thats ok. 5 mins later, his whole family came for coffee.</div>
