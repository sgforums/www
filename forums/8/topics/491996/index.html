              <p class="first" style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">The proliferation of the internet has been one of the great technological advancements of the 21<sup style="vertical-align: super;">st</sup>century. It has improved the flow of information across the globe, transformed the way communication is done between people, and change businesses in ways that we have never imagined.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">Yet, there are always people around the world that find ways of abusing something that was originally meant to be good. In recent years, internet scams have started to become more common across the world. People in Singapore have not been spared.</p>
              <h3 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 14.04px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 22.464px;"><strong>Why Use The Internet?</strong></h3>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">There are many reasons why the internet makes sense for scammers. Similar to other legitimate businesses that are based online, the internet allows scams to be operated cheaply (you just need a website and a Facebook page), quickly, and anonymously. The best part is that scammers can even scam people anywhere across the world, while enjoying their mojito at some beach in the middle of nowhere.</p>
              <h3 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 14.04px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 22.464px;"><strong>Ways People Are Scam On Different Platform</strong></h3>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">People are scammed all the time across different online channels. The good thing about most scams (not all though) is that scammers are generally not that creative, and would typically prefer to spend their efforts using tried and tested methods. An example would be all the gold buyback scams that have been operating in Singapore for so many years.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">The bad thing about these online scams is that most of them are already tried and tested elsewhere. And they are brought in to Singapore because they work well elsewhere.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">Here are some common online scams to take note of.</p>
              <h3 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 14.04px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 22.464px;"><strong>Working From Home “Job”</strong></h3>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">The idea of having a job that provides you with flexible working hours while working from home is an extremely appealing one. Not surprisingly, scammers have started to pounce on this common desire that so many people have.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">Basically, what they do is advertise on online job portals about possible job openings. This is a neat idea, since they are getting people to apply for these “jobs” rather than to get a salesman to do the scamming. There is little or no cost involved.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">What happens thereafter is basically a ponzi scheme. You pay to get included as part of this <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">scheme</span>scam and you get paid when you invite more people to the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">scheme</span> scam. So yes, the job is flexible and you can indeed work from anywhere. But there is no job whatsoever, unless you consider scamming other people as a job.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">This article from <a style="color: #005790;" href="https://vulcanpost.com/569681/malaysian-expose-job-ad-scam/">Vulcan Post reports it nicely</a>. It is based on a Malaysia operation but there is a great chance that it is merely a matter of time before this appears in Singapore, if it hasn’t already been taking place.</p>
              <h3 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 14.04px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 22.464px;"><strong>Carousell Scam</strong></h3>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">Carousell is a great platform for anyone looking to sell his or her 2<sup style="vertical-align: super;">nd </sup>hand items.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">Scammers started realizing they could easily make a quick buck or two simply by posing as buyers. What they do is pretend to have made a bank transfer to buy your product (usually an expensive product). Subsequently, they will claim there was an overcharge on their account and that a refund would first have to be made from you to them before the bank releases the balance to you.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">If you make the transfer to them, you will never be seeing your money again.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">A lady in Singapore shared her experience on this. You can <a style="color: #005790;" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153876407131055&amp;set=pcb.10153876407371055&amp;type=3&amp;theater">read her Facebook Post here</a>.</p>
              <h3 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 14.04px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 22.464px;"><strong>Online Facebook Contest</strong></h3>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">This is a scam that steals your social media network, rather than your money. Many people fall for it all the time because they do not think it costs them anything.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">Basically what happens here is that some fraudster would start a Facebook page posing as a big brand and run an online contest with a giveaway that is too good to be true. We have seen giveaways that include Playstation 4, free air tickets on Emirates and most recently, the giving away of Range Rover cars in Singapore.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">These scams work very well with the respective pages gaining thousands of “like” in a matter of a few days. And in case you are wondering, no, these scammers didn’t respect Singaporeans and our social media discernment enough to create a new scam by themselves, <a style="color: #005790;" href="http://www.hoax-slayer.net/2016-version-of-free-range-rover-facebook-scam-spreading-rapidly/">they simply copied what already worked overseas.</a> Seems like we are a pretty naïve bunch of people on social media.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">The thing about these Facebook contests is that even though it cost you technically nothing from a financial point of view to take part, “liking” the contest and “sharing” it on your Facebook page opens up the rest of the people in your social network to the same scam. You are in other words, a brand ambassador of this Facebook scam.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">So spend a little effort to think about what you are actually “liking” and “sharing” on Facebook.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14.04px; line-height: 22.464px;">What are some other online scams that you encountered? <a style="color: #005790;" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/538229993008898/">Join this open Facebook Page</a> to share with the rest of Singapore scams that you know of.</p>
