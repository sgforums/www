            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I'm new to this religion thing, so I hope those who have knowledge in this matter can help me out. Firstly, I want to be a Catholic. I'm not really sure why but it's because my first exposure to Chrisitnaity and the Church was through a Catholic firned. So Maybe that's why I am influenced by him. Secondly, I've been to the Church I've been frequenting (without my parents knowledge, cause they are Buddhists) and asked about baptism and the person told me that I have to attend Sunday classes first before being baptised. Is there any way to get around this? I mean, infants are baptised without having to go for classes and i don't really see the difference between the baptism between an infant and an adult. Thanks for all the help.</div>

Thanks for all the help.</div></blockquote>It is important and necessary you attend class before baptism, believe me this will do you good, no harm!  The church has the responsibility to make sure those who are baptised in the church understand the fundamental, and what is expected of Catholics.  For infant baptism, defiinitely babies are not required to attend any class, and parents are expected to do their part to bring up the kids the way expected of Catholics or Christians.<br><br>Hey, think this topic is best posted in the religion forum.  There is one forum for Catholics.  If you post it there, the catholics will be able to give you more advise and help you.</div>

Then they go through the rights of confermation.<br><br>Just join the RCIA class and they will guide you through.<br><br>Good luck and God bless.</div>
