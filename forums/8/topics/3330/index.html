            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Aries<br><br>ARIES AND ARIES<br>Both enter with the intent of dominating the scenario. A passionate affair, but neither is content with playing the smaller role. The Aries female tends to dominate (generally because domineering females have to try harder to get their way than domineering males). However, there will be fierce competition to be number one. Eventually, the flare-ups and heavy cannonading take their toll in the bedroom, and what starts out so promisingly ends in disharmony. The situation dictates that both need their own careers or directions independent of one another for this to work. When their energies are diverted into other areas, conflict between the two becomes a bit more playful and less destructive.<br><br>ARIES AND TAURUS<br>Both are highly sensual, but Aries may be annoyed by the deliberate pace and unimaginative lovemaking of Taurus. Taurus is a homebody, while Aries is definitely not. Aries is impulsive, and looks for new experiences and freedom. Taurus is possessive and jealous, set in its ways, and views Aires's need to be an individual as a rejection. Taurus is good at making money but Aries is even better at spending it. The long haul can be hard going, though if they hang on long enough Aries will come to appreciate Taurus's steadiness and dependability.<br><br>ARIES AND GEMINI<br>They won't bore each other because both love to talk. (It's a close contest, but Gemini will probably win.) And they share a special compatibility, for Gemini is as restless and anxious to try new things as Aries is. There are no inhibitions on either side. Gemini is clever enough to counter Aires's need to dominate. Gemini may seek extra stimulation, but is discreet about it. Both minds mesh well; Aries is dynamic and intelligent, Gemini is versatile and ingenious. Aries is likely to be the leader sexually, and Gemini delights in thinking up variations to keep Aires's interest at a peak. The signals are definitely go.<br><br>ARIES AND CANCER<br>These two are fascinated with each other at the beginning, but sexual attraction fades in the face of many temperamental differences. Aries leaps without looking; Cancer is cautious. Cancer loves hearth and home; Aries hates being tied down. Resentments build up and they argue over trifles. Aries has a sharp tongue that wounds vulnerable Cancer. The more aggressive Aries is, the more defensive Cancer becomes. There's too little compatibility to work with. When Cancer starts to nag, Aries looks for the way out.<br><br>ARIES AND LEO<br>Both have got egos to burn and both like to lead. Aggressive Aries wouldn't dream of taking second place, and kingly Leo needs constant admiration. Usually they can work it out by having Leo play the emperor and Aries play the general. The trick is for neither to take the other all that seriously. It's a fine combustible sexual match, for both are fiery and romantic. Aries is optimistic and open to fife; Leo is generous and good-hearted. If neither tries to deflate the other and if they can find room to compromise about who dominates whom this should be a happy mating.<br><br>ARIES AND VIRGO<br><br>Aires's boldness should intrigue shy, reserved Virgo for a time. But they have totally different ideas about what should happen in the bedroom and elsewhere. Aires's passions are impulsive and direct. Virgo's sexuality is more enigmatic and takes time to be revealed. In other areas Aries is full of exciting new plans and ideas, and insists on being boss. Virgo is critical and fussy, and likes things to be done the way Virgo wants. Virgo disapproves of Aires's extravagance; Aries thinks Virgo cold and carping. They end up making war, not love.<br><br>ARIES AND LIBRA<br>There is a powerful initial attraction between these two opposites, for in certain areas each supplies what the other lacks. For one, Aires's aggressiveness arouses Libra's sensual potential. Their love life may be unconventional. However, Libra really wants peace, quiet, and harmony -while Aries wants action and adventure. Both like social fife, entertaining, and pleasure, but both are restless in different ways. In time Libra will look for someone less demanding, and Aries will bind someone more adoring. Marvelous affair; poor marriage.<br><br>ARIES AND SCORPIO<br>Love can be a bonfire between these two. They're both physical, energetic, and passionate. Sexually, everything should be finite's the emotional side of the relationship they can't handle. Each has a forceful personality and wants to control the other. In the end, Scorpio's jealousy may prove the undoing. Aires's many outside interests make Scorpio feel insecure and that brings out Scorpio's tyrannical streak. Aries won't take orders and Scorpio will never take a back seat. This is an unstable partnership with a low ignition point.<br><br>ARIES AND SAGITTARIUS<br>Sagittarius is a perfect temperamental match for Aries. They are both active, spontaneous people who like socializing, have extravagant tastes in common, and enjoy the good life. There may be a little conflict because both are impulsive and brutally frank. Arguments can reach the boiling point. Aires's forceful sexual approach is not always playful Sagittarius's style. However, they have wonderful senses of humor and enjoy each other's company. If they make it in the bedroom, they'll make it everywhere else.<br><br>ARIES AND CAPRICORN<br>Aires's taste for innovation and experiment may not please conservative Capricorn. Aries is restless, fiery, impulsive; Capricorn is ordered, settled, practical. Capricorn needs to dominate and so does Aries. Problems also crop up over money Aries is extravagant, Capricorn is security minded. Aires's responsive sexual nature meets its match in Capricorn's deep-seated passions. And Capricorn's strength and endurance will in time win Aires's respect.<br><br>ARIES AND AQUARIUS<br>They're well suited temperamentally -both are active, ambitious, enjoy a wide range of interests, and are equally eager for sexual adventure. Depending on whim, Aquarius may or may not let Aries take the lead. Both are independent -- Aquarius even more than Aries and Aries may at times feel neglected. Aries finds the Aquarian unpredictability exciting, but also never feels entirely secure. However, with a bit of tact and understanding on both sides, this is a great affair that could turn into something even better.<br><br>ARIES AND PISCES<br>Aries will draw Pisces out of that shell, and in turn will be hypnotized by Pisces' seductive and mysterious sexuality. The boldness and confidence of Aries plus Pisces' intuitions and fantasies add up to an eventful union. Personality differences complement each other. Aries is self-assured and vivacious; Pisces is somewhat shy and easily led. Aries likes to be dominant, Pisces likes having someone to lean on. For a happy coupling this requires only a little more tact on Aries's part.<br><br>Taurus<br>TAURUS AND ARIES<br>Taurus is not as quick on the trigger as Aries, but both have a mutual interest in making love. Aries is emotional and Taurus ' Is sensual, and they're bound to have fun while the affair lasts. In time, though, Taurus's possessiveness will strike angry sparks from fiery Aries. They'll also argue about money-Taurus tends to be careful and conservative, Aries is reckless and a spendthrift. Aries's impulsiveness in making decisions annoys fixed Taurus, who dislikes a sudden change in routine. An affectionate affair can turn into a difficult marriage.<br><br>TAURUS AND TAURUS<br>This isn't the most exciting union ever, for both are domestic creatures who prefer safety to adventure. However, both share a fondness for money, are hardworking, loyal, and affectionate. She tends to be more sentimental than he, but each is as possessive as the other, which works out fine. Because they are both earthy and direct about sexual needs, there should be no problem in that department. Boredom is the threat. The perfect solution is for each to develop some outside hobbles and friends without raising the possessive hackles of the other.<br><br>TAURUS AND GEMINI<br>These two are completely unalike in temperament. Taurus is stolid, fixed in opinions, resistant to change. Gemini is flighty, restless, vacillating. But they may find each other intriguing for that very reason-for a little while. Gemini is attracted to Taurus's passions, but in time Taurus's instinct for security and stability will be offended by volatile Gemini. Taurus is too much a creature of habit to go along with Gemini &amp; the constant need for new stimulation. Eventually, Taurus's demands are simply too much for Gemini, who seeks escape.<br><br>TAURUS AND CANCER<br>They have a lot going for them. Both are home-lovers, sentimentalists, and highly sexed. Taurus's even-going, placid nature is a good antidote for Cancer's moodiness, though at times plain-spoken Taurus must be careful not to slight Cancer's feelings. Cancer needs someone like Taurus to depend on; Cancer gives Taurus the loyalty and feedback it needs. Taurus is ambitious for money and security, and Cancer has exactly those same goals. Similar interests and desires make for a harmonious mating.<br><br>TAURUS AND LEO<br>Leo demands constant praise and adulation, and is forever competing with Taurus. As a result, Taurus digs in its heels and gets more sullen with each passing day. Taurus needs appreciation and Leo needs worship, but neither will get what it needs from the other. In addition, Leo is extravagant and Taurus parsimonious. There is a basic conflict between Taurus's desire for a well-ordered schedule and Leo's need for a larger-than-life existence. Sexually, these two are well matched, but Leo thinks life is a circus and tries to perform in all three rings at once. Taurus finds that hard to take, or even to watch.<br><br>TAURUS AND VIRGO<br>It's love at first sight- Both are homebodies and they share the same intellectual pursuits. Taurus's tenacity and Virgo's sharp mind are a good combination for success as a team. And Taurus keeps a careful eye on expenditures, which pleases thrifty Virgo. Although they lack what might be called a spontaneous approach to life, neither puts a high value on that. They may have to adjust sexually, for Taurus is more physical. However, Taurus will probably waken Virgo's sleeping passions. And they have everything else in common.<br><br>TAURUS AND LIBRA<br>Taurus finds Libra a warm, romantic, vibrant partner. Libra was born to charm and titillate. Steady Taurus balances Libra's indecisiveness. Money may be a problem, for Libra doesn't share Taurus's reverential attitude toward a dollar, but both tend to be acquisitive and like to collect beautiful things. Both signs are ruled by Venus and have sensual natures, but each expresses this quality differently. In time, Libra's fickleness and casual air toward love can drive Taurus wild; and Libra will certainly resent Taurus's possessiveness. This romantic pairing may not last long.<br><br>TAURUS AND SCORPIO<br>These two are opposites in the zodiac, but they have more in common than other opposites. Both are determined and ambitious, and neither is much of a rover. However, there are two strong wills at work here. Taurus's passionate sexual nature meets more than its match in Scorpio-in fact, the sexual element in this affair borders on the obsessive. But Scorpio's overbearing, possessive, jealous nature makes Taurus simmer with resentment. This is a tempestuous affair, and neither has the tolerance to make the union last.<br><br>TAURUS AND SAGITTARIUS<br>This might work if Taurus can tie a string to Sagittarius's kite and hold on tight. They are attracted to each other physically, for Taurus's passions are ignited by Sagittarius's uninhibited lovemaking. But Taurus finds it difficult to deal with Sagittarius's roving eye and search for novelty. Sagittarius has an easy live-and-let live attitude about sex and everything else, whereas Taurus is both serious and possessive. Sagittarius refuses to stay under someone else's thumb. No dull moments-but a good deal of quarreling. An affair can be fun.<br><br>TAURUS AND CAPRICORN<br>Capricorn is a strong match for Taurus, for they both have passions that are straightforward and uncomplicated. There won't be much romance but plenty of healthy. sex. They share the same goals and like the same kinds of friends, and both are fond of security and ~m-o-n-e-y. Capricorn is a bit more secretive than Taurus would like, but all the same Capricorn's loyalty makes Taurus feel secure. And Taurus is charmed by Capricorn's unexpected sense of humor. Auguries for the long term are promising.<br><br>TAURUS AND AQUARIUS<br>Neither is likely to approve of the other. Taurus is conservative, careful, closemouthed. Aquarius is unconventional, innovative, and vivacious. Taurus is lusty and passionate, while Aquarius operates on a mental plane. Taurus finds it hard to keep Aquarius at home or satisfied with the delights of domesticity. Aquarius looks for openness and self-expression in a relationship, while Taurus needs security and comfort. Aquarius, a fancy-free loner who resents ties that bind, sooner or later slips away from possessive Taurus.<br><br>TAURUS AND PISCES<br>Pisces may not altogether understand Taurus's materialistic approach to life. But the dependability of Taurus supplies the anchor Pisces needs to keep from drifting away into a private sea of fantasy. Hard-working Taurus sets a good example for lazy Pisces. Also, Taurus's practical, easygoing nature helps Pisces through its frequent changes of mood. In love, Taurus is devoted and Pisces is adoring. Though Pisces can be a little fey for Taurus, they're well suited sexually. Taurus is passionate, Pisces is sensual, and what's wrong with that?<br><br>Germini<br>GEMINI AND ARIES<br>This lively, energetic pair can be good friends as well as good lovers. They thrive on activity, adventure, and variety; enjoy each other's humor; and like social life. Aries will probably make the decisions because Gemini has difficulty in that area. There will be bedroom high jinx, for both are enthusiastic about sex. Aries' domineering streak will give Gemini the firm direction it needs-and Gemini's occasional wanderings from the straight and narrow will keep Aries on its toes.<br><br>GEMINI AND TAURUS<br>An unpromising match, though at the beginning Taurus responds to Gemini's sparkle and Gemini is intrigued by Taurus's uncomplicated directness. But Taurus wants life to be stable and ordered, while Gemini is easily bored and looks for new experiences. Taurus is devoted to home sweet home while Gemini follows the lure of the open road. Gemini finds Taurus's lovemaking a bit on the dull side, and also resents the restrictive net Taurus tries to construct. In turn, jealous, possessive Taurus can't handle Gemini's outside dalliances. Passions cool.<br><br>GEMINI AND GEMINI<br>You won't find a more versatile, charming, or vivacious pair. These two will never bore each other, for they are interested in everything. The pace is frenetic, but neither would dream of slowing down. They are fascinating conversationalists, have tons of friends, and together they'll throw some marvelous parties. Sex is fun and games. But this couple is also superficial, unstable, and very restless. When they move out of the bedroom, everything becomes too chaotic even for twin Gemini's.<br><br>GEMINI AND CANCER<br>Passionate Cancer fulfills Gemini's physical needs, and Gemini's cheerfulness brightens Cancer's disposition. But all too soon Gemini's tendency to play at love wounds oversensitive Cancer. Flirtatious Gemini makes Cancer feel very insecure and an affair is likely to be volatile. These two have too little in common for a long term relationship. Cancer needs security and domesticity; Gemini loathes being tied down. Gemini hasn't any patience with Cancer's moodiness, and Gemini's sharp tongue Is too biting for Cancer's fragile ego. They are doomed to a downhill run.<br><br>GEMINI AND LEO<br>An affectionate pair who really enjoy each other. Gemini's amorous playfulness finds a responsive partner in eager, extroverted Leo. Leo's self-confidence blinks at Gemini's flirtations with others. Gemini's penchant for ridicule can annoy regal Leo, though, and Leo will probably demand more adoration than Gemini is willing to give. Socially, each tries to upstage the other, but they have a lot of fun together doing it. They both love to laugh, and in bed they set off sparks. What more can they ask?<br><br>GEMINI AND VIRGO<br>Both are Mercury ruled and have a mental approach to life. But similarity ends there; these two are star-crossed from the beginning. Virgo considers Gemini scatterbrained and immature. Gemini thinks of Virgo as a stick-in-the-mud and a bore. Virgo's analytical approach seems like indifference to Gemini. Virgo looks on Gemini's busy social life as superficial and a waste of time. Virgo is critical; Gemini is tactless. Passions run on a low thermostat; their sex life soon turns chilly. Gemini's eye is certain to rove.<br><br>GEMINI AND LIBRA<br>These two air signs are well suited intellectually and every other way. They are stimulating companions who will enjoy a lighthearted, lovely affair. Neither is combative and they're likely to agree on everything. They are affectionate, fun-loving, and like social life, entertaining, and travel. Sexually both are fervent, neither is jealous or demanding, and Libra goes along with Gemini's taste for experiment. Their one problem is that they both love to spend money. Otherwise, a perfect match.<br><br>GEMINI AND SCORPIO<br>Gemini's imagination and Scorpio's dynamism would make a good combination if only these two were able to get along together. There is combustion in the bedroom, but they soon find out that sex isn't everything. Scorpio is sensual, passionate, demanding, jealous, inflexible. Gemini is fickle, flighty, superficial, lighthearted, changeable. Gemini is a social creature, Scorpio likes privacy. Scorpio's suspicious nature is in constant turmoil over Gemini's casual attitude about love. It won't be long before enough becomes too much.<br><br>GEMINI AND SAGITTARIUS<br>These two are opposites in the zodiac and are attracted to each other like magnets. They'll especially enjoy each other's minds for both have wide-ranging and varied interests. Sagittarius tends to be more intellectual, Gemini more social. Both are too restless and argumentative, and both need freedom. They may be disappointed sexually, since neither is demonstrative-and Gemini is very quick to criticize. This affair probably began impulsively and will end the same way.<br><br>GEMINI AND CAPRICORN<br>Gemini's freewheeling, anything-goes attitude meets opposition from conventional, steady, conservative Capricorn. Capricorn worries about security, while Gemini frets about losing its liberty. Order and routine keep Capricorn content, but drive Gemini to distraction. Gemini's need for a stimulating existence does nothing to make Capricorn feel secure. And Capricorn's sober outlook puts a damper on Gemini's high spirits. This isn't an affair with high svoltage-but Gemini can help develop Capricorn's sensual potential.<br><br>GEMINI AND AQUARIUS<br>Versatile Gemini and innovative Aquarius get along famously. They share a taste for novelty, travel, meeting new people. Because both are unpredictable, things can't always go smoothly. But love keeps getting better, for Aquarius adores Gemini's wit and good cheer. If Gemini is somewhat inconstant or unstable, Aquarius understands. If the affair should end, they'll still remain friends. In marriage, these two are affectionate, devoted companions more than passionate lovers.<br><br>GEMINI AND PISCES<br>The passion quotient is high, and so are the problems. Emotional Pisces is too easily hurt by thoughtless Gemini. Gemini is mischievous and playful, but Pisces is sensitive and takes things to heart. Each practices deception in his or her own way: Gemini dissembles, Pisces won't deal with reality. Gemini needs freedom and I new vistas; Pisces needs unending adoration. Pisces just can't feel secure with gadabout Gemini, and tries to pull the net tighter. The claustrophobic atmosphere eventually makes it hard for Gemini to breathe.<br><br>Cancer<br>CANCER AND ARIES<br>These two may start out like a house on fire, but it won't take long for the fire to burn out. Aries' venturesome spirit and wandering eye inflame Cancer's jealousy. And Cancer is too easily hurt by Aries' aggressiveness and sharp tongue. Cancer likes security and domesticity; Aries needs freedom to explore new worlds. Cancer wants to cherish and protect a lover, an attitude that Aries finds too claustrophobic. Both like money, but Aries wants to spend it and Cancer wants to keep it. Too many temperamental problems here.<br><br>CANCER AND TAURUS<br>Both need security and a sense of permanence, and both are loving, affectionate, and passionate as well. Cancer adds a dash of imagination to Taurus's otherwise staid approach to sex. Taurus is possessive and that's just fine with clinging Cancer. Both are acquisitive moneymakers, and together they enjoy the delights of hearth and home. Taurus likes being catered to, and Cancer is the one to do it. Steady-going Taurus is also good for Cancer's moodiness. What each needs the other supplies.<br><br>CANCER AND GEMINI<br>Gemini's sparkle immediately intrigues Cancer, but Cancer won't find security with fickle, fly-by-night Gemini. Basically, Cancer's nature is emotional and Gemini's is cerebral, and that makes it difficult for them to understand each other. Although sexual energies are well matched, Cancer will have a hard time adjusting to Gemini's playful, nonchalant attitude toward love. Possessive Cancer will try to keep Gemini hemmed in, and Gemini can't abide that. It's a short countdown to the finish.<br><br>CANCER AND CANCER<br>They have a lot in common, and that's the trouble. They understand each other perfectly and can wound each other without even trying. Both are too sensitive, too demanding, too dependent. Cancers are obsessively concerned with their emotional psyches: Each needs an enormous amount of attention, coddling, and reassurance, and resents the other for not giving enough. On the plus side, they're sensual bed mates whose erotic imaginations are sparked by each other. But that's rarely enough. This treadmill goes nowhere.<br><br>CANCER AND LEO<br>Cancer has to get used to Leo's extroverted exuberance. Otherwise, generous, openhearted, strong Leo is just what insecure Cancer is looking for Cancer's marvelous intuitions tell It exactly how to handle proud and flamboyant Leo. Admiration and a lot of flattery are what are needed to keep Leo purring with contentment. Leo is domineering in the bedroom and a little too forthright sexually for Cancer. But Leo's sunny disposition is a wonderful antidote for Cancer's moodiness.<br><br>CANCER AND VIRGO<br>Cancer's responses are emotive while Virgo's are analytical, but their personalities mesh so well that it doesn't seem to matter. Cancer may have to warm up Virgo a little, but there is fire under the ice. This can turn into a secure, comfortable, and affectionate relationship. Cancer's struggle for financial security works perfectly with goal-oriented Virgo. Cancer understands Virgo's fussy ways, and steady Virgo helps balance variable Cancer. Cancer's dependency neatly complements Virgo's need to protect, and each is anxious to please the other..<br><br>CANCER AND LIBRA<br>This pair operates on entirely different levels: Cancer wants love to be emotionally transcendent, Libra seeks perfect intellectual communion. Libra has no sympathy for Cancer's moods, and Cancer is made insecure by Libra's detachment and shallow emotions. Cancer is too temperamental and possessive for airy Libra. They have a hard time establishing real sexual rapport, and that exasperates Cancer. They both love a beautiful home, but Libra also needs parties and people and outside pleasures. When Cancer turns critical, especially about Libra's extravagance, Libra starts looking elsewhere.<br><br>CANCER AND SCORPIO<br>Cancer's sensuality is ignited by Scorpio's dynamic passions, and because Cancer is loyal, Scorpio's jealousy isn't provoked. Cancer's possessiveness will actually make Scorpio feel secure. Cancer admires Scorpio's strength while Scorpio finds a haven in Cancer's emotional commitment. Both are extremely intuitive and sense what will please the other. Together they can build a happy cocoon where they feel safe and loved. This relationship has great intimacy, intensity, and depth. Things just get better all the time.<br><br>CANCER AND SAGITTARIUS<br>Outgoing Sagittarius can open intellectual vistas for imaginative Cancer, but unfortunately Sagittarius won't give Cancer the security in love that it always needs. Cancer's jealousy is aroused by Sagittarius's flighty, faithless ways; Sagittarius is bored by Cancer's dependency. Sagittarius likes to wander, while Cancer is a stay-at-home. Cancer's commitment to total togetherness only makes Sagittarius desperate to get away. In addition, outspoken Sagittarius's bluntness continually wounds sensitive Cancer. Better friends than lovers.<br><br>CANCER AND CAPRICORN<br>There's an initial sexual attraction because they are a polarity in the zodiac. If they can overcome their opposites in temperament, they can make a winning combination. But career-oriented Capricorn has too many other interests to give Cancer all the attention it needs. Cancer is shy, sensitive, and needs affection, while Capricorn is brusque, aloof, and domineering. Cancer takes Capricorn's reserve as a personal rebuff, and becomes moody and critical. The differences may prove too great for long-term happiness.<br><br>CANCER AND AQUARIUS<br>Cancer's warm, responsive nature is chilled by Aquarius's cool self-possession. In turn, Cancer's clinging, cloying demonstratives makes Aquarius feel hemmed in. Aquarius is quick-minded, unpredictable, apt to be impatient with cautious, hesitant Cancer. And thin-skinned Cancer is easily hurt by Aquarius's caustic humor. Cancer doesn't understand Aquarius's essential detachment. Cancer needs to feel close and secure; Aquarius is a lone wolf. Sex may be all right, but there's little else going for them.<br><br>CANCER AND PISCES<br>This is an affectionate, sensitive couple who will bolster each other's ego. Pisces is an imaginative dreamer but Cancer is an imaginative worker-and together they can make their dreams a reality. Pisces provides romance in Cancer's life, and Cancer is the all-protective lover Pisces needs. Both are emotional, intensely devoted, sensitive to each other's moods. They'll hit it off in the boudoir, for both are responsive sexually. Cancer has to take the lead but Pisces is a very willing, erotic follower. A harmonious match.<br><br>Leo (thats me hee)<br>LEO AND ARIES<br>These two are the superstars of the zodiac. These well-matched partners get along marvelously in the bedroom. They're an unbeatable combination for deriving sheer joy and excitement from sex. They also share the same likes and dislikes in other areas of life. However, they need all that rapport to overcome one big problem-the head-on collision of two super egos, each of whom wants to play the leading role. They have to learn to share center stage. Otherwise, a glorious mating.<br><br>LEO AND TAURUS<br>Leo's sovereign right to rule runs smack up against Taurus's determination to have its own way. Both are fixed signs, so neither will give an inch .Leo merely becomes angrier and Taurus more obstinate. Thrifty Taurus is also appalled at Leo's careless spending habits. Taurus is cautious and deliberate; Leo expansive and extravagant. Taurus stubbornly refuses to give Leo constant worship, and Leo is too self-centered to give Taurus the devotion it needs. Leo is much more exuberant than Taurus, both in and out of the bedroom. Too many personality conflicts here.<br><br>LEO AND GEMINI<br>They strike it off immediately because they like so many of the same things-glamorous social life, parties, theater, lots of friends. Lively, independent Gemini brings out Leo's joie de vivre. Their affair is a merry chase after variety and amusement. Leo finds Gemini's imaginative sexual hi-jinks great fun, but Leo may also become jealous because of Gemini's lighthearted approach to love. Leo is more intense than airy Gemini. Life together will be stimulating and exasperating, but the outlook is good if Gemini can stay faithful. Otherwise poof!<br><br>LEO AND CANCER<br>Both are romantics, though in different ways: Leo wants a relationship to be glorious and exciting, Cancer wants it to be meaningful and fulfilling. Leo doesn't get as overwrought as Cancer, who takes things more seriously. Cancer needs security, tranquility, and is a stay-at-home. Leo is boisterous and a gadabout who loves to be on constant display. Cancer's dependency will please Leo-provided a little adoration is thrown in. Leo is flamboyant in love, and Cancer is responsive, loyal, and intense; Leo likes that. Mixed signals.<br><br>LEO AND LEO<br>When a king and queen are together, heads turn. This couple can have a royal mating a grand passion conducted on a grand scale. Both are romantic, colorful, exuberant about life, and highly sexed. The main question is: Who's going to be in charge? It's difficult for one Leo to make room for another ego as large as its own, but that's exactly what's needed here. Each not only wants to sit on the throne, each wants to be the power behind it as well. Grand lovers--and interesting rivals.<br><br>LEO AND VIRGO<br>Leo is drawn to Virgo's intellectualism, but Virgo doesn't understand Leo's dramatic nature. Leo can't get from cool, reserved Virgo the sexual responsiveness it demands. Virgo is practical and prudent; Leo is extravagant and a spendthrift. Leo likes to live life in a really big way, but Virgo is conservative, frugal and a nit-picker--which puts a damper on Leo's high spirits. Virgo won't be dominated either. Leo needs lots of flattery, but Virgo's tendency is to puncture inflated egos. Both of them should look elsewhere.<br><br>LEO AND LIBRA<br>Leo's creative side meshes well with Libra's penchant for artistic and esthetic pursuits. Leo is more interested in the strictly physical side of love than Libra, but Leo's style and brio can win Libra over. Libra is indecisive and Leo will naturally take charge. The checkbook may not always balance because they're both extravagant and love a beautiful setting in which to shine. Each will also try to outdo the other in order to get attention. But in the bedroom, Leo is the master-and that's what Leo likes.<br><br>LEO AND SCORPIO<br>There's immediate sexual fascination with each other. But Leo finds it hard to cope with Scorpio's jealousy and possessiveness. Intense, smoldering Scorpio is on a too short fuse, while Leo is much more buoyant. Leo thinks Scorpio difficult and temperamental; Scorpio considers Leo pretentious and a show-off. Scorpio doesn't understand Leo's need to be continually surrounded by an admiring audience. Scorpio would rather dominate than admire, and that doesn't suit Leo's kingly state. Sex isn't everything.<br><br>LEO AND SAGITTARIUS<br>Leo is enthralled by optimistic, extroverted Sagittarius-and fun-loving Sagittarius is enchanted with Leo's sunny openness to life. Together they share a liking for freedom, adventure, and meeting new people. Both are passionate and fiery sexual types, and if anyone can keep Sagittarius faithful it's Leo. Leo's natural quality of leadership brings out what loyalty Sagittarius can give. Leo is very proud, but self-confident and expansive Sagittarius is perfectly happy to let Leo strut.<br><br>LEO AND CAPRICORN<br>Leo's romantic, expansive nature is curbed by cautious, practical Capricorn. Merry Leo likes to kick up its heels, but Capricorn disapproves of too much self-indulgence. Both are highly sexed, but with basic differences. Leo needs glamour in lovemaking and Capricorn can't supply it. Leo will think Capricorn stingy with affection because Capricorn's reserved, undemonstrative nature cannot give Leo the adoration it needs. Neither will take a back seat or let the other dominate. This affair will be on the rocks before it even leaves the dock.<br><br>LEO AND AQUARIUS<br>There is initial physical attraction between these two, but Aquarius's tendency to analyze and criticize will shake Leo's confidence and deflate its ego. Leo views Aquarius's aloof emotions as a personal rejection. Also, Aquarius's unconventional, experimental approach to love may prove upsetting to Leo, who doesn't like to wander too far afield. Both like socializing and meeting new people, but Leo always needs to perform on center stage, which makes Aquarius impatient and irritable. Aquarius is too independent to become Leo's devoted subject. And that's where it ends.<br><br>LEO AND PISCES<br>Leo is flamboyant, domineering; Pisces is unworldly and mystical. They intrigue each other because they are so different, but the differences don't mesh well. Leo's active outgoing nature doesn't harmonize with Pisces's dreamy introspection. Leo needs public acclaim, while Pisces prefers the sheltered life. Both are more inclined to take than to give. Leo can't tolerate Pisces's ultra-sensitivity, nor Pisces's inclination toward exotic boudoir activity. Before long, the lion will start to roam.<br><br>Virgo<br>VIRGO AND ARIES<br><br>Virgo can be intrigued by Aries's audaciousness, but Virgo's prudent ways soon clash with Aries's colorful personality. They have difficulty communicating, because Virgo wants to talk and Aries wants to act. Their arguments will probably be more passionate than their lovemaking. Aries will think Virgo is inhibited; Virgo will consider Aries impulsive and wild. Aries likes a flamboyant social life. Virgo is happy with quiet, intellectual friends. Aries is also the type to bring out Virgo's worst habits of nit-picking and nagging. Exit romance.<br><br>VIRGO AND TAURUS<br><br>Virgo is analytical while Taurus is sensuous, but Taurus's strong passions can spark Virgo. If that happens, they make lovely love. Practical, down-to-earth, satisfied with the tried-and-true, these two have much in common. Both try to build for a secure future, both are homebodies, both share a fondness for money. Virgo's rational approach and Taurus's persistence are also a good moneymaking combination. Auguries couldn't be more promising.<br><br>VIRGO AND GEMINI<br><br>They are attracted to each other because of a mutual interest in intellectual ideas. Both have active minds, but the rapport ends there. Gemini's amorous nature Is too impulsive and unstable to suit Virgo. Gemini dismisses Virgo as a stick-in-the-mud. Virgo considers Gemini irresponsible and adolescent. Gemini needs freedom to pursue its varied interests. Virgo resents this, and will nag and try to dominate. Gemini will soon stray to other lovers.<br><br>VIRGO AND CANCER<br><br>A stimulating affair, for they arouse each other's beneath-the-surface sensuality. Cancer isn't too forceful, which suits Virgo fine. And the little attentions won't be neglected, which suits Virgo even better. Cancer is affectionate and sentimental, and that makes Virgo feel secure. This couple also likes money and domestic comfort, and Cancer's dependency fits perfectly with Virgo's protectiveness. On the downside, both tend to be overcritical. On the upside, each draws the other out of its shell.<br><br>VIRGO AND LEO<br><br>Highly physical Leo takes it as a personal affront if Virgo doesn't match its leonine ardor. Virgo's passive and reserved nature frustrates Leo and leads to quarrels. Virgo isn't quick to hand out praise, and Leo lives on nothing but. Leo is a spendthrift, Virgo is careful with pennies. They're both very independent, but Leo exhibits this in a temperamental way while Virgo is very private. Virgo simply will not be dominated by tyrannical Leo, and always has its guard up. This affair has a shorter life than a May fly.<br><br>VIRGO AND VIRGO<br><br>All is smooth sailing as long as these perfectionists curb their instincts for finding fault. Actually, they bring out the very best in each other. They are responsible, sensitive, intelligent, and take love seriously. They also share passions of the mind, and will never bore each other. important things in Both think that there are more' life than sex; they may end up just talking in bed. There will probably be a continual contest over who is leader, but they have too much else in common for that to matter.<br><br>VIRGO AND LIBRA<br><br>Libra is too frivolous and shallow for Virgo's taste. Libra enjoys spending money, going to parties, and being the center of attention. Virgo criticizes and makes Libra feel unloved. Libra may tap Virgo's hidden sensuality but their personalities are altogether too different for real compatibility. Virgo will try to curb and dominate Libra's fickle and outer-directed nature. Virgo is reserved and practical, and Libra views this as a personal rebuff. Libra will soon drift away in search of more fun-loving companions.<br><br>VIRGO AND SCORPIO<br><br>Sensual Scorpio keeps trying to entice Virgo into ever bolder sexual adventures. But Virgo is pleased because Scorpio is also possessive and fiercely loyal, which makes Virgo feel loved and protected. They also admire each other's minds. Virgo is logical, intellectual, analytical. Scorpio is imaginative, visionary, perceptive. Each sometimes has trouble expressing real feelings: Scorpio is volatile but secretive; Virgo is self-restrained and reserved. There may be some conflict about who runs things, but Virgo's willingness to compromise keeps Scorpio tractable.<br><br>VIRGO AND SAGITTARIUS<br><br>These two are like the grasshopper and the ant. Sagittarius's free spirit has nothing in common with hardworking Virgo. Sagittarius has a reckless gambler's spirit, while Virgo carefully builds for future security. Both are intellectual signs but the way their minds work clashes with each other. Sagittarius is expansive and extravagant, while Virgo prefers a simple, ordered, and unpretentious life. Sagittarius considers Virgo's sexual attitudes rather prudish, and won't stay long in one bedroom anyway.<br><br>VIRGO AND CAPRICORN<br><br>A harmonious pair. Capricorn's ambition and drive for success meshes well with Virgo's perfectionism and energy. Both are diligent, disciplined, and have a sense of purpose. They admire one another and take great pride in pleasing each other. Both need respect and approval (though neither will confess this), and each intuitively gives the other exactly that. Sexual compatibility becomes a mutual achievement; in lovemaking, though, Capricorn usually takes the lead.<br><br>VIRGO AND AQUARIUS<br><br>They are both rational, intellectual, and tend to view love in the abstract but the similarity ends there. Aquarius has venturesome ideas and thinks Virgo unresponsive or cold. Actually, each has a distant quality: Virgo is cautious about emotional giving; Aquarius's thoughts are in the far-off clouds. Aquarius is interested in other people, in causes, and in setting the world right. Virgo seeks personal achievement and financial security. Aquarius is outgoing, inventive, a visionary. Virgo is reserved, prudent, and very practical about its ambitions. This couple may not even make it as friends.<br><br>VIRGO AND PISCES<br><br>To Virgo, love means security and mental compatibility. To Pisces, love is a sweeping, all-enveloping emotion. At first Virgo is powerfully attracted to Pisces, as opposites often are: sentimental, in-love-with-love Pisces is very intriguing to Virgo, and Pisces is fascinated by Virgo's incisive, analytical mind. However, disillusion quickly sets in. Pisces's extravagance, secretiveness, and dreaminess frustrate pragmatic, orderly Virgo. Also, Virgo isn't likely to adapt to some of Pisces's sexual preferences.<br><br>LibraLIBRA AND ARIES<br>While they're immediately attracted to each other, tensions also immediately arise. Libra looks for harmony and peace, while restless Aries aggressively seeks new challenges and new worlds to conquer. Libra considers Aries rude and tactless; Aries thinks Libra hopelessly unwilling to face facts. Aries needs to feel independent but wants unquestioning fidelity from its partner, and can't forgive Libra's indecisiveness about making a commitment. Passionate Aries is also offended by Libra's shallow emotions. Physical rapport is wonderful for a while but then what?<br><br>LIBRA AND TAURUS<br>This couple shares a love of music and art, but hasn't much else in common. Taurus is a homebody, which bores Libra, who likes to shine socially. Libra spends lots of money on luxuries, Taurus advocates financial caution. Libra dislikes Taurus's dictatorial ways and quickly loses patience with Taurus's stodgy attitudes. To boot, Taurus is jealous of Libra's romantic and fickle nature. They are sexually in tune, but when the song is ended the malady lingers on.<br><br>LIBRA AND GEMINI<br>Pleasure-loving Libra and high-spirited Gemini are an ideal mating. Both are curious, vivacious, and affectionate. For them, love is a carousel that never stops. True, the fun and games are more frolicsome than deeply passionate, but these two don't care as long as they're having fun. No jealousy or possessiveness will spoil their good times. Both tend to be quite indecisive, so there will be lots of discussion but not a lot of action. However, both know how to use charm to get other people to do things for them.<br><br>LIBRA AND CANCER<br>Cancer might eventually understand Libra's romantic nature, but Cancer is too cautious to press indecisive Libra for the emotional response it needs. Disappointed at Libra's shallowness, Cancer turns sharply critical, and those crab-claws cut deep. Money-oriented Cancer is also annoyed by Libra's extravagance. Libra loves the glittering social life; Cancer is happiest in the warmth of its own home. Problems might be solved in time, but the wait usually isn't worth it.<br><br>LIBRA AND LEO<br>Libra's amorous playfulness blends marvelously with Leo's dash and energy. Leo's generous, expansive sensuality really lights Libra's fire, and the thermometer moves up to torrid. Libra does have to approach Leo carefully on matters involving ego, but that won't be a problem for tactful Libra. In a real conflict, Libra knows how to yield gracefully. Together they share a love of luxury, going to parties, and creating a beautiful home that serves as a stage setting for these two stars.<br><br>LIBRA AND VIRGO<br>Libra is too affectionate and frivolous for emotionally inhibited Virgo, who takes love very seriously. Virgo won't express flowery admiration, which is the stuff of life to Libra. Stay-at-home Virgo resents Libra's socialbutterfly instincts and pursuit of pleasure. Libra's tastes are expensive. Virgo is careful, not to say miserly. Libra finds Virgo fussy, critical, completely inflexible. Love will have a short season for these two.<br><br>LIBRA AND LIBRA<br>Equally demonstrative, lively, warm, sociable, in love with beautiful things, they enjoy pleasing each other in sexual ways. But with these two there's a great sense of playing at love. A problem is that neither wants to face reality. Though they are charming, peace-loving, and adaptable, each needs a stronger balance than the other can provide. Also, because they are so much alike, the specter of boredom lurks around the edges. But if both of them can find enough outside stimulation to whet their appetites, this can be an interesting liaison.<br><br>LIBRA AND SCORPIO<br>At first, Scorpio's intensity in love flatters Libra, who is always looking for any new form of attention. But Scorpio is also touchy, moody, and quick to lash out in anger, which is just the kind of person Libra cannot bear. Possessive Scorpio tries to control a lover, but Libra has a need for diversion and won't stay in Scorpio's net. Libra's flirtatiousness and casual attitude toward sex infuriates sensual Scorpio. As Scorpio seethes and becomes steadily more jealous and demanding, Libra has either to submit-or to leave.<br><br>LIBRA AND SAGITTARIUS<br>Libra is stimulated by Sagittarius's eagerness for adventure, and Sagittarius is drawn to Libra's affectionate charm. Both are highly romantic, though this quality is more dominant in Libra. Libra will want to settle down before flighty Sagittarius does, but they can work that out. Charming, clever Libra knows how to appeal to Sagittarius's intellectual side and easily keeps Sagittarius intrigued. This pairing should develop into a fun-filled, free, delightful relationship.<br><br>LIBRA AND CAPRICORN<br>Libra is drawn to Capricorn's strong sexuality, but that's as far as it goes. Libra needs flattery and attention, but Capricorn keeps its affections buried. Sentimental, in love-with-love Libra won't get much understanding from realistic, materialistic Capricorn. And Libra's lazy, easygoing ways will offend Capricorn, who believes in hard work and achievement at any price. Libra is fond of socializing and nightlife, while Capricorn tends to be a loner, comfortable with only a chosen few. A short-lived romance.<br><br>LIBRA AND AQUARIUS<br>Libra's indolently sensual nature is stirred to life by Aquarius's bold and experimental lovemaking. And these two have all the makings for a beautiful friendship: harmonious vibes in socializing, artistic interests, even in involvement in public affairs. These two will enjoy the friendship side of an affair as much as the romantic part. Indecisive Libra is delighted with the fact that quick-minded Aquarius likes to make decisions. With a satisfying love life and a mutual enjoyment of living, all signals are go.<br><br>LIBRA AND PISCES<br>They start off fine, since both are sentimental and affectionate. In a way they are alike: Both want to impose their romantic visions on reality. But Pisces needs domination, reassurance, and constant attention, and Libra soon finds that cloying and restrictive. Libra is gregarious and fun-loving. Pisces feels neglected, and whines and scolds. Pisces senses that Libra's commitment is often insincere and that Libra's charm is mostly superficial. Sexually, Libra has to take the lead, and finds that most annoying.<br><br>Scopio<br>SCORPIO AND ARIES<br>The initial attraction is strong. Sexually, Aries is more imaginative and willing to experiment, but Scorpio's smoldering desires prove a fair match. Trouble looms in other areas though. Both are selfish and both want to make the decisions. There is a basic clash of wills because Aries wants to dominate and Scorpio wants to control. Scorpio's secretive and brooding nature frustrates open, impulsive Aries. Aries is freedom-loving, outgoing, and flirtatious, and this enrages possessive , jealous Scorpio. Temperamental differences undermine the sexual rapport.<br><br>SCORPIO AND TAURUS<br>Taurus has the stamina and the desire to satisfy Scorpio in the bedroom. But what will this passionate pair do with the other 231/2 hours in the day? Both are very jealous and stubborn. The difference between these two is that Taurus wants to own a lover, like a valuable object, and Scorpio tries to possess in an emotional sense. Though they share an affinity for finances, Scorpio is thrifty and spurns laziness whereas Taurus likes to spend on creature comforts. Scorpio is willful, Taurus is obstinate, and both want to be the captain of what may turn out to be a sinking ship.<br><br>SCORPIO AND GEMINI<br>Scorpio is drawn to Gemini's vivacity, and Scorpio's complex personality fascinates curious Gemini. For a time Gemini is also intrigued by Scorpio's unceasing sexual demands. But Gemini is too changeable and inconstant for intense Scorpio, who needs and demands total commitment. Restless Gemini has a strong penchant for independence, while Scorpio wants to dominate and possess. Scorpio is basically a loner; Gemini likes to glitter in social settings. They'll have some lively frolics but all too soon the fun palls-and Gemini starts looking for an exit.<br><br>SCORPIO AND CANCER<br>This can be a rewarding combination. Cancer is the passive partner, but there's plenty of combustible material to catch fire from Scorpio's abundant passions. The heat in the bedroom will help cool off disputes that can arise between two jealous people. Scorpio offers strength and protectiveness, which is just what clinging, insecure Cancer is looking for. In turn, Cancer is affectionate, generous, loving, and devoted-all that Scorpio wants. These two get along together like bread and jam.<br><br>SCORPIO AND LEO<br>Scorpio won't flatter Leo's ego or accept Leo's dominance. Scorpio seeks to plumb the erotic psyche of a lover, whereas Leo looks for a grand romance. Passions and tempers are equally strong on both sides. Fiery Leo is extravagant and likes to live on a majestic scale, but Scorpio disapproves of conspicuousness and waste. There's a great deal of physical attraction between them but both are on a very short fuse. Scorplo'sjealousy will probably provide the spark, and when the explosion comes-the sky's the limit!<br><br>SCORPIO AND VIRGO<br>Restrained Virgo has trouble keeping up with highly demonstrative Scorpio and doesn't understand what all the fuss and bother is about. But there's a marvelous meeting of minds and a fine mixing of personalities. Both are devoted to family and to financial security. Neither is flighty or superficial; the deep feelings that each harbors lead to a strong commitment and loyalty. They have so much in common that maybe Scorpio won't mind that Virgo's passions are more intellectual than physical.<br><br>SCORPIO AND LIBRA<br>Scorpio's unpredictable nature immediately intrigues Libra, who enjovs collecting interesting people. Scorpio satisfies Libra's need for affection and then some-and Scorpio's jealousy will flatter Libra. But Libra is an inconstant flirt and Scorpio is super-sensitive and touchy. Intense Scorpio takes love and commitment seriously; Libra wants a partner to enhance its own image. Libra's on-again off-again attitude toward love will frustrate and upset Scorpio. This mating isn't likely to lead to anything permanent.<br><br>SCORPIO AND SCORPIO<br>Plenty of sexual attraction here but the emotional temperature can't keep rising forever. These two people who are so much alike understand each other very little. They are highly jealous and demanding. They are so intense that every little storm quickly becomes a hurricane. Both are sulky, brooding, possessive. Both are in a continual struggle to force the other to relinquish control. Something has got to give and when it does it's likely to spell The End.<br><br>SCORPIO AND SAGITTARIUS<br>Scorpio is tantalized by Sagittarius's free-wheeling, uninhibited style. Scorpio will dominate but can't keep restless, flighty Sagittarius submissive for long. Sagittarius thinks the accent should be on fun and new adventure; Scorpio wants security and constant loving. Sagittarius is open, talkative, casual about relationships; Scorpio is reticent, secretive, and very jealous in love. Scorpio wants Sagittarius at home, Sagittarius wants to roam. An affair without a future.<br><br>SCORPIO AND CAPRICORN<br>All of Scorpio's powerful passions find a welcome here. Scorpio's volatile emotions tend to open up brooding, inner directed Capricorn, and the zesty goings-on add savor to a warm emotional relationship. Capricorn even likes Scorpio's jealousy-for that makes Capricorn feel secure. These two share a sense of purpose: they are ambitious, determined, serious about responsibility-and as a team have good auguries for financial success. They should have clear sailing.<br><br>SCORPIO AND AQUARIUS<br>Scorpio makes heavy emotional demands, but to Aquarius even a love affair is simply another way to broaden its horizons. Scorpio can't tolerate Aquarius's independence within a relationship or understand Aquarius's casual air toward love. Aquarius is altogether too impersonal and has too many outside interests to suit possessive, jealous Scorpio. Scorpio will try to dominate and will be upset by Aquarius's unpredictable moods and love for freedom. Scorpio wants to stay at home; Aquarius wants to be free to go. And so on-to the finish.<br><br>SCORPIO AND PISCES<br>Scorpio's strength is a perfect bulwark for Pisces' indecisiveness. In turn, Pisces' imagination sparks Scorpio's creativity. Pisces is able to give Scorpio the devotion and admiration it craves, and their mutual fascination with lovemaking provides a fine romantic aura. Pisces' flair for the bizarre adds spice to Scorpio's desires, and the intense emotional needs of both signs neatly complement each other. Pisces' intuitive awareness and Scorpio's depth of feeling unite in a special closeness. This kind of mating lasts.<br><br>Sagittarius<br>SAGITTARIUS AND ARIES<br>Both share a similar approach to sex (they make the most of every opportunity). Add to this a mutual love of the outdoors and a fondness for socializing, and you can see why they get along. They're also intellectually well suited: Both have a wide range of interests and love to talk about them. Sagittarius is more philosophical about problems than Aries, who becomes more personally involved. The one question mark is their combustible temper. Arguments are heated but short-lived -and the making up will be fun. A perfect match.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS AND TAURUS<br>Taurus wants to run things, but Sagittarius won't be controlled. Sagittarius needs change, variety, and adventure. That proves irritating to steady, disciplined, homeloving Taurus. Taurus approves of tried-and-true ways of doing things but Sagittarius will try anything. Blunt Sagittarius will say what it thinks at the drop of a hat, and that brings Taurus's temper to a slow simmer. There are also money problems, since Sagittarius gambles today while Taurus hoards for tomorrow. A short future for this pair.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS AND GEMINI<br>They're both rest_ less, adventuresome, imaginative, and fun loving. No other opposite signs in the zodiac enjoy each other more than these two. There'll be shooting stars in the bedroom for a while, but when the fireworks fizzle the bickering begins. Both have bright minds, but Sagittarius is outspoken and bossy, while Gemini likes to poke verbal fun. Too rootless and discontent to settle down, they eventually both succumb to the siren call of other interests, other loves. But parting should be amicable.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS AND CANCER<br>Cancer's sensuality and romantic imagination intrigues inquiring Sagittarius. But Sagittarius is both venturesome and cerebral while Cancer is cautious and emotional. and this pair will never understand each other. Sagittarius can't supply the security and stability Cancer needs or endure Cancer's moodiness and jealousy. Without even being aware of it, blunt Sagittarius wounds sensitive Cancer at every turn. When Sagittarius seeks outside stimulation away from home, Cancer nags and whines and tries to hold on tighter. They'd be better as just friends.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS AND LEO<br>There are exciting times ahead for this ardent pair. Self-confident Leo holds the key to unlocking Sagittarius's deeper passions, and their love life is an adventure. They also enjoy travel, meeting new people, and each other's company. Leo loves freedom as much as Sagittarius so there won't be problems with jealousy or possessiveness. Sagittarius has the lightness of touch necessary to cope with Leo's monumental ego. A grand mating.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS AND VIRGO<br>Shy, reticent Virgo can't take the initiative, which makes Sagittarius think Virgo is prudish. Both have intellectual leanings so they may end up having some interesting conversations in bed. Elsewhere, Virgo looks for order and simplicity whereas Sagittarius looks for excitement and new experiences. Virgo wants a long term commitment; Sagittarius has to be free to roam. Sagittarius's slapdash ways irritate meticulous Virgo. When Virgo carps and criticizes this is sometimes a way of showing it cares, but Sagittarius will never understand that. Little bodes well in this affair.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS AND LIBRA<br>Sagittarius is charmed by Libra's artistic, elegant, easygoing nature, and Libra is fascinated by Sagittarius's lust for adventure. Libra is more romantic than Sagittarius; otherwise the sexual harmony is delightful. Libra casts a tolerant eye on Sagittarius's frolicking, and may even slow down Sagittarius's pace, for Libra knows how to turn on sensual charm. Libra loves home and luxury, and Sagittarius prefers the outdoor life. But Librans are artists at working out such problems.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS AND SCORPIO<br>Scorpio tries to clip Sagittarius's wings and keep it in a cage. Brooding , pent-up Scorpio just can't deal with 9 open, ebullient, outspoken Sagittarius. Sagittarlus's far-roaming interests constantly make Scorpio jealous. Romantically, this is a volatile combination. Sagittarius is playful about sex and finds Scorpio's intense, dominating passions too much to cope with. Soon Sagittarius's inclination is to fly. Sagittarius is also quick-tempered and cools quickly, while Scorpio's anger seethes until it erupts in fury. A temperamental, difficult union.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS AND SAGITTARIUS<br>Some astrologers believe the only fit mate for a Sagittarian is another Sagittarian. They do seem perfectly suited: two independent, freedom-loving roamers. But this exciting, chaotic, eventful relationship is too unpredictable to suit either of them. They have a tendency to bring out the worst in each other. Each remains uncommitted and has so many outside interests that this pair inevitably drifts apart. But they'll be good sports when the fun is over.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS AND CAPRICORN<br>Capricorn's demands can't be satisfied by Sagittarius's flighty, lighthearted approach to love. Both have high aspirations in life but their approaches are totally different. Capricorn wants to climb to the top of the mountain; Sagittarius wants to fly over the top. Sagittarius's frank outspoken nature is sure to rile Capricorn's sensibilities. Capricorn is restrictive, a loner, known for its dour outlook. Sagittarius is venturesome, sociable, expansive. Capricorn is cautious with money and concerned with appearances and Sagittarius is neither.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS AND AQUARIUS<br>These two share a great zest for living and a forward-looking viewpoint. Neither will try to tie down the other. Both seek to explore possibilities to the fullest, and they share an idealism about love and life. Aquarius is innovative. Sagittarius loves to experiment. There'll be imaginative fun in the bedroom, and they'll probably find out things that would surprise even Masters and Johnson. They'll like each other too. True emotional intimacy may be slower to develop-but prospects are wonderful for the long haul.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS AND PISCES<br>Pisces is drawn to Sagittarius's life-force, and Sagittarius is attracted to Pisces's spirituality. But Sagittarius needs a pal and Pisces needs a dream lover-and neither can help the other. Sagittarius's naturally buoyant spirits are anchored by Pisces's dependency and timidity. Highly emotional Pisces is looking for more than an occasional sex partner, and restless, freedom-loving Sagittarius is looking for nothing else but. Bedroom high jinks keep things going for a while, but this affair slowly sinks into a quagmire.<br><br>Capricorn(thats my ex)CAPRICORN AND ARIES<br>They'll get along as lovers, but even in bed there'll be arguments about money, friends, socializing, and who's boss. A major difference is that Capricorn won't make a move unless sure of winning, whereas Aries is completely headstrong and impulsive. Arguments never fade away, for both are strong-willed, aggressive, and need to dominate. Jealousy also raises its head as Aries' lively passions stray toward more fun-loving company. Temperamentally and emotionally, this mating is better suited to an arena than to hearth and home.<br><br>CAPRICORN AND TAURUS<br>Taurus admires Capricorn's strength of purpose, and Capricorn is delighted with Taurus's affectionate stability. Taurus can get through to aloof, cautious Capricorn and give the encouragement and responsiveness needed, Both have earthy, passionate natures, and sensual Taurus can tap the deep well of romanticism that lies under Capricorn's reserve. Capricorn is loyal and Taurus is devoted, so jealousy is not a problem between these two. In addition, both value money, security, and are home-lovers. One union-strong and indivisible.<br><br>CAPRICORN AND GEMINI<br>Capricorn will have a hard time holding the reins on excitable, flirtatious, wayward Gemini. All of Capricorn's patience is needed to deal with a partner it considers to be capricious, extravagant, and scatterbrained. Capricorn prizes order and control, and approaches life in a practical, determined manner. Gemini is disorganized, high-strung, and erratic. Also, Gemini's verbal quickness has a way of making Capricorn secretly feel inadequate. Neither is particularly sentimental, so whatever flamelets ignite at the beginning will quickly cool.<br><br>CAPRICORN AND CANCER<br>These two are sexually attracted to each other, but need all the harmony they find in the bedroom to offset the discordance they create everywhere else. Sensitive Cancer will resent Capricorn's domineering manner. Capricorn isn't willing to put up with Cancer's endless emotional demands. Cancer's need for warmth will be frustrated by Capricorn's aloof coolness. Both fear rejection, but Cancer's tendency is to withdraw and Capricorn's is to become tyrannical. These two are zodiac opposites with all that implies-<br><br>CAPRICORN AND LEO<br>Ordered, organized Capricorn neither understands nor approves of Leo's exuberant impulsiveness. Capricorn cannot stand Leo's habit of leaping first and looking afterward. Extroverted Leo will be impatient with Capricorn's secretive tendencies. Capricorn is too reserved to give Leo the adoration it needs, and proud Leo will not give in to Capricorn's domineering ways. Spendthrift Leo adores luxury while Capricorn puts financial security above all. Also, they both want to rule in the bedroom. This unpromising couple will find their way to a quick ending.<br><br>CAPRICORN AND VIRGO<br>Virgo's neat orderly mind meshes well with Capricorn's self-discipline and capacity for hard work. Both take pride in their home, enjoy having a few close friends rather than many acquaintances, and admire each other's intellectual abilities. There's no reason this duo shouldn't click except in the bedroom where virgo's reticence needs a stronger push than reserved Capricorn likes to give. Neither finds it easy to be spontaneously affectionate. However, this is the only minus entry on a balance sheet full of plusses.<br><br>CAPRICORN AND LIBRA<br>Capricorn is intrigued by magnetic Libra, and Libra is charmed by Capricorn's slowly revealed passions. But over the long term Libra needs more excitement, romance, and beauty than Capricorn can provide. Capricorn is not oriented toward social and artistic pursuits, which are Libra's favorite activities. Capricorn prizes discipline and responsibility, and finds Libra altogether too frivolous, vain, and self-centered. Libra turns restive and starts to look elsewhere. Throw in some Capricorn jealousy to keep the cauldron bubbling. A recipe for disaster.<br><br>CAPRICORN AND SCORPIO<br>Scorpio's powerful sensuality kindles Capricorn's slumbering passions. Scorpio is the more imaginative lover, but Capricorn's stamina is a delightful match. Scorpio's possessiveness spells security to Capricorn. These two work well as a team-Capricorn is highly organized and Scorpio has native shrewdness. Both prize discipline and accomplishment. Each is strong willed and sometimes Scorpio's renowned temper comes up against Capricorn's stubbornness. Their battles will be royal, but so will their makings-up.<br><br>CAPRICORN AND SAGITTARIUS<br>Capricorn is cheered by optimistic Sagittarius, and Sagittarius is intrigued by Capricorn's depth and self-containment. All too soon, though, Capricorn becomes annoyed by Sagittarius's fickle attitude and total need for freedom without strings. Capricorn senses that it cannot count on Sagittarius's loyalty through thick and thin, and is frustrated by Sagittarius's nonchalance in love. Also, Sagittarius is impetuous and has free-</div>
