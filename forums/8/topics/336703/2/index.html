              <p>You should also consider the following:</p>
              <p>Bring your own water bottle and water.  drink copious amount of it before you eat.  The water will fill you up and thus you wont eat a lot, plus it helps with slimming you down.</p>
              <p>also make your own iced green tea. brew them and store in the fridge for whenever you are thirsty.</p>
              <p>You can also buy those Redoxon Orange fizz tablets.  For when you want to drink fizzy drinks, the redoxon tablets in your normal orange juice will give u a buzz, yet is healthy enough to keep you free from cold/flu.</p>
              <p>Bring home cooked food, tell mummy to cook more rice and dish for dinner, and you pack the rice and dishes into your microwavable container. Put into fridge and bring to school in the morning.</p>
              <p>Buy bigger loaf of wholemeal bread.  Buy cheese slices and make your own toaster baked cheese on bread.</p>
              <p>And boil about a half dozen eggs when you buy them.  Make mashed egg sandwich fillings.</p>
              <p>Buy $10 jeans from Ck dept stalls and your bags from army market.  they are lightweight and made of canvas where you can sew in stuffs you like.  The army kit bags was great as luggage and I got a few more for my travelling.</p>

              <p><br>Great ideas; I actually practise some of them, especially the water tip. We can all share ideas on how to minimise our expenses during bad times like this. Anyone has other ideas?</p>

              <p><br>When going to economy rice stall (mixed rice stall), go AFTER the peak hour, when the vendors are more anxious to clear their food, thereby giving you greater portions. AVOID PEAK HOURS, when they tend to 'conserve' their portion giveaways.</p>
              <p>Some shops sell off unwanted food just before closing at a discount so you may want to check out these shops.</p>

              <p><strong>5. If you have decided to eat meat, pick it first<br></strong>Have you ever realised that the vendors give a lot of the first dish, less of the second dish and even less of subsequent dishes? They do it most of the time, so learn to adapt!</p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>1. Cheapest places to shop<br></strong>Contrary to popular belief, Fairprice really isn't the cheapest place to shop for your snacks. Try Sheng Shiong, heartland supermarkets and dollar stores instead.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><br>I should mention that the better and more popular meat dishes tend to be located away to the end...so in the direction of crowd queue, the nicer dishes upfront would be vegetables and closer to the end would be nicer meats. So, naturally u wuld select a good dish closest to u as ur first dish (i.e. veg) end up with more veg and less meat :(</p>
              <p>Fairprice isn't necessarily more expensive. House brands can be cheaper and there is also the house brand discount. If you want common and popular brands, FairPrice would be good. But if you really want to save and don't mind cheaper Ah Tiong brands (if you have that amount of trust), go for heartland shops.</p>
              <p>For meat and vege, don't shop in supermarkets. Go to wet markets.</p>

              <p><br>Like I said in my original post, the optimum strategy is a two-pronged one: earn more, spend less. It's a good habit to cultivate and will serve you better than either of them alone.</p>
              <p>This is a potent strategy, mind you. Just about a year ago, I had only one stream of income: scholarship allowance. I've decided to basically do something, and now I have 3 streams of income and am working on 3 potential sources of great net worth:</p>
              <p><strong>1. Income: scholarship allowance<br></strong>I was receiving S$4,300 per annum, but recently, it has been increased dramatically (good for me).</p>
              <p><strong>2. Income: freelance work<br></strong>I write legal term sheets, proposals and do some web programming for a company that I have developed a good relationship with during my months after A Levels. I'm paid $30 per page of document I write, and I don't even have any formal qualifications. This job earns me a high three-figure sum every month.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Income: parent allowance<br></strong>I've somehow managed to negotiate a 5-figure annual allowance from my parents (citing expensive books).</p>
              <p><strong>4. Source of net worth: education</strong><br>The biggest investment in my life. I'm doing my best to excel in law school.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Source of net worth: business</strong><br>I'm currently building my business too. Hoping to get it running before my 20th birthday.</p>
              <p><strong>6. Source of net worth: financial investment</strong><br>I've already invested more than S$20,000 in foreign currency fixed deposit, unit trust and the stock market, and I'm looking forward to investing much more. Yes, this money is my own, saved from my three streams of income and invested prudently. I'm hoping to achieve a net worth of S$100,000 by the time I graduate.</p>
              <p>The abovementioned would be the first prong. The second prong is to curtail my spending, which I'm advocating to people because it's more doable. This is my strategy anyway, and anyone with comments or ideas is welcome to share.</p>

              <p>You, sir, had just motivated the hell out of me. I really shouldn't slack so much anymore.</p>
              <p>1 more year to A levels. After which I will pick up a job. Move on to NS, then go to University. Maybe work part time as a tuition teacher if I continue to pump out straight As from PSLE to A levels. Alright dude, I got my entire future planned out for real!</p>

              <p>For the big loaf of bread, which most of us cannot consume in one seating.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buy the load, have cellapane or ziplock bag available, break the loaf up, like maybe 4 slices of bread into idividual ziplock bag.  freeze them in the freezer.  When you need to eat bread, take it out of the freezer, put into a microwave and there you have at least 4 slices of bread to make toast, sandwicch or pack for school.</p>

              <p>Invest in a few pairs of decent sports walking shoes and walk!  After class, goiing home.  Singapore is not that big that you cannot walk from any mrt station.</p>
