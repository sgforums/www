Yuckssss!!!!!<br><br>As for the chewing gums issue you are the one who is lacking brains and the inability to see deeper into issues. Did you understand the reason behind the government's action in disallowing shops to sell chewing gums ? They did not want places to be strewn around with gums.  And I believe your kindself is at least knowledgeable enough to know that if the shops do not sell chewing gums, the gums become inaccessible to public and the habit more or less disappears.  You don't have chewing gums appearing from thin air suddenly.  Do you ? What are the shops for then? Actually it is a smart way of doing things. Isn't it indirectly prohibiting chewing gums?  Try walking thru the Woodlands customs with a big packet of gums.  If they are not prohibiting chewing gums, then why do they sometimes confiscate it? I hope your brains can decipher this...</div></blockquote>I support people for who they are and want to be. That's all. If you discriminate against people for such actions which you condone, that would be unfair and unjust.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by malarica:</div><div class="quote_body">it is a offence if we are cought having chewing gum???  it is said that eating chewing gum dirty our country..but how about this type of people..prostitutes??<br>THINK SINGAPORE!!</div></blockquote>As for the chewing gum, you said its an offence to chew. I am telling you its not! Get that right first! Shops do sell chewing gum, the shops you will find them in are pharmacies, they only sell 1 specific brand and a few types of flavors.<br><br>Second, if you think that the sex brothels(housing prostitutes) in Geylang are also illegal, you're a brainless idiot who does'nt know Singapore's Statutes at all.<br><br>So, next time you think of something, think twice because you might be shooting yourself in the foot. And in this case, eating your own words!<br><br></div>
