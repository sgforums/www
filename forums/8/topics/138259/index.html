            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, so I was at Plaza Singapura hanging out with R after going to ECP. We were at Carrefour's toy section, banging on the keyboards, when I heard a BOM sound. It's just like Times Square in Malaysia when the roller coaster goes over. loud but not noticeable. So we continued banging on the keyboard, when there was an announcement saying that "the security personnel are investigating the cause of the fire alarm..." WHAT fire alarm? I didn't hear anything?<br><br>You know how when you're in school/outside and the fire alarm goes off and it's ALWAYS nothing? Yeah, so we were like bo chap lorh! then after awhile... "the management has everything under control. there is no cause for alarm..." so like okay.... *fiddle with keyboard* oh. we better go home. *walks to tennis raquet section*... where i smelt a BURNING smell... R, do you smell anything? "Oh, that's just the new rubber smell." "Orh. okay." announcement... "there has been an inccident. everyone please evacuate the building immediately."<br><br>SIAM ARH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>okay larh, so we were strolling. =P But this mother and her kids were RUNNING OUT OF CARREFOUR. her kids were SCRAMBLING over the barriers, and shouting to hurry up or they'll be trapped. we were liek o_O panic so much for what? so we went up the travellator which had stopped and we saw people still eating yoshinoya (lol. wah. that good arh?) and security people asking them to evacuate. Shopkeepers were RUNNING and LEAPING down the travellator to close shop (must be jia zua larh!)...<br><br>so we went up the next travellator which was open and.... OMG YOU CANT SEE A THING?! SMOKE SMOKE SMOKE THE WHOLE BUILDING WAS CHOKED WITH SMOKE and we were choking too. and the security guard at the end was saying "RUN RUN!" so RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! right through the smoke!<br><br>then we waited outside where SIX fire engines came, and all teh cars from the nearby multi-storey carpark were being evacuated.there was extremely smelly (toxic?) fumes coming out of the stairwell... heard a guy commenting it's burning rubber. but smelt more chemically-ish? people were whipping out their camera phones to take photos and call. including me. the scdf personnel and policemen were helping with crowd control... telling us not to stand too close. the firemen were taking out their equipment... using big fans... i think to blow out the smoke. we went to the front and the whole place was swarming with people.<br><br>so after waiting around for quite a bit, we went back in... we were allowed to go everywhere except the carrefour/marks and spencer part of the building which was barricaded with police tape. so... i think the inccident came from marks and spencer? i think it was a small fire though....<br><br>what worries me is that we were not able to hear the fire alarm,and when we went back into the basement, we could not hear the announcements being broadcasted. what if the fire is biggeR? and since ps is connected to dhoby ghaut mrt... in the event of a really big fire, will the fire be able to spread?</div>

From what the thread starter describes, the whole evacuation doesn't seem too orderly.
