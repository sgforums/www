            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has unveiled his new Cabinet line-up, which will be sworn into office on May 30.<br><br>Among the major changes: at least five new MPs are being catapulted to be office bearers; younger Ministers are being given new or additional portfolios; and three senior Ministers are stepping down.<br><br>The line-up builds upon the team that has already been assembled, says Mr Lee.<br><br>"It's the strongest team I can find. I had in mind to build a Cabinet when I went out to look for candidates to field to become MPs and am happy that nearly all of them (were) shepherded through safely and elected. And from this group of MPs I have selected the strongest and most representative team for the Cabinet," said Mr Lee.<br><br>In choosing his team, Mr Lee said he looked for ability and experience, especially in the private sector.<br><br>He also looked for those who were committed and who would work hard as a team.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Raymond Lim takes over as Transport Minister of Transport, while Yeo Cheow Tong retires from Cabinet. </span></strong><br><br>Tharman Shanmugaratnam takes over Mr Lim's Second Minister for Finance post, while continuing as Education Minister.<br><br>Meanwhile, Vivian Balakrishnan will be appointed Second Minister for Information, Communication and the Arts, or MICA.<br><br>He will continue as Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports.<br><br>In a departure from previous Cabinet line-ups, Mr Lee has appointed more office-holders this time.<br><br>He says this is to let them focus on specific responsibilities.<br><br>Said Mr Lee, "In the past, we used to appoint people to more than one appointment at a time, so you would have Education and Defence, Finance and Transport, or some combination like that. It was to stretch our people and make a virtue out of necessity. But this time, I'm trying out more people, have put in more Ministers of State and Parl Secs. It's an opportunity to test people out, to expose them, to see who will grow, and to make as many of them succeed as possible. Not all will necessarily stay -- some will go back to be backbenchers; some will go back to the private sector."<br><br>Two other Ministers will also be moving out eventually.<br><br>MICA Minister Lee Boon Yang told the Prime Minister before the General Election that he was ready to step down.<br><br>But he had been asked to stay on for at least half a term to help groom a successor.<br><br>Lim Boon Heng will also be stepping down after he hands over his NTUC portfolio to Lim Swee Say at year's end, while Minister of State for Education and Trade and Industry Chan Soo Sen will be leaving for the private sector.<br><br>Mr Lee said, "I would like to place here on record my thanks and the thanks of the government to all who are stepping down, because they all made significant contributions."<br><br>Looking ahead, Mr Lee said his Cabinet reinforcements are in the priority areas: education, cost of living, health care, the lower income group, and older Singaporeans.<br><br>The next Parliamentary sitting is expected in November. - CNA /ct<br><br>Cabinet and Other Office Holders - Complete List<br></div>
