            <div class='col-md body'>In PM Goh's National Day speech, he said Singapore's per capita income is $40,000.  Sure on Not?  That means every Singaporean earns $40,000 a year!  Which works out to $3,300 a month.  Where got?  Or issit that the minister's high pay more than makes up for the lowly pay of the masses?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When PM Goh said that the per capita income was $40K, what is meant is that the average income of a Singaporean is $40,000.  It does not necessarily mean that all Singaporeans earn $40K.  If you looked at it objectively, it is quite possible since for every employee in Singapore, there is a mandatory CPF contribution made by the company of 12% which even though you do no see, is calculated into the per capita earning field.  Also, it includes bonusus which are paid out at the end of every year (13th month bonus).<br><br>Management level staff are usually paid between $6K-10K per month (depending on type of management position held).  Even executives are paid in excess of $2K so calculating out the average is not that difficult.  If for example my gross income is $5K, the company contributes a further $600 (CPF) which makes my gross income $5600 per month.<br><br>If I earn $2.5K per month, my actual pay is $2.8K (with Co. CPF contribution) and to top it up, I would get the mandatory AWS (Annual Wage Supplement) of 1 month's pay which will then amount to $36,400 in which case, I might get further performance bonuses which will eventually hit the average per capita income of $40,000.  In Singapore, we do earn a decent living but because there is the forced savings in the CPF, we do not see much of it until you retire or when you decide to buy a house etc.<br><br>------------------<br>Need a brain?<br><br>Go get one from Cold Storage...they're better than the one you've got right now<br><br>[This message has been edited by GoonDu (edited 13 August 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Goondu, per capita income of a country means the annual income of a citizen of that country.

Almost 70% and that is one of the reasons why the Singapore Govt. is worried about having too many old people when the baby boomers (born in the years 1966-1969) grow old and therefore will not have enough young to support.<br><br>How many Singaporeans live in private housing and Condominiums? - 25%...now 25% of these people have to be earning roughly more than $10,000 per month in order to support their houses and not forgetting to mention their cars.  If you take these 25% and put it into the general population of working people, the income per working capita will go up dramatically.<br><br>How many cars are there in Singapore? For a person just to own a car in Singapore, he will have to earn more than $2000 per month. (Unless he intends to starve to death in order to support his car). How many new cars do you see on the road? An average of 10,000 new cars are registered in Singapore over 4 months (1 alphabet jump in roughly 4 months) and you still cannot believe that the income per capita is $40,000?<br><br>Hmm...besides, if he is wrong, someone would have obviously pointed it out to him that the department of statistics has made a huge booboo...particularly from the opposition party.</div>
