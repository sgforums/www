Do you all want a free forum after all? A lesson is learnt here, the froum despite it's declaration on the freedom of speech, is not the free. Respect as in all democratic society is required for this society to survive. It is not a "I can say what I like" place. You can say what ever you like about a topic of discussion, butyou do not gossip, or defame people here, a forum is for discussion s it is not for personal vendetta. It is after all a public place where are you dirty laundry will be hanged out to dry.<br><br>Do you not notice the similiar scenario but with a diffrent respone from the same people? Those who use to declare the freedom of speech as supreme now asks for privacy and discreetion to be employed. Why? simply because it is someone that they know? How contradictary this is. As the saying goes, <strong>Do notdo onto others, what you do not want others to do onto you.</strong> The above example shows clearly how we as an individual alway fails to see what is right and wrong in a spur of emotions but rather we see what is advantageous to us during that spur of emotions. Do we not stop to think what should be done rather than what we want to do?<br><br>When you do not feel the pain of your enemy do not shout your warcry. It is like a savage's laughter. But if you understand their pain, you would not shout for victory, but you will only proclaim your pain.<br><br>If you find me extreme in my demostration, I apologise, but I still firmly believe that in order to educate the rest, sometimes you have to make an example of one. The cut must be the deepest for you and for them. Or they will not feel the pain and see the truth.<br><br>But I do encourage free discussion, on topics that will be most helpful to our lifes. I try not to get personal and that is important to maintain an open channel for discussion. Gossips and vengence can only be a total hinderence to the growth of a forum. It does not help propergate the image of what a forum should be, but kill it slowly by annoucing to the world of it's lack of it.<br><br>So how free do you want the forum to be? Stop to think and you might not want so much freedom after all.</div>

Therefore you dun buy chocolates.This suits your statement about being considerate for others before doing something.As for the quote in question,if I want to scold someone severely for a minor mistake,i will reflect whether will i want this to happen to me if i make a minor mistake.My answer will be no,so i will refrain from giving that guy a severe scolding as I strongly believe that if you wish to dish something out,you better make sure you can take it from someone else or it will seem to be pretty absurd that you can do things to others,but not have others do things to you,eheh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>If I knew it would be the last time that I'd see you on my plate,<br>I would eat you up and pray the Lord, i put on some weight<br>If I knew it would be the last time that I see you drop onto the floor,<br>I would call the waiter over and ask for 1 more.<br>If I knew it would be the last meal before i go to sleep,<br>I would sleep soundly knowing you are in my stomach deep.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Waiting for Diablo 2 Add-on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
