            <div class='col-md body'>My friend ask me to take a look at this forum, said it will be of an interest to me. Yes, it is. The bible has many flaws, so are other religious text like buddhism, hinduism and others. Nobody really know Buddha or Jesus, nobody really can tell what their minds is thinking and what they really see during that time, or what events has happened to them. For example, Jesus, the Bible clearly omited out his childhood, what happened to him? How did he survived? What really happened to him that time? Did he have a special event that change his life? What happen to Buddha during his training? Could he have meet up a alien? All this, nobody knows.<br><br>To jesus, maybe he has found a way to escape time and death, that is why he can said he is God. Same for Buddha, he can say enlightened and maybe he has found a way to escape time and death too. Remember, people are more naive at that time, to whatever things they do not understand, they will accept it as what the person is saying. If for example, right now you see an alien and he perform many many wonders, will you believe him?<br><br>Maybe Jesus have seen and been taught by an higher being and been instructed to do all this tasks, maybe Buddha too. Who really knows the minds of another person. The Buddhist scripture and Bible didn't write down the thoughts and feelings of Jesus or Buddha himself. It is writen by another party, another person, it is like narrating a story. The bible is a collection of texts by another person seeing Jesus, same for the Buddhist texts. The Bible did not write: I said to the crowds, I am Jesus and they wow! the Buddhist scripture did not write: I told them that I have enlightened and they wow!<br><br>Will it be Buddha and Jesus are both time travellers, or have found, meet something which make them a level higher than human race, just like we are higher than the apes. In a lot of myths, there are humans who become so called immortal. Could it be they have find the way to become a higher level, to go to heaven, another place for their new life.<br><br>In order to prove something, there must be solid proof and verification. In this case of Jesus and Buddha or other religions, there is not enough proof to prove the theory they provide. Remember, faith itself cannot be use to justify the law of science and nature, reasoning and testing and verification is very important. You can't just build a rocket and said god and buddha said it will fly to the moon. Maybe if really God and Buddha is here, they can say it, but not us.<br><br>I believe something must be out there, be it you called it God, Buddha, Aliens whatever. In times, when we humans can break free of our own minds and stop restricting our mind to only what we know, we can slowly, but surely break the answer to the origins of life.<br><br>------------------<br>In questions of science, the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual.</div>

I know the goal of buddhism is saving all people and gaining enlightenment. What I am trying to said here is that nobody will know the future or the past, since we are not there. Nobody can also understand what Buddha mean when he said enlightenment unless the person experience it. In order to know something, we must experience it. What is enlightenment? Nobody can really tell. What did buddha go? What is he doing now? When Buddha said he enlighten, what is he really meaning, nobody will unless he himself become buddha. maybe buddha now is in another universe, or another dimension. Just like taoist, when they died, some of them become immortal, where do they go?
