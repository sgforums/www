They might scold you lah, but it's nothing one. Tomolo they will forget about it liao. I think your parents rather scold you and push the school to take actions than risk of losing you, their children. Besides, When you have problems, shouldn't you talk to your parents first?<br><br>First of all, it's out of responsiblity. They give birth to you and feed you for so long liao. Shouldn't you at least tell them what's going on?<br><br>Next, it's about your safety. When confronted with this type of situations, you dun have the experience on how to deal with it. So shouldn't you get some experience from your parents?</div>

Recently there was a DotA match between my ex class and another ex Sec 2 class. There are no prizes for the winner, it's just for the pleasure and fame. Our class won and they were not happy, they started spouting nonsense and said "my face very kiam pah (have a temptation to hit my face)" and I am very "kao peh (irritating in a more vulgar way). Ok I admit I did laugh at them when we won...<br><br>Obviously my classmates and I were not very happy. I went to his class to find him. He is now in a NA class. Got a lot of pai kia friends I presume. I said something along this line "Eh Jack(Coded for confidential purposes), why you scold me? Can come out explain anot?". Suddenly out of nowhere, his "pai kia" friend started spouting nonsense like "Eh boy who you think you are? You know who I am anot? You think you big gangster arh? KNNBCCB **^#$%@##$%@#$" Then I gave a firm reply which is like "I not talking to you, I talking to Jack." Then he goes "KNN $#%!#$$#@%!#@" and he spits on me.<br><br>I was ****ing unhappy and was about to spit back until a teacher pulls me away and wanted all of us to write a reflection and hand it up to her. After some crap talking with her, he forced all of us to apologize, the pai kia apologized in a very sacarstic way and went away. I knew this would not end like this..<br><br>After school, I was on my way to the basketball court to watch my friends play bball. Then another distant friend of mine came to me and said "Oi, they camping for you outside the General office.. Say what want to beat u up." I said "Dun care la.. I go bball court." then his reply was "Oh I told them you were going there too.." I heed his words no more and I went to the bball court. I was confronted by many friends and started giving me crap ways to solve this problem. A few others also confirmed the fact they were outside the GO waiting for me. After like around 20-30 mins, I decided to go home. My friends accompanied me. We went to the GO and no one was there. Heard rumours they went home already and will take me on later.<br><br>Now what?? He is a pretty famous Pai Kia in our school. He seen the DM more then I see my grandma. Some say he is a pretty good fighter, took down a sec 4 or 5 guy from other classes. Almost ear off someone's ear, need go to hospital for some stitches. Any solutions to this matter? </div></blockquote>First of all ,why did you even bother to confront him? You were asking for a fight. Just leave the namecallers alone next time.<br><br>Just watch your back now in case someone decides to be stupid. Be careful when you enter boy's toilet also. I remember matters got settled in girls or guy toilets in secondary school.<br><br>Talk to your parents as well. And do not be afraid to ask for help from your teachers.<br><br>Not sure if Eu Tong Sen police station still houses the SS aka Secret Society branch but you are more than welcome to let the police know what is going on if that pai kia disturbs you.<br><br>The guys at SS branch are bigger pai kia - tattooes all over. All gangster chief like. I met them for my research project 9 years back ....wah lau ...they macham also talk the talk and walk the walk. Not sure if the eagle is still there. That guy is damn rough but he might talk down your good friends waiting outside the school for you.</div>
