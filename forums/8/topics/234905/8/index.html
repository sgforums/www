Recently there was a DotA match between my ex class and another ex Sec 2 class. There are no prizes for the winner, it's just for the pleasure and fame. Our class won and they were not happy, they started spouting nonsense and said "my face very kiam pah (have a temptation to hit my face)" and I am very "kao peh (irritating in a more vulgar way). Ok I admit I did laugh at them when we won...<br><br>Obviously my classmates and I were not very happy. I went to his class to find him. He is now in a NA class. Got a lot of pai kia friends I presume. I said something along this line "Eh Jack(Coded for confidential purposes), why you scold me? Can come out explain anot?". Suddenly out of nowhere, his "pai kia" friend started spouting nonsense like "Eh boy who you think you are? You know who I am anot? You think you big gangster arh? KNNBCCB **^#$%@##$%@#$" Then I gave a firm reply which is like "I not talking to you, I talking to Jack." Then he goes "KNN $#%!#$$#@%!#@" and he spits on me.<br><br>I was ****ing unhappy and was about to spit back until a teacher pulls me away and wanted all of us to write a reflection and hand it up to her. After some crap talking with her, he forced all of us to apologize, the pai kia apologized in a very sacarstic way and went away. I knew this would not end like this..<br><br>After school, I was on my way to the basketball court to watch my friends play bball. Then another distant friend of mine came to me and said "Oi, they camping for you outside the General office.. Say what want to beat u up." I said "Dun care la.. I go bball court." then his reply was "Oh I told them you were going there too.." I heed his words no more and I went to the bball court. I was confronted by many friends and started giving me crap ways to solve this problem. A few others also confirmed the fact they were outside the GO waiting for me. After like around 20-30 mins, I decided to go home. My friends accompanied me. We went to the GO and no one was there. Heard rumours they went home already and will take me on later.<br><br>Now what?? He is a pretty famous Pai Kia in our school. He seen the DM more then I see my grandma. Some say he is a pretty good fighter, took down a sec 4 or 5 guy from other classes. Almost ear off someone's ear, need go to hospital for some stitches. Any solutions to this matter? </div></blockquote>lol..<br>these little punks..<br><br>it's silly reading while i am thinking back of my secondary sch days..lol<br><br>those so call 'ah bengs' that you call them, are just trying to act cool only.<br><br>you try asking or befriending some people who have black belts in karate or taykuado (whatever the spelling is - i bad when it comes to this spelling.)<br><br>see if they can touch you if you know those people.<br><br>those 'ah bengs' see DM only..<br>i last time see Prinicipal, Vice Principal, DM, and even other teachers' private meetings wor..lol..<br><br>not fighting la, but over some sudden violent behaviours only. lol..<br>my teachers and the school HODs even had a meeting just on my case..hehe..<br><br>grow up lor, don't be easily offended, hold you're cool, no point fighting with pigs.. of course, taking into consideration that you're in your puberty, which is the ego thingy stuffs of every guy comes out, it's natural to reply, but be a gentleman, not a ganster.<br><br>You and other people can be ganster in school, to have a lot of people fearing you all, but once you leave your protection - school, you are stepping into adults' world, everything goes, you would not even know when you kanna wack either physically or verbally infront/behind your back.<br><br>just beware.<br><br>don't be a fool to fall into their traps, they bad behaviour nvm, just let them be, but play along with them since you don't really have a bad record, i'm sure you will not want to have a BAD testimonial when you leave and graduate from secondary sch right?</div>

There is a guy who used to give gang talks to secondary school students - his code is either the eagle or hawk or something. But I am sure they will direct you to him or someone else if  you really feel threatened by this pai kia. Those SS branch deal with hardcore gangsters - your pai kia in school will look like a gentleman compared to the undercover cops.<br><br>Act guai guai when you talk to them because THEY HATE AH BENG wannabes.<br></div>
