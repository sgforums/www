            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, this problem is more or less I start one.. but please help me k?<br><br>I am in Sec 3. Recently there was a DotA match between my ex class and another ex Sec 2 class. There are no prizes for the winner, it's just for the pleasure and fame. Our class won and they were not happy, they started spouting nonsense and said "my face very kiam pah (have a temptation to hit my face)" and I am very "kao peh (irritating in a more vulgar way). Ok I admit I did laugh at them when we won...<br><br>Obviously my classmates and I were not very happy. I went to his class to find him. He is now in a NA class. Got a lot of pai kia friends I presume. I said something along this line "Eh Jack(Coded for confidential purposes), why you scold me? Can come out explain anot?". Suddenly out of nowhere, his "pai kia" friend started spouting nonsense like "Eh boy who you think you are? You know who I am anot? You think you big gangster arh? KNNBCCB **^#$%@##$%@#$" Then I gave a firm reply which is like "I not talking to you, I talking to Jack." Then he goes "KNN $#%!#$$#@%!#@" and he spits on me.<br><br>I was ****ing unhappy and was about to spit back until a teacher pulls me away and wanted all of us to write a reflection and hand it up to her. After some crap talking with her, he forced all of us to apologize, the pai kia apologized in a very sacarstic way and went away. I knew this would not end like this..<br><br>After school, I was on my way to the basketball court to watch my friends play bball. Then another distant friend of mine came to me and said "Oi, they camping for you outside the General office.. Say what want to beat u up." I said "Dun care la.. I go bball court." then his reply was "Oh I told them you were going there too.." I heed his words no more and I went to the bball court. I was confronted by many friends and started giving me crap ways to solve this problem. A few others also confirmed the fact they were outside the GO waiting for me. After like around 20-30 mins, I decided to go home. My friends accompanied me. We went to the GO and no one was there. Heard rumours they went home already and will take me on later.<br><br>Now what?? He is a pretty famous Pai Kia in our school. He seen the DM more then I see my grandma. Some say he is a pretty good fighter, took down a sec 4 or 5 guy from other classes. Almost ear off someone's ear, need go to hospital for some stitches. Any solutions to this matter?</div>
