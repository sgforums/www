            <div class='col-md body'>Since you are good in Dota, I have a great suggestion. First, go buy a <span style="font-style: italic;">parang</span>, 4 <span style="font-style: italic;">smoke bombs</span> - get it from Thailand or illegal shops, and a whole <span style="font-style: italic;">black ninja suit</span>. Now, when they come in numbers, change yourself into Rikimaru - wear the ninja suit inside, you can straight tear off your uniform. Remember to bring along Glucolin or some glucose water to replenish your mana. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Now you're in the situation 5v1, I'm pretty sure you know this is called <span style="font-style: italic;">gangbang</span>. They surround you, use your smoke bomb to activate your skill <strong>Smokescreen</strong>. At Level 4 - throw 4 bombs at the same time, 80% of their attacks will miss. Now ASAP use your <strong>Blind Strike</strong> at one of them. Use your parang attack them from behind, remember must from <strong>BEHIND</strong> because that's the only way you can apply your <strong>Backstab</strong> skill. Im sure you gonna deal a lot of damage because you are high at <strong>Agility</strong> since you're playing basketball. Kill one of them, then another one to get your <strong>Double Kill</strong>, and settle the rest to get your <strong>Triple Kill</strong>. Remember, make use of your <strong>Permanent Invisibility</strong> by hiding near some shades at your school, eg. under the trees (they can's see you well since you wearing a black suit, remember dont attack or else you gonna be visible back) in case all the above doesnt work or failed. Attack when the timing is right, this is what a true ninja is. If you failed badly, run back to your base/health pool which is the Police Station to save your life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Okok, time to get serious, I think you should tell your parents about this matter. Your parents will know what to do. Dont be so foolish and go settle your own by fighting etc. Eventhough you get to 1 on 1, if he lose, I believe all of them will beat u as well. Usually, they are not steady especially they outnumber us. It happens to me before as well last time. I alone facing 6 ppls, 1 on 1 with the head, beat him down like pussy and his partners start to attack me as well. I truly beat all of them and I go report to the police with my parents. My father is a lawyer, so the case is much easier. The police warned the gang not to disturb me again since they already ''1 on 1'' with me. If anything happens to me, they will go directly to jail. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I advice you seeks your parents advice rather than settle all by your own, dont worry, your parents love you, they wont let you got hurt.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Recently there was a DotA match between my ex class and another ex Sec 2 class. There are no prizes for the winner, it's just for the pleasure and fame. Our class won and they were not happy, they started spouting nonsense and said "my face very kiam pah (have a temptation to hit my face)" and I am very "kao peh (irritating in a more vulgar way). Ok I admit I did laugh at them when we won...<br><br>Obviously my classmates and I were not very happy. I went to his class to find him. He is now in a NA class. Got a lot of pai kia friends I presume. I said something along this line "Eh Jack(Coded for confidential purposes), why you scold me? Can come out explain anot?". Suddenly out of nowhere, his "pai kia" friend started spouting nonsense like "Eh boy who you think you are? You know who I am anot? You think you big gangster arh? KNNBCCB **^#$%@##$%@#$" Then I gave a firm reply which is like "I not talking to you, I talking to Jack." Then he goes "KNN $#%!#$$#@%!#@" and he spits on me.<br><br>I was ****ing unhappy and was about to spit back until a teacher pulls me away and wanted all of us to write a reflection and hand it up to her. After some crap talking with her, he forced all of us to apologize, the pai kia apologized in a very sacarstic way and went away. I knew this would not end like this..<br><br>After school, I was on my way to the basketball court to watch my friends play bball. Then another distant friend of mine came to me and said "Oi, they camping for you outside the General office.. Say what want to beat u up." I said "Dun care la.. I go bball court." then his reply was "Oh I told them you were going there too.." I heed his words no more and I went to the bball court. I was confronted by many friends and started giving me crap ways to solve this problem. A few others also confirmed the fact they were outside the GO waiting for me. After like around 20-30 mins, I decided to go home. My friends accompanied me. We went to the GO and no one was there. Heard rumours they went home already and will take me on later.<br><br>Now what?? He is a pretty famous Pai Kia in our school. He seen the DM more then I see my grandma. Some say he is a pretty good fighter, took down a sec 4 or 5 guy from other classes. Almost ear off someone's ear, need go to hospital for some stitches. Any solutions to this matter? </div></blockquote>come come. i lazy to read so many replies so i'll get straight to the point.. points.<br><br>1. talk to your DM, tell him everything. he will at least take note and watch out for any suspicious activities nearby.<br><br>2. tell your parents, and try to convince them to make a police report with you. if you try and do it yourself, chances are, the police won't take your words for it.<br><br>3. walk with a couple friends when you go back home.<br><br>4. see if your phone has emergency numbers shortcut keys, or save 999 in the first slot in ur contacts.. so you can call the cops as fast as possible.<br><br>i think after a couple weeks, they would be bored and can't be bothered with you any longer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from the looks of it. since you provoked Jack, who happens to be his friend, its only reasonable that you get back some kind of punishment be it from who.<br><br>seems like you're set on getting hit and humiliated and got your friends to standby to take photos. i suggest try to ask your friends to get some passer-by to help if there's any. just in case the whole situation goes out of hand and your friends can't do anything about it.<br><br>but if it so happens that you suddenly feel like fighting back, just take a rock (of reasonable size) zham one hard time on his head. of course don't smash it in his face tt disfigures him or smth. just hit it on the back of his head. and call for ambulance. and if reported to police its simply an act of self-defence since you have your 'camera crew' set-up as evidence.<br><br>i guess if you tomorrow just let him whack one good time once and for all doubt he will find you trouble in the future. think this kind of pai kia is too free have to find people like you to bully in school. the most in the future he might just give you a hard bang each time you see him. but i guess after tomorrow you will still be traumatised by this incident. till then, keep us updated.<br><br>and good luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
