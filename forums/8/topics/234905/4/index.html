Make sure ur fren take pics from far!! if not ur fren also kena beaten up and proof get destroyed. Not retaliating does not mean u a hum ji, I am sure if u can land the beng into deep shit with the police, the rest of his fren will be hum of u. Show them that u are a knowledgeable person who can deal wif crooks effectively. Stay firm no matter what. Not to use violence on others and never allow others to use violence on u.

I use to kena this sheat b4 when I was in sec 3. This sec 5 normal guy try to be funny wif mi and kept picking on mi. I pay a gal $5 bucks to get his home no(mi time HP very uncommon). This stupid hum sup gave her the no. and I ask mi parent call his parent that night... After that I totally ignore him at sch...although he seems like want to beat mi up, the size of his ball did not give him enuf couraqe....He went ard telling ppl I hum ji dare not fight him but isnt he more hum ji because he dare not even lay a finger on mi? After this incident , I just concentrate on mi studies instead of wasting mi time on scum like him.</div>
