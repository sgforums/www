            <div class='col-md body'>Siao ah, avoid a fight at all costs.<br><br>Why get yourself into such a situtation over some talk? There are better things to fight for.<br><br>Apologize to the moron and don't fight him, when you all grow up all this things will look stupid to you and anyway he's setting himself up for ruin in the future so why follow him? Also be more careful next time and don't offend people... and offend them liao don't give them more reason to find fault with you (like going to confront them on why they not happy with you). Learn to be polite. Lose face better then losing life.<br><br>Also running works a lot better most of the time... if you really want to learn self-defence, learning how to break chokeholds, bear hugs, armlocks and all those things are a lot more useful then simple punching and kicking. This is not a MMA contest, this is life and death. Don't pick fights, walk into them to "settle things", and what have you not if you can... that's the first rule of self defence.<br><br>Also be aware of where you are at all times, think about all the possible ambush spots and escape routes, and make sure you have a plan on how to do, what to do at all times...<br><br>Also know your threat, find out about the person who is after you if you can... what kind of person is he? What are his strengths and weaknesses? What is he afraid of? What does he like/hate? What is his routine? How does he relate to others?<br><br>Also carrying a knife around here is a bad idea... at worst you fail to use it properly and it is turned against you... at best you hurt him and welcome to jail. It's a lose lose thing.<br><br>Use your brain on what you can use that will give you an advantage if the stuff really hits the fan, is easy to use, but cannot be turned against you easily... and also does not hurt the person much but will slow him enough to make him ineffective long enough for you to get away.<br><br>Look around your kitchen, I'm sure you'll find more useful stuff for self defence rather then a knife.<br><br>Hint enuff liao.<br><br>Stay safe.<br></div>
