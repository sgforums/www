            <div class='col-md body'>Stop guessing.. gambling lead to his death..<br><br>SINGAPORE : A compassionate family man who loved helping the elderly, but a man who had a weakness for gambling - this was the picture painted by pastors of 40-year-old Simon Lee, who jumped to his death from a flat at Tampines.<br><br>The church also revealed that he had gone to a casino at Genting Highlands with his family last December, where he chalked up a "substantial" gambling debt.<br><br>Relatives of Simon Lee, his wife Jeslyn Wee, and their children Jonathan, 11, and Sheena, 4, lost not one but four loved ones overnight.<br><br>It was one heartbreaking scene after another as they took turns to identify the bodies at the mortuary on Tuesday morning.<br><br>Simon Lee, who worked as a complaints investigation officer with Comfort Delgro, was found dead at the foot of Tampines block 470 on Monday.<br><br>Hours later, police found his wife and their two children dead in the flat.<br><br>Teachers and classmates of Jonathan Lee were shocked to hear the news.<br><br>His classmate Loh Jianghan said, "He's a very loyal friend and he's very cheerful. He's always positive and never thinks negatively. Most of all he's very hardworking and willing to learn to improve."<br><br>Godwin Tan, Johnathan's best friend, said, "The last time I spoke to Jonathan was last Friday. I asked him why he was so upset but he ignored my question and just left. Many, many cried over the loss of such a good friend."<br><br>It is a difficult time especially for the Primary 6A class of Yumin Primary, who are still trying to come to terms with the sudden death.<br><br>Jonathan, who turned 11 on 29 December, was described as a well-loved person and an outstanding student who was in the top 15 percent of his cohort.<br><br>But the question on their minds was why did such a thing happen?<br><br>Pastors at Faith Community Baptist Church gave some clues when they shared with the media that Simon first came to church 10 years ago with a gambling debt of S$100,000 and a failing marriage<br><br>But with counselling, he cleared his debt in three years and saved his marriage.<br><br>He became an active church member who always helped the elderly.<br><br>Said Reverend Lawrence Khong, senior pastor at Faith Community Baptist Church, "We thought everything is fine until just end of January. We discovered that he went on a vacation with his family to Genting resort and quietly one night, to gamble and he lost what to him was a substantial amount of money that he could not pay up.<br><br>"As a result of that he got into a loan with loansharks, and when he spoke to us in January, he told us that he owes about S$10,000. And we came up with the money to help him, so that at least he could get over this loanshark thing so that we can counsel him."<br><br>But they never got a chance.<br><br>The family was last seen by other church members on Sunday at a wedding. - CNA<br><br></div>
