            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by wuming78:<br><strong><br><br>i like ur explanation.<br><br>but smith was created by the machines. if hes purpose is to destroy neo (beyond which hes useless and will be exterminated) den wouldnt the machines know it? den in tt case, they wont even need to strike a deal with neo - they can be rest assured smith will hunt neo down and try to kill him as best he can. after tt, the machines are assured of the auto-destruction of smith. </strong><br><br>Nope, I think probably the machines might not be aware of it themselves... The Matrix though built by the machines... Are probably 'governed' by a main programme... The Architect.<br><br>Take for example? Even if a computer has been used for several generations... Only the 1st person needs to have the 'know how' of setting up the PC... Only the 1st person would need to know the configuration of the PC... The follow up users of the PC need not... The Matrix has become sort of like an 'automated system' to them.... Feeding them... Just like our digestive system but probably much more COMPLICATED.... Since it's such a vital part of their survival, I reckon they would not wanna 'alter' it in anyway... Which. If results are undesirable, might cost their own survival... Just like a person without much computer 'know how' but only to use it for minimal usage would not be foolish enough to meddle with its configuratoin unless they're ready to face the consequences?<br><br>Another point to note.... I believe Agent Smith is 'undercover' as an AGENT (without himself realising it...) Just like Neo as an 'undercover' in human...<br><br><strong><br>another thing is in reloaded, smith explained tt when he got killed by neo in matrix 1, he failed in his purpose and became no longer under machines control. but he continued hunting down neo cos "they wan the same thing". well. it wasnt clear to me wat it was and stil is not tt clear. but im quite sure its not cos he was made for tt purpose.</strong><br><br>Like I've mentioned earlier, Agent Smith is probably working like under a hidden code. I believe his true 'purpose' was only triggered when he came into contact with Neo. The other agents just do their job. Each serving their OWN purpose.<br><br><strong><br>as for how smith died in the end, some say neo killed him and the machines killed neo. tt i disagree. canot explain y though. but i tot it's linked to the oracle somehow - cos towards the end, smith uttered "everything tt has a beginning has an end" - something oracle said. and he became vastly scared at tt point cos he himself din say tt. but i stil cant figure out if he actualli "killed" neo or not. </strong><br><br>From what I've figured out. He said that line simply because he's about to end Neo. The reason why he was so shocked when he said that was because it's all too familar. Recall he mentioned that he remember "I was standing here... No, over here..." He was becoming a little confused then. He's just part of a programme 'The One'. REPEATING what he had done previously... He was a little uneasy because he can remember only PART of the event... He don't know what to expect next. Otherwise he probably might not (?) have done it... But STILL, he's just a programme...?<br><br><strong><br>and at the end of it all, oracle was still around. she mentioned b4 her purpose was to create imbalance of the equation for peace. i suspect in so doing, she has been using neo all the way - right to the end - to achieve her goals.</strong><br><br>Yes. Everything was rebooted. Oracle probably was brought back then? And she mentioned to the Architect about the 'releasing' of some characters from the Matrix.... Which probably are characters like Smith &amp; Neo (The One), Key-maker and her bodyguard etc... Characters which are CRUCIAL to the 'creation' &amp; assistance of THE ONE....<br><br></blockquote></div>

But from my opinion, Smith should be created by the Architect? In fact, all the characters within the Matrix should be created by the Architect... With exception to the Oracle which I'm not too certain...<br><br>From the way I see it, the Oracle is like a programme responsible for the choosing of the characters so as to establish 'The One' at the RIGHT TIME... Timing is IMPORTANT as 'The One' is only purposeful at the time of the Machines' attack on Zion. Hence you should also noticed by now that the Oracle has constantly mentioned to Neo that the time is not ripe for him to know yet....<br><br>The Oracle, being within the Matrix herself is also responsible in guiding the creation of 'The One'....<br><br>The 'deal' between the Oracle &amp; Architect goes on probably because 'The One' helps in rebooting the Matrix &amp; hence for Architect to work on its perfection and maybe even the survival of the Matrix... The Oracle is probably more concerned with the BALANCE between Machine World &amp; Zion? Oh well... Maybe even herself as she lives in the Matrix? ANYWAY... Don't think they care much also yup?
