            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.... This is my point of view....<br><br>Remember when the Oracle 1st told Neo that if he's the 'positive' then Agent Smith is considered the 'negative'? Neo is actually part of a programme... Just like Agent Smith who can actually possess a body and 'smuggle' himself out of the Matrix into the real world, Neo somehow has been 'smuggled' out when Morpheus unplugged him from the Matrix system. The people actually believes that Neo is a human (in my opinion, he's probably not) and some of them actually believes him to be THE ONE. (Which I think they're probably partially right)<br><br>Neo feels and talk like a human. Felt in love with Trinity. This has later becomes unsurprising as he discovered that programmes can also fall in 'love'. His DESTINY as he has finally realise it, is to save Zion (or whatever's left of it). He ACCEPTED it as his FATE and PURPOSE as he's actually a PROGRAMME. Designed to carry out his 'job'. Just as the Oracle has frequently says "We're all here to do what we are meant to do".<br><br>I've only came to realise how Agent Smith is identified as the 'negative' of Neo just before the show is about to end... Before that, the BIG picture... (the way I interpreted it?)<br><br>Matrix is a place which sort of added like an 'interphase' (virtual reality, but also has the ability to affect reality especially when the life of a human is in concern...) between the humans and machines. Majority of the humans are 'asleep' with a relative minority of them plugged in from the REALITY.<br><br>Then comes the reality... ZION and MACHINE CITY.... In the 'war' between humans &amp; machines, the whole system is kept in check by the 'Matrix'. Which actually extends its influence to the REAL WORLD.<br><br>I believe... MATRIX itself is kept in check by 2 characters (programmes)... The Architect... And the Oracle... The Architect being the ORDERLY... Trying to establish the Matrix into perfection. But like he had previously said, humans are flawed... Hence it's just a matter of time that the system would go into Chaos.... Hence, in my opinion. To him, the need to reboot Matrix is so that he can 'rebuild' it... For perfection? The Oracle... Job's much simpler? To bring 'Chaos' in a sense? But also a CRUCIAL character as she aids in the establishment of 'THE ONE'. The 'key' to the REBOOT of Matrix and also the 'saviour' to BOTH the Machine City and Zion. As mentioned before... The BALANCE between the humans &amp; the machines.. If one is to face 'extinction', the other would not survive.... Hmm... Getting lengthy... Let's see if I can simply put this into point forms?<br><br>MATRIX - Ultimately would be a system responsible for the BALANCE between the WAR of the MACHINES &amp; HUMANS. As it is crucial to the survival of the machines as an energy source.<br><br>The Architect - 'Builder' &amp; Orderly of the Matrix.<br><br>Oracle - Responsible for the 'formation' of THE ONE. With her key 'THE ONE' and through the MATRIX SYSTEM, sets a balance between machines &amp; humans in real time.<br><br>THE ONE - With Neo being the 'positive' and Agent Smith the 'negative'.<br><br>Neo - Programme unplugged into the real world, believed to be a human and 'the one'  to ultimately serves ITS PURPOSE as HALF of the KEY.<br><br>Agent Smith - Initially an agent. But when came into contact with Neo, triggered its hidden agenda and PURPOSE. A programme written to DESTROY NEO.<br><br>When the Matrix was taken over by Agent Smith, Machine City would be the NEXT in the line of fire. The ONLY solution was to strike a deal with Neo. For him to destroy Smith. Neo didn't defeat Smith. That was never his purpose. His purpose is to DESTROY Smith. (so that the deal can be made and Zion could be saved) Recall that Agent Smith said he KNEW all that would happen and even remember doing them? Like Neo, he's probably the 7th version of Agent Smith. Why is it that Smith is so HOT on his heels against Neo? That's because that's Smith's PURPOSE. After he has 'done his job'. As initially mentioned, any programme that no longer serves a purpose would be DELETED away. Neo 'died' in the fight, the machines took his body away. He fulfilled his task. In return, Zion was left untouched as promised. With Smith taking over MAJORITY of Matrix and being destroyed. The Matrix rebooted itself.<br><br>Err... Something like that?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">&gt;</div>
